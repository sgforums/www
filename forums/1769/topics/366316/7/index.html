On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, 'Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon.'<br><br>Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby<br>photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.<br>'Good morning, <br>Ma'am', he said, 'I've come to.'<br><br>'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, 'I've been expecting you.'<br><br>'Have you really?' said the photographer.<br>'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?'<br><br>'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped.<br>Please come in and have a seat !.<br><br>After a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?'<br><br>'Leave everything to me.

You can really spread out there.'<br><br>'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't<br>work out for Harry and me!'<br><br>'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one<br>every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'<br><br><br>'My, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Smith.<br><br>'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and Out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'<br><br>'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly.<br><br>The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a<br>portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said.<br><br>'Oh, my God!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her<br>throat.<br><br>'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when<br>you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'<br><br>'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith.<br><br>'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look'<br><br>'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.<br><br>'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, too.<br>The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots.<br>Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.'<br><br>Mrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually<br>chewed on your, uh...equipment?'<br><br>'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'<br><br>'Tripod?'<br><br>'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my<br>Canon on. It's much too big to be held in the hand very long.' <br>Mrs. Smith fainted</div></div>
