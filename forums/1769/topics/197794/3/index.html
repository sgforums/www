Especially in the form of accommodation and furnishing. .....<br><br>Personally i think diamonds and precious stones et al are an easy way out for guys. Gems and flowers. Most girls don't complain because if they dont get those, they probably dont get anything liao (maybe electrical/kitchen appliance) so they bobian.<br><br>But if the guy can be creative and give something interesting, valuable that is applicable uniquely to the specific girl that has great meaning, and will display that lots of laborious effort have gone into it to win us over, then u know - the gems and flowers can be done away with.<br><br>Look at those medieval knights!
