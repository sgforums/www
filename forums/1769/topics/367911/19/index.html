              <p>Which is probably why MOE rejected the lowest bids: because they don't offer good value for money, or they simply just don't make financial sense.</p>
              <p>The lowest bid doesn't always win a tendering exercise, and with good reason. The whole point of it is to see which firm can provide the best value at a reasonable price, and the lowest-bidding firm is not always the one that can do that. And MOE probably also didn't want to further depress the salaries of the cleaning aunties.</p>
              <p>I don't have a beef with MOE on this, so long as the firm that won the bidding war provides good services at sensible prices.</p>

              <p>Anyway, how is our country gonna squeeze so many people in? The govt seems VERY eager to accept FTs....already housing them in dorms are causing howls from the people when they get "too close". Not to mention our transportation system is under a fair bit of strain.</p>
