              <p>l think the issue is even simpler than that .....</p>
              <p>I mean ... look ... we know how kiasu and kiasi singaporeans are ... and the SAF is no exception ... what is the one thing that the SAF, or indeed any goverment body, is most afraid of ? .... complaints, bad publicity, right ? ....</p>
              <p>and what are the most sensitive issues in singapore ? ... race and religion, right ? ....</p>
              <p>would any SAF commanders risk dicking around on this issue ? ... would any SAF officer risk his ass and his career just to say no to this kid out of bloody-mindedness, say no just to be petty about it ? ... highly unlikely right ? ....</p>
              <p>further more, this chap has stirred up a lot of shit before liao, apparently, they have appealed to MPs, ministers, Goh Chok Tong, and even to the President ! ...... for the SAF to still play hardball, to charge the fellow ... they must know that their case and reasons are solid ...</p>
              <p>trust me, there's something fishy about this young chap .... he must have been insubordinate, played punk or thought it was his father's army or something,.....the SAF would never dick around on religious issues, and that's something that those stupid dickheads in those threads didn't think about ...</p>
