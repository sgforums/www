              <p>A man was sick and tired of going to work every day while his wife stayed home. He wanted her to see what he went through so he prayed: 'Dear Lord: I go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home. I want her to know what I go through. So, please allow her body to switch with mine for a day. Amen!'</p>
              <p>God, in his infinite wisdom, granted the man's wish. The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a woman.</p>
              <p>He arose, cooked breakfast for his mate, <br>Awakened the kids, <br>Set out their school clothes, <br>Fed them breakfast, <br>Packed their lunches, <br>Drove them to school, <br>Came home and picked up the dry cleaning, <br>Took it to the cleaners <br>And stopped at the bank to make a deposit, <br>Went grocery shopping, <br>Then drove home to put away the groceries, <br>Paid the bills and balanced the check book. <br>He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog. <br>Then, it was already 01P.M.</p>
              <p>And he hurried to make the beds, <br>Do the laundry, vacuum, <br>Dust, <br>And sweep and mop the kitchen floor. <br>Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home. <br>Set out milk and cookies and got the kids organized to do their homework. <br>Then, set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing.</p>
              <p>At 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables for salad, breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper. <br>After supper, He cleaned the kitchen, <br>Ran the dishwasher, <br>Folded laundry, <br>Bathed the kids, <br>And put them to bed.</p>
              <p>At 09 P.M . He was exhausted and, though his daily chores weren't finished, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaint.</p>
              <p>The next morning, he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said: - 'Lord, I don't know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please, oh! Oh! Please, let us trade back. Amen!'</p>
              <p>The Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied: 'My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were. You'll just have to wait nine months, though. You got pregnant last night.'</p>

So, please allow her body to switch with mine for a day. Amen!'</p>
              <p>God, in his infinite wisdom, granted the man's wish. The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a woman.</p>
              <p>He arose, cooked breakfast for his mate,<br>Awakened the kids,<br>Set out their school clothes,<br>Fed them breakfast,<br>Packed their lunches,<br>Drove them to school,<br>Came home and picked up the dry cleaning,<br>Took it to the cleaners<br>And stopped at the bank to make a deposit,<br>Went grocery shopping,<br>Then drove home to put away the groceries,<br>Paid the bills and balanced the check book.<br>He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog.<br>Then, it was already 01P.M.</p>
              <p>And he hurried to make the beds,<br>Do the laundry, vacuum,<br>Dust,<br>And sweep and mop the kitchen floor.<br>Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home.<br>Set out milk and cookies and got the kids organized to do their homework.<br>Then, set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing.</p>
              <p>At 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables for salad, breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper.<br>After supper, He cleaned the kitchen,<br>Ran the dishwasher,<br>Folded laundry,<br>Bathed the kids,<br>And put them to bed.</p>
              <p>At 09 P.M . He was exhausted and, though his daily chores weren't finished, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaint.</p>
              <p>The next morning, he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said: - 'Lord, I don't know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please, oh! Oh! Please, let us trade back. Amen!'</p>
              <p>The Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied: 'My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were. You'll just have to wait nine months, though. You got pregnant last night.'</p>
