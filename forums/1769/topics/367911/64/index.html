              <p>They should just be like the JW and suck it up and go to jail for 2 yrs since they feel so strongly about it.</p>
              <p>From what I see, the SAF has already given in a lot liao. And he has dry rations what. How much rations he wanna bring is up to him also. If he wants to bring a little bit than dun kpkb not enough food.</p>
              <p>The way they talk is like he dun even have food and the SAF is starving him to death. Even the farktards who signed on the appeal...All of them phail in English</p>
              <p>Oh ya the SAF allows food and I believe the food dun have meat, garlic and whatever shit. It's just that he is insisting that the food must be offered to his god first.</p>
              <p>He can just bring a small statue of his god and whatever things he need to pray ma</p>
              <p>Must be from temple meh. Muslims and Christians also pray to their god before meals ...ok not sure about Muslims.</p>

              <p>Out of curiosity I went to read up on it. -_-"</p>
              <p>Seriously as a young guy, I doubt he will remain a priest at all coz it means you can't travel at all liao if every meal have to be like this:</p>
              <h2>How To Offer Your Food To The Lord</h2>
              <p>As you walk down the supermarket aisles selecting the foods you will offer to Krishna, you need to know what is offerable and what is not. In the Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krishna states, "If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water, I will accept it." From this verse it is understood that we can offer Krishna foods prepared from milk products, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and grains. Meat, fish, and eggs are not offerable. And a few vegetarian items are also forbidden--garlic and onions, for example, which are in the mode of ignorance. (Hing, or asafetida, is a tasty substitute for them in cooking and is available at most Indian groceries.) Nor can you offer to Krishna coffee or tea that contain caffeine. If you like these beverages, purchase caffeine free coffee and herbal teas.</p>
              <p>While shopping, be aware that you may find meat, fish, and egg products mixed with other foods; so be sure to read labels carefully. For instance, some brands of yogurt and sour cream contain gelatin, a substance made from the horns, hooves, and bones of slaughtered animals. Also, make sure the cheese you buy contains no rennet, an enzyme extracted from the stomach tissues of slaughtered calves. Most hard cheese sold in America contains rennet, so be careful about any cheese you can't verify as rennetless.</p>
              <p>Also avoid foods cooked by non-devotees. According to the subtle laws of nature, the cook acts upon the food not only physically but mentally as well. Food thus becomes an agent for subtle influences on your conscious. The principle is the same as that at work with a painting: a painting is not simply a collection of strokes on a canvas but an expression of the artist's state of mind, which affects the viewer. So if you eat food cooked by non-devotees-employees working in a factory, for example--then you're sure to absorb a dose of materialism and karma. So as far as possible use only fresh, natural ingredients.</p>
              <p>In preparing food, cleanliness is the most important principle. Nothing impure should be offered to God; so keep your kitchen very clean. Always wash your hands thoroughly before entering the kitchen. While preparing food, do not taste it, for you are cooking the meal not for yourself but for the pleasure of Krishna. Arrange portions of the food on dinnerware kept especially for this purpose; no one but the Lord should eat from these dishes. The easiest way to offer food is simply to pray, "My dear Lord Krishna, please accept this food," and to chant each of the following prayers three times while ringing a bell:</p>
              <p>1. <strong>Prayer to Srila Prabhupada</strong>:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <em>nama om vishnu-padaya krishna-preshthaya bhutale <br>srimate bhaktivedanta-swamin iti namine <br>namas te saraswate deve gaura-vani-pracharine <br>nirvishesha shunyavadi pashchatya desha tarine</em>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I offer my respectful obeisances unto His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who is very dear to Lord Krishna, having taken shelter at His lotus feet. Our respectful obeisances are unto you, O spiritual master, servant of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami. You are kindly preaching the message of Lord Caitanya deva and delivering the Western countries, which are filled with impersonalism and voidism."</p>
              <p>2. <strong>Prayer to Lord Chaitanya</strong>:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <em>namo maha-vadanyaya krishna-prema-pradaya te <br>krishnaya krishna-chaitanya-namne gaura-twishe namaha</em>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"O most munificent incarnation! You are Krishna Himself appearing as Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. You have assumed the golden color of Srimati Radharani. and You are widely distributing pure love of Krishna. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You."</p>
              <p>3. <strong>Prayer to Lord Krishna</strong>:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <em>namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya cha <br>jagad-dhitaya krishnaya govindaya namo namaha</em>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I offer my respectful obeisances unto Lord Krishna, who is the worshipable Deity for all brahmanas the well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas and the benefactor of the whole world. I offer my repeated obeisances to the Personality of Godhead, known as Krishna and Govinda."</p>
              <p>Remember that the real purpose of preparing and offering food to the Lord is to show your devotion and gratitude to Him. Krishna accepts your devotion, not the physical offering itself. God is complete in Himself--He doesn't need anything--but out of His immense kindness He allows us to offer food to Him so that we can develop our love for Him.</p>
              <p>After offering the food to the Lord, wait at least five minutes for Him to partake of the preparations. Then you should transfer the food from the special dinnerware and wash the dishes and utensils you used for the offering. Now you and any guests may eat the prasadam. While you eat, try to appreciate the spiritual value of the food. Remember that because Krishna has accepted it, it is non-different from Him, and therefore by eating it you will become purified.</p>
              <p>Everything you offer on your altar becomes prasadam, the mercy of the Lord. The flowers, the incense, the water, the food--everything you offer for the Lord's pleasure becomes spiritualized. When we offer the Lord something with genuine love and devotion, He enters into the offering, and thus the remnants are non-different from Him. So you should not only deeply respect the things you've offered, but you should distribute them to others as well.</p>
