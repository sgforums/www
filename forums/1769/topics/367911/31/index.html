              <p>okay.. i'm going home...</p>
              <p>btw.. the retard?</p>
              <p>he was placed in that section because, like the senior citizen, they put him there because it's not mission critical and very relaxed.. he had cancer and was going through chemotherapy or radiotherapy or something..</p>
              <p>thing is, he was well 4 years ago already.. the therapy must have destroyed his brains as well..</p>
              <p>the other week, we told him to move the towed vehicle up to Suntec Convention Hall through the ramp and gave him the map, gave the tow truck driver the map.. we were busy doing everything else..</p>
              <p>he went to exactly the entrance of the ramp, stopped there, refused to move because he was "scared that it was the wrong place"</p>
              <p>we told him to get the damned thing up, and he wanted us to come get him.. all the time, he was holding traffic by just parking his goddamned vehicle at the entrance of the ramp!</p>
              <p>and there was another time he stonewalled a whole project for a month because his senior citizen boss was in hospital.. all we wanted was a file to get a contact of the vendor who did the things in his section.. in order to move the project along due to his boss not being around...</p>
              <p>he flat out refused to assist.. we know about the file, we just don't know who his vendor was.. he stonewalled us.. hell! he stonewalled a dy director too.. kept insisting "i don't know.. you go and find out" i gave it to him "i'm trying to find out to save your goddamned skin!!" and still he stonewalled me.. until the organisation No.2 lost his temper and we moved into his goddamned office to turn up upside down looking for the file...</p>
              <p>this is how retarded this retard is..</p>
              <p>and now we have to supervise him...</p>
