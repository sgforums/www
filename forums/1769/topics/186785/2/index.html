            <div class='col-md body'>i read from some book that is becoz<br><br>Woman are generally attracted to the ride of rollercoaster emotions ,like sadness , betrayal , misery ,happiness,ectascy etc all rolled in-to-1 , it makes them more alive coz living to them, is all abt feeling.Hence when a badboy comes into their life , they are naturely tempted by such potential emotions,why do u think woman love korean soap operas and melodramas,love novels. It makes them cry, smile and giggle.  A bad guy brings out the 'woman' in them.<br><br>I have seen many examples around my life ,esp the earlier stage of our life , esp younger woman who want to experience the rollercoaster of emotions.<br>But we all know such emotions are short lived and after a few tries , a few years down the road , they have tried n experienced it all and ready to settle down . Hence the nice guys comes along , but at this stage most of them already married/divorced/turn gay or the rest of left on the shelf.<br><br>I have also seen cases of early marriages which resulted in the divorces, although having a endearing loving hubby , they were not able to experience enulf of the emotional upheaval becoz of their early commitment, hence a very potential break-away temptation would be there for them.<br><br>Do u know how woman masterbate? they dont have images of naked men humping etc etc like us men. BUt they visualize environment , feelings , emotions which turns them on.<br><br>So all in all, why woman cry and men lie.<br><br>But tats my 5cts worth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>personal experience, my gf loves me, but treats me like dirt..coz i treat her like a princess<br><br></div>
