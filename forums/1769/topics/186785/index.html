            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I guess nice also must have tactic lah. There were times when I was too nice to people and they were freaked out, they were like, how come this guy is so nice to me, he must be having ulterior motives. I guess that's a common way of reacting to nice people, because as the world grows smarter, people tend to be overly cautious of others. I'm not saying that it's bad to be distrusthful of others, but this is why nice guys often freak people out, it's the instinct that if people are too nice, they will be thought of as having ulterior motives. I guess often the movies portray such things, like evil people pretending to be nice with a deep hidden agenda. Well, movies are movies afterall, there can truly be really nice sincered people in this world. I've met my fair share of them, and I'm a collector of such friends, because I love to be surrounded by such people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've had my share of being with the bad guys too - guys who are extremely exciting and 'forbidden' and needless to say, disliked by my family and close friends!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>The forbidden fruit tastes sweeter, what can I say?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>It's not just nice guys who finish last, cause nice girls do finish last too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Maybe, it's this need for 'challenge' in some of us.  If someone is 'too nice' and 'too available', we tend to take that person for granted.  However, if someone's touted as a 'difficult' catch, it might suddenly render that person extremely desirable, notwithstanding their bad boy or bad girl image, which, in these instances, can actually enhance their desirability because of the exciting challenge they become to people who love the thrill of the chase.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hopefully, we get over this stage and move on wiser and become mellower and more mature.  Sadly, some don't proceed beyond this stage!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If you're very restless, easily bored, and are always on the lookout for exciting, new stuff, you might find a nice guy/girl too boring, too predictable, too stifling, etc.  However, if you're more or less a homebody sort who like the idea of a stable relationship with little to no nasty surprises, you'd go for the 'nice' peeps.<br><br>We go through stages of our life when we prefer different people and oh well, different strokes for different folks, as they say.<br><br>Me?

If someone is 'too nice' and 'too available', we tend to take that person for granted.  However, if someone's touted as a 'difficult' catch, it might suddenly render that person extremely desirable, notwithstanding their bad boy or bad girl image, which, in these instances, can actually enhance their desirability because of the exciting challenge they become to people who love the thrill of the chase.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hopefully, we get over this stage and move on wiser and become mellower and more mature.  Sadly, some don't proceed beyond this stage!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If you're very restless, easily bored, and are always on the lookout for exciting, new stuff, you might find a nice guy/girl too boring, too predictable, too stifling, etc.  However, if you're more or less a homebody sort who like the idea of a stable relationship with little to no nasty surprises, you'd go for the 'nice' peeps.<br><br>We go through stages of our life when we prefer different people and oh well, different strokes for different folks, as they say.<br><br>Me?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think some women see the so-called "bad boys" as a challenge. Maybe they're exciting to be with, just a bit rough around the edges. And the women delude themselves into thinking that they can change the person over time.<br><br>That being said, who says a person cannot be nice and yet interesting/exciting to be with? The stereotypical definition of "nice guy" seems to be that of a guy who's nice, caring, but boring.<br><br></div>
