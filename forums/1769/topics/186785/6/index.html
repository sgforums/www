I mean if a guy is nice - whether or not the girl fails to appreciate his gentlemanliness or not should not make him seem like the victim.<br><br>He is not a victim  simply because he is nice and his niceness is not reciprocated. It would be a sad day that if once 'niceness' does not guarantee 'gratitude' then the niceness is wasted and the giver becomes 'victimised'<br><br>He is only a victim if he is either<br>1) unable to discern that his affections is wasted on someone who not only does not return his affection, but abuses it and use him, and does not respect him or<br><br>2)unable to walk away from someone like this despite being able to see it due to whatsoever reasons.<br><br><blockquote>well the ability to "discerne" is always easy in hindsight and from an outside perspective. I am sure you have seen relationships where it makes you cringe at how couples talk to each other, and it usually the "nice" person being talked to in such a way.<br></blockquote>And yes, as mentioned above in 1) and 2), then the nice party is a victim and deserves pity.<br><br>I am only putting this across because I have seen many more situations  where, say, a guy does a lot for a girl even though the girl have already stated very clearly to please stop it, she cannot reciprocate. And in the end, the girl is the one being criticised for not 'accepting' the 'nice' guy. Of course the opposite happens where the girl is the 'nice' one as well<br><br>The recipient of such 'niceness' in the end resort to being curt and adamant to discourage this - but in the end will also be criticised for not appreciating the 'niceness' and the nice person is so pitiful and victimised.. like someone do much but kenna treated like this back.<br><br>Real cases of victimisation exists, but most of the time cases like this that happen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the response... everyone. Just goes to show that there are and always will be differences in opinions of whether a guy can be deemed 'too nice' or otherwise.<br><br>It's all a matter of perspective, really.<br><br>To all those guys who are 'too nice' - don't stop being nice, and to those who feel a kinship with the bad ones... some of us still need you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For what its worth... always, always be yourself.
