              <p>Hanor!   That's why often I wake up exhausted... because my dreams are not only in technicolour, it seems as if I 'work' as a scriptwriter, stunt coordinator, cameraman and director in my dreams!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Peng Sanz!</p>

              <p>OH gosh... yesterday at my workplace, I went to another ward and
              saw a small aquarium with a cute li'l lone goldfish peeking out at
              me from amongst the aquatic plants...</p>
              <p>And then I dreamt that I was in a beautiful street in a place
              that looked like England or Europe.  Walking down the lane
              towards an aquarium when a fire warning was sounded!  I hopped
              into a shop, got four packets of 'fire retardant powders', and
              sprinkled it all over the street! </p>
              <p>Crossed the road, sprinkled it on the other side of the
              road.  Started to wonder how the powder worked, read the
              instructions, realised that the powder will transform into snails
              when it comes into contact with water / air!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  Somehow, the snails fight fire!! 
              <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>I watched the powder transform into snails in a longkang. 
              Also saw a goldfish, two catfishes, and a stingray in the
              longkang. </p>
              <p>Went into the aquarium.  Tried to look for a nice-sized
              tank for myself but couldn't.  The fishes, even the 'normal'
              ones, were expensive.  I saw a 'Tarantula Fish' that was
              bright green + turquoise + orange etc!!  It was a brightly
              coloured exotic tarantula that lived in water!  Somehow, the
              owner got me a net and told me to fish one out, and I struggled to
              keep it in the net because it kept trying to crawl out!! 
              <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  I screamed and yelled until the owner
              finally took over the net!  Eeeeee-yerh!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>There were 'aquatic Pacman frogs' too that looked like
              they  had an armour of golden 'plastic' over them.  They
              were swimming in a full tank of water, which was pretty
              unusual...</p>
              <p>Ended up not buying anything.  Went into an old old
              building where they were training student nurses.  Went into a
              'mock ICU' which turned out to be a REAL ICU!  Saw some funny
              boxy equipment, latest technology or something, that was a
              high-tech mechanical ventilator.  Ooh'd and aah'd over
              it.  Looked over to examine the patient being kept alive by
              it. </p>
              <p>Then, entered a classroom of nursing students.  All tried
              to learn something from me but then their tutor entered the room,
              and they left to dress up for a Chingay Procession, gathering
              outside a Temple beside the old building!</p>
              <p>So I entered the restroom and found that the first cubicle was
              sealed off because there was a huge hole in the floor and you can
              see floors down through it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>The next two cubicles were 'normal' old squat toilets but the
              last one had firemen gear and uniform chucked into the
              toilet!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> and a huge window was on the wall beside it looking
              out into a rural scene with fireman cordone tapes hanging all over,
              blowing in the wind! </p>
              <p>Weird... just weird... and with that, I leave the interpretation
              for later when I'm back from work!</p>

              <p>Went to meet the HR Director to be interviewed for a job.  In the end, he told me that I'm too good for the job, but he'd like me to help train the person they intended to hire for the position instead!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> </p>

              <p>And as proven last night, alcohol doesn't help stop my dreams.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, had a bumper crop of two nightmares last night!  It started with me working in a huge mine of some sort.  Forced to cook porridge to enter into some competition to see who cooks the best porridge.  We were in some sort of minefield, but I was up on a cliff whilst the mining was done deep in the recesses.</p>
              <p>And then, whilst watching the ore trucks moving here and there on the rails that hug the undulating terrain, I started to fight for someone's affection.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  And out of the blue, an old HK actor, Cheng Siu Chow, appeared.  He seemed to be some sorta manager.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I decided to try a new technique with my porridge to make it smoother, but it ended up making it thicker and I had to add more water to smoothen it out. </p>
              <p>Then suddenly, I was asked to move out of the landmine and instead, approach a huge airport where my parents were and they told me to look for my brother in the cinema.  Walked into the cinema with plush red carpeting, and found my bro, except, he wasn't an adult - he was a little boy aged about 10 or so. </p>
              <p>I sat beside him on the plush carpet floor, and we watched this HK movie where Sammi Cheng was the lead actress and she was being pursued around the world by this ardent suitor and we were enjoying the scenes from around the world.  Everyone watching the movie commented that it was worth watching as the producers probably spent millions flying the cast and crew all over the world just to film the movie! </p>
              <p>And then... I woke up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>This is too bizarre to even attempt to interpret!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>I dreamt last night that I was in a vertical marathon.   It was underwater, however, and you had to make your way back to the surface after that. No problems with that, and I helped a couple of classmates along the way.</p>
              <p>That turned out to be a dream within a dream. I "woke up" to find 4 of my teeth broken. I tried to telephone my dentist several times in desperation as it was  near closing time but nobody answered. That's where it ended.</p>

              <p>Since I dream nightly nowadays, I might as well keep a dream journal! </p>
              <p>Anyone who dreams and is able to recollect their dreams, is also welcome to contribute and share their dreams here! </p>
              <p>Here's a cnp from my post in the Jive Pad :</p>
              <p>I dreamt of Pinky and MPB last night!  Also of av! </p>
              <p>I dreamt that Pinky and MPB are my neighbours although their apartment is more than twice as large as mine.  I decided to keep an aquarium again because I went to this atypical aquarium and saw a 'Kurosaki goldfish', which is the dark brown - black goldfish with a lovely tail and semi-protruding eyes, which I used to keep.  Anyways, I bought that one and only Kurosaki goldfish, dug out my dad's old abandoned aquarium, and tried to set it up, but I have forgotten how to, so I hopped over to Pinky's apartment and ended up spending time in there oogling at her aquarium, which was huuuuge!</p>
              <p>Pinky, I saw that you had one helluva strange-looking fish that kinda looks like a more sinister version of the Barramundi with a really odd tail!  It was kinda... 3-pronged, but it definitely looked like some alien mutant!  There were like tails within the tails!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, you know I love the Bee Fish, right?  I went fish-shopping again and found ONE bee fish!  Yay!!! </p>
              <p>And then suddenly, I was in JC with av and he was helping me hunt for the mysterious Lecture Theatre that was built opposite to all other lecture theatres in campus!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  And better still, there was an MRT station right smack in front of the rows of lecture theatres!  How cool is that?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, I returned to the aquarium only to end up in a fight to the death with a Scorpion that had somehow escaped its tank!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  I tried to bite off its pincers but of course got stung, tried to pry off the other pincer, got stung again!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  But I didn't stop!  I just kept on struggling with it and got stung repeatedly... and then I woke up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>Sigh... another night of nightmares and weird dreams...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Interpretation from <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1769/topics/www.dreammoods.com">www.dreammoods.com</a> :</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;">Goldfish</span></strong> <span style="font-size: small; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><br></span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">To see a goldfish in your dream, foretells of wealth and many successful and pleasant adventures.</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;">Aquarium</span></strong> <span style="font-size: small; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><br></span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">To see an aquarium in your dream, signifies that you have acknowledged your emotions but have not yet confronted them. Thus, it may refer to your unconscious thoughts or repressed sexual desires. </span></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> <span style="font-size: small; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Also, you may feel that your life is going no where or that you feel it is going in circles. Alternatively, the aquarium may indicate that you need to calm down and set some time for yourself to relax and unwind.</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: medium; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;">Scorpion</span></strong> <span style="font-size: small; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><br></span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">To see a scorpion in your dream, represents a situation in your waking life which may have been painful or hurtful.</span></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> <span style="font-size: small; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">It is also indicative of destructive feelings, "stinging" remarks, bitter words and/or negative thoughts being expressed by or aimed against you. Your dream forewarns of a self-destructive and self-defeating path. The scorpion is also a symbol of death and rebirth. You need to get rid of the old and make room for something new. Alternatively, the scorpion may also represent a person who is born under the astrological sign for Scorpio.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, at least I fought back the Scorpion!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">  Something did happen yesterday at work though.  The nasty bunch of Aussie colleagues at work tried to make things difficult for me again, but this time round, I stood up for myself and took a shot back at them, because I have had enough!  And you know what, I walked away mighty proud of myself that I FINALLY became assertive towards them!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  I think a few nicer colleagues did notice that they seem to act like bullies towards certain people at times, but this time round, I just wasn't going to allow it anymore because I have finally managed to get in the direction I wish to head towards and I'm getting out of that horrible ward, and I no longer have to keep my tail between my legs just because I had no choice but to keep my head down low to prevent things from escalating!   (Unfortunately, that bunch of horrible people rub shoulders with the Unit Manager, so it was best not to offend them and keep a low profile). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">  Maybe, that was why although I got stung repeatedly by the Scorpion in my dreams, I kept on biting back and trying to twist its pincers and tail off!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm in a new work area now where my new colleagues have had nasty encounters with these people from my ward before and thus they have been making subtle statements that made me realise that my old workplace was just plain nasty, political, and hostile at times.  There are, of course, a few colleagues in my new ward I have to watch out for, but other than that, it's a much better working environment because there are more males, which kinda balances out the b!tchiness in an otherwise female-dominated workplace!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm a Scorpio too, btw.  I guess it's pretty symbolic!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <div>I dreamt this while I was serving my 10 year sentence in Changi Prison for cheating S$4.8 million dollars from 1991 to 1992. I wrote a letter to my wife about this dream because it was about us. I felt it was quite interesting for her to read.<br><br>I dreamt about it on the night of 22nd July 1997.<br><br>Thought I share this with you.<br><br>With Love,<br>Zulkifli Mahmood<br><br><br><strong><strong>22nd July 1997</strong><br><br></strong>In this dream, the sceneries that surrounded the both of us were all mountains. It was rather cooling and quite dark. I said to her, "You said to me that you have to go and live somewhere at the mountain and we have to wait for about five years until we are reunited again." I felt sad and then I said to her, "I refuse to agree with you about what you have just said and planning to do." But then she ignored my pleading and left me without any second thoughts and without looking back to wave goodbye. I watched her went up the mountain track alone. I felt abandoned and lonely. Anyway, I refused to accept the idea of her living up in the mountain and to wait for five years.<br><br>Sometime later, somehow another, I managed to go around the mountain and I met a wise old man with long white hair and beard, sitting crossed legs at the base of the other side of the mountain. He was wearing a white robe. I saw her with this old wise man. I saw she was preparing something to drink near the camp fire.<br><br>While I was approaching near, the old wise man and her saw me coming. When I came nearer, the old wise man stopped me in front of him and she were sitting next to him. The old wise man looked at me and studied my face with wonders for quite sometime. Somehow another I could feel and see that my face, especially, my forehead, it was glowing with bright lights. And then this old wise man spoke to me with full confidence, "You have a good soul." After hearing this I woke up.</div>

              <p><strong>The Portrait And World War Two</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <div class="post-body">
              <div style="clear: both;"><strong></strong></div>
              <div><strong><strong>I had these dreams while in Changi Prison (The Old Changi Prison that was build by the British prior to WW2).</strong></strong><br><br>With Love,</div>
              <div>Joe<br><br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong></strong></span><br><strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Dream One</span><br></span></strong><br></strong>The first dream I had was about the potrait of a man in black attire.<br><br>"I was in the grand hall where there were many large potraits hanging on the wall. I saw a group of children gathering in front of me, viewing a large potrait. Though I was watching them from behind, I felt their deep admirations for the portrait that they were looking at. Awhile later the children moved away from the portrait so I approached the portrait out of curiosity because I wanted to know who was in that portrait and why they admired it so intensely.<br><br>I saw a man in black attire but I could not see his face because it was covered with white mists. I saw on his left palm a tattoo of an eagle. The eagle was diving down with its wings spread out just like The United States of America military eagle insignia. Without thinking, I look at my own left palm and there it was, the same identical eagle tattoo just like in the portrait of the man." And then I woke up.<br><br><br><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dream Two</span></strong></span><br><br></strong>The second one I dreamt that, " I was walking on top of a cliff towards its edge. When I reached the edge of the cliff, I saw myriad of battleships and I saw many landing crafts carrying troops towards the beach. I felt frightened because I knew the American task force was invading the island that I was on. With fear I told myself that I needed to hide from them and I felt afraid of death." And then I woke up in cold sweat.<br><br><br><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dream Three</span></strong></span><br><br></strong>In the third dream, " I saw from a distance from high above, a white aircraft crashed into the sea. I saw its hind tail and its side wings in wreckage, floating in the water. The sun was shining on it."<br><br>The impression I got from this dream was that the plane, maybe C130 Aircraft had crashed while enrouted to other part of Vietnam upon reaching Vietnam during the Vietnam War. There were U.S. Marines on board the plane. None of them had survived in that plane crashed.<br><br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dream Four</span></strong></span> <br><br>The fourth dream was, " I was kneeling on my knees and with my head bending downward. I clearly felt that there was a Samurai sword above my head waiting to strike my neck though I did not see it. So I heard my own voice saying to myself, "Come on, do it quickly'." And then I heard a voice shouted "No!" very loudly." I woke up with the fear of death.<br><br><br><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dream Five</span></strong> </span><br><br></strong>The fifth dream, " I was walking towards a man in khaki uniform. He was watching a group of people coming out from a building and there were black uniform soldiers standing on the streets with rifles in their hands. When I came closed from behind this man, he suddenly turned around and saluted me.<br><br>I asked him, "Which unit you're from?"<br>He replied, "From the Milan Unit, Sir!"<br>Then he asked me, "Are you the last five, Sir."<br><br>When he questioned me that, I was confused and I did not know how to reply him. I woke up.<br><br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Is Not A Dream</span></strong></span><br><br></strong><span style="color: #999900;">There was one occasion I was half asleep and half awake. I opened up my eyes and I saw four Scottish soldiers standing at attention. They were in kilts and I saw their Scottish army berets. On their breasts there were many war decorations and medals as though they were proud to show me of their war valour honours that they had possessed. </span><br><br><span style="color: #999900;">Their faces were concealed with white mists and I could not see their faces. The impression I had was that they were The Gordon Highlanders of the British Army.</span></div>

              <p><br>So i'm not the only one. I'm so tired. I've had dreams almost every other night. Sometimes i get sleep paralysis, i think i'm so mentally tired. Is there a cure to it? I'm thinking of a MRI scan but not if i can save my brain cells, is there a way to sleep well?</p>
              <p>I dreamt of a crashing helicopter last night and 3 people were dead, i dreamt i crossed the door of hell the night before, and that day, i confirmed colors in my dreams, as i remembered the clear blue sea.</p>
              <p>Most times, my dreams are so morbid i think nightmares don't seem significant anymore. I've had lucid dreamings, and sometimes i don't know why i even bother to sleep when i know it's not even proper rest at all.</p>
              <p>I tried to take naps but that's the time i'm most prone to sleep paralysis, and i'm scared of it. I've had scary hallucinations from it. i envy people who sleep well..</p>

              <p>I just had another nightmare...</p>
              <p>Dreamt that I came to work as usual. First to reach the office. It was all dark, except for a small little light in my boss room. And the door's ajar. I thought something was amiss because my boss is not in town, so was it because colleagues did not close his door the previous day?</p>
              <p>I walk in. I see empty cupboards. There's a small little cupboard behind Boss desk and there is a safe inside. Its empty! (in reality, there isn't any such safe or cupboard).</p>
              <p>I knew there was a breakin. I came out without touching anything. I called the security of my building to let them know there was a breakin. I looked around again. I saw that the thief had used my colleague's set of keys to open boss room as well as the cupboards in there. My boss keeps a whole set of jackets in his room and those are gone as well.</p>
              <p>When my colleagues came to work, I told them about the break in. Security came and Housekeeping came too! They came to clean up the room.</p>
              <p>I was very angry with Security because they didn't do anything. Then I woke up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>Now I feel sooooooo tired...</p>

              <p>Incidentally, now that I'm on annual leave, my pattern of dreaming has changed drastically!</p>
              <p>Instead of vivid nightmares, I only have subtle 'flossy' dreams running in the background and they are usually so placcid that I don't recall much of it upon waking up!  Nothing traumatic!</p>
              <p>So my nightmares had nothing to do with supper or no supper, drinks or no drinks, sleeping early or late, watching horror movies or not... it's more to do with my state of mind in my waking hours!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Verdict : Working in a stressful, bad-vibes environment is bad for holistic health!</p>
