              <p>Since I dream nightly nowadays, I might as well keep a dream journal! </p>
              <p>Anyone who dreams and is able to recollect their dreams, is also welcome to contribute and share their dreams here! </p>
              <p>Here's a cnp from my post in the Jive Pad :</p>
              <p>I dreamt of Pinky and MPB last night!  Also of
                                          av! </p>
              <p>I dreamt that Pinky and MPB are my neighbours although their
                                          apartment is more than twice as large as mine.  I decided to
                                          keep an aquarium again because I went to this atypical aquarium and
                                          saw a 'Kurosaki goldfish', which is the dark brown - black goldfish
                                          with a lovely tail and semi-protruding eyes, which I used to
                                          keep.  Anyways, I bought that one and only Kurosaki goldfish,
                                          dug out my dad's old abandoned aquarium, and tried to set it up,
                                          but I have forgotten how to, so I hopped over to Pinky's apartment
                                          and ended up spending time in there oogling at her aquarium, which
                                          was huuuuge!</p>
              <p>Pinky, I saw that you had one helluva strange-looking fish that
                                          kinda looks like a more sinister version of the Barramundi with a
                                          really odd tail!  It was kinda... 3-pronged, but it definitely
                                          looked like some alien mutant!  There were like tails within
                                          the tails!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, you know I love the Bee Fish, right?  I went
                                          fish-shopping again and found ONE bee fish!  Yay!!! </p>
              <p>And then suddenly, I was in JC with av and he was helping me
                                          hunt for the mysterious Lecture Theatre that was built opposite to
                                          all other lecture theatres in campus!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  And better still, there was an MRT station
                                          right smack in front of the rows of lecture theatres!  How
                                          cool is that?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, I returned to the aquarium only to end up in a fight to
                                          the death with a Scorpion that had somehow escaped its tank! 
                                          <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  I tried to bite off its pincers but of course
                                          got stung, tried to pry off the other pincer, got stung
                                          again!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  But I didn't stop!  I just kept on
                                          struggling with it and got stung repeatedly... and then I woke
                                          up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>Sigh... another night of nightmares and weird dreams...

              <p><br>Interpretation from <a href="/forums/1769/topics/www.dreammoods.com">www.dreammoods.com</a> :</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Goldfish </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><br> </span> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> To see a goldfish in your dream, foretells of wealth and  many successful and pleasant adventures.</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Aquarium </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><br> </span> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> To see an aquarium in your dream, signifies that you have acknowledged
                  your emotions but have not yet confronted them. Thus, it may refer to
                  your unconscious thoughts or repressed sexual desires.  </span></span><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> Also, you may
                  feel that your life is going no where or that you feel it is going in
                  circles. Alternatively, the aquarium may indicate that you need to calm
                  down and set some time for yourself to relax and unwind.</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Scorpion </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><br> </span> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"> To see a scorpion in your dream, represents a situation in your waking
                  life which may have been painful or hurtful. </span></span><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">It is also indicative of
                  destructive feelings, "stinging" remarks, bitter words and/or negative
                  thoughts being expressed by or aimed against you. Your dream forewarns
                  of a self-destructive and self-defeating path. The scorpion is also a
                  symbol of death and rebirth. You need to get rid of the old and make
                  room for something new. Alternatively, the scorpion may also represent
                  a person who is born under the astrological sign for Scorpio.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, at least I fought back the Scorpion!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">  Something did happen yesterday at work though.  The nasty bunch of Aussie colleagues at work tried to make things difficult for me again, but this time round, I stood up for myself and took a shot back at them, because I have had enough!  And you know what, I walked away mighty proud of myself that I FINALLY became assertive towards them!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  I think a few nicer colleagues did notice that they seem to act like bullies towards certain people at times, but this time round, I just wasn't going to allow it anymore because I have finally managed to get in the direction I wish to head towards and I'm getting out of that horrible ward, and I no longer have to keep my tail between my legs just because I had no choice but to keep my head down low to prevent things from escalating!   (Unfortunately, that bunch of horrible people rub shoulders with the Unit Manager, so it was best not to offend them and keep a low profile).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">  Maybe, that was why although I got stung repeatedly by the Scorpion in my dreams, I kept on biting back and trying to twist its pincers and tail off!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm in a new work area now where my new colleagues have had nasty encounters with these people from my ward before and thus they have been making subtle statements that made me realise that my old workplace was just plain nasty, political, and hostile at times.  There are, of course, a few colleagues in my new ward I have to watch out for, but other than that, it's a much better working environment because there are more males, which kinda balances out the b!tchiness in an otherwise female-dominated workplace!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm a Scorpio too, btw.  I guess it's pretty symbolic!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Last night, I dreamt of our KualiBaba!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I think he was asking me for help and we went searching for something called a "Shin Ji" or whatever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  The whole dream was just going around searching and searching and encountering all manner of weird people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  At certain stages, it got quite scary actually.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>However, I woke up at 3am right in the middle of the dream, and when I was up, I thought, "I should write details of my dream down!" but I was too sleepy to bother and thus, the details have been forgotten.</p>

              <p>I have had a few pretty traumatic nightmares that I can still remember because they spook me sooooo much!</p>
              <p>A recurrent nightmare takes place in my maternal grandma's Commonwealth apartment.  I suspect the grounds are 'dirty' because I keep having nightmares of that place.  I'm always being chased by ghosts and all manner of spooky zombies and monsters and I always have to run up and down the staircases, trying to avoid getting caught, and trying to hide in an empty apartment. </p>
              <p>Another time, same setting, but it was some kinda war or communist era and I ran into grandma's apartment, locked the door and windows, and tried to hide from the communists.  I sneaked a peek out the kitchen window and saw the entire area below the block being occupied by communist armies!! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then there's the time this year when I dreamt I was in a Club 30 outing, much like our outings to Geylang a few years ago, and there was a huge 4-lane road that I was trying to cross without using the overhead bridge when suddenly, screams were head, the sky turned dark, and a huuuuge explosion rocked the earth!!  I looked up and saw a plane with a broken wing and smoke and fire crashing into a block very near me!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  I was sooo scared, I was petrified and shaking and couldn't move!  l woke up shaken and with heart palpitations!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>ok i had the weirdest dream just now</p>
              <p>i was a plainclothes police officer, and something happened, probably a terrorist attack, so i acted as if i fainted, it was at a cold long corridor of an office or some mall</p>
              <p>then someone, during the chaos, begun to drag me away, i continued to pretend to be unconcious, it was a long drag to some other places, probably the plumbing room or some other room</p>
              <p>getting kinky huh?</p>
              <p>the guy who dragged me started to nudge me, when i opened my eyes, there was this sinister guy with sneering smile, look like those typical thug who dressed well in suit and what not, having a long metal spike in his hand, wanting to kill me</p>
              <p>so i dodge, then we went into a fight, in the end, he tried to throw his metal spike to pierce my heart, but it missed, couldnt find where it went to, then i reached for my weapon...a bloody army jacknife, and begun slashing away</p>
              <p>soon my team members joined in the fight, submachine guns firing away, and the thug's friends joined in the fray, so there we were in a carpark, firing and slashing and fist fighting</p>
              <p>the climax was reached when one of my team member's head was pointed at gunpoint by the thug, and i pointed my jacknife or gun at him (how did i get a gun?), and due to an intervention by a female team member of mine (she is like the heroine of the show), chaos erupted, and my team take the chance to run away</p>
              <p>so left the thugs, dazed and lost in the carpark, as soon as they knew what was going on, they tried to collect their members together and escape, but enter the uniformed policemen, more like SWAT Team or Flying Tigers team</p>
              <p>they hollered at all civilians to squat down or remain in their cars, and they soon started firing their submachine guns, machines guns, whatever at the thugs</p>
              <p>massive number of rounds were fired, you can see cars riddled with bullet holes (they tell civilians to remain in their cars?), and all thugs were killed</p>
              <p>then the SWAT Team searched the whole area and told civilians to gather at a corner</p>
              <p>one of the thugs who escaped the gunfire by jumping into the car, joined the group, until a civilian pointed him out, he protested his innocence, then suddenly said he would offer information on his gang...but was promptly arrested by the police</p>
              <p>then i woke up</p>

              <p>Just woke up from a nightmare!</p>
              <p>Dreamt I was back in nursing school although this time round, the nursing school is a semi-hospital and it was really high-rise, with 80+ floors!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  There were many corners and nooks and crannies and it was very very scary cause it was mostly dark and ghosts and other sinister creatures not of htis world were lurking all over the place! They were quite bold too and some of them just get out and about along the corridors and into the rooms in broad daylight!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>To escape a group of phantoms tailing me cause I somehow ended up being alone, I ran into a huge room, which happened to be a sewing hall and there were lots of ladies in there sewing and learning how to sew clothes from paper patterns.  I got busy for a while, deciding which pattern of dress to sew etc.</p>
              <p>Then suddenly, I had to get out to work in some funny ward.  It was meal time and the dinner trolleys were being pushed around.  Somehow, there was enough manpower so someone said, Missy, just push this trolley to the other end and then distribute amongst yourself and your friends!</p>
              <p>But the corridor was loooong and it got darker and darker as I pushed it.  I was soooo relieved when I entered the last room and it was brightly-lit and elindra and av were there!! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As we distributed the food and selected our own, more food was coming.  There was an old HDB flat type of wooden shutter window at the head of this large bed so I went to sit on the large bed and looked out (not down, because I think we were more than 80 storeys high!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> )  There was a tiny rectangular pot of various small cactus by the window sill and I was a bit fearful someone would accidentally kick or push it out the window.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I looked out and there was a huge HDB penthouse apartment in the opposite block with a roof-top garden which I could see very well.  There were cactus all over, one huuge barrel-like round succulent one, and esp one really tall, multiple-lobed one!  For some strange reason, I kept looking at the tallest cactus and wondering if anyone would be brave enough to get on top of a ladder to trim it or something because then if you fall off the ladder, it's a long way down!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Then, elindra and av and I decided to explore the recesses of our building.  We stumbled into an indoor amusement park!  We decided to go for the roller coaster rides.  The first ride wasn't so scary... it was pretty gentle.  It had the old strapped on belt that I was worried about.  Then, we had to walk into a tunnel and descend to our seats in the 2nd roller coaster, which was a killer roller-coaster!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  It had death-defying plunges and corkscrews and what-not.  Worse, elindra couldn't seem to put on her safety harness and she was sitting facing the wrong way, and mine didn't seem to get tight and snug enough!  The roller-coaster started moving down slowly and both of us were screaming and screaming!  av tried to yell to the guys to stop and at this point, I was so fearful, I woke up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

This
                  may involve a painful memory, guilt, or some repressed thoughts. You
                  may be afraid of death and dying. Alternatively, ghosts are
                  representative of something that is no longer obtainable or within
                  reach. It indicates a feeling of disconnection from life and society.
                  This dream may be a calling for you to move on and abandon your
                  outdated modes of thinking and behavior.</span></span></p>

              Your space is being crowded into and you feel like you are being
              suffocated. The prickly spines of the cactus represents your wish to
              establish a boundary of your personal space and privacy. Perhaps you
              have found yourself in a sticky situation. Alternatively, a cactus may
              be symbolic of your need to defend yourself in some way. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;">To see a cactus in your dream can also signify your need to adapt your existing circumstances instead of trying to change them.</span></p>

              desperation in trying to escape a repetitive situation or behavior
              patters. You need to free yourself of this repetition and the corridor
              is seen as a passage from one phase in your life to another. </span></p>

              may attempt. Darkness is synonymous with the ignorance, unconscious,
              evil, death, and fear of the unknown. You will overcome your failure if
              the sun breaks through the darkness. </span></p>

              dream that you cannot find someone in the darkness, signifies that you
              need to keep your temper in check. You have the tendency to let your
              emotions get out of control and lose your temper.</span></p>

              dream that you are looking out the window, signifies your outlook on
              life, your consciousness, point of view, awareness, and intuition. You
              may be reflecting on a decision and seeking guidance. Or you need to go
              out into the larger world and experience life. </span></p>

              anxiety about a current project or task. The dream may also be telling
              you that you need to "get back to work".ï¿½ Perhaps you have been
              slacking and need to pick up the pace. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;">To
              dream that you are at your former or past work, suggests that there is
              an old lesson that you need to learn and apply to your current
              situation.</span></p>

              Alternatively, it may suggest anxieties about a current task or
              project. You may need to "get back to work" and stop procrastinating.</span></p>
