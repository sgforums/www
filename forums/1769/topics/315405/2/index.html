              <p>The past few nights I kept having nightmares and then waking up at about 3am, repeating the details to myself, saying I ought to remember the dreams for interpretation in the morning, and then promptly forgot the dreams afterwards!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>I think I had two nightmares last night.  Oddly enough, I can't quite remember the first one because I woke up again at about 3am and whilst I could remember it then, I can't recall it now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>The 2nd nightmare : I dreamt that a few friends and I were at this community fair and somehow, I ended up in the fire engine contingent!  We had to manoeuvre the huge fire truck out of a crammed parking lot and I think we escaped a few narrow scrapes where head-on collisions almost occured!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  Then, we had to sit on a metal platform as it is raised up to more than 20 storeys high and climb down the ladder!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Our legs all went soft and we were all shivering in fright at the top cause the winds were strong and we felt very vulnerable and exposed up there with just skimpy steel rails around the platform!  The wind blasted at us and we could feel the platform shaking and all and several times, we thought we'd crash to the ground and die! </p>
              <p>Finally, I rallied my mates and myself to start the descent because we couldn't stay up there forever, in case the strong winds blew our platform off!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  So with very shaky legs, we started the long climb down the ladder!!  EEEeeeeeeeee... everything was so shaky!!!  For some strange reason, instead of climbing down facing the rungs of the ladder, I climbed down facing outwards!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  I was soooo scared of falling all the way down, I woke up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              if you are climbing down a ladder, suggests that you are escaping from
              your spiritual responsibilities. It is an indication of much
              disappointments.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Fire Engine / Fire Truck </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>   To see a fire engine in your dream, suggests that you are tending to
              the needs of others and overlooking your own needs. You also worry and
              stress out in situations that are sometimes beyond your control. Stop
              trying to be in the middle of everying and stop trying to fix things.
              Use more discretion.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Height </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>   To dream that you are at a great height, signifies that you have reached one of your highest goals or objectives.  </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;">To dream that you are afraid of heights, denotes that you are striving for goals that seem beyond your reach. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sigh... no respite even in sleep!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png">  I think I'm going crazy...</p>

              <p>OH gosh... yesterday at my workplace, I went to another ward and saw a small aquarium with a cute li'l lone goldfish peeking out at me from amongst the aquatic plants...</p>
              <p>And then I dreamt that I was in a beautiful street in a place that looked like England or Europe.  Walking down the lane towards an aquarium when a fire warning was sounded!  I hopped into a shop, got four packets of 'fire retardant powders', and sprinkled it all over the street! </p>
              <p>Crossed the road, sprinkled it on the other side of the road.  Started to wonder how the powder worked, read the instructions, realised that the powder will transform into snails when it comes into contact with water / air!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  Somehow, the snails fight fire!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>I watched the powder transform into snails in a longkang.  Also saw a goldfish, two catfishes, and a stingray in the longkang. </p>
              <p>Went into the aquarium.  Tried to look for a nice-sized tank for myself but couldn't.  The fishes, even the 'normal' ones, were expensive.  I saw a 'Tarantula Fish' that was bright green + turquoise + orange etc!!  It was a brightly coloured exotic tarantula that lived in water!  Somehow, the owner got me a net and told me to fish one out, and I struggled to keep it in the net because it kept trying to crawl out!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  I screamed and yelled until the owner finally took over the net!  Eeeeee-yerh!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>There were 'aquatic Pacman frogs' too that looked like they  had an armour of golden 'plastic' over them.  They were swimming in a full tank of water, which was pretty unusual...</p>
              <p>Ended up not buying anything.  Went into an old old building where they were training student nurses.  Went into a 'mock ICU' which turned out to be a REAL ICU!  Saw some funny boxy equipment, latest technology or something, that was a high-tech mechanical ventilator.  Ooh'd and aah'd over it.  Looked over to examine the patient being kept alive by it. </p>
              <p>Then, entered a classroom of nursing students.  All tried to learn something from me but then their tutor entered the room, and they left to dress up for a Chingay Procession, gathering outside a Temple beside the old building!</p>
              <p>So I entered the restroom and found that the first cubicle was sealed off because there was a huge hole in the floor and you can see floors down through it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>The next two cubicles were 'normal' old squat toilets but the last one had firemen gear and uniform chucked into the toilet!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> and a huge window was on the wall beside it looking out into a rural scene with fireman cordone tapes hanging all over, blowing in the wind! </p>
              <p>Weird... just weird... and with that, I leave the interpretation for later when I'm back from work!</p>
