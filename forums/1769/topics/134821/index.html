He became my hero for months afterwards!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>My current home is a rented apartment, on the top (3rd) storey, it looks rather English, and has a small pond with koi / goldfish and running water.  The sound of the running water is really soothing too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I love my current place cos the neighbours are friendly and considerate.<br><br></div>

We had 'factions' back then and I remember one year, we were envious of the larger and nicer cellophane lanterns the kids in the other 'faction' had... and how we giggled madly when they bumped into each other and their lanterns got burnt to a wicked black crisp!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>In fact, I laughed so hard that day, I started to turn round and round, throwing my head up, guffawing... and... next thing I knew, I was down on the floor, with grandma yelling some Hokkien expletives and rubbing my forehead with the bottom of her slipper!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Apparently, in my giddy glee, I had walked right smack into the silver gate and sustained a 'bua-doo-ku' (contusion) on my forehead, and it was old wives' tale that if you immediately rubbed a bua-doo-ku with the bottom of your shoe, all would be well.<br><br>I remember yowling out in pain, not so much from the bua-doo-ku but from the dirt on my grandma's slipper being rubbed with great friction against my forehead!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   Oddly enough, back in those days, kids don't succumb to illnesses and infections as easily as they seem to do nowadays.

            <div class='col-md body'>The '70's was a period when neighbours interacted with each other and enjoyed a sense of comaraderie and helped to watch out for each other.<br><br>If grandma ran out of sugar, she just had to walk over to any neighbour living on the same floor and 'borrow' a cup of it, then 'return' the sugar when she bought it.<br><br>Groceries were bought by calling 'Ah Teck' and ordering via the phone and a few hours later, 'Ah Teck' would come with the groceries in a box being wheeled on his squeaky thingy.  (eh... pai seh... suddenly just cannot recall what those things are called!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Hearing grandma call 'Ah Teck' on the phone always made my day because sometimes, she would include a pack or two of 'Koka' crispy snacks or Twisties for me!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   Or if I was really really good that day, there'll be a lollipop!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Soft drinks were sold in glass bottles then.  After drinking, the glass bottles would be left in the carton by a corner of the kitchen for 'Ah Teck' to come and collect for recycling.  Sometimes, I'd wake up and find a cockroach inside the bottle, fatally attracted by the sweet syrupy smells and then had fallen inside the smooth bottle in its attempt to get some of the sweet nectar!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Grandpa would occasionally bring home a huge bag of cockles and then the special yellow metal basin would be brought out where they made a huge din when being emptied into it.  I would continue the symphony by grabbing a spoon and shovelling them around, causing grandma to yell at me to stop the noise!  Well, I'd then sit there and stop... for a short while of course, before the lure of the orchestra got overwhelmed me again!  hehehe!<br><br>In those days, if you wanted to eat chicken, you had to bring home a live one!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  On special occasions, grandma would return from the market with a live chicken tucked under her armpit and it would then be tied in the bathroom where it'll be my reluctant playmate for a while as I sat there trying to 'make friends' with it then run yelling when it made sudden movements at me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Yeah, I got 'hen-pecked' a lot then!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Thank God Grandpa would always bring me into the bedroom to play when grandma went into the bathroom to slaughter the chicken.  I never got to see the awful process.  PHEW!  I also never got to associate the missing chicken with the plate of nice steamed 'bai zhan ji' grandma would place on the altar table as offering to the gods and descendants before taking it to the dinner table.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Sweet innocence of youth!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Once, I was fascinated by how they would fold in like an accordion and pushed the gates in and out, in and out, in wonder, and didnt' realise the din I was creating... until a groggy grandma, roused from her afternoon nap by my antics, came over and promptly slapped me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Even back then, I was interested in details!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
