            <div class='col-md body'>One of my kids is really cute. I take her everywhere and all my colleagues gush over her, want to carry her. She has a bit of behavioural issues though.... and.. Hmm.. sometimes I know discipline her less strictly than I should cos... well.. she's cute....<br><br>(sigh. since people seem distracted by this part of it, let me edit it)<br><br>whenever I see people gushing over cute kids, treating them specially cos well, they are cute. PUnishing them less, praising them more... and I wonder, what's going to happen when they grow up... not cute enough. Not pretty enough. Not popular enough.  One of my friend has a daughter who is really very pretty. She told ALL of us to NEVER compliment her on her looks. She said its enough. (her problem is boys in her primary 1 class giving her daughter money during recess. Her daughter is 7).<br><br>Oh Well. My little kid been putting her feet up at the desk during class. Repeated reminders all day but she isnt stopping. It's a heartache to punish her today, and I guess I am as susceptible to cuteness as everyone else. But guess bobian. need to try and be stricter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no i can't of course... and it is a fact of life that better looking people get treated better. But I am just saying, a lot of kids I know grow up having issues cos people around constantly gush about them when they are young. But they suddenly realise they are not the centre of attention when they grow up. Those who grow up with less attention actually can handle adolescence better too. This is what I observe from working with kids and teenagers.</div>
