            <div class='col-md body'>I've been there quite a few times (like almost every year nowadays), but there were always people bringing me around and paying for me, so I can't give you any advice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Basically:<br><br>- People are friendly and casual, without much of that white supremacy attitude (they're not really white anyway, but more latino), but watch your belongings....especially in the Vatican itself.<br><br>- Things are reasonably expensive, but not that unaffordable.  Some cheaper than here, some 'expensiver' than here.  Hotels are quite expensive, even boutique hotels in the countryside.  Pizza is S$10-20 each.  Coffee is S$1-2 per 'shot' (they don't drink what they call "American coffee" in a normal cup, which is what we get in hotels here).<br><br>- Branded goods are cheap.  Florence is great for leather.<br><br>- When out of the city area, get used to some people staring at you.<br><br>- If you like big bazookas, watch free-to-air TV everynight after 10:30 pm.<br><br>- If budget is a problem, avoid Venice at all cost.<br><br>- Get ready to eat pasta pasta pasta, cheese cheese cheese, olive oil olive oil olive oil.....hardly anything else.  Not a good place for health freaks.  Pasta is eaten as the dish before the main course (and that leaves most of us hardly any space for the main course).<br><br>- They are like Asians, very formal with hierachy systems.  So when addressing a group of people, always greet the most senior first.  Also, if someone buys you a meal, you have to finish everything - from appetizer to antipasti to main course to dessert to wine.<br><br>- Their timing is like Asian timing at wedding dinners.  So when they say meet at 3 pm.....feel free to go to 3:30 pm.  Chances are they'll not be there yet.<br><br>- When in Rome, do like the Romans do.  Learn a few clean curse words....like FUNKULO!  Means bullshit.  And learn also to gesture with your hands a lot when talking.<br><br>- Oh, just like anywhere else in Europe, get ready to be checked like hell upon entry at the airport (if you're Asian).  Unlike Germany, the Italians will also check other people...and not only Asians.  They sometimes have undercover cops at the airport, wearing round-necked t-shirts and jeans who will pick you out.  They're not that inflexible though....whatever they ask you, just speak English for a long time, very quickly....and they'll give up and let you pass (trust me, I know from experience when I was caught with 3 new handphones going into Rome <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Presents for my friends lah).<br><br>- Don't take taxis, unless you have a big budget.  At 6 am, a 30 minute taxi ride could cost a shocking EUR 110!<br><br>- If you smoke, I have bad news for you.  Italy's anti-smoking laws are much stricter than here.  You can only smoke at home, or on the streets.  No where else.<br><br>If I make a trip this end of year to Rome, and if you happen to be there too, lets meet up.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm Trevis Fountain and Coliseum in Rome is a must visit. There is some legend in throwing of coins into the Trevis Fountain involving your romance...throw one coin = something..throw two coin is something hahah i forgot, please ask the local guide. Coliseum need to pay to get in, u can take photo with the roman guards who are of cos extras lah haha. Vatican City is fast lah...its very small nia, so take all the photos you can while you are there.<br><br>As for Florence, called Firenze, over there, i dun remember much of it except for a very nice long river and also a very nice art gallery or museum.... there is also a place where u can get a bird's eye view..... Its a pity I cannot remember all the names of the places I visit, but when i look at the photos, it brings back good memories.....Florence also got alot of migrants selling fake paintings...mind you, some of them are as good as the original..they are sold ranging from a few Euros up to 15 Euros.<br><br>I also went to Venice and Pisa, Pisa was really nothing except the Leaning Tower and Venice is really an experience....I took the gondola ride in the river or canals and u i tell you its really DIRTY!! it smells too and as u ride along, u will see rats jumping into canal from the backlanes of the buildings hahahaha.....<br><br>Oh ya in Italy, u also have to be beware of your belongings. Dun talk to strangers and be careful of a group of people called the gypsies. They always hang around crowded places and sometimes even used their children to steal things from you. My fren kena when in Rome. In Venice, dun anyhow take the gondolas, ask the local guide for trusted ones. they say that the Mafia is very active in Venice..and some of the gondolas are targetting tourists who seems rich...dun know how true...<br><br>Take your own photos or you can buy cheap postcards from there...one whole stack for 2 Euros. Lotsa of souvenirs to buy...people hardly bargain there...but knowing true blue singaporeans...you can try but please dun think that is bangkok...the vendors have alot of pride.... I give you example ah...the Gondola costs us 25 Euros each and when we finish, my fren wanted to go another round...so she ask, are there any discount? The gonodla boat man, look at her and laugh, he points to his own shoe and say, real leather, 300 euros, also no discount...25 euros you want discount?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
