              <p class="MsoNormal">..... for Make Benefit Glorious Forum of Club 30!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I recently went to Istanbul, Turkey for my honeymoon two days after
              my wedding.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">We took Emirates since it was the cheapest option at
              $1067/pax. The next cheapest was Qatar Airways at $1250/pax. Unfortunately the
              low cost came at a price: we had to transit twice at Colombo (for 8 hours) and
              Dubai (for two hours).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, we eventually reached Istanbul and the safety of our
              hotel, Hotel Mina. Hotel Mina is just a small boutique hotel in a side street
              with just forty rooms. The main downside of it is that the rooms are pretty
              small.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">But that said, location-wise, it’s brilliant. Most of the
              main attractions are within a 500 meter radius of the hotel. And the way we saw
              it, we were going to spend a lot more time out of the room than in the room
              anyway.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Kapali Carsi (Grand Bazaar)</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The Grand Bazaar, opened in the year 1461, is one of the
              oldest covered bazaars in the world. At over 4000 shops, it is also the world’s
              largest.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This is no ordinary pasar malam. For one thing, it’s open
              only during the day. The other is that it has its own gates and its own roofs.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0080.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">One of the gates of the Grand Bazaar</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There is an amazing array of things here that can be bought,
              from Turkish carpets to jewellery to leather products to prized Iznik tiles and
              so on. It has its own police station and mosque in the middle of the bazaar.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">For shameless bargainers, this place is paradise. If you are
              willing to bargain hard, it is not difficult to bring the price down by a large
              amount. For example, we brought down the price of a traditional Turkish large
              tablespread from 250 Turkish liras to 110 TL before buying it (1 TL ~ SGD 0.85).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0079.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">One of the streets in the Bazaar</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Note that you are under no obligation to buy if you don’t
              want to. The shopkeeper may tornado his own shop and even offer you tea (and we
              drank it) and he will not hold a grudge against you if you don’t buy anything.
              However, once you offer a price that the shopkeeper accepts, it would be rude
              to change your mind and not buy it.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">A view of the mosque from Hagia Sophia</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This mosque was built in 1616 by Sultan Ahmed I as a means
                      of penance after an ill-advised war with Persia. It is built next to the
                      Byzantine Hippodrome opposite the Hagia Sophia.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At the time it was built, this was one of the grandest
                      mosques in the world, with six minarets. Legend has it that the sultan was
                      criticized for being too presumptuous since the Grand Mosque in Mecca also had
                      six minarets, and so he built a seventh minaret at the Grand Mosque.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0101-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The mosque courtyard. That little structure in the foreground is a fountain for ablutions.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The mosque itself isn’t really all that blue-ey. It was
                      nicknamed the Blue Mosque because of the predominantly blue Iznik tiles that
                      were used to decorate the interior of the dome.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">It is still being used as a mosque. While visitors are
                      allowed, everyone must take their shoes off and refrain from visiting during
                      the five daily prayers (and especially during the Friday prayers).</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">The Hagia Sophia ('Holy Wisdom' in Greek) was originally a cathedral dating from the
                      4<sup>th</sup> century AD. It was repeatedly burnt down and rebuilt over the
                      centuries. After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 AD, it was
                      converted into a mosque.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In 1935, after the abolition of the sultanate and
                      subsequently the caliphate, the building was converted into a museum. It
                      required extensive refurbishment works to stabilize the structure and improve
                      its interior into its present form.</p>

              <p><strong>Topkapi Sarayi (Topkapi Palace)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Topkapi Palace is the medieval palace used by most of the Ottoman sultans between 1456 and 1856. This was the primary palace used until they moved out to the more European-style Dolmabahce Palace in the late 1800s.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Topkapi Palace is not one single building of its own, but rather, it is a complex of several buildings. It holds some of the most sacred relics in Islam (including Prophet Muhammad's cloak and sword). Too bad photographs couldn't be taken in those rooms.</p>

              <p><strong>Topkapi Palace Imperial Harem</strong></p>
              <p>The Imperial Harem is what it sounds like: the section of the palace where
                      the sultan's wives and concubines all live in, along with the Valide Sultan
                      (Queen Mother) and the eunuchs.</p>

              <p>Interestingly enough, the Queen Mother is in
                      charge of the harem, which means that she's effectively in charge of all the
                      women her son gets to bonk.</p>

              <p>Despite its name, this mosque was actually built in 1597. Construction was painstakingly slow due to political infighting and intrigue - it was only finally finished in 1663 and inaugurated in 1665.</p>
              <p>This mosque is located at Eminonu on the southern shore of the Golden Horn.</p>

              <p><strong>Galata Bridge</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0636.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>A short distance away from the Spice Bazaar, the Galata Bridge is a simple low-level bridge bridging the districts of Galata and Eminonu across the Golden Horn. Symbolically, it is the link between the Old City of Istanbul and the districts where many non-Muslims lived in the Ottoman era, making it a bridge between cultures.</p>
              <p>The first thing you notice about this bridge is the many, many fishermen who fish at the docks on the sides of the bridge.....</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0094.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>..... and on the bridge itself.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0120-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another thing you will notice is that they catch a LOT of fish, considering that they're using fishing rods.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0116.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>All this was caught by those two guys in jeans. Using fishing rods.</p>
              <p>Also, you get to see street vendors selling mussels.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0287.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>You tell the vendor how many mussels you want, and he will open it for you. You will eat it on the spot. Needless to say, I didn't dare try it, because I don't know for how long the mussels have been there.</p>
              <p>One thing unique to the Eminonu side of the bridge is the traditional Istanbul fish sandwich - the Balik Ekmek. Literally meaning 'fish in bread', it was thought up by fishermen who had the brilliant idea of selling the fish they caught by cooking it right there in the boat itself.</p>
              <p>The fishermen would catch the fish, fillet it, grill it, and stuff it into half a loaf of bread with onions and salad - all on the boat itself. You can take it to be the Ramly Burger of this area.</p>
              <p>Now regulations prohibit fishing boats from selling food (out of hygiene concerns)..... but hey, they still have floating boats where the Balik Ekmek restaurants would do the grilling.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0307.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>They grill the fish on the boat (right), pass it to the waiter on the dock (center), who will then pass it to the customers in the eating area (left).</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v241/fudgester/DSC_0348.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>One of the waiters was thrilled to learn that I was from Singapore, and <em>insisted</em> that I take a photo with him....</p>
              <p>It's just a grilled fish sandwich, but trust me, you'll never taste a fresher grilled fish in your entire life.</p>

              <p><strong>Galata Kulesi (Galata Tower)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a tall medieval stone tower (supposedly) a short walk from the Galata bridge. Unfortunately, you have to go through a maze of alleyways (all uphill) in order to get to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/7216/dsc0282c.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Also known as the <em>Christea Turris</em> (The Tower of Christ) in Latin by the Genoese. This is a stone tower built in the district of Galata in 1348. In that time Galata was a colony mostly settled by Genoese tradesmen and their families.   </p>
              <p>It was initially used as an observation tower for the Galata defensive fortifications during the Byzantine era. In the Ottoman period, it became used as a fire observation tower, given how it has such a commanding view of the city.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/8000/dsc0180p.jpg" alt=""></p>
