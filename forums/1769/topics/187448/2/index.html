My relatives.<br><br>As I grow old each year, I begin to feel more distant from my relatives, not because we not close each other, somehow I cant feel I'm very clickable with them.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm pretty close to a couple of my maternal cousins, one of whom is residing in Australia now. The others are either pretty old and have their own lives to run even at family gatherings, or are still loud-mouthed and childish even though they are in secondary school now.<br><br>Most of my paternal cousins are much older than me, so I don't stay in touch with them except at gatherings for that side of the family.<br><br>Among my grandparents, I'm closest to my mum's mother, because we spend the most time visiting her. We visited my mat. grandfather at Villa Francis about twice a week during the school holidays (together with my cousin and aunt before they emigrated) when he was still alive. Dad's mum passed away well before I was born, and his father visited us once in a blue moon until his passing...he was closer to the family he started after re-marrying.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think for the most of us... our parents have like.. more than 5 siblings or so... therefore, it's common for people to rant and rave about our aunts and uncles.. cuz we have so many relatives.<br><br>i know this might sound so cliche.. but i think we should treasure the people we have around us... i know some relatives can really be a pain in the ~~~ ... but these things actually make life sorta more... interesting.... no? you get a topic to talk about with friends and even here in sg forum!<br><br>fast-forward a few years later to what our grand-children or grand-grand-children would be discussing about... most of us today, have the most, two siblings. hence, the future generations wouldnt have that many relatives...<br>they probably wouldnt even understand this thread if they were to read it.. cuz they dont have those problematic relatives. sure.. maybe there would be mom's friends... or dad's friends... whom they will call uncle, auntie.... but it's different.<br><br>it would be like us not really getting why our parents always say "noodles were just 5 cents per bowl..." (ok, it's a bit different... but you guys get what i mean yea? haha)<br><br>just a random thought anyways...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
