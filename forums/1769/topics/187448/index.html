With some of my friends who are very close to their cousins, very often their parents are also very close. My father was pretty much estranged from him family for many years, and only in the past decade I think, closed the gap with some of them. I still remember snide comments made by them during my dad's struggling years. It is hard to forgive at times.<br><br>In the few recent years, there have been a couple of tragedies in my maternal family. Times like this, even though we try to be there to give support, can't help wondering what went wrong with the whole family. It was horrible being there, but unable to reach out because of the unfamiliarity and hoping that despite that, they know that my heart is with them.<br><br>Actually maybe cos I am cancerian <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I wish that the extended family is closer than it is. But after the couple of tragedies, I can feel the bond trying to grow closer. But you know the closer you are, the more their problems become yours too, and I can also sense the reluctance. Sigh. Oh well!</div>
