            <div class='col-md body'>What do you think about this? Agree/Disagree?<br><br>==================================<br><br>They say opposites attract, blondes have more fun, and some relationships end because of a seven year itch. We asked a gender expert to test the myths.<br><br>Author, medical doctor and relationship professional, Dr Cindy Pan examined the top ten facts and misconceptions about relationships, gender and being lucky in love.<br><br>1. Short men are romantically disadvantaged: myth<br>"There is no real rhyme or reason why that should be so," Dr Pan said. "Any more than that the man should be older, or more successful, or earn more money.<br><br>"These are sort of supposedly societal norms, but there's nothing abnormal about it or abnormal about the converse, so I think it's a myth."<br><br>2. Blondes have more fun: myth<br>"Definitely a myth," Dr Pan said. "I think it comes from this idea that blondes are dumb, and that's not true."<br><br>"There's certainly no real genetic link between blonde colouring and having a happier outlook or being more hedonistic. That's definitely not true."<br><br>3. The seven year itch: myth<br>"If there is such a thing as the seven year itch, then there is also such thing as a one, two, three, four, five and six year itch," Dr Pan said.<br><br>"The seven year itch is a myth, insofar as you can really get the itch any time before, at seven years and after seven years as well."<br><br>4. Women are naturally more faithful than men: myth<br>"Women and men are both capable of both fidelity and infidelity," Dr Pan said.<br>"It is believed that women's infidelities tend to be more based on looking for emotional intimacy and romance, and men's infidelity tends to be more related to having sex."<br><br>5. Opposites attract: fact<br>"It probably is true to a certain degree that opposites do attract, in the sense that you admire or respect something re the other person that you don't personally have yourself," Dr Pan said. "And one of the crucial things in being able to maintain a relationship in the long term is being able to respect the difference."<br><br>6. The way to a man's heart is through his stomach: myth<br>"I don't think that cooking skills are neccessarily the main issue on a man's mind when he wants to date a woman," Dr Pan laughed.<br><br>7. Men are afraid of commitment<br>"I don't think men are necessarily afraid of commitment," Dr Pan said. "I think that when a man feels he's found the right person, that he can be just as committed, just as intent on establishing a firm, lasting relationship."<br><br>8. Absence makes the heart grow fonder: fact<br>"I think that in some cases, absence can make the heart grow fonder and that to be separated from that person you yearn for them," Dr Pan said. "So yes absence can make the heart grow fonder."<br><br>9. The grass is always greener on the other side: myth<br>"I don't think there's any truth to this idea that the grass is always greener on the other side," Dr Pan said. "At any one time, the grass in your patch might be a bit dry and sparse, but it doesn't mean you can't do something to make it greener."<br><br>"The issue is to own your patch of grass and do what you can to fertilise it or water it, or take care of it and not always be looking at other people's grass," Dr Pan laughed.<br><br>10. Once a cheat, always a cheat: myth<br>"Some people are serial cheaters," Dr Pan said. "And certainly if a man, for example, has what they call 'Don Juanism' Â– sexually compulsive, addicted to having one-night stands and this sort of thing Â– then they probably will keep going in that fashion. Unless they have some sort of treatment intervention and commit to change."<br><br>"But I think just in general, when it comes to cheating, if people can admit to what they're doing, feel remorse and commit to changing behaviour, then definitely there is hope they won't always be cheaters."<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Dr Cindy Pan's book about health, sex, drugs and relationships in the 21st century is called Pandora's Box, RRP $23.95, ISBN 0732264316.

            <div class='col-md body'>Re point number 7,<br>I don't think men are necessarily afraid of committment, but rather we are not designed to commit to single relationship.<br><br>It is part of our (human species') survival strategy developed over millions of years.<br><br>Consider this: The primary objective of any species is to survive and propagate (definition of living things) and in other words, passing on our genes on to the next generation.<br><br>Over the course of evolution, different species have develop different strategies to survive.  And for ours, the rate limiting step of human birth is in the gestation of the foetus.  Thus an effective strategy for homo sapiens to propagate their genes is for a male to impregnate as many females would mate with him.  His success would, of course, be defined by his "fitness".<br><br>Thus I pose to all the following:-<br>If men are not design to be monogamous,<br>Monogamy is therefore invented by women.<br><br></div>
