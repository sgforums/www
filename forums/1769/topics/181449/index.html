            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: #8B1A1A;"><br>"Health Benefits of Red Wines: One to Two Glasses a Day<br><br>Plato may have been wiser than he knew when he said, "Nothing more excellent or valuable than wine was ever granted by the Gods to man." Those of us who have come to enjoy the variety and tastes that wine have to offer can now look to red wines for greater health benefits. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recent studies show that drinking one glass of red wine every day may have certain health benefits. Research indicates that moderate red wine consumption may help protect against certain cancers and heart disease, and can have a positive effect on cholesterol levels and blood pressure.</span><br><br>The French Paradox<br><br>The French seem to know something about the health benefits of red wine. In a study that compared French and German red wines, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the French red wines delivered a greater health benefit due to their higher level of antioxidants</span>. This may partially account for the "French paradox," where studies show that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in areas of France where the diet is high in fat those who drink red wine with meals have a lower incidence of heart attack than other parts of the world</span>. Due to vast differences in diets, the evidence is inconclusive, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">experts believe that red wine contains certain compounds that help protect the heart</span>. This has opened the door for other researchers to study the components in red wine that may be responsible for its health benefits.<br><br>Moderation is Key<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The key to reaping the health benefits of red wine seems to be moderate consumption. Drinking one glass a day for women and up to two glasses a day for men may decrease the risk of heart disease, cancer and stroke. Excessive or binge drinking, however, doesn't produce the same benefits. In other words, when it comes to red wine: more is not better. </span><br><br>Healing Powers of Antioxidants<br><br>The compounds found in red wine that are responsible for its healing powers are antioxidants. Red wines contain several antioxidants beneficial to good health. Different antioxidants have different functions, but the key feature of all these antioxidants appears to be one of protection and prevention of disease.<br></span><br><br>Source : <a href="http://www.red-wine-and-health.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.red-wine-and-health.com/</a></div>

"I did, I'm still living."<br><br>Goguen celebrated her 100th birthday Monday, and joked that she enjoyed a beer now and then while she and her late husband, Jack, owned the Blue Moon, a restaurant in Leominster.<br><br>But her husband never drank, she said.<br><br>"It was nice, we had a good business. We sold beer," she said. "We sold beer over the counter for years, and he never drank any of it."<br><br>Birthday cards, posters and balloons crowded the area around Goguen's bed in the Keystone Center, where she has lived for about five years.<br><br>About 30 friends and family members went to the nursing home Sunday for a party in her honor.<br><br>"There were flowers all over," she said. "We had fun."<br><br>Irene Belrose, who lived near Goguen in the high rise apartments at 161 Spruce St. about a decade ago, said she wishes Goguen a happy 100th birthday.<br><br>"Well, enjoy life," Belrose said. 'If it's the beer, the laughter, whatever. You take one step in front of the other, and it's about not being afraid of your age."<br><br>Born March 6, 1906, Goguen was one of 12 children. Her father died at the age of 39, and her mother did odd jobs to support the family.<br><br>"She cleaned and ironed," she said. "We helped her out."<br><br>The family lived at 177 Sixth St., she said. She attended school in the St. Cecilia parish until she was 14, then left to help support her siblings and mother.<br><br>"I had to find some money so we could eat," she said.<br><br>Goguen worked her first job at a second-hand store on Whitney Street, she said.<br><br>"We went and took the rubbish someone threw out," she said. "Then we turned it into what people wanted to buy."<br><br>Her niece, Theresa Hakala, said Goguen stayed healthy by being busy and maintaining a positive attitude.<br><br>"She walked everywhere, and she was always working. Even after she retired, she had part-time jobs," Hakala, a Lunenburg resident, said. "And she's always happy."<br><br>Goguen has a feisty sense of humor and erupted in fits of giggles several times during an interview Monday, especially when she talked about getting into trouble with her siblings.<br><br>Ask her about the biggest changes in Leominster during the last century, and she can't think of anything.<br><br>But ask her about how she acquired the Leominster Enterprise as a girl and her eyes light up.<br><br>"My mother would give me the money for the Enterprise, and I would go steal it from the neighbor, and keep the money" she said. "He would say, 'It was out there this morning,' but the morning was long gone."<br><br>Goguen remembers conspiring with her siblings to use the family's limited grocery supply to make fudge when their mother left the house.<br><br>"We had a lot of fun," she said. "My mother went out of town and told us not to touch anything. We waited until we heard the door close, and we got started right away because we knew we didn't have a lot of time."<br><br>Goguen remembers her wedding anniversary - May 30 - but not the year of her wedding. It was sometime in the 1920s, she said.<br><br>She and and her husband were married more than 60 years when he became sick and died. The couple did not have children, but they had a large extended family and enjoyed traveling to California, Florida and Europe, she said.<br><br>Jack was the best part of the last century, she said.<br><br>Goguen, who had "the nicest voice" among her siblings, sang the 1918 ballad "Till We Meet Again" from memory Monday morning.<br><br>She remembers the lyrics to the song about a fallen World War I soldier from her childhood.<br><br>"So wait and pray each night for me, till we meet again," she sang.<br><br>After the song, Goguen, who has outlived her husband and 11 siblings, said: "That's it, I guess. That's the story of my life."<br><br>(source: <a href="http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/local/ci_3577765" rel="nofollow">Sentinel and Enterprise</a>)<br></div>
