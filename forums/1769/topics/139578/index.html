            <div class='col-md body'>I like the Freedom Tower.  Found something ironic though... they're building it with a 'safe' distance from the roads... BUT, they're building it much much taller than the surrounding buildings and it does stick out conspicuously, which was what the WTC did too, and we all know what happened to it.  And they didn't consider that when they were considering 'safety' factors?  So what if it's located a distance from the road?  Have they forgotten how the WTC was destroyed?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   I just found that a tad ironic.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And oh, today is a freedom day of sorts for me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
