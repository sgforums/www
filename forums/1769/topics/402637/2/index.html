              <p>You might remember the time I had to deal with a plagiarist in my term paper group a few years ago.</p>
              <p>My friends urged me to simply present the evidence to the prof and ruin the fella academically.... but I had a soft heart and just chose to confront the fella myself.</p>
              <p>How <em>that</em> turned out was like a soap opera.... hell, he went to the extent of going into sgforums, created a new nickname in my real name and proceeded to slur me online. I had to get Jason to throw that account out.</p>
              <p>Finally he woke up his ideas and apologize to me via PM.... I didn't bother replying to it. I wonder if he's intelligent enough to realize that I could file a lawsuit against him if I wanted.</p>

              <p>All the more reason for Fatum to go for broke..... what that agent did was a potentially career-ending move for both herself and Fatum.</p>
              <p>If there's one thing that plagiarism episode taught me, it is that if people really don't give a sh*t about you, you shouldn't bother giving a sh*t about them.</p>
