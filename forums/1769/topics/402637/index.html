              <p>actually, that's about what I did .... the tenants changed the
              locks at 1am last night and guess who's picking up the bill ?</p>
              <p>after I heard about this, I promptly went down in person to
              speak to the tenants yesterday evening, and left them my card,
              that's how the leasing agents got hold of me this mornning. I've
              also been working on the owner, who's been getting a shitstorm from
              the tenants side as well ........</p>
              <p>people cobroke all the time .... why this has got to happen to

              <p>Yeah.... buddy's wife or not, what she did was wrong, period.</p>
              <p>You gotta straight talk to your buddy that you're gonna file a formal complaint against his wife because what she did can get you into a career-ending sh*tstorm, and that police reports can be filed against her.</p>
              <p>And like everyone else said, yes, get back into the tenants' good books by offering them a hamper or something, and keep them posted about the formal action against the other agent. At least that will show them that you're genuinely trying to help them.</p>
