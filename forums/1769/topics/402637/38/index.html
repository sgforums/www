              <p>Then in a few years what, M1 also want streaming cable TV? Mio isn't all that great to begin with since it relies on your bandwidth.</p>

              <p>Stupid really. And it's not like more competition, and they bring in better goods. Singtel stole good channels away, only to support it with below-par broadcasting at a ridiculous price, only because you require higher broadband speeds to support it.</p>

              <p>And I couldn't believe my eyes when the PM said we cannot expect a flood-free Singapore. Come on, when was the last time we had flooding this frequent in the affected areas? My memories of "flooding" in the 15 years prior to that are of ankle-high water.</p>
