            <div class='col-md body'>I think I am really sick.<br><br>Am kinda slow to remember that Sat, while at the movies.<br><br>I've been shopping and going back to the cinema theatre again for the 2nd show.  I had walked along this driveway and the carpark next to me.<br><br>A fat young kid had run away from the cars and hiding behind a car near to where I walked.<br><br>Then I saw a teenager, about 16-18, carrying a gun, pointing 45 degrees downwards and some of his friends was shouting at him to put that thing away.<br><br>I figured its a airweapon, and sure enough, when I walked to teh fat kid and asked good naturedly, 'Is it a Airgun?'<br><br>The kid replied: "yes, but it sure hurts where the thing hits."<br><br>I good naturedly tells him: Well, you are w/o glasses, just make sure he dont get the pellets in your eyes.<br><br>Then I see that teenager finally stuffed that airgun into his waist and walking to his friends with his hands happily waving in the air and laughing at his friends.  I think his friends arent that amuse though.<br><br>I walked away still in good spirits and thinking it was child's play.<br><br>Somehow, only just now, then I feel outraged, that the teenager was properly using that airgun to torment/bully the other younger kids and I had a surge of feelings inside me, wishing that I actually has a real gun and had actually ordered that Bully to drop the weapon.<br><br>Then I think about the Virginia Univisity shooting, and I really regretted that I didnt react back then!  I could have at least called the police, have the police stopped these teenagers and make sure the parents are pulled up for questioning on letting their son get away with pointing a airgun at ANYBODY!<br><br>Something else flashed thru me and I really felt angry at myself, that I dont have a weapon on me.  If I did, that kid would have been brought down way before the police officers does, and it could serve a lesson on handling weapons.<br><br>Cos I KNEW. That airweapons can be deadly TOO!  AND I DIDNT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!</div>
