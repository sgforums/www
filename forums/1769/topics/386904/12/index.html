              <p><br>She replied:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"First, thanks to those who wished me happy birthday. Thanks as well to those who support the previous post. As for those who said kudos to the staff at OCBC, I agree with you. The staff reacted well enough, I think. Two of the ladies seemed quite amused. The third one just seemed a bit disinterested after performing her banking duties. I think the gentleman also saw the funny side of the incident. Our conversation basically revolved around whether there was a sufficient basis for the ad to be reenacted. As I said, if he had insisted I had a super cute daughter with me to get a cake, he would have won.<br><br>I don't know if the OCBC gentleman paid for the cake out of his own pocket but I've asked David Conner and Andrew Lee, respectively OCBC's group CEO and Senior EVP of Global Consumer Financial Services, to make sure he's reimbursed.<br><br>I'd like to point out that I didn't insist on getting a cake from OCBC, technically, at any point in time. I asked if I could get a cake. I was told no, I couldn't. Which was fine. I then asked why I couldn't get a cake. I was told it was because the commercial was just a commercial. Which was also fine. I then asked why OCBC had a commercial about giving away birthday cakes when it didn't have any birthday cakes to give away. If the staff had given me an acceptable explanation, I'd have walked away. Or if they hadn't given me an acceptable explanation (nor a cake), I would then ask OCBC's senior management for one. But I can't complain to the CEO straight away without giving the ground level staff a chance to show whether OCBC really gave their customers birthday cakes, right?<br><br>Some people say I got a cake from OCBC's employees, not OCBC, and that I shouldn't have tormented the staff when my target was the corporation. I'm sorry, this argument cuts no ice with me. The incident was during business hours, the staff were wearing OCBC's uniform, serving OCBC's customers on OCBC's banking premises. They were representing OCBC whether you or they like it or not. It's a tough job working in a banking hall but hey, whose job is easy, eh? Other than the President of Singapore? Sure, the frontline staff aren't responsible for the ad. They don't make as much as David Conner. But they know they're getting paid for being the conduit between retail customers and 'the bank', which they're a part of. Should they perform only mechanical tasks because they make only $x per month? Any unexpected incidents not listed in the training manual is none of their business? Come on! If they do that, they're no better than machines. And if they're no better than machines, they should be replaced by machines. And bank tellers have been, to some extent. The next wave of workers to be replaced will be those cashiers who mechanically scan, pack and collect the money. Cold Storage Great World City has a lane for those who prefer to scan, pack and swipe a bank card themselves. Such facilities are already quite common in the US.<br><br>I think it's a bit over dramatic to say I 'tormented' or (emotionally) 'maimed' the staff at OCBC, or spoilt their day or weekend. As for those who use the word 'misery', well, you have no idea what misery is. Misery is when you have stage 4 cancer. Misery is when your country's at war. Misery is when there's no rice in the house. Misery is when your dog's run over by a car. Misery is when you're homeless in a -10°C winter and you're five years old. A crazy customer making a crazy request? That's a nice distraction from the tedium of being a bank teller. Nevertheless, if I did really cause anyone at OCBC any distress, in any minor or major way, I apologise, unreservedly and sincerely. And I suggest you get out of the service industry. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. If you can't handle crazy customers, then don't handle customers for a living. Or you would have to face many more crazy ones and make yourself 'miserable'.<br><br>I've enjoyed reading the comments, even those that are are downright rude. I'm perverse, I know. (Hey! I think no one's used that word on me yet!) There's a diversity of views, which is not a bad thing. But there's one thing we all agree on: the cake's bloody awful!<br><br>Ok, over to you, guys. Fire away."</p>
