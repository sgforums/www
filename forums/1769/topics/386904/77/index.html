              <p>That's why I said that it's also partially my fault..... I assumed that all drivers are responsible people who will dilligently watch pedestrian crossings and give way to all pedestrians.....</p>
              <p>I sure would like to see nothing better than that aforementioned scenario involving the stray dogs and crows happening to such drivers....</p>

              <p>me and a guy friend was walking along singapore expo pedestian walkway and the roads are clear... (small lane by the expo).</p>
              <p>the 2 FT must cycle along the pavement (behind us) and rang their bells at us when we are walking... and shouted "give way".</p>
              <p>my guy friend who is 1.85m tall and big... grabbed hold of one of the guy bike by the handle and tell him on the face "if you want to cycle, CYCLE ON THE ROAD" and my friend refused to let go of the handle....</p>
              <p>the horrified FT apologized (his voice shaky) and quickly pushed his bike onto the proper road and quickly rode away..!</p>
              <p>i was amused... i shall do the same next time...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
