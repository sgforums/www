              <p>yes, however, there is a key difference between our "ali baba" model, and our northern neighbour's ....</p>
              <p>is that our retired soldiers go work for those GLCs, as employees, it's just like a retirement job for them, lower ranked ones and warrant officers end up being discipline masters in schools, it's the same thing .... those GLCs in turn are owned by our goverment, so the $50 profit is not really taxpayer's money, cos it becomes taxpayer's profit too ......</p>
              <p>whereas up north, the retired soldiers would form shell companies, pull a few strings, get a few fat contracts, and then proceed to fleece the goverment while subcontracting the meat out to the babas. Just look at their "speedpas" card for vehicular entry into malaysia, classic fat cat case ... </p>
