              <p>There are also folks who will act like nothing ever happened and it's business as usual with them. Others find the trespasses unforgivable and henceforth the friendship ceases to exist. </p>

              <p>Initially, when I'm really infuriated, I usually use the silent treatment, because I don't trust myself to say nice things when I'm angry.  However, I will rant and rave to my other friends about the situation and also to get a little pressure off from being wronged. </p>

              <p>I like how you segregate into close friends and normal friends.  However, sometimes, those who are closest to us have the ability to hurt us the most.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Not to split hairs, but "react" might be the wrong word to use, since you have the option of responding as well.</p>
              <p>My friends know well enough that I don't mince words.  I just call it as I see it, and if I do have a problem, I'll get to the point of what the problem is and why it doesn't sit well with me.</p>

              <p>heh, that was what i used to do - deleting and blocking people, erasing their numbers so there are zero channels even if i wind up itching to make contact.</p>
              <p>nowadays i feel that sometimes momentary anger and freak misunderstandings do happen, it doesn't hurt leaving doors slightly opened.</p>
              <p>as for drastic measures to avoid contact, me thinks it reflects some kind of insecurity. just my two cents worth.</p>

              <p><br>after trying to talk things over first? if so then fine.</p>
              <p>if not, then that's very childish and petty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, I try to talk first....so even if things don't work out I know I've tried. And I try to avoid the whole yelling/shouting match routine.</p>

              <p>I might confront. I'm not the kind that take things lying down, esp if the issue deserve to be addressed. However, i'm also the type that is quite emotionally stable so i trust myself to act with reasonable constraint during the talk out.</p>
