            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe the fur has something toxic.<br><br>Cats are are known to cause toxoplasmosis.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is toxoplasmosis?</span><br>Toxoplasmosis is a common disease found in birds and mammals across North America. The infection is caused by a parasite called toxoplasma gondi and affects 10 to 20 out of every 100 people in North America by the time they are adults.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the symptoms?</span><br>Fever<br>Sore throat<br>Sore muscles and tiredness<br>Swollen glands in the neck, armpits or groin<br>In some cases the infection can also cause temporary blurred vision or loss of vision<br>Most people who are infected do not show any signs of the disease.<br>Persons who are pregnant or are experiencing a suppressed immune system due to AIDS, cancer or following organ transplants are at higher risk for illness.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How is it spread?</span><br>All animals and birds can be infected with the toxoplasmosis parasite. The parasite enters the muscles of a bird or animal when it eats raw meat or drinks the milk of another animal that is infected. Cats can also spread the parasite in their feces. Therefore humans can also become infected with toxoplasmosis when changing a cat litter box or working in an area contaminated with cat feces.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common ways for people to become infected with toxoplasmosis include:</span><br>eating raw or undercooked meats;<br>drinking unpasteurized milk;<br>cleaning cat litter boxes;<br>working in gardens or playing in sandboxes that contain cat feces.<br>Pregnancy and toxoplasmosis<br><br>A growing fetus can become infected with the toxoplasmosis parasite. This can happen if the mother is infected with the parasite while pregnant or before she becomes pregnant. Infection in the unborn child early in pregnancy can result in miscarriage, poor growth, early delivery or stillbirth. If a child is born with toxoplasmosis he/she can experience eye problems, hydrocephalus (water on the brain), convulsions or mental disabilities.<br><br>Treatment of an infected pregnant woman may prevent or lessen the disease in her unborn child. Treatment of an infected infant will also lessen the severity of the disease as the child grows.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prevention</span><br>Order or cook your meat well done.<br>Do not eat raw or undercooked meat.<br>Wash your hands, utensils, and cutting boards after handling raw meat to prevent contamination of other foods.<br>Do not drink unpasteurized milk from any animal.<br>Be careful not to breathe in dust when cleaning the cat litter box.<br>Clean the litter box daily so that the parasite does not have a chance to become infectious.<br>Avoid cleaning cat litter boxes if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.<br>Wear gloves when cleaning the cat litter box, then wash your hands.<br>Place a secure lid on your sandbox to prevent cats from using it as a litter box.<br>Wear gloves when gardening, then wash your hands.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cats and you</span><br>Just like other family members, your pet cat can pass disease on to you. Most cats which are infected do not appear sick. The cat's feces contain the parasite for only two weeks after the cat is infected. However, the feces themselves may remain infectious for well over a year. Most cases of toxoplasmosis do not originate from contact with cats, but rather from consumption of raw meat.<br><br>Cats which have been raised indoors, have never caught and eaten mice or birds, and who have never been fed raw meat are not likely to be infected. A stray or unfamiliar cat which appears sick should not be handled but should be reported to your local Animal Control Officer.<br><br>Here are some tips to help you continue to enjoy your pet cat.<br><br>wash your hands after patting, brushing or being licked by your cat;<br>clean out the litter box every day;<br>dispose of cat feces in a plastic bag in the garbage;<br>do not compost the cat litter, or dispose of the litter near your garden;<br>see a veterinarian if there are any signs of illness in your cat;<br>don't feed raw meat to your cat.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is there a treatment for toxoplasmosis?</span><br>Most people will recover from toxoplasmosis without treatment. However medication is available from your family doctor to treat the infection. Treatment may be needed if the eyes or heart are affected or if the infection occurs in persons with weak immune systems or long lasting diseases (e.g. AIDS or cancer).<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/health/prevcont/toxoplas.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.metrokc.gov/health/prevcont/toxoplas.htm</a></div>
