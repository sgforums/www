            <div class='col-md body'>This is something for the guys.. I wonder if they have an equivalent for ladies..<br><br>-----<br><br>1. Whatever you do, don't just show up at their house [without notice]...they run around in their underwear just like we do.<br><br>2. DON'T CHEAT ON THEM. It may seem foolproof, but girls tell each other everything about everything. Trust me, they WILL find out and you will be mud. If you do cheat on them do not ever talk to the girl or see the girl you cheated on them. They will be hurt , no matter what they say.<br><br>3. Beware of every single male relative and all guy friends. Any of them would kick your ass at the drop of a hat, and a lot of them wouldn't even wait for the hat.<br><br>4. NEVER miss an opportunity to tell them they're beautiful.<br><br>5. DON'T refuse to kiss in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's because they're jealous.<br><br>6. If they slap you hard, you deserved it.<br><br>7. Don't be afraid to touch them if you want to. If they're going out with you in the first place, it's because they like being in your arms.<br><br>8a. If you don't sleep with them, DO NOT tell your friends that you did.<br>8b. If you DO sleep with them, DON'T tell your friends that you did.<br><br>9. You can be dirty minded in private, really...most of them are not offended by it...<br><br>10. Not all of them eat like birds, a lot of them can eat like whales.<br><br>11a. Most of them don't mind paying half of everything, but they do discuss these things with their friends. Realize that if you make your girlfriend pay half all the time, everyone will know about it and your friends will know you're a dick..<br>11b. Do you honestly need all your money that much? Be a man, pay all the time!<br><br>12. Every girl should eventually get three things from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, ONE OF HIS SWEATSHIRTS, and a really PRETTY RING (plastic ones from machines dont count). Even if it's not a serious relationship.<br><br>13. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you aren't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely.<br><br>14. If a guy is bothering her, it is your right to beat the sh<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>it out of him.<br><br>15. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, PULL YOUR GIRLFRIEND CLOSER.<br><br>16. NEVER, ever slap her, even if it's just in a joking way. Even if she swats you first, and says, "Oh, you're so dumb" or something, never make any gestures back.<br><br>17. Go to a chick flick once in a while. She doesn't care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went.<br><br>18. You're dead meat if you can't get along with their pets, parents, and best friends. Be prince charming to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals.<br><br>19. Don't flirt with their moms...that's just freaky.<br><br>20. Don't be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like sh<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>it, so be understanding.<br><br>21. If you don't like the way they drive, you do it.<br><br>22. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better damn well introduce her as your girlfriend.<br><br>23. Don't stress where you go for every date. They really only want to be with you.<br><br>24. If they complain that something hurts, rub it for them WITHOUT being asked.<br><br>25. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/wrestling, be very gentle.<br><br>26. Memorise their birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life.<br><br>27. Don't marinade in the cologne, but smell good.<br><br>28. Don't give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful.<br><br>29. After you've been dating for a while, realise that they really have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibility, privilege and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a nanosecond.<br><br>30. NEVER, and i mean NEVER make her do anything she doesn't wanna do. Because if you do she'll think that you're only after one thing. (and i think you all know what that is)-sex.</div>

It only shows how indecisive you are as a male and girls don't like indecisive males. Only try it when you are in a steady relationship but don't do it all the time. </strong><br><br>2) never cut your hair shorter than his, almost 99% of the male population likes long hair girls<br><strong>We don't like guys to have longer hair then us. Those funky long styles you<br>see on visual kei bands really don't work on you.</strong><br><br>3) let them carry your shopping bags, they like to be seen with them<br><strong>Not all guys want to carry our shopping bags. We only let them carry if they offer.</strong><br><br>4) always be submissive in front of his guy friends, they expected that<br><strong>And we expect you to be not so heavily influenced by your friends and have the balls to stand on your own feet. We will not embaress or put you down in front of your friends but don't expect us to grovel.</strong><br><br>5) do not msg or glue to the phone more than 50% of the time while going out with him, he won't appreciate the divided attention<br><strong>Fair enough. Applies 2 ways</strong><br><br>6) learn to drop hints, this is a vital skill in training him, espeically important for birthdays, xmas, valentines etc<br><strong>I think hints don't work for guys with thick skulls. Sometimes you have to blatently tell them in their face</strong><br><br>7) if you cannot cook, buy home made cookies to give to him, he cannot tell the difference. if you can cook, show it off<br><strong>Erhmm isn't that worse. Learning to cook is better than pretending to know how to cook. That is lying and not being honest!</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> never spill the beans about your past relationships, but you must always ask him to share his<br><strong>From my experience 99% of the guys don't like to talk about their past relationships.</strong><br><br>9) if he is a smoker, don't leave home without your mints, you need that to breath near him<br><strong>Even if he is not a smoker he appreciates that you have mints on you especially if he likes garlicky meals</strong><br><br>10) if he drinks, don't let him drive, call a cab for him (look what happened to fann's bf)<br><strong>This is like common sense</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></blockquote></div>
