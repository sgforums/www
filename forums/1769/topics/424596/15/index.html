              <p>I remember the time they printed out a $1 coupon for the BK Tendergrill. The queue at Burger King at NUS on that day was hilariously long.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>These so-called promotions are just marketing gimmicks designed to make customers who were not even considering going to BK or Texas Chicken to go there.</p>
              <p>Odds are that those customers would buy other things on top of the $1 burger..... and most of them would. No point queueing up so long just for one single burger, no?</p>
              <p>These promotions would only benefit those who were <strong>already planning</strong> to go the restaurant before there even was a promotion. For everyone else who got sucked in, it's the restaurant that benefits. Whatever loss in profits they experienced by selling the cheap burger would be more than made up by the sheer volume of customers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, considering the fact that the BK at NUS is at the Arts and Social Sciences faculty, a good number of people who were queueing up were Economics, Sociology, and Psychology majors.</p>
              <p>What are the odds of them actually applying their studies to the act of queueing up at BK? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Seriously it's near Zora's place you should just pop by sometime to try. At that time they served a mighty good ice kachang at their outlet too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The thing about fast food places is that they pressure cook before frying their chicken so it becomes kinda mushy and the flesh doesn't seem as firm. Last I remember, they don't do that at Arnold's.</p>
