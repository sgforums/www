              <p>Ok.... that bugger who handed in his test paper wrongly has finally replied to me. He said (I quote):</p>

              <p>So in my reply I b*tchslapped the guy on several counts: (a) for not bothering to check his class group and venue, (b) for not bothering to check that he had handed in his test paper correctly, (c) for being rude to me, intentionally or not, (d) for taking such a bloody long time to reply to me, and (e) for making me have to go through the trouble of finding his own tutor to pass the paper to him.</p>
