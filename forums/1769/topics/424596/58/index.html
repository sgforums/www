              <p>Just now I decided to walk over to the Arts canteen.... simply put, I was getting bored of the food at Engin....</p>
              <p>I went to the western stall, and ordered pan-fried salmon. The signboard showed this:</p>

              <p>Two ultra-small, ultra-thin fillets of salmon. With a miniscule amount of fries.</p>
              <p>The Western stall at Engin is so much better.</p>

              <p>That Indonesian stall? Its first stall is at Engin. They got so prosperous that they expanded to both Science and Arts.</p>
              <p>I very much prefer their flagship Engin stall - good food, good portions, low prices.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if that bloody condemned Arts Western stall was at Engin, I can assure you that hordes of engineers will chase out the stallowners in the middle of the night while bearing flaming torches and pitchforks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>Okay, not that dramatic, but I already illustrated the fate of one screwed-up Peranakan stall at Engin. It didn't even last one semester.</p>
              <p>It was a pretty sad sight, that Peranakan stall.... in the middle of lunchtime, the canteen would be overcrowded, and the queues at every stall would be really long, but that one stall would not have a single customer at all.</p>

              <p><br>But its true.</p>
              <p>This Western stall is already the 2nd.</p>
              <p>The first was horrific. They left the meat out in the open with those heating lamp for hours on end, and you get to eat rocks instead of meat as a result.</p>
              <p>This 2nd western is only slightly better, but didn't you notice that the queue is significantly shorter, if there's any to start with?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Yeah, I liked the Indon stall at Engin, but sometimes its just better to eat at Arts especially if my lecture is right next to the canteen. And the Engin does have the best western stall.</p>
