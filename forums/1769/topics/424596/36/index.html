              <p>Yes.</p>
              <p>I'm very unhappy about this bcos this module is very important
              to me, and I badly needed this little advantage I had grappled.</p>
              <p>Anyhow, I'll take this challenge and NOT take the retest because
              even if I do, I don't gain much, if I do gain anything.</p>
              <p>Dang. Every sem's lecturer gets dumber AND dumber.</p>

              <p>Once I had a lecturer who worded her questions poorly.</p>
              <p>In one mid-term test, one of her questions was so poorly-worded that it could be interpreted in two totally different ways. Half the class (myself included) chose the wrong interpretation and lost a lot of marks. All our complaints fell on deaf ears.</p>
              <p>So for the next test, I was careful. I came across another similarly poorly-worded question. I immediately summoned the one of the PhD student invigilators to explain which interpretation was correct.</p>
              <p>The fella scratched his head and said, 'I think it is...... (explanation)...... but I'm not sure.'</p>
              <p>I immediately blew up at him: 'I thought, you think, who confirm?!?! Go confirm now!'</p>
              <p>And guess what? The lecturer was on leave. So all the PhD invigilators huddled together, came up with a consensus, and announced the correct interpreation of the question to everyone.</p>
              <p>Half the class moaned.</p>
