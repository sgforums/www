People here stereotype waaay too much, and their ignorance shows in all this stereotyping. For eg, seeing a really white north indian, they'd go, is he eurasian? It's better people like that don't talk. At least they didn't come across as being that stupid when they are silent. To quote a friend's blog "until you can learn to speak pleasantly, remain silent", and if you don't practise civility, don't expect me to.</div>

Everyone knows he is a homosexual, yet he still goes about telling people how he like this girl and all that.

            <div class='col-md body'>Homosexuals are raised in a culture in which heterosexuality is central, open and in your face. Movies, advertising, popular music are all permeated by heterosexual images. Homosexuals learn from the earliest age that everyone of importance in their lives expect them to develop heterosexual interests and relationships. In short, sexual orientation and identity is much more than what one does in the bedroom. It encompasses the people we love, our daily lives, dreams and aspirations. To make all that invisible is exhausting, depressing and esteem destroying work. Pressures on homosexuals to keep their sexuality hidden may limit the effectiveness of laws that can offer some protection. We are certaintly entitled to live full and open lives, free from harassment on the grounds of our sexuality.</div>
