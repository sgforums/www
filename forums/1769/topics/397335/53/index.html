              <p>Ok, looks like I will someday die from a heart attack....MPB too</p>
              <p>Memo to boss: 11-hour days are bad for the heart</p>
              <p>LONDON (Reuters) - People working 10 or 11 hours a day are more likely to suffer serious heart problems, including <span id="lw_1273598321_0" class="yshortcuts">heart attacks</span>, than those clocking off after seven hours, researchers said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The finding, from an 11-year study of 6,000 <span id="lw_1273598321_1" class="yshortcuts">British civil servants</span>, does not provide definitive proof that long hours cause <span id="lw_1273598321_2" class="yshortcuts">coronary heart disease</span> but it does show a clear link, which experts said may be due to stress.</p>
              <p>In all, there were 369 cases of death due to <span id="lw_1273598321_3" class="yshortcuts">heart disease</span>, non-fatal heart attacks and angina among the London-based <span id="lw_1273598321_4" class="yshortcuts">study group</span> -- and the risk of having an adverse event was 60 percent higher for those who worked three to four hours overtime.</p>
              <p>Working an extra one to two hours beyond a normal seven-hour day was not associated with increased risk.</p>
              <p>"It seems there might a threshold, so it is not so bad if you work another hour or so more than usual," said Dr Marianna Virtanen, an epidemiologist at the Finnish Institute of <span id="lw_1273598321_5" class="yshortcuts">Occupational Health</span> and University College London.</p>
              <p>The higher incidence of heart problems among those working overtime was independent of a range of other <span id="lw_1273598321_6" class="yshortcuts">risk factors</span> including smoking, being overweight or having <span id="lw_1273598321_7" class="yshortcuts">high cholesterol</span>.</p>
              <p>But Virtanen said it was possible the lifestyle of people working long hours deteriorated over time, for example as a result of poor diet or increased alcohol consumption.</p>
              <p>More fundamentally, long hours may be associated with work-related stress, which interferes with metabolic processes, as well as "sickness presenteeism," whereby employees continue working when they are ill.</p>
              <p>Virtanen and colleagues published their findings in the European Heart Journal.</p>
              <p>Commenting on the study, Gordon McInnes, professor of <span id="lw_1273598321_8" class="yshortcuts">clinical pharmacology</span> at the University of Glasgow's <span id="lw_1273598321_9" class="yshortcuts">Western Infirmary</span>, said the findings could have widespread implications for doctors assessing patients' heart risks.</p>
              <p>"If the effect is truly causal, the importance is much greater than commonly recognized. Overtime-induced work stress might contribute to a substantial proportion of <span id="lw_1273598321_10" class="yshortcuts">cardiovascular disease</span>," he said.</p>
