When the bus was travelling along Serangoon Road, I heard a commotion between a woman who claimed she had been molested and a male commuter who adamantly denied any misconduct.<br><br>As the exchange grew more heated, the bus driver stopped the bus in an attempt to placate both parties who were standing at the front of the bus.<br><br>After a few minutes, this drew protests from two male commuters who insisted that the driver continue on the journey to get them to work on time.<br><br>One of them spewed vulgarities in Hokkien while the other remarked that it was a trivial matter and suggested wryly that the woman should travel in a cab to avoid such incidents.<br><br>Faced with mounting pressure and a busload of commuters, the driver drove on. I do not know if the driver intervened again and resolved the matter as I alighted soon after.<br><br>I was taken aback by how some commuters can remain indifferent when thrust into situations that call for assistance and, to aggravate matters, put their own interests before others'.<br><br>If the woman in question were a family member of the two commuters who protested, would they still respond in a similar manner?<br><br>Bus companies should educate their drivers on how to handle such delicate situations appropriately and effectively, if they have not already been trained to do so.<br><br>On a positive note, I would like to commend the woman who stood her ground and spoke out against the man, as well as the bus driver who stepped in to mediate the dispute.<br><br>Tania HengLi Yen (Ms)<br></div></blockquote>Well, we are a nation of zombies...<br><br>Living here is like a horror movie sometimes that I am forced to watch, day in, day out..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's assume that the woman doesn't KNOW the man she was sitting next to<br>(YOu would know that when you hear their argument) .. then if it is not a real molest case, then you will also need to assume the woman is either paranoid or crazy.<br><br>Imagine, you ... a guy is sitting in the bus. This guy sitting next to you accidentally brushes his hand on your thigh. You feel uncomfortable... but at that moment, will you shout it out?<br><br>Following that gesture, this guy who was sleeping drops his head on your shoulder. His hands loosely falls on your thigh again. Possible close to ur crotch<br><br>IF it happens to you, will you jump up and bring to light this situation?<br><br>If you have not been molested before, I don't think people can comprehend the fear, shame and anger connected to the entire incident. Most people don't react to molest, jump up and start accusing someone<br><br>They sit there, tolerate, wonder in doubt if it is an accident that it happened twice/three/four times, in shame cos to jump up and accuse someone means to blow the matter up, in fear and disgust... by the time a woman jumps up to accuse a man of molest most of the time she has already sat through quite a few long minutes of all these mixed feelings.<br><br>Unfortunately the more angry a woman is, the less credibility and less help she is likely to get. (Waa.. so chia. That man suay man.. molest this type of woman) And apparently only if she is sobbing in fear and helplessness does she deserves pity.<br><br>So it is really a woman's responses to molest that guarantees people's reactions towards her. And i think in many people's minds.. molest itself is still 'no big deal.' Let's hope they don't have to suffer through it themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well you must understand that people have different tolerance levels towards their own personal space. Just as you will not feel comfortable if some big burly guy sleeps on your shoulder or if you have slept on a big burly guy's shoulder, even if it is a genuine case of sleeping you will feel embarassed too.<br><br>Fact is, if you did accidentally fall asleep and rest your head on her shoulder, you did invade on someone else's personal space and should accept that she WILL feel uncomfortable. Instead of getting angry and upset, I think a sincere apology will probably alleviate the tension.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Re this case mentioned in ST, I note that the letter writer is a woman. Maybe she's assumed that the alleged molester was guilty. Maybe the other commuters did not agree with the pesky complainant. Afterall, in a crowd bus, it's hard to say who's right and wrong and it's defnitely wrong to inconvenience other communters with an argument between two persons.</div>
