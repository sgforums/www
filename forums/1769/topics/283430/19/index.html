In those numbers are cases of heart bypass surgeries, orthopedic surgeries and expensive dental treatments.<br><br>Soon, those cases of individuals seeking care may give way to corporate plans, as well.<br><br>In North Carolina, Carl Garrett, 60, became a test case in September for his company, Blue Ridge Paper Products, Inc. Garrett flew to New Delhi, India, to have gallstones removed and rotator cuff surgery at a savings of $50,000 for his company.<br><br>The surgeries would have cost Garrett $20,000 in the United States. Instead, he received $10,000 as a share of his company's savings.<br><br>This practice has been going on in other countries for years.<br><br>Canadians and Britons, frustrated with long waits because of nationalized health care plans, have used medical travel to have procedures done sooner. Asians long have traveled to countries within their region to reduce medical costs.<br><br>As U.S. health care costs have become prohibitive, Americans are joining the legions.<br><br>In 2005, 46.6 million Americans had no medical insurance and 120 million were without dental insurance, according to the Census Bureau.<br><br>Alain Enthoven, a senior fellow at the Center for Health Policy at Stanford University, noted that global health care is becoming an accepted alternative as U.S. health care Â“prices itself out of reach.Â”<br><br>Signs of that are already present:<br><br>Blue Cross Blue Shield Association has included Wockhardt Hospitals in India among its worldwide network of participating hospitals.<br><br>Insurer Health Net of California contracts with accredited Mexican clinics near the U.S. border.<br><br>United Group Programs in Florida, which caters to self-insured companies, offers options for obtaining medical care at Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.<br><br>West Virginia's state Legislature is considering a bill that would encourage state employees to have nonemergency medical surgeries overseas.
