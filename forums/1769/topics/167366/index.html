            <div class='col-md body'>Death isn't a very 'nice' topic.  And there are Singaporeans who broach this topic with a lot of 'choi! dai kar lai see!' kinda attitude!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But death creeps up on our loved ones and on us eventually and inevitably.  And I've seen it so much at work, seen so many different ways death is handled, that I think a lot of folks just don't spend enough time preparing for the eventual death of a loved one who is hospitalised and on the 'Dangerously Ill List'.<br><br>Recently, I witnessed a rare occasion when the death of a loved one was handled with such grace and dignity that my heart went out to the patient and his entire family.<br><br>They were Catholics and in the mere matter of just three to four days in the ICU, it was apparent that the patient was dying and there was nothing else we could do for him.  I think the patient was in his mid-40's, relatively young.<br><br>The family streamed into the room after the docs broke the news to them to prepare for his eventual death.  His mom grabbed her rosary and cross, and whilst crying, told him to listen well and good, they're all there surrounding him in love, she loves him but the good Lord wants to call him back to be with Him and that he should let go of all earthly things and the entire family will band together and take care of his wife and kids.<br><br>A heart-rending assurance from a mom.  I was in there adjusting his drips and had to gulp down my own emotions.  It was hard for me to fight my own tears cause I was so moved.<br><br>It's always tough for the old to send the young away on a journey towards the afterlife.  'Bai2 Fa3 Ren2 Song4 Hei1 Fa3 Ren2'<br><br>However, there was a beauty to this... this family placed their entire faith in God.  Their belief in the life God promised us after death was complete and absolute.  Sure, they'll all miss him upon his demise, but this deep acceptance and coming to terms with the inevitable and tackling the impending death of a loved one by assuring him, asking him to go in peace and unburden his spirit upon leaving this earth... it's really a very loving way of sending away a loved one.<br><br>We all handle our grief differently, but I think when death is knocking at the door, it's important to send away the person in peace and make his spirit 'at rest'.

It's not your everyday light-hearted topic, but seeing the way some folks react towards the imminent death of a loved one, I think knowing how we can mourn someone and yet provide spiritual relief and peace to the person who's standing at the threshold of death is very important.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Then a relief should come, but the grief still stays in you, you have to manage it. Death is bad for those who stay, not for those who have gone. The life continues, no matter who died.<br><br>I have lost my grandparents, I'm sure you all know the helpless and desperate feeling, that no matter how much you wish, how much you mourn, they won't come back, there is nothing to do about it. Then you pick up yourself and carry on with your life, because those who have passed away sure wouldn't be happy if seeing you suffering. The best thing you can do to commemorate them is to do the best out of your life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">However, there was a beauty to this... this family placed their entire faith in God.  Their belief in the life God promised us after death was complete and absolute.  Sure, they'll all miss him upon his demise, but this deep acceptance and coming to terms with the inevitable and tackling the impending death of a loved one by assuring him, asking him to go in peace and unburden his spirit upon leaving this earth... it's really a very loving way of sending away a loved one.<br><br>We all handle our grief differently, but I think when death is knocking at the door, it's important to send away the person in peace and make his spirit 'at rest'.  'An1 Xing1 de4 Zou3 Ba4'.  </div></blockquote>Dear Rhonda,<br><br>Since you mentioned that the family was Catholic, let me share with everyone a small glimpse of how we Catholics are taught to see death.<br><br>Below are the lyrics to the last part of Faure's famous Requiem in Latin and in English.<br><br>Latin:<br>In paradisum deducant te angeli,<br>in tuo adventu<br>suscipiant te martyres,<br>et perducant te<br>in civitatem sanctam Jerusalem.<br>Chorus angelorum te suscipiat,<br>et cum Lazaro quondam paupere<br>aeternam habeas requiem.<br><br>English:<br>May the angels lead you into paradise,<br>may the martyrs receive you<br>in your coming,<br>and may they guide you<br>into the holy city, Jerusalem.<br>May the chorus of angels receive you<br>and with Lazarus once poor<br>may you have eternal rest.<br><br>The piece, when sung, has a very other-worldly feel to it.<br><br>regards,<br>siginah</div>
