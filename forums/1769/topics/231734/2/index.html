The LTA aims to increase the share of commuters from the current 63 per cent to 70 per cent over the next 10 to 15 years.<br><br>For this to happen, chairman of the Public Transport Council Gerard Ee told TODAYy that timing and scheduling are critical.<br><br>"For more public commuters to switch to public transport, reliability is key and ultimately factors such as waiting times, travelling times and scheduling matter," he said.<br><br>Mr Ee said the review could look into road design and development so that bus routes can be more efficiently mapped out Â— for example, dedicated bus lanes can be considered.<br><br>Booz Allen Hamilton is expected to submit their findings to the LTA in the middle of this year for review and evaluation. - TODAY/st</div>
