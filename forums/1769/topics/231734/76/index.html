That my brother in law receiving the t-shirts is a quality assurance director of a company in USA.

I doubt I should bring it up now.  His company is still around, just that he might not have known about the conversation I had with his gal.<br><br>He probably thinks of me as a customer who only talk big about making new orders from him but never did follow up my words. And I didnt mind that.<br><br>Thanks for the support guys.  I guess I have to try to PM him within these few days to confess about it.<br><br>And I do agree about building long term biz relationships means a lot of trust, customer service and having to make good your products even if you lose out a bit of money.  I ordered from him cos he is a trusted fellow forumer.  And it was kinda a put down when the gals comment makes me feel like stretching the friendship to not complaining honestly.</div>
