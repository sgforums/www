I knew it was a punishment, and I accepted it.<br><br>I was also whacked uncontrollably by my parent when I was young. For things such as... playing too loudly and waking my dad up, I was whacked to the corner with a variety of implements from cane to belt to whips. I went to school with scars all over my body in the era before caning went out of fashion. I still love my dad, but I think he has issues in anger management.<br><br>I have also seen kids with parents that treated them with violence. I spoke to the parent about this kid fighting in school, immediately the parent shoved his head and flung him on the wall, and screamed at him. He did not react, his body just limp. It is no wonder he learns that when people don't listen to him, he can treat them in this way too.<br><br>What i am saying is that.. up to now, I have never felt the need to use this type of punishment on a child.  It started w the fact that.. since I am not their parents, I do not use corporal punishment - EVEN if the parent tells me to go ahead with it. But since then, I have never met a kid that truly needed it. Even a kid who was completely spoilt at home and threw bawling tantrums, flinging his chair on the ground can be disciplined without the need to smack him.<br><br>Or rather, I manage to instil fear in the kids I teach, without needing to lift a hand....
