                      2008?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">A smooth-sailing and uneventful year with none of the dramas, tumultuous up's and down's and bad news that characterised 2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'd also love to have my savings increase exponentially!  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'd also love to have my driver's licence and my very first car.</span><br> <br> 7. What date from 2008 will remain etched upon your memory, and
                      why?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">That
                  I knew how political the players were, but yet I decided to close one
                  eye and maintain a low profile, foolishly thinking that if I just keep
                  to my corner, I will be left untouched.  I should have learnt by now
                  that only the fittest survive and like it or not, one has to take steps
                  to ensure one's survival and not just play dumb.  </span><br> <br> 10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">People at work - both colleagues and patients... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Manipulative "PR Queens" who seemingly get away with murder</span>...<br> <br> 14. Where did most of your money go?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Food, Books, Clothes...  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"><br> <br> 15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">My work arrangement - more days off, higher pay!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></span></p>

What do you wish you'd done more of?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Saving.</span>  <span style="color: #0000ff;">Studying.</span>  <span style="color: #0000ff;">Housework.</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"> Cooking.</span><br> <br> 19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Spending.</span>  <span style="color: #0000ff;">Eating out.</span><br> <br> 20. How will you be spending Christmas?</p>

                  watching programs on Discovery Travel and Living as well as on Animal
                  Planet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></span><br> <br> 25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last
                      year?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes</span>. <br> <br> 26. What was the best book you read?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I
                  wanted a better wardrobe... and I got more clothes by waiting patiently
                  for end-of-season sales. I got my first black leather jacket and first
                  velvet trench coats.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

                      satisfying?</p>

How would you describe your personal fashion concept in
                      2008?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Whatever's
                  comfortable and makes sense for the weather condition.  'Tis better to
                  keep warm than to shiver and freeze out in the cold.  </span><br> <br> 34. What kept you sane?</p>
