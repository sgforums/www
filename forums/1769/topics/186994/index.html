            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanted to rant... <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Smileys%20and%20Emoticons/ranting3.gif"><br><br>This evening, I was at Mos Burger at Plaza Singapura.  I ordered a burger for takeaway, alongside a cup of Pink Guava Juice.<br><br>Whilst waiting for my burger, I decided to sit down and drink my juice first.  My word, it was awful!  The juice was room temperature, and on top of that, there was a weird sourish taste to it!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">   I sipped it a few more times just to be sure and true enough, the juice tasted 'off'!<br><br>I went up to the counter, and informed the counter staff that their juice tasted off.  The cashier got hold of the Supervisor, who poured a small amount of the juice into her cup, then she made sure she stood out of sight and the cashier looked like she was communicating to the hidden manager cause you could tell from her facial expression.<br><br>The Supervisor then offered to replace my drink with another drink of similar value.  So, I decided on Iced Lemon Tea because no way was I going to order the Pink Guava Juice again.  <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Smileys%20and%20Emoticons/tongue.gif">  Yucks!!<br><br>She headed towards the kitchen, then after a while, returned and said she'll replace it with Pink Guava Juice, but she'll take a new batch.<br><br>From the facial expressions of the staff, it was easy to see that even though they replaced the stale juice, they must have thought that I was trying to find fault, that I was trying to be a difficult customer, or even, that I was trying to get a different drink and that was my tactic to get it free (that's probably why she decided not to change my drink order to the Ice Lemon Tea afterall).  She insisted that there was nothing wrong with the drink.<br><br>I was extremely unhappy about being treated like I was trying to be difficult, but I didn't want to raise a ruckus and they did replace my drink and gee, it tasted so different from the stale one I was served!  The first drink they gave me was definitely bad!<br><br>Instead of being apologetic for serving stale juice that tasted a tad rancid, they made me feel bad, like I was finding fault and being troublesome.  I walked away without saying anything more after getting my drink but truth be told, I hated the entire episode.<br><br>Have you ever been served food that was spoiling or downright stale or really yucky?  What did you do?  Did the restaurant try to remedy the situation?<br><br></div>
