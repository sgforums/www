            <div class='col-md body'>I've made waiters/staff send food back to the kitchen before. Sure I run the risk of the cook spitting into my food but I'll be damned if I'm going to pay for under/overcooked food, or worse, stale food. I've also complained about serving portions before.<br>And in most cases, the staff do not apologise but give you that kind of look.  What, am I supposed to eat undercooked chicken??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>My office canteen takes the cake though. Chances are that the same chicken you see on monday will be the same chicken you see on friday. Ditto for all their meat dishes. They're just re-cooked in a different manner throughout the week unless they're sold out. We vote with our wallets and feet and eat out instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I send food back if they're off or have turned bad, regardless of where I'm eating, cheap or pricey.  Customer service is subjective, but food condition, the very basic requirement of being served EDIBLE, safe-to-eat food, is non-negotiable.<br><br>Most times I get a reasonable response from the vendor.  I would ask them / the cook to taste it.  And I always get the dish replaced.<br><br>I'm surprised that people keep quiet about inedible food because  "they don't want to argue with the vendor".... in the first place, why would you immediately assume that to bring up a food condition problem would guarantee you a quarrel on your hands?<br><br>It's no biggie really, I think if you talk to the vendor nicely they can work out a satisfactory solution for you.</div>
