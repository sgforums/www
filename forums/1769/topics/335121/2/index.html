              <p>like all your life you've been aimless and suddenly it dawned on
                      you that THIS is it.. THIS is what you've been searching for all
                      your life.. THIS is what makes sense of your life.. and everything
                      that you've done before falls into place.. like the last piece of
                      jigsaw and you know it.</p>
              <p>anyone? you haven't been thinking about it much too ya...</p>

              <p>Sonny, why would you assume that people havent been thinking too much about it, when it hasn't yet been established as being in existence in the first place?</p>
              <p>You're looking for The One Thing, and frankly I reckon it's a pipe dream because the key question is not what that One Thing is, but how events change the way you live and lead you to create meaning in your life.</p>
              <p>The day I transferred primary schools and found myself with no friends, I realised that the only person who's always going to be there for me is myself.  The day I first jumped out of an airplane, I learned that you either go all-out for something, or you forget it altogether.  The day I had a loaded M16 pointed at my head, I found out that life's just too damned short to sweat the small stuff.  The day I got my doctorate and found that I had no right to be the angry young man because I had just become one of the beautiful people, I discovered with indignation that your ambitions can shatter the shape of your world.  The day I decided to propose to my wife, I realised that there might be someone else who's going to be there for me after all.</p>
              <p>It's not what you find to do that gives your life meaning.  It's how you decide to live your life that does.</p>
              <p>Yeah sport, I've thought about it all right, so don't go trying to tell me otherwise.</p>

              <p>To put a spin on John Lennon, whp in turn paraphrased one of any number of people, life's what passes you by while you're trying to figure out what life is.  Live every day as if it was your last, and don't sweat the small stuff.  If there is a grand scheme of things, it'll reveal itself out there, and you're not going to find it while sitting down and pondering.</p>
