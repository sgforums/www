And I guess its human nature to be a bit flirtatious (harmlessly or otherwise).  And its also our nature never to be fully satisfied with what we have - the grass is always greener on the other side.<br><br>After the initial fire of romance dies, blindness turns into sight again.  Another few months and they start running out of things to say.  New temptations and opportunities present themselves.  And they start to get a bit sian and wander off a bit.....mentally first, then emotionally and physically later.<br><br>For example:  If our spouse is the goodie type, we tend to be appreciate and secure.  But sometimes that lack of adventure is boring, which is when we start harbouring thoughts of outside fun....<br><br>Or:  If our spouse is the fun type, we tend to have fun, but lack security.  And at times when you crave for some seriousness, maturity and security,......blah blah blah.<br><br>Or:  It could be just that some people have a special, unique way of touching us where no one else could.  Could be in terms of some sensitivity, common sentiments, etc....<br><br>To cut an impossibly long story short, the problem is that no one person can provide from every angle.  This leaves us wanting sometimes....<br><br>And a lot of attached/married people are now defying traditions, even in the most conservative of countries.  Often, it ends up in being torn between two.<br><br>Fortunately, most fantasies are shot down by over-expectations by potential players.  As they go into the game, they feel that reality is not as good as fantasised....and that makes the players look again at their own spouses with renewed appreciation (Am I being too abstract here?).<br><br>(Ok, now I'm waiting for some single kid to come along with his/her idealistic ideas like "if you don't wanna be faithful, then why get married?", blah blah blah....it always happens in this forum).<br><br></div>
