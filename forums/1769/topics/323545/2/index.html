              <p>Agree, they actually endorse it. The public has nothing against kids who want to ahve fun but general public like to have kids have fun in the correct places.No one talked about cages and I have seen very well behaved kids. They play their stuff among themselves but not run around shoving people, hang on the bars, scream at the top of their voice in a crowded area. If they get injured, who is to blame? the parents or the kids. I blame the parents for their lack of better judgement to not have the sense to teach their kids the right thing at the right place, at the right time.</p>
              <p>I see my BIL and his kids. I cannot stand them cause the parents never stop them from the destructive monsters that they are.</p>

              <p>I dont mean to be biased or anything but I have found it really difficult to meet people that do not have children.  It seems that when couples reach "certain age" they have a desperate calling to breed.</p>

              <p>Ccffsg, I think you are under a lot of pressure from your in-laws or husband or friends to have children (Guess)</p>
              <p>However, you do not need to seek out like-minded people to justify your reasons on why not to have children.</p>
              <p>Sometimes people start having children because they are now ready for it, be it financially, emotionally or perhaps they want to try moving on to the next phase in life.</p>
              <p>Some people want children but choose not to because they don't have the means to provide, so they have them when they can.</p>
              <p>Whatever your reasons are, ultimately it is a PERSONAL CHOICE and should not bow to social norms and views.</p>
              <p>As well, when you have children, you don't have to talk about baby stuff to your friends or just talk about baby things. My friends who have children leave their kids at home and we enjoy ourselves outside and they only talk about baby stuff if we ask them about their child.</p>
              <p>Perhaps ask yourself the reason/s why you don't want to have a child and if someone ask, you can either tell them the reasons or politely tell them it's a personal choice and you appreciate that they respect your choice.</p>

              <p>I was having lunch on Saturday. We sat next to a big table which is empty. Then this kid came and began to run around the empty table. The dad, who was carrying a smaller boy walked towards this son (abt 6?) and then this son will run behind the dad and try to scare the smaller boy then he laugh very very loudly. The smaller boy also laugh. Sometimes the dad will run around the table and then try to scare the son too. So all of them were quite noisy.</p>
              <p>We got a little irritated, because little kids have piercing voices and they were disturbing our conversation. We kept staring at the dad but the dad just looked away, while the mom and rest of the family just looked at them smiling away.</p>
              <p>In the end, we caught hold of the boy and told him to shhhhh.. after that, the boy did keep quiet. But he continued running around the table..</p>
              <p>Yes, I agree that little kids like to run and jump around. That's fine. But as parents, you're in a restaurant, please try to keep your kids quiet and don't disturb the rest of the patrons!! If you want to play with them, bring them to a park or the beach or playground so that they can scream and shout as much as they like.</p>

The dad, who was carrying a smaller boy walked towards this son (abt 6?) and then this son will run behind the dad and try to scare the smaller boy then he laugh very very loudly. The smaller boy also laugh. Sometimes the dad will run around the table and then try to scare the son too. So all of them were quite noisy.</p>
              <p>We got a little irritated, because little kids have piercing voices and they were disturbing our conversation. We kept staring at the dad but the dad just looked away, while the mom and rest of the family just looked at them smiling away.</p>
              <p>In the end, we caught hold of the boy and told him to shhhhh.. after that, the boy did keep quiet. But he continued running around the table..</p>
              <p>Yes, I agree that little kids like to run and jump around. That's fine. But as parents, you're in a restaurant, please try to keep your kids quiet and don't disturb the rest of the patrons!! If you want to play with them, bring them to a park or the beach or playground so that they can scream and shout as much as they like.</p>

              <p>That's so true. I think the places that used to stop pets should stop kids instead and allow pets.   During all restuarant outing with my husband's entire extended family, the BIL kids will lead all the other kids in the table to run around the restuarant. The serving staff and other patrons stare at us. But to me its not my kids. The parents are happily eating and talking away ignoring the kids. The kids fall, kick into other guests and almost run into service staff with food. There are so many times I wish someone spill hot soup over all the kids and teach all of them a lesson. I do not stop them cause, if their parent's cannot be bothered to take the responsibility  to teach them now, they will not teach them in future, its not my responsibility for them to tell them anything. Besides, the BIL has a temper and I do not want to cross any lines.</p>

              <p><br>Agreed on these. Some parents were so atrocious that they actually side with their kids, and condone their bad behaviour. Some kids at my mum's house loves to play football outside our house, and often kicked the ball into our house or neighbours' house, despite repeatedly telling them to be careful. Once they kicked the ball into my house and nearly hit our worship altar. I called the security guards, and was told that they have spoken to those kids' parents.</p>
              <p>The loving parents reply was, "What's the bloody problem? If my kids break anything, I will pay for it. They are just kids. I can afford to pay for them to break anything" Poor security guards were even abused by those parents, shouting at them as if they were dogs. Uncouth people.</p>
              <p>This incident shows how irresponsible some parents are, not guiding their children properly. Think these kids will grow up with all the wrong values.</p>
