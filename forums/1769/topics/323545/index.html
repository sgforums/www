              <p>I have friends who are childless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One couple recently celebrated their 23rd wedding anniversary.  As far as I know, they come across a lovely and loving couple.  They keep themselves busy with badminton, karaoke sessions and dancing classes.  Erm, they are my karaoke buddies. :)</p>
              <p>Another 2 couples, married over 10 years.  Both couples keep pets and focus their attention to careers and self development.</p>
              <p>One other couple in their 60s, also childless but seems to be leading separate lives.  Hubby golfs, wife dances.  But they do do stuff together.  We've know them for 17 years.</p>
              <p>One common element is all got plenty of $$$$$.</p>
              <p>No need to follow norm.  Just follow your own desire.  Ask yourself, are you ready for the commitment.  It is hugh but then again, the love that you experience?  It's PRICELESS!!!! :)</p>
              <p>Good luck with your decision.  Anyways, the decision has to be mutual with your spouse, right?  How does he/she feels?</p>

              <p><br>don't know what to say but i think you will be missing alot. yes. children come with responsibilities but i think it's worth the while. you breed not because of pressure from any quarters but you want it.</p>
              <p>Nothing beats the experience. let me share with you some.</p>
              <p>my 3 years old boy was jumping and swinging on an MRT and i stop him by telling him i will leave him here. he says cannot. and when i asked him why cannot, he thought for a moment and replied "because I love you."</p>
              <p>my new born girl was hospitalised because i was sick before she was born due to work stress and having to attend to the wife and child need. when she was born, she caught the illiness pass on by me. When we brought her to the hospital, the doctor suspect menigitsis and therefore did a lumbar puncture procedure on the baby. while waiting outside, i heard the baby cried and my heart cried too as if i could feel that pain too.</p>
              <p>This are some of the little experience but it had been a long time liao</p>

              <p><br>Well I believe there are people who regret not having children later on, and those who don't</p>
              <p>It's highly up to the individual</p>

They took a photograph of an old couple from the west travelling around in Japan and gave a comment that says," will we still be able to travel around the world like this 2 when we are at their age?"</p>

              <p><br>how do you regret? it's not as if the stuff can be returned or disposed if it does not suit you or you don't like it. therefore i agree with bear and the rest that careful consideration be given.</p>
              <p>for me, and being chinese, i think that the way to repay for parent is to be filial and to be a parent myself since i have decided to marry.</p>
              <p>anyway, i felt very happy when my 1st child is a boy(chinese mentality again) but happier that both the child and mother are healthy</p>

              <p>anw childbearing is not just abt expiry date! in her view, marriage is prob the same. u HAVE to be married by wat age, have a kid by wat age... tis is wat society says, but it is NOT society tat's gonna be in TAT marriage or raise TAT kid....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u want a kid, have it... if not, don't. both have its consequences... make ur OWN decision and live by it... (and pls dun come here to whine after tat)...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i can only say, i'm GLAD i din have a kid... having bubble is more than enuff wahahahahahaa</p>

              <p>yeah I know a ex-colleague.</p>
              <p>Nowadays women with kids brandish their kids like trophies and expect everyone to give way to them like they own the world. You can see the bloody attitude right on their faces thay they feel entitled to some special treatment</p>

              <p>Dun bring the child into the world if u cant commit. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dun do it bcos it's the "norm", if u do, the one suffers in the end will be ur children.  Just look at the raising numbers of abandon  / abused kids..Wat have they done to deserve such treatments?  Of cos our parents will volunteer to help us to look after our kids, but then again..we cant always rely on others to raise our kids, they r ours afterall..</p>
              <p>I wll love to opt for international adoption if my finance is not a prob...tho' i wld still love to try havin babies of my own, i hope to share the love with the kids who suffer as well.</p>
              <p>My point is simple.  &amp; I shall repeat : Do NOT bring the child into the world if either party cannot compromise to commit.</p>
