            <div class='col-md body'>I've had my quarter life crisis about... 3-4 years ago...<br><br>I started with SERIOUSLY bumming for months and realised you need to have a lot of stamina, and commitment to be a REAL BUM (It aint easy bumming). And when I say bum, it means you don't do ANY work, and you don't do ANYTHING meaningful. U BUM. It's extremely boring so.. I figured what's missing was excitement. So...<br><br>I've broke up a failing relationship, got into a rut, dated, got heartbroken. Resigned from my job and temped and starved on a part time pay while wasting my time on non paying activities for the fun or it. And it was really funny looking back (forgot to add this) cos it was like real angsty. you know.. the.. I'M SO CONFUSED!!!!!<br><br>Now that's all over, and I am glad, cos it means I'm gonna live till 100 since it happened while I was about 25. So NOW all I got to do is to wait for kids to arrive  and the mid life crisis to descend on me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's the Financial and Social Aspects of this Quarter-Life Crisis, also from Wikipedia :<br><br><strong><span style="color: #8B3A3A;"><br>Financial and social aspects<br><br>A primary cause of the stress associated with the "quarter-life crisis" is financial in nature. <span style="font-style: italic;">Real wages for most people have been dropping since the 1970s, and most professions have become highly competitive. Positions of relative security, such as tenured positions at universities and "partner" status at law firms, have dwindled in number. This, combined with excessive downsizing, means that many Americans will never experience occupational security in their lives, and this is doubly unlikely in young adulthood. </span>Generation X was the first generation to meet this uncertain "New Economy" en masse.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The era when a professional career meant a life of occupational security, thus allowing an individual to proceed to establish an "inner life", is coming to a crashing end. </span>Financial professionals are often expected to spend upwards of 80 hours per week in the office, and people in the legal, medical, educational, and managerial professions may average more than 60. In most cases, <span style="font-style: italic;">these long hours are de facto involuntary, reflecting economic and social insecurity. While these ills plague adults at all ages, their worst victims are ambitious, unestablished young adults.</span><br><br>In The Cheating Culture, David Callahan illustrates that <span style="font-style: italic;">these ills of excessive competition and insecurity do not always end once one becomes established,  by being awarded tenure or "partner" status, and therefore the "quarter-life crisis" may actually extend beyond young adulthood. </span>Some measure of financial security, which usually requires occupational security, is necessary for psychological development. <span style="font-style: italic;">Some have theorized that insecurity in the "New Economy" will place many Americans in a state of, effectively, perpetual adolescence, and that the rampant and competitive consumerism of the 1990s and 2000s indicates that this is already taking place.</span><br></span></strong><br><br>Really food for thought...<br><br>It's true that these days, the younger folks graduate into a pretty 'unfriendly' working environment - in the job market, it's the employers' market these days.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   Terms of employment, remuneration and benefits aren't what they used to be, and on top of that, permanent employment can be pretty difficult to get, leaving most job-seekers with contract or temporary positions, which does not offer any job security at all.<br><br>No wonder greater and greater numbers experience a sort of 'burn out' in their jobs much faster and end up with the Quarter-Life Crisis!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
