So what if parents pay susidised fees, they still pay what and do we deserved to get treated worse than a prisoner? Students in US probably get more off days than us even though they have compulsory attendance cos during winter months, they probably dun have to go to school every time it snows too much. And they dun go back to school during holidays cos their holidays are after the school year ends, not like our june holidays.<br><br>Why u so stupid? still get mc? I just didn't go to school for the whole week before the school ends and before that i even missed some prelim papers. They can't do anything to u what, already leaving school liao.<br><br>Alternate 5 day week but the minimum working hrs is still like what? 44hrs? it makes no difference at all. The govt should cut down on the minimum working hours</div></blockquote>Because If I dont give MC, attendance will be affected and it will be reflected in my testimonial...anyway, all my medical fees being paid by insurance ...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
