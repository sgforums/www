            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever come across a question in a forum, and wondered why in google's name he/she doesn't just do some quick research on their own?<br><br>I mean, they are on an internet forum, so presumably fairly internet savvy, at least savvy enough to use a search engine, don't you think? Or in the case of personal issues, why seek the advice of complete strangers, who more often than not dispense advice that even your enemies wouldn't dare dream of?<br><br>Why, I wonder.<br><br>There may be a few reasons why the habitual-forum-nonsensical-question-poser does so, apart from maybe the blatant fact that attention does a world of good for one's ego. If they can't readily obtain it IRL, mayhaps the vast cyberspace is the next best thing.<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">1. The person actually knows all about the subject, and is looking for an entry point to show everyone how much they know.</span></strong><br><br>You know the type. Ask a question and then argue with the people that answer. This annoys me because it is a form of attacking well meaning people who are just trying to help.<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">2. Person knows full well how to get the information they need, but by thinking and asking the question, they will look Â’knowledgeableÂ’ in some ways.</span></strong><br><br>For example - "Anyone know how I can surprise my girlfriend with a gift that she's always wanted?"<br><br>Translated, this reads "Hey... guess what,? I'm flushed with cash - enough to buy the girl a 7ct diamond ring! Other girls can eat their heart out and just HOPE..."<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">3. In the case of personal matters, the person invariably knows what must be done, but needs the backup and approval of others before they can go ahead and act, so that if it doesn't go the way they hope it will, the complete burden of failure doesn't fall solely on one's lap.</span></strong><br><br>"My boyfriend shot my brother, raped my mother and fed my cat to the dog. Should I dump him?"<br><br>4 pages and 60-odd replies later, people are still discussing how best to kill the non-existent dude.<br><br>Ah... the internet. Faceless names hiding gleefully behind the secure anonymity of the screen. It's rapidly becoming a facet of life that we cannot simply choose to ignore, so much so that Google becomes the ultimate answer to everything.<br><br>If all else fails, there's always SgForums.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... think sometimes people are just clueless. Something which may seem apparent to us.. (i.e. monster boyfriend and mr hyde girlfriend) just seems to elude them somehow. Or rather, they know the answer, but they need affirmation and encouragement to do the extra step. A lot of us have friends that provide this support and affirmation but some don't. Therefore you have Aunt Agony.<br><br>Me.. neh.. just lazy.
