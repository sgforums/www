Upon checking the rules, we found that we were allowed to wear our own clothes in the pool and my friends continued to swim.<br><br>The woman approached us and started yelling Hokkien vulgarities at my friends and my friend's mother. My friend told her to stop verbally abusing her mother and the woman yelled: 'You want to fight, come up and fight, lah!'<br><br>A while later, her husband went up to my friend, shoved her and slapped her on the face for being 'rude' to his wife. Mind you, this was a 15-year-old girl who was half his size.<br><br>When we yelled at him in indignation, his wife showed my other friends the middle finger.<br><br>As a 15-year-old, I am appalled at the behaviour of these adults. They portray the ugly side of Singaporeans and give Singaporeans a bad name.<br><br>I hope that we can do something to change the mindsets of such people: that they are educated and therefore are above everybody else.<br><br>Joanne Tan Yu Min (Ms)<br><br>the author and friends were right in not hitting back. the author can choose to call the police but doesnt which shows how kind they are. writing to ST forums is a good mass media for telling us singaporeans.<br></div></blockquote></div>

Upon checking the rules, we found that we were allowed to wear our own clothes in the pool and my friends continued to swim.<br><br>The woman approached us and started yelling Hokkien vulgarities at my friends and my friend's mother. My friend told her to stop verbally abusing her mother and the woman yelled: 'You want to fight, come up and fight, lah!'<br><br>A while later, her husband went up to my friend, shoved her and slapped her on the face for being 'rude' to his wife. Mind you, this was a 15-year-old girl who was half his size.<br><br>When we yelled at him in indignation, his wife showed my other friends the middle finger.<br><br>As a 15-year-old, I am appalled at the behaviour of these adults. They portray the ugly side of Singaporeans and give Singaporeans a bad name.<br><br>I hope that we can do something to change the mindsets of such people: that they are educated and therefore are above everybody else.<br><br>Joanne Tan Yu Min (Ms)<br></div></blockquote>i wonder is wrong with that couple ? i am shock when i read this. that farking B@stard got no balls slap a 15yr gal. my blood is boiling <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  how can he do such a thing ? then that hokien B!tch.  really if i was there i already call my brothers wack them liao. scratch their car stuff wet tissue into their car exhause. let them die and rot in the 18 levels of hell  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> . i pity that 15yr gal... i wonder what did her parents did.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> if i am the father i sue them with all my assets make sure they sleep in streets , the B!tch give dog rape the B@stard give gay fark. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Err.. OOT too... but.. Reading this makes me feel that's THAT's the good thing about 'Auntiehood'<br><br>You see, If I am 15 and something like this happened to me... I would have suffered in indignant silence, possibly outburst (at home) and be completely unable to do anything about it to stand up for myself.... I think this girl very good liao to be able to write to forum about it.<br><br>Recently... I was walking home really slowly (carrying a few bags of groceries) when a young man in his 20s cycled from BEHIND me, bumped into me and then turned around to shout at me "WALAO, you don't know how to walk properly issit?!"<br><br>If it had been just a couple of years ago.. oh I would have suffered in silence, shocked and angry.<br><br>To my surprise, I raised my voice and said to him "HEY! YOU ARE THE ONE cycling on the pavement! You should be on the road! And still dare to be so rude!" I think he was surprised I reacted too.<br><br>Oh man.. I was so stunned I did it afterwards. Looked around kind of embarassedly but felt a little proud that finally... after the years of being queue-cut, shoved, victim of bad behaviour.... finally i spoke up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
