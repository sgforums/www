            <div class='col-md body'>Rotating shifts is ultimately bad for one's health.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>First to suffer would be your sleep pattern.  I used to be a morning lark and I'll rise and shine early in the morning and breeze through the day.  Since I became a nurse, my sleeping pattern became totally screwed up and I became more of a night person.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I'd still wake up automatically every morning at about 5:30-6:30, even on days off and on vacation, but I'll be stumbling about like a blindfolded bear!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I used to be rotated on Morning, Evening, and Night duties and I started to become Narcoleptic, as diagnosed by our very own Dr Bear!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>However, working shifts presents you with the opportunity of running errands during off-peak hours and thus avoid the maddening crowd.  However, sometimes, you're so tired you end up catching up on sleep anyways to really fully utilise the time off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I know of colleagues who work the permanent night shifts at work so that they can go home to wake their children up, prepare breakfast, and send them off to school.  A few of them also work shifts to coordinate with their spouses, who coincidentally, also do shift work, so that no matter what, at least one parent will always be home for the kids.  It is a huge sacrifice but as moms and dads, I guess there's nothing you won't do for your kids!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The good thing with shift work is, you can play around with the rest days on your rosters and plan your vacations well.  For instance, I'm getting a 30-day vacation using just 14 days of my accrued annual leave, because I played around with my rest days!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Ultimately, it's a trade-off.  Sometimes, it's hard to go to work knowing that you're missing out on a party / event though.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

He only recently got treatment for it and is now sleeping with the aid of a C-PAP machine. When he worked on rotating shifts, I really pitied him. He could fall asleep anywhere, anytime, poor thing.

I used to be a morning lark and I'll rise and shine early in the morning and breeze through the day.  Since I became a nurse, my sleeping pattern became totally screwed up and I became more of a night person.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I'd still wake up automatically every morning at about 5:30-6:30, even on days off and on vacation, but I'll be stumbling about like a blindfolded bear!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I used to be rotated on Morning, Evening, and Night duties and I started to become Narcoleptic, as diagnosed by our very own Dr Bear!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>However, working shifts presents you with the opportunity of running errands during off-peak hours and thus avoid the maddening crowd.  However, sometimes, you're so tired you end up catching up on sleep anyways to really fully utilise the time off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I know of colleagues who work the permanent night shifts at work so that they can go home to wake their children up, prepare breakfast, and send them off to school.  A few of them also work shifts to coordinate with their spouses, who coincidentally, also do shift work, so that no matter what, at least one parent will always be home for the kids.  It is a huge sacrifice but as moms and dads, I guess there's nothing you won't do for your kids!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The good thing with shift work is, you can play around with the rest days on your rosters and plan your vacations well.  For instance, I'm getting a 30-day vacation using just 14 days of my accrued annual leave, because I played around with my rest days!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Ultimately, it's a trade-off.  Sometimes, it's hard to go to work knowing that you're missing out on a party / event though.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>Thats the problem, if your partner/friends/spouse isnt on shift, you lose out alot.<br><br>The only good thing is the planning of leave, those on shift live for their off days. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Unfortunately, my company is enforcing a global wide forced taking of leave. And as expected, news of this resulted in many of us quitting</div>

They stand to lose so much more by trying to squeeze blood out of their employees, who then quit en masse, can't they SEE that?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   I mean, they've spent so much money and effort and resources to train you guys and then they make all of you so angry, everyone quits!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Where's the logic in that?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>BTW, didn't know you were doing shift work, DG!
