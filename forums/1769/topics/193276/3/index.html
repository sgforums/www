I first realised that during my short clinical attachment in the US and now, that idea continues to prevail.<br><br>Whilst there will be a handful who chose nursing because they truly want to save lives, you can't rule out those who do so for more material reasons.  Besides, with the bad nursing shortage that exists worldwide these days, I don't think we have the luxury of weeding out people who want to enter the profession for 'less noble' reasons.  We truly need all the help we can get.<br><br>Besides, a desire to save lives can and do rub off on you somehow, once you're in the profession.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>We're all different in that we get motivated by different things.  I love nursing but to be honest, back in Singapore, I was getting burnt out and was starting to detest it.  But now, in a 'better' work environment and with fairer remuneration, I'm starting to love nursing once more.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
