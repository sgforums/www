That's the big news locally today. Interstate 35W is <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> major arterial roadway feeding into downtown Minneapolis from the northern suburbs, and the bridge collapse is going to seriously screw up the traffic flow there for some time yet, even with all the reroutings to alternate bridges which are out of the way and aren't designed to cope with the heavy traffic.<br><br>I've driven over that bridge on numerous occasions. It seems (seemed?) like a pretty substantial structure, so it'll be interesting to find out what caused the collapse.</div>

The talking heads in the media are all falling over themselves trying to come up with plausible theories for the collapse. In the end, I'll bet the NTSB will conclude that it was just good ol' metal fatigue exacerbated by poor maintenance.<br><br>The death toll thus far has been remarkably low: four at last count. The fact that most of the vehicles on the bridge were stationary at the time of the collapse, might have contributed to that.</div>
