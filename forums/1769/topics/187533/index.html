            <div class='col-md body'>OK, I digressed with my earlier post but now, I'm going to take the bull by the horns!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I feel that love draws two people to journey through life hand-in-hand, not knowing what landscapes they will encounter, what storms they'll have to weather, and where the nearest oasis providing a respite from it all will be.<br><br>Despite the uncertainties, out of mutual love, no one opts to leave the other, even when the going gets real tough.  This is where the 'in sickness and in health, through good times and bad' part comes in.<br><br>I guess the onus is to choose the right partner before we commit ourselves to love him/her.  Some people have the depth and strength of character to walk through burning brimestone with you and you'll both come out forged in fire, stronger in your relationship.  Others will whine and shuffle their feet and need to be dragged, and they'll come out at the other end disillusioned, bitter, and unwilling to continue the walk with you any further.<br><br>It pays to be prudent in choosing who we love.  I used to think that we don't have a choice, that when cupid strikes, that's it, even if your match is a bad guy, you just have to grit your teeth and bear it out cause that's your lot in life.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  (And that's how I ended up with a pai kia in my silly younger years!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>However, I no longer think that way.  I feel that whilst it may sound callous, we need to evaluate who we fall in love with, know the person's strengths and weaknesses well before we entrust our lives with him/her and embark on a journey together.  Afterall, you can't put a lamb through a buffalo's paces and if you're taking the buffalo route, you'd jolly well not allow a lamb to tag along because both of you will be hindered and unhappy!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>We need to evaluate with our eyes wide open because once we make that commitment, we don't turn back.  Ideally.<br><br>Sometimes, love appears to be totally spontaneous and out-of-control, at other times, love appears only after careful thought and the slow and steady getting-to-know-you stage.  I guess there's no one-size fits all kind of love.<br><br>To the sentimental folks, love would be all that the poets espouse it to be - a flurry of heartbeats and emotions, being swept off your feet, totally ecstatic and never humdrum.  To the more 'sedate', objective-driven folks, they would view love as a steady partnership with no nasty surprises and where the typical milestones in life are experienced together.  Most of us are in-between folks and we may have our very unique idea of what love really is.<br><br>Is love always enough?  I feel with the right partner, yes, it can be enough.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

What right do others have to judge another's dreams if they have not walked even a mere step in your shoes?<br><br>That's the weirdest thing about matters of the heart... it never ceased to amaze me how something that can be so beautiful cause so much pain. Ironical is a gross understatement. Just like the stark contrasts between night and day, tears and laughter... good and evil... as much as it brings you happiness - it carries with it as much heart rending sadness. What would you do? Where would you turn?<br><br>It's a persistent ache in your heart that shadows the smile on your face,<br>It's a longing that is sated momentarily by a flash of a vision.<br>It's awakening to a pleasant thought that has no end in sight...<br>It's a restless fall into slumber with the promise of a dream.<br><br>When the veil of darkness has draped itself around your life and concealed the tears of your pain and despair, when the destiny you had envisaged has all but faded like water amongst the golden sands of the desert, when you stand alone in your hour of adversity and need and no-one is willing to stand beside you, when the battles within your life are on the verge of defeat and ruin, when you are in exile within your own mind, when your heart is empty and is merely watered by the tears of your agonized and anguished soul...<br><br>What do you do?<br><br>When it seems the haunting silence of the darkness hangs like a shadow within the depths of your heart... When you cling like a child to the dreams of yesterday, when the light of dawn refuses to appear and the sun refuses to shine, when each day has become an eternal struggle to survive...<br><br>What do you do?<br><br>I believe that within the midst of our suffering there is always something to be learnt. With every obstacle overcome, we will become stronger... and wiser in the ways of life.<br><br>As Carl Jung once commented:<br><br>Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart.<br>He who looks outside dreams.<br>He who looks inside, awakens.<br><br>I hope that one day you will find it in yourself to love again... and be loved in return. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><img src="http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i247/BabyRS/full_bf8dab8bd63a7fb7e24504d3539b66.gif"></div>

It's only fair that when you start a new relationship, give that new person a clean slate, and don't let him/her shoulder the burden of baggages that you've brought over from your past relationship(s).  Afterall, not everyone is the same, and therefore, not everyone will behave in the same manner as your ex(s).  Always give your newly-chosen partner a fair chance instead of confining him/her in a small room with walls built from your past experiences, baggages and prejudice.<br><br>When the right person comes along, it won't be a bed of roses either but the difference would be that instead of opting for the easy way out when things go bad, or when you're having a bad day and somehow acted badly, he/she will still stick around simply because he/she loves you and is not about to go away and abandon you just because of little hitches now and then.  Afterall, all relationships experience highs and lows as well and if someone loves you, they're in for the entire ride, whether it be a sky-high rise or a rock-bottom pitfall.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
