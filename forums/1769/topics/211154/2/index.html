(super stupid- ppl will make use of this reason to get what they want out of you den dump you also; end up getting more hurt)<br>7-trying to commit sucide-not wise, super stupid too, coz u need not kill yourself over a rotten tree, there's still a jungle of trees and woods for you to choose from.<br>8-just treat ur ex- like pigs. dunno how to eat good stuff.<br><br>doing these silly things will either danger your own life in one way or another.<br>will lead to depression, mental unstability, hallucination, nightmares, sooner or later will collaspe. my fren happens to fall into this catergory, so <strong>my advice is to face the music, dun run away from it, where you fall down, you have to learn how to get up on your own at the very spot and move on!!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also don't understand the need to travel to public place to weep.<br>If I'm gonna have puffy red eyes , leaky nose and basically look like shiet I'd want to do it in the privacy of my own room.<br>Plus you can't really WAAAIILL and heave and hiccup in public without people staring at you.<br>Another thing... how to ensure you have enough tissue in public?  Pack a box in your bag?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Choco B... with experience I can say a toilet roll works the best for chronic crying... tissue paper too... flimsy.. toilet rolls have the right texture..value for money too</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If toilet roll must get the pricier brands like Kleenex, they're softer and finer.<br>Else with the rubbing &amp; blowing of nose  you're gonna get serious abrasions.<br>I prefer tissues , but for better absorbancy get the 3 ply types - thick and soft.  Once again, from better brands like Kleenex.  This crying business is expensive!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah i Agree with no stinging on good quality toilet rolls when u cry.. looking horrible won't make u feel better.. especially if u got bits of inferior quality toilet paper stuck on ur nose (even if that would take the attention off the puffy eyes)<br><br>What people need in crying toilet paper is not aloe vera... its.. uhh.. -illegal substance- .. that can make u feel happy and joy again.. or.. uhh.. something that will simply knock u out and u sleep until the sadness passes over...<br></div>
