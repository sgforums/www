            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met. After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was, of course, perfect. One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road, when they noticed someone at the side of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help. There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving along delivering toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the accident. The mind numbing  question is: Who was the survivor?<br><br>Scroll down for the answer...<br><br>The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man. Women stop reading here. That is the end of the joke.<br><br>Men keep'a scrollin'...<br><br>So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving. And that explains why there was a car accident. By the way, if you're a woman and you're reading this, this illustrates another point: Women never listen, either<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A jock and a geek applying for the same job.<br>The boss said, "Boys, you need to take a test before you can get this job."<br><br>So they took the test and the next day they came back to see who the boss chose. "Well," he said, "Both of you got the same score except I'm going to choose the geek."<br><br>The jock complained, "Don't you think that's prejudice or something?"<br><br>"Well," the boss said, "Let me tell you what happened. Both of your papers were right all the way through until the last question came up, and the geek answered 'I don't know,' and then when I looked at your paper, you answered, 'Me either'.<br><br>=======================================================<br><br>A British Man, a French man, and an American man are on a safari in Africa, and they are taken prisoner by a savage group of villagers. As they're being brought to the village, they are told that death was their only option, however, they each had their choice of the method they would use to kill themselves. The British man requested a pistol, and cried out "Long live the queen!" as he blew his brains out. The two others watched in horror as the savages flayed the man and made his skin into a canoe. The French man was next, and he requested a Saber. "Vive le France" was what he cried out as he disemboweled himself. The American guy watched again what they did with his body, as they made his skin into a canoe. The last guy, the American guy requested a fork in which to kill himself. As soon as it was handed to him, he started stabbing himself violently as he screamed "So much for your fucking canoe!"<br><br>=======================================================<br>President Bill Clinton called Jean Chretien with a pressing emergency:<br><br>"Our largest condom factory has exploded!" the American President cried, "My people's favorite form of birth control!

"Could you possibly send us 1,000,000 condoms ASAP to tide us over?"<br>"Certainement! I will get on hit right haway." said Jean.<br>"Oh, and one more small favor, please?" said President Bill.<br>"Oui?"<br>"Could the condoms be red, white and blue, and at least 10" long and 4" in diameter?" asked Clinton.<br>"No prob'lem," replied the Prime Minister, and with that, Chretien hung up and called the president of Trojan.<br>"I need a favor.

            <div class='col-md body'>A middle aged woman lived alone except for her pet, a male parrot. The woman was very proud of her parrot because it would sit in the bottom of its cage, cross its wings, and pray. She was also a devout church goer and would often brag to the congregation about her faithful parrot.<br>One day the women was boasting about her parrot's prayers. An older gentleman was simply amazed by this. ''I have a female parrot and she's just terrible. My son raised her and all she does is curse. She's the most foul mouthed creature I've ever heard,'' he sighed. ''Maybe if we put my parrot with your parrot he would teach mine how to pray and stop cursing so much.''<br><br>The woman readily agreed to this and a few days later the gentleman brought his parrot by. The woman's parrot sat praying in the bottom of the cage as they placed the female inside with him. The parrot instantly stopped praying, hopped up, looked the female over and shouted, ''Hot damn!! This is what I've been praying for!!''<br><br>=======================================================<br><br>A couple is doing yard work and the wife goes to take a shower. Her husband is looking for a rake and can''t find it. He yells up to his wife, but she motions to him from the window like she can''t hear. So he points to his eye, hits his knee, and then makes raking motions. ("I need the rake.") She replies by pointing to her eye , grabbing her left breast, slaps her ass, then rubs her crotch. The man is confused and runs upstairs.<br>"What? What was that?"<br><br>"Eye, left tit, behind, the bush."<br><br>=======================================================<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Grandpa and a Grandma always got very excited when they recalled<br>&gt;&gt; the<br>&gt;&gt; old<br>&gt;&gt; days they were together. They made a decision, one day, to make it<br>&gt;&gt; "yesterday once more". They made a date on the river bank they used to go<br>&gt;&gt; when they were young. The next day, grandpa got up 6 a.m. in the morning,<br>&gt;&gt; dashed to the bank, picked up a big bunch of wild flowers before sunrise,<br>&gt;&gt; waited there for his sweetheart to come.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; But Grandpa ended up in disappointment as Grandma never showed up<br>&gt;&gt; even<br>&gt;&gt; after<br>&gt;&gt; sunset.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Grandpa went home in such anger. He opened the door, seeing Grandma<br>&gt;&gt; lying<br>&gt;&gt; on<br>&gt;&gt; the sofa with her pillow. He threw the flowers on the floor and<br>&gt;&gt; questioned:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; " Why didn't you come to our date?!!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Grandma hid her head in the pillow and replied shyly....<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; " Mom didn't allow me to go..."<br></div>

The minister knew that Jack and Paul earned their living<br>as salesmen and were likely capable of selling some Bibles.  But<br>he had serious doubts about Louie who was a local farmer, who<br>had always kept to himself because he  was embarrassed by his<br>speech impediment.<br><br>Poor Louie stuttered badly.  But, not wanting to discourage<br>Louie, the minister decided to let him try anyway.<br><br>He sent the three of them away with the back seat of their cars<br>stacked with Bibles.<br><br>He asked them to meet with him and report the results of their<br>door-to-door selling efforts the following Sunday.<br><br>Anxious to find out how successful they were, the minister<br>immediately asked Jack, "Well, Jack, how did you make out<br>selling our Bibles last week?"<br><br>Proudly handing the reverend an envelope, Jack replied, "Using<br>my sales prowess, I was able to sell 20 Bibles, and here's the<br>$200 I collected on behalf of the church."<br><br>"Fine job, Jack!" The minister said, vigorously shaking his<br>hand.  "You  are indeed a fine salesman and the Church is<br>indebted to you."<br><br>Turning to Paul, "And Paul, how many Bibles did you sell for the<br>church last week?"<br><br>Paul, smiling and sticking out his chest, confidently replied,<br>"I am a professional salesman. I sold 28 Bibles on behalf of the<br>church, and here's $280 I collected."<br><br>The minister responded, "That's absolutely splendid, Paul. You<br>are truly a professional salesman and the church is also<br>indebted to you."<br><br>Apprehensively, the minister turned to Louie and said, "And<br>Louie, did you manage to sell any Bibles last week?"  Louie<br>silently offered the minister a large envelope.<br><br>The minister opened it and counted the contents. "What is this?"<br>the minister exclaimed.  "Louie, there's $3200 in here!  Are you<br>suggesting that you sold 320 Bibles for the church, door to<br>door, in just one week?"<br><br>Louie just nodded.  That's impossible!" both Jack and Paul said<br>in unison.  "We are professional salesmen, yet you claim to have<br>sold 10 times as many Bibles as we could."<br><br>"Yes, this does seem unlikely," the minister agreed.  "I think<br>you'd better explain how you managed to accomplish this, Louie."<br>Louie shrugged.  "I-I-I re-re-really do-do-don't kn-kn-know f-f-<br>f-for sh-sh-sh-sure," he stammered.<br><br>Impatiently, Peter interrupted.  "For crying out loud, Louie,<br>just tell us what you said to them when they answered the door!"<br><br>"A-a-a-all I-I-I s-s-said wa-wa-was," louie replied, "W-w-w-w-<br>would y-y-y-you l-l-l-l-l-like t-t-to b-b-b-buy th-th-th-this<br>b-b-b-b-bible f-f-for t-t-ten b-b-b-bucks ---o-o-o-or--- wo-wo-<br>would yo-you j-j-j-just l-like m-m-me t-t-to st-st-stand h-h-<br>here and r-r-r-r-r-read it t-to y-y-you??"<br><br></div>
