              <p>I was good buddy with a senior medic and we often chatted with the NS MO ... he, the doc, enlightened us on several points of the whole thing.</p>
              <p>point number one is that the medical community in singapore is damm small, everybody knows everybody ... chances are the senior specialist who downgraded one of the men taught you in medical school, etc etc ... so MOs won't overrule such things lightly ... cos you'll be going again someone who's much more senior than you in your professional community.</p>
              <p>the most expeditious way is to kick it upwards to the medical board .... and if the medical board says boo ! chao keng ... then you can bet your arse the man was really trying to chao keng ...end of story ...</p>
              <p>I never bought into any of those I'm injured and the MO won't downgrade me, or I'm siao, can't take NS, going made stories in the SAF forum ... you know how risk adverse the army is when it comes to NSmen, you think they'll fark around with you and be bloodyminded out of spite?</p>
