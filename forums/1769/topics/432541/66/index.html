              <p>We bought a Killed In Action for $48K three years ago, and I

              <p>Most of the new cars are designed to be destroyed in a

              <p>so we have have the ironic situation where most people's first car would also be a conti car .... it's a bit silly to pay 100k for a japanese hatchback when you can get a conti sedan for 10% more ....</p>

              <p>Its not about being kiasu....the superiority of auctioning boils down to its ability to eliminate those who are not able and willing to pay and allocating it accordingly.</p>
              <p>The problem comes with what goods you would want to auction.....private transport? Which becomes closer to a necessity with this transport system we have now? Then the advantage of using the auction system fails..........classic market failure.</p>
