              <p>Some economists and sociologists have been ruminating over this issue: about how an abudance of natural wealth can be a liability, and a lack of it can in fact be an asset.</p>
              <p>It is sobering when you think of Ghana as compared to South Korea. At the point of its independence in the late 1950s, Ghana was ahead of South Korea in terms of GDP. It has abundant natural resources in terms of cash crops, whereas South Korea was still recovering from the Korean War.</p>
              <p>Now, South Korea has Samsung and Kia and whatnot.... and Ghana has regressed after a series of failed projects.</p>
              <p>A lack of resources, on the other hand, forces the populace to be creative with what they have. Which is at least part of the reason why South Korea and Taiwan both surged ahead after the Korean War and Chinese Civil War respectively.</p>
