              <p>they can squander that all? what are they? morons?</p>
              <p>okay.. they may squander it all..</p>
              <p>well, add to that.. SMRT ridership was around 52m monthly.. subtract an amount for the senior citizens, you get around 45m... multiply by 0.02¢ you get $900,000 a month, free money..</p>
              <p>SBST is around 87m.. to get around mayb 78m to get around $1.5m a month.. again free money...</p>
              <p>so.. is this amount going to pay the workers? or do they get stiffed like i think they would?</p>

              <p>Actually they down-rated CCL's overall ridership to 400,000 now... It used to be 500,000 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I predict with 7 mins CCL freq into Pasir Panjang, Science Park &amp; NUS, it'll only do more to crowd e SBS buses.</p>
