One fella who was caught fidgeting by his PS got tekaned like hell and got turn-out parade (Smart 4, boots polished) three times a day for the next ten days. Considering that that outfield was Cat 1 for nine out of the ten days, that was hell.</p>

              <p>Perhaps, we must make it compulsory that all MPS must serve NS,
                  regardless of gender, race,language or religion!</p>
              <p>At least the basic of standing still to show respect to the
                  flag, anthem and nation as common sense should be present for them.
                  Wait.. Perhaps their common sense is not that common after all....
                  :D</p>

              <p>Even foreign students stand to attention during flag raising/lowering ceremonies. They just don't sing the anthem or recite the pledge, that's all.</p>
              <p>I also get reminded of the time I was at a pasar malam in Chiangmai a few years ago. At 6 pm, the Thai national anthem started playing on the radio and everyone on the street froze.</p>
              <p>After the initial shock, my friends and I all stood to attention. The last thing you want is to show a blatant sign of disrespect in a crowded marketplace.</p>
              <p>I really cannot accept the MP's behaviour, especially since it was outright Facebooking and not just some minor scratching on the thigh.</p>

              <p>Good afternoon. Today's lesson commences after 6pm.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>As for the MP....her excuse makes it even worse. FB more important than anthem?</p>
              <p>When I was serving the nation, even if we were caught in the open with our barang, we were expected to keep stock still. Heck, even the banglas we used to excort would do the same.</p>
