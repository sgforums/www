            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Seancannot,<br><br>If your profile is right, then you're in your early 30's and not that old.  I know many older people without even S$30K of savings.<br><br>Depending on your lifestyle, S$30K in modern Singapore is not very much money.  (For my lifestyle, its not much because if I should need to change my car, the downpayment itself would take up more than half of the S$30K).<br><br>If I were you, I'd just keep the money in the bank.  Perhaps place a portion of it in savings (for liquidity) and the remainder in some short-term fixed deposit (for better returns).  I say short-term because I suspect that interest rates might go up in the next 1-2 years, so you may wanna pull it out and re-invest in the near future (unless, of course, you can find a long-term fixed deposit with flexible rates).<br><br>"Investing" in any kind of trading/business is only for those with EXTRA cash to spare (and to lose).  I wouldn't consider your life savings EXTRA cash.  Such trading type "investments" are not "investments" at all - they're in reality a gamble, a two-edge sword which can cut both ways (too risky in your case).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br><br>i agree with wat gentle rock said <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>you shouldn play with stocks n shares using savings..<br><br>if i were you, i'd hav a part of the money in endownment plans, cos basically, they offer higher interest rates than the ordinary savings acc.<br><br>or take out time deposits.<br><br>since u have 30k, u might wanna put say 20k in time deposits, of longer deposit periods. the remainin 10k, maybe set it as emergency cash? or have 3 k in time deposits as well, but of shorter deposit periods..<br><br>If you tink u'd wanna go for higher risk, there's time deposits with foreign currency.. but any changes in the exchange rate might mean a decrease in value at maturity.<br><br>*note: I didn really do any research on this topic, but said all the above based on what i think. and this is nowhere near professional. Just what I will do if i have that sort of money. and if it matters, i did a bit of finance in my poly days.*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Check out standard chartered new deposit offer today. They are giving 1.8% interest rate.<br><br>Also, if you want almost secure investment option, try buying Med-long term government bonds which is giving 3.21% right now @ <a href="http://www.fundsupermart.com" rel="nofollow">www.fundsupermart.com</a>. Note that early selling before bond maturity may result in a loss (as usual).<br><br>And if you plan to retire somewhere else or perhaps save for children education overseas (if you have any), consider putting them in a foreign currency deposit which can give you up to 5%++ interest (E.g. AUD).<br><br>And if you just want to take the easy option out, repay whatever loan you have (E.g. housing loan which is ~3% for bank loans and 2.6% for HDB loan, car loan which has effective 4-9% interest etc.. etc..).<br><br>Anything higher would probably be unsecure and involve more risk than an average person would be willing to take.</div>

Please seek professional advice for your own unique situation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>I have fren who lost their monies in insurance investment plan, unit trust what are your takes on them</strong><br><br>I am biased towards index funds and equities.

However even if they do outperform you may not realise the gain due the misc expenses.<br><br><strong>30 K is all my saving / no other $$$ beside 30 K </strong><br>Then it may be better to first adopt some of my suggestions in my earlier post.<br><br><strong>i have life insurance 50 K coverage </strong><br>We would just focus on life insurance. Purpose of Life insurance is to transfer risk (usually loss of income from your death) from your dependants (aged parents, spouse, children) to the insurer. So if you have no dependants, u dun really need insurance.<br><br>Wat is a adequate sum? It depends on your income and your age. if you earn 30k a year and can still work for 20years u may need 600k insurance coverage. As this would ensure that if u die now (touch woord) your dependants can still afford their current lifestyle for 20 years. theoritically speaking...<br><br>but as you grow older...you may wish to reduce your coverage provided you have catered for savings/investments. a good way to do this is using a 'layered' term insurance<br><br>say at age 30<br>you buy 1 5yr, 10yr, 15yr, 20yr, 25yr, 30yr term policy of 100k each. then just dun renew any of the policies.<br><br>doing this at age<br>30 u are covered for 600k<br>35 at 500k<br>40 at 400k<br>45 at 300k<br>50 at 200k<br>55 at 100k<br>60 no more coverage<br><br>at 60 if you have proper financal planning, you should do fine living on your returns from your investment portfoilo ;p for your dependants, if children they should be able to take care of themselves soon.<br><br>once again...please just use this information for information only <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Dont buy insurance related investments. These products are strcutured in a way that you are paying through your nose. Your agent wont tell you.<br><br>2. Dont go for banks because they control your exposure to a wider variety of investment products that is available.<br><br>3. A no-brainer is to buy into Index funds. Very low fees.<br><br>4. If you can withstand a few years, there are so many products out there. Contact a private financial planning firm for access to global products.</div>
