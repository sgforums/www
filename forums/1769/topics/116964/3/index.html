            <div class='col-md body'>when i was younger, looks mattered. they're not everything, but they mattered. i loved it when friends came up to me and whispered in my ear, "hey, he's cute huh, you lucky gal..." it was shallow, of course, but we all are, to a certain extent, especially at a time of juvenescence, naivete and exploration. but they're not everything. it'd have to be coupled with chemistry and mutual adoration. i loved him for who he is, not just what he looked like.<br><br>with age, one gets more forgiving and gets a broader perspective.<br><br>as i grow older, i find that looks still matter, albeit in a different way. i think now, all that really matters is i find him pleasing to me. i wanna look at him and feel my heart skip a bit every time it happens. and no, that does not mean he has to be devastatingly handsome, heart-breakingly smothering or anything like that. i guess it all boils down to that elusive thing called chemistry. someone whom you didn't know might appear to be an average joe at first glance, but with further contact and understanding, and consequently admiration/love, that same person could be transformed in your mind's eye into the most attractive person in the world.<br><br>i guess tho, in the same vein, if i find that person physically repulsive at first glance, it's probably highly unlikely i'd make an effort to really further the friendship, that's taking things to extremeties, of course...</div>
