Our trials and errors are excellent ways from which to learn more about ourselves, what we want, what we don't want, what should be done, what should be avoided etc. Without it, we'd be like pubescent teens, stumbling from one love disaster to another (not that with it we're that much better! if you know what i mean, hahahaaa...).<br><br>i guess what's important is to take these experiences in perspective and attempt to use it to our advantage, rather than convert it into damaging, excess baggage.<br><br>the biggest obstacle, in this sense, is yourself... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The things they claim make you think that they are such and such a person and that might lead you in the wrong direction for a while but then you slowly come to realise that who they really are is different from what they claim themselves to be and it is the who they claim to be that you have actually fallen in love with.<br><br>Self-deception or a lack of real understanding of self, which misleads others.

You can be optimistic but you also have to be realistic.  Knots in the heart not easy to undo.  It does take time sometimes... ultimately, time heals all wounds.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   Such things cannot be trivialised one.</div>
