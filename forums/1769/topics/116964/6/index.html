There are habits you never knew about each other, the different needs for privacy, different tolerance levels for various issues and circumstances, etc.<br><br>Ask any married couple... the first few months of living together can be the hardest.  It can be little things like ... he leaves his cups wherever he finishes his drink without bothering to clean up; she leaves her hair in the shower clogging up the drain without bothering to remove it; and the all-time favourite - squeezing the tube of toothpaste from the end or helter-skelter any which way you want, etc etc.<br><br>Love can be the lubricant that smooths the path but it does not eradicate all obstacles and challenges.  Love can bring two people together and bring on the commitment that 'No matter what happens, we're in this together and I will still love you' and that can actually help a couple surpass the trials they'll face.  But, love does not mean you'll have a problem-free time.</div>

(for my parents &amp; some other couples I know).  Each person has been brought up in a different way, with different expectations, so much so that when they marry another person, it's like stepping into a whole new 'culture' - so many strange things they didn't know about their other half now reveal themselves to the person once they start living together!<br><br>But, going thru' the ups and downs together, adjusting to each other's likes/dislikes, and still loving each other at the end of the day, is indeed a very admirable trait I find in lots of older couples.

Ability to make good conversation is top priority and most people I've met don't satisfy that)<br><br>If it wasn't easy for me to find someone I love, I'd say that now that I have, it does take effort to make things work.

You'll always need to put in effort, 'cause it cannot be "my way or the highway" in relationships.<br><br>But having tasted unrequited love (I wouldn't really call that love now, else it'd be cheapening what I have now), I'd say finding someone you love and who loves you is a big deal.

It's in everyone's definition of what love is. But when you can bring yourself to cheat on your partner, I don't think it was ever love, and I feel sad for those people. They don't seem to have much of a pool of emotions and feeling to draw upon..<br><br>And with each milestone in life, you appreciate and love your partner more and never cease to wonder... how come he loves you too..</div>
