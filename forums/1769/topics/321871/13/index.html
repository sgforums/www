              <p>Hanor!  I had that thought when I read their rants in this thread about PR's getting citizenship. </p>
              <p>It was all about escaping NS.  I was thinking KNS... I see such a positive transformation in my male friends after NS! </p>
              <p>The arrogant, upper middle class snob became more humble.</p>
              <p>The clueless,  heading nowhere, easygoing dude became more focused.</p>
              <p>The sickly-looking pale smurf became more masculine and manly.</p>
              <p>I mean, what's bad about learning to respect authority in critical moments?  What's awful about realising that one's action has implications on the entire troop and not just oneself?  What's horrible about being aware that one's mistakes can have fatal consequences? </p>
              <p>KNS... if Singapore ever got into a war situation, I will serve as a Nurse.  See all those gay-lo's kpkb'ing really buay tahan!</p>

              <p>Yeah, it's all about the attitude and nothing about the nationality.</p>
              <p>I think too many Singaporeans are too cushy.  They want to have an easy life without putting in any effort and when they can't, they kpkb. </p>
              <p>I mean, if the fuel issue really affects Singaporeans, don't drive lor!  Take the public transport to work!  It's not as if the public transport system is like Australia's where you have to climb hill, walk long distances and plan your trip the day before to make sure you get places on time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
