              can.  You can have different lifestyles at different stages of
              your life and everyone can choose different outcomes for
              themselves.</p>
              <p>I love the diversity here too.  You just never know who
              you'll meet in the streets!  I'm friends with people of so
              many nationalities and ethnicities here, life gets
              interesting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Singapore is a pressure cooker of a pigeon hole and a rat-race
              on top of it all.  One helluva cramped, mad zoo!

When the guild isn’t performing, these decisions are in question. Prone to shooting sprees, forum flame wars, and the rapid advancement/gearing of whatever toon the guild “needs”. If you can keep your mouth shut, he’ll go emo and quit before you get gkicked. Still, you do like the guy. Or did. Before he went crazy. See drunks, below.<br><br><strong>The GM's Significant Other</strong> - Okay, so he was going to have to quit but he tricked his SO into playing. She loves it. She's terrible. You'll effectively 24 man every boss. Count on 4 constructs in the raid, every attempt. She plays a Blood Elf.</p>

              <p>Two sides...</p>
              <p>I've met Aussies who have family living in Singapore and they are very happy.  Of course mah, can get domestic help, which is unheard of here unless you can afford machiam some kinda modern-day butler or employ the services of cleaning companies. </p>
              <p>They also say Singapore is safe for raising kids and there's no drugs and no rampant alcohol culture. </p>
              <p>There are also Aussies who prefer cheaper places like Thailand because they say it's cheaper to live there (and a few cheeky buggers say the girls are easy).  And Aussies who prefer Hong Kong because it is more vibrant. </p>
              <p>Overall, Singapore ranks pretty well on the list, unless cost is a huge factor.</p>

              <p>Let me try making myself clearer here...</p>
              <p>If it was someone else saying that he think sg girls are all cmi, i wouldnt bother. After all, why the hell would i care abt a stranger ? However, as it were, I know you. </p>
              <p>Yes, you may  "<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> do it in front of Fifi, i do it in front of churra, audlenelee and everyone who knows me in forums" </span></p>
              <p>I do not know whether they get offended or not. Or is it that they chose not to tell it to your face. Like I said before, I find it more.."correct" to say things to you if i do know you. So when I am telling you that I am offended that you keep dissing the majority of sg girls, thats a personal opinion. </p>
              <p>No, I am not gonna try to convince you that sg girls are not cmi. Some are, some are not. Unfortunately as it is for you, you seem to have encountered most of the wrong kind. </p>
              <p>Once again, let me repeat, when you say "most", although you had specifically excluded those you know, does not exclude those I know. And thats what made me extremely uncomfortable. And its with this that I chose to inform you of it. </p>
