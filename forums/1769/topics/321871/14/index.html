              <p>Yeah, it's all about the attitude and nothing about the nationality.</p>
              <p>I think too many Singaporeans are too cushy.  They want to have an easy life without putting in any effort and when they can't, they kpkb. </p>
              <p>I mean, if the fuel issue really affects Singaporeans, don't drive lor!  Take the public transport to work!  It's not as if the public transport system is like Australia's where you have to climb hill, walk long distances and plan your trip the day before to make sure you get places on time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>still fighting. i guess my CO has forwarded the email up to the higher manpower level.</p>
              <p>but the CO talked to the WO saying that if i can get out in september. better to prepare the paperwork now because we need 3 months notice for release.</p>
              <p>so if i prepare now, i can get out in september. if they are gonna wait till later to decide, its 3 months from then.</p>

              <p>The difference between the local receptionist and this PRC receptionist</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The local receptionist never smiles and when you ask for recommandations she says all are equally good blah blah blah and I got a few bad ones before. She is always extremely curt and doesn't make you feel welcome</p>
              <p>Now the PRC receptionist smiles and welcome you warmly. When you ask for recommandations she will tell you all is good but maybe you would like to try this person because she has more clients etc. When it's done, she ask you how is it etc and if there is someone standing outside the shop, she goes out to greet them and explain their packages.</p>
              <p>Now tell me if you are an employer who would you wanna hire???????</p>
              <p>I tell you the service lvl is Heaven and Earth difference!!!!</p>
              <p>And I talked to the PRC girl. She is pretty and intelligent and she has a double degree from (I forgot the uni name she told me) in USA.</p>
              <p>I asked her why is she doing this job she said she just finished her studies and as she is still deciding what to do, she took up this job to learn about the business.</p>

              <p>My boss was telling me this story of this Indian construction
              worker who was working on one of his properties</p>
              <p>He said 2 yrs ago he met his Indian construction worker who was
              helping to renovate one of his properties and he remembered him
              because he went the extra mile while the Singaporean workers bo
              chup that was why my boss remembered him</p>
              <p>Now it so happened my boss met him again on another property of
              his and this time he sees the same guy in a nice shirt with a tie
              because he got promoted to a supervisory level</p>
              <p>He was saying this is the kind of foreign workers Singaporeans
              are fighting their rice bowl with and most still whine and cry and
              bitch and tell their MP they need handouts -_-"</p>

              <p>A lot of Singaporeans whiners forget that it's not the fact that they are 'FT's who make them go ahead of the pack - it's the fact that these FT's actually do the freakin' job, and do it well!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I like working here.  Everyone more or less has a fair go.  Of course the Aussies would love to see more Caucasian Aussie nurses but they know that there's a shortage and they realise that having nurses, local or foreign, is better than having no nurses.  Anyways, most Aussies take to FT's much better than those Singaporeans.  Shameful, closed-minded mindset.</p>

              <p>OF course Australia is nowhere better!  Cannot even compare to Singapore when it comes to public transport!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>Do you realise how bad peak hour traffic is here?  It's horrible, no matter if you drive or take any form of public transport!  It's so bad that a lot of Melbournians plan their life to avoid peak hour traffic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I know my colleagues who drive or take public transport whined recently when the last two days of our course had to be changed to end at 5:30pm because they immediately raised a racket, saying, "Oh noooo!!  We have to deal with peak hour traffic!!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I think we're going to all  head to the pub on the last two days of the course so that they can all head home AFTER peak hour.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
