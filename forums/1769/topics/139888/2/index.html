But love and reliance are not equivocal. if i do not die without my man, it does not mean that i do not love him. in a relationship, we're both part of a partnership, as well as individuals unto ourselves.<br><br>I never denied the emotional aspect of love either. perhaps, again, you didn't read my post properly.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by neuros:</div><div class="quote_body">if we can't protect ourselves from the emotional hurt, at least take care of ourselves on the physical, monetary front.</div></blockquote>precisely because we are unable to safeguard our emotions in a relationship, having taken the "leap of faith" that you mentioned, all the more necessary it is for us to safeguard ourselves physicalyl and emotionally, no?<br><br>it is all very well to say when you love someone, you trust him or her. but again, who marries someone without trusting him or her? if we don't trust him/her, why marry? but again and again, we see that trust betrayed.<br><br>NOTE: i'm NOT saying don't trust your partner. i'm just saying be careful and leave something for yourself to fall back on.<br><br>we all think we're invincible. but we're not.<br><br>we can trust the other person and be relatively self-sufficient at the same point too, you know. i don't believe they're mutually exclusive. unless you're saying once i married and love the person i've to take all my money from him, spend every cent or return him every cent that i didn't spend such that i do not keep anything for myself. else that's not love? ridiculous notion, huh?<br><br>i'm willing to take the risk of emotional suffering if i really really love the person. if i love him, i probably can't help myself, committing to him spiritually and emotionally, entirely. but what i can help is being left high and dry in the event of any adversity happening. it's already painful enough coping with the feeling and hurt of betrayal - why make it more difficult for yourself by having no choice but to swallow it?<br><br>i'm also not saying to definitely not forgive the straying man (though i personally would find it extremely hard), but to forgive him because you love him and treasure the family/relationship is very different from forgiving him because you need the money to feed yourself and your kids. again, i'm not saying that the woman in the article is purely the latter but you cannot deny that there is that element. if given a choice (i.e. she can fully support herself and her kids) AND she still goes back to him, then i'd think their relationship might then be more worth saving and stands a better chance of starting afresh. otherwise, there might always be the resentment and sense of helplessness/bitterness even if she's physically by his side.<br><br>and no worries, i'm dun feel cornered. nor am i challenging you. just an exchange of viewpoints. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Voices // Tuesday, July 5, 2005<br><br>IT BOILS DOWN TO BOUNDARIES<br>Sacrificing all for the kids can be unhealthy<br><br>Annie Chua<br><br>I refer to the article, "Is there justice in marriage?" (July 1) and would like to offer another perspective to marriage.<br>.<br>People get married for various reasons and, for a first-world country where people are not fighting for the most basic needs, one would hope that communication, love, respect, sharing and joy fall into the realms of marriage.<br>.<br>Why do people start a family? One would hope that it would be for more than just procreation. It should be a continuation of a contented couple wanting offspring to enjoy the warmth and love within a family and radiated from a loving couple.<br>.<br>I see in Singapore, however, an interesting phenomenon. Not only is family life built around the children's schedules, but even grandparents are cast aside in the "busy-ness" of catering to their tuition and multiple extra-curricular activities.<br>.<br>Is it the failure of the education system Â— which most children can only keep up with by having extra tuition Â— or are parents going overboard to ensure that their kids are ahead of the game?<br>.<br>I have seen the mad driving around of children from one place to another. It is exhausting for the parents and boundaries must be set. Life is full of compromises: Would it not be better to accept that it may mean the kids achieve "B" grades instead of "A" grades?<br>.<br>The writer has accepted that she has no life and she is totally exhausted by all her child-rearing duties. Aren't children supposed to be a joy to add to a good marriage? When did they become a source of exhaustion?<br>.<br>In this mad rush around for the children, not only are the parents cast aside, but the grandparents are also relegated to secondary importance.<br>.<br>What are we teaching our children? Is it that when you grow old, you will be the next generation to be cast aside Â— for the sake of the children's children?<br>.<br>Our priorities appear to be misplaced.<br>.<br>What about making it a priority to keep the family intact? Has the writer ever made herself or her marriage a priority and set boundaries for the children?<br>.<br>Why is there always at least one child sleeping between them? This family has obviously lost some boundaries as individuals, as a couple and as a family.<br>.<br>It is wonderful to be self-sacrificing, but one can only love others if one learns to love oneself.<br>.<br>If you don't love yourself, how do you know how to love your husband and to love your children?<br>.<br>I agree with the writer that she does not have a marriage. What she has is a man on whom she depends for a living Â— for both herself and the children. He obviously sees it the same way. He is not important; his needs are not looked after. She argues that she has been working so hard for the family. But is that what her husband expects of her Â— simply concentrate on the kids and ignore all else Â— or is that her definition of a good wife and mother?<br>.<br>When a wife sees the husband as a meal ticket, he will probably see her as just an instrument for mothering his kids. You get as much out of life as you put into it.<br>.<br>The contented marriages I have witnessed are those where both partners respect each other individually and as a couple. They make time to go out once a week or, if time does not permit, once a month.<br>.<br>They understand that unless they keep happy, they are putting their family in danger, and the children will suffer in consequence.<br>.<br>In my humble opinion, it all boils down to boundaries.<br>.<br>There are individual boundaries; couple boundaries; nucleus family boundaries; and, in Asia, extended family boundaries.<br>.<br>Singapore is at a very interesting phase because we became a first-world country very quickly.<br>.<br>So parents of this generation find that their parents' way of child-rearing Â— which is mostly self-sacrificing in a much poorer economic climate Â— does not work now. Yet, the Western way of parenting also feels uncomfortable.<br>.<br>Go to a countryside in a Western nation and you will find the so-called "old-fashioned way" of parenting, which is very much a mixture of the so-called "values" from the East and the West: The values of respect, common courtesy to all and the genuine interest and care for people are all that is needed to make relationships of all levels work.<br>.<br>This piece was contributed by a Today reader.

I guess this problem will be more prevalent as there is less negative stigma associated with being divorced. Not to forget, a lot of Singaporeans marry for the wrong reasons - They marry for a house. I think some are not even ready but have to marry but carry on for the flat. Really dumb I think since there is a surplus of houses now.<br><br>Also, I guess as one grows older, one gets more cynical  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

It is true that as we socialise more, we might end up becoming more and more 'fussy'.  We start to want someone with, say, 'Lisa's body plus Meagan's face and Cheryl's dimples with Lina's boobs and Isabel's happy-go-lucky nature' or, for the girls, 'Jason's face with Den's body combined with Bernard's intelligence and Leslie's maturity with JF's easy-going nature'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>We start to be picky as a few of us go around looking for the 'best'.  It's not enough that David is a very kind man - he's a tad quirky; and Lucy, well, she's a smart girl but she's plump and not too pretty.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Sounds familiar?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>And it's true how couples give up more easily now.  You never know, if you weather this storm just long enough, you might realise that it's calm waters ahead.  Don't sweat the small stuff, I guess.  When you decide to be part of a couple, you have to learn to give up control and not place your expectations on the other party and stifle him/her.  I guess we can't be rigid either because as we grow older, we'll change and we should give each other the leeway to develop, but be lovingly stern enough to gently rein each other in when anyone becomes wayward.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by elindra:</div><div class="quote_body">The thing is, it is very easy to divorce these days and people don't really want to put in the effort to work out their problems.

Sooner or later, you'll settle down, things will start to become routine and 'boring' as you start to relax in each other's presence and stop trying hard to keep each other entertained.<br><br>I've heard married couples say that the first year after marriage was one of the hardest because that's when the lovey-dovey dating stuff ended and the realities of having to compromise and live with each other's different living habits, good or otherwise, sets in.<br><br>I look at happily married couples and I see that over the years, they've not only learnt to compromise but they've learnt to come together to develop a common 'style' or preference.  It's really sweet to see - two different individuals coming together to become a single unit.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
