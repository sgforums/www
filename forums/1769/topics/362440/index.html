              <p>is an internship at a bank counted as a job? i did get paid mthly though. LOL. well if that's not counted, i carried on working for them after my internship for about 2 mths. i was paid roughly $3000 gross, and of course i loved the job!</p>
              <p>it involved nothing more than clicking around the computer, processing reports that can be easily done with just one click.. LOL.</p>

              <p>i think it was about selling those CNY cards and mini transistor radios.</p>
              <p>we had to prey on unsuspecting aunties and uncles to get em to buy them off us. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"> </p>
              <p>It was a pretty good learning experience, i must say. cos it teaches u that to make one single sale, u probably have to tackle around 10 ppl... pay is peanuts. cant remember whether there was a basic... but it pays per item u sell i think... </p>

              <p>At my previous job, I was introduced to Iraqis. Many of them live in my corner of the world. OMG, when it comes to purchasing stuff, they are terrible (not bashing, just fact) . Not only will they haggle to the nth degree but they bring their entire family with them! This one man, brought his mother, sister and wife, 15 minutes before closing time. He tried to haggle but I was on to him. Every step of the way, he kept asking for discount after discount after discount. I was gracious and kept saying, sorry. Just as I was ringing up the transaction, he said, how about giving me your employee discount? I told him that if I did, it would be my last day on the job. To which he replied, "I don't care as long as I get a better discount". !!!!!!</p>
