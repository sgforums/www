              <p>At my previous job, I was introduced to Iraqis. Many of them
                  live in my corner of the world. OMG, when it comes to purchasing
                  stuff, they are terrible (not bashing, just fact) . Not only will
                  they haggle to the nth degree but they bring their entire family
                  with them! This one man, brought his mother, sister and wife, 15
                  minutes before closing time. He tried to haggle but I was on to
                  him. Every step of the way, he kept asking for discount after
                  discount after discount. I was gracious and kept saying, sorry.
                  Just as I was ringing up the transaction, he said, how about giving
                  me your employee discount? I told him that if I did, it would be my
                  last day on the job. To which he replied, "I don't care as long as
                  I get a better discount". !!!!!!</p>

              <p>Hey, count yourself lucky.  I gotta live next to that kinda crap.  The lady next door just brought her mother over from Baghdad and every weekend the whole friggin' clan swarms over and clogs up the driveway with their cars and raise seven brands of hell. Gawd dammit, it was the Yanks that invaded Iraq - why do we get the payback?!</p>
              <p>They've just got no concept of decency or personal space - even the folks from across the street bitch to me about how her relos infest the neighbourhood.  Oh, and she also decided that she was going to paint her house a different colour from the other four units on the lot - that caused all kinds of grief at the body corporate meeting.</p>
              <p>Mind you, she can't friggin' drive either.  The guys who used to live there never had any trouble getting their Landcruiser up and down the driveway, but noooooo, she's gotta just about reverse through my lounge room window to get her Mazda 2 out.  Jesus friggin' wept - Sash and I call her Schumacher.</p>

              <p>My first job wasn't really a job. It involved writing newspaper columns from home, courtesy of a friend's recommendation, and I got $250 for each one that was published. My cousin told me that it was a lower-than-usual rate, but I'd only just finished the A-Levels, and I stopped when I entered NS.</p>
              <p>When I was looking for my second (and current) job, I wanted one that was going to add value to my portfolio. I found it at an art studio, working with kids from a mixture of backgrounds. I was rather apprehensive during the trial period but they took me in anyway. Maybe I'm slow, but I still learn plenty of new things about teaching and handling children and face challenges occasionally.</p>
              <p>I've since found out from my classmates that it's not the best-paying art studio around, but the conditions (bosses and student-teacher ratios) are not the worst either.</p>

              <p>Doesn't Sg have a minimum age law? I'm surprised so many of you started working at 13! Here in the States you can work at 16 only after you submit paperwork at your school and your employer can only let you work certain hours.</p>

              <p>I remember me going for a interview at Marina Bay Golf &amp; Country Club after 'O' levels holiday and I got in.  My friend didnt.  Her 16th birthday was in Dec.</p>
              <p>Incidently, that Marina Bay golf club job was my third part time job.  And it lasted me quite a while, cos I went from Waitress to Cashier.....then cashier to multiple restaurants.  Then hor.....was doing my dip in IT, working as videographer and doing the cashiering. </p>
