            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Cody was only about 2-3 months old when I saw him huddled at the ground floor lift landing with his sibling.  They weren't in good condition, especially the sibling, who later died of ill health.  Cody had an eye infection and looked really dirty.  But he was really affectionate, running over to me when I squatted down and meowed at him.  Cute adorable little kitten!<br><br>I hurried to the shopping centre nearby to get some eyedrops from the vet to help that little fella.  By the time I got back, I couldn't find the kittens anymore.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>For the next few days, I kept looking out for them then voila!  on the 3rd day, I saw Cody, sitting all by himself, dirtier and sorrier looking than previously!  His eye infection was so bad, there was heavy crusting on both eyes and worse, one pupil actually looked a bit clouded over, a sure sign of a bad infection.  I stopped in my tracks, not sure if I should approach him because he was really dirty and it would be unhygienic to bring him home.  Yet, I couldn't bear the thought of this little kitten going blind when there's something that I can do for him so I scooped the little one up in my hands and held him out at arm's length as I hurried home with him.  It's close to impossible to have a firm grip on a squirming, struggling cat when you're holding him out at arm's length so I eventually ended up holding him close to my chest where he seemed to struggle less.  I was conscious of dirtying my tee and denim skirt but what else could I do?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So, I brought him home and gave him a nice bath, first thing.  Then, I gave him a nice meal of catfood to welcome him.  Next, eyedrops and eardrops!<br><br>He made tremendous progress and his eye infection cleared within the week!  He is the most affectionate and loving cat of all the cats I've ever had.  Maybe, he knew that I had rescued him!  hehe!  He follows me all over the house and even comes running briskly when called.  He quickly found a place in my heart and we shared many special moments together.  I was happy to have company - living by myself previously, now with Cody's companionship, I no longer felt alone.  I lost my paranoia of people breaking into my house and of ghosts and evil spirits lurking.  Prolonged loneliness does make one kinda jumpy regarding safety / security issues and also, being alone with an active imagination sure conjures up all sorts of possible ghost encounters!  hehehe!  Now, if there was a spirit, I'd know because cats can see spirits and by their reaction, I can tell.  So in the meantime, I can be assured that there are no spirits in my house.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>He grew up quickly and became strong.  He impressed me by how intelligent he was.  Then, the stunner came when he learnt how to unlatch the windows!  He always attempted this when I'm working on Night Duty.  First time I came home to see my bedroom window open, I panicked but he was safe and sound within my house.  He got bolder and bolder.  And also, he started to mature and had an urge to roam.  I could've had him sterilised sooner but I had budget restrictions and was planning to do so two weeks later.  Little did I know that that would be too late.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>The next three times he escaped, I always found him either along the corridor outside hiding amongst some neighbour's junk, or along the corridors upstairs.  It amazes me how people can put so much junk outside their houses but I was appreciative of that at the time cause it helped my Cody get cozy as he spent the night outdoors.<br><br>Today, I was aghast as I saw that he had chosen to unlatch the window right next to my main door!  Anyone could've just opened my door by reaching in through the window and burglarised my house!!!  After securing the window, I went searching for Cody frantically but he was nowhere to be found.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I'm not sure I can take him back either... now that he has a taste of the outdoors, I'm sure he'll make repeated attempts to escape.  And this puts my security at risk.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I already miss him so much!  Cody was truly my darling cat!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   I hope he's safe... and thinks of me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Choosy cat.<br><br>I'm worried for your cat as well.  Hope it's safe.  Rainy season, just hope that it wont get wet and cold and starving.  Dun just sit around, go out and search for it.  It won't go far i hope.  i remember once I found my cat 10 days later, few streets away from my home.</div>
