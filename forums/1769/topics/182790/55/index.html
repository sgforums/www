I have to say that even though I only understand a smattering of Japanese, those shows were really enjoyable. They have one called Omoshiro Recycle about everyday people with ingenious recycling ideas. Then there are the endurance shows and the million yen shows. Some were hilarious. I know of the shows you mentioned. Those like Top 100 Best Ramen, etc, those I really liked. The Japanese are really cheeky too.

They had people, usually pretty girls, who wanted a plug for their magazine spreads. They would get these girls to get into a see through tub full of hot water (in the summer) and icy cold water (in the winter). The longer they stayed in the tub, the more time they earned to plug their product. But of course, before the girls could get into the tub, they had to change into bikinis. So right there and then, they are offered a selection of bikinis. Then a screen made up of towels descends from above and usually these girls (usually 3) have just 45 seconds to change. Once up, the screen falls to the floor. Doesn't matter if the girls are done. More often than not, you'll have girls who haven't gotten their tops on yet. They either cover themselves with the bikini top or the host will throw them a tiny towel. The hamsup cameraman loves to zero in on the poor girl's bosom and crotch too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

When I first got there and saw the infamous Japanese school girl, alamak! Their skirts are hiked up so short! You can almost see the underwear! Then imagine, in the dead of winter, how can they not feel cold? And they're always in their uniforms, even on Sundays.
