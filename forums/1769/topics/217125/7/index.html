Anyway the surge in singaporeans migrating to australia is mostly trigger by the financial crisis and recession. Pretty sure that more and more people will be thinking twice about leaving this country now because singapore economy is recovering so well and there so much buzz in the city right now.<br><br>I was with several european clients last night, everybody was saying about how lucky we are to be living in this city and I do agree with them totally. As long as you are on the right side of the law, you will like the system we have in place in Singapore.<br><br>Then we started talking about democracy and freedom of speech etc, and we all agree that what singapore need is guided democracy not full democracy like in india, USA, or Europe, because will not survive in this world, e.g. just look at what is happening to VW plant in belgium right now. Union got stronger, demand got higher and VW finally decided to shut down the plant and retrech about 4000 highly paid work force.<br><br></div>
