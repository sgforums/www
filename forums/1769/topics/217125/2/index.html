In Melbourne, one can easily get a brand new litte car for Toyota Echo for A$15k or less.

The younger the driver (16-25 yo) the more expensive the car insurance will become.<br><br>As for maintaining the car, since labour is generally expensive in Oz so regardless the cheap spare parts, the service can easily cost from $100 - $1000 depending on the type of the service required for the car.<br><br>It is not too bad at the end of the day if it can take you from A to B and you get plenty of pleasure out of driving the car.<br><br>I think a car is a must if you are planning to stay in Oz permanently for not all places can be reached using public transport.
