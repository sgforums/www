You are talking crap when you are saying that you cant make a decently living without being a scholar in Singapore.<br><br>Opportunities? Hell yes, loads of job opportunity in Australia for foreign talents like you to take up jobs which white men are not interested. Isnt that the equivalent for filipinos taking nursing job in Singapore?  I guess some people just prefer to lick a white butt to wiping an asian arse<br><br></div></blockquote>Ai yo so defensive .....am I adding salt to your wound?<br><br>For your information - when I say local idiot - I refer to myself at the point when I was in Singapore.  Why so sensitive? Even other people know I am being sarcastic.<br><br>Economic - hello ...paying off a HDB flat with only a 99 year old lease and paying it off for the rest of my working life is not my version of decent living ....worrying about job security with all the young cheaper foreign "talent" hovering around me  like vultures is not my version of decent living in Singapore . Of course lah ...MOST of us are not as lucky as YOU are to get a 10k salary in Singapore and who could boast about some big continental car. So we have to go out lor ...what's your problem with that?<br><br>If I can afford a nice freehold title house in Australia where I can pass it down to the future generations , if I can afford to buy a nice car without worrying about paying it off for the rest of my life - Why so unhappy about it? Unless of course , you want the rest of us to be poorer than you so that you can feel like a BIG MAN among us ...ok lor ...speechless lah.<br><br>Opportunities - FYI there are asians in Australia , there are caucasians and there are certainly arabs/lebanese/turkish people around. Don't tell me you are so White-sighted - you are likely to wipe their asses more than I .  Health care is a right for everyone , not JUST for the so called <span style="font-style: italic;"> noveau rich </span> like you and asians tend to be the ones who tend to be more well to do than the whites  in Australia. And I am not a nurse anymore .... So don't even presume to assume.</div>
