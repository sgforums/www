Forget the Plane ticket issue . Let's look at the " I can come anytime through sponsorship because of my brother" . Sorry - that is utter BS. Anyone can check www.immi.gov.au to tell you FAT CHANCE.<br><br>Your parents , judging from your cryptic remarks , are in Singapore and you have one brother who is an australian citizen . Not sure about whether you have children but as long as your parents and/or siblings still in Singapore - it automatically disqualifies you from applying . So who do you want to kid ?<br><br>Your cover is blown . Big deal when you ONLY just happen to own (and note) a part of some property in Australia. Sorry to disappoint you but I happen to own a property as well . No big deal, anyone with alot of hardwork and determination can do it in Australia, I even know of a friend who has 5 properties at my age now and he worked hard for it  - I manage to buy my freehold property faster in Melbourne than some 99 year lease HDB flat. First million in Singapore my foot- I reckon my luck is better with lottery in Australia than earning my first million in Singapore.<br><br>My parents own more than 1 property in Australia as sole owners  - so do you want to continue about my poor parents who "have to give up everything in Singapore" to come here and babysit me?<br><br>So don't bother boasting about your stupid share of a single property - there are EVEN MORE people out there who own more (like 6 properties or so)  than my parents do ,and <strong> MUCH MORE than you do ( a what again? 0.something share of probably a condominium since foreigners cannot buy land if the title deed is to have a foreigner's name) </strong> . So don't even bother telling us about some seaside mansion you might have.</div>

Again?  I'll give you the same answer I gave you the last time:<br><br>If you want to try and prove that you've got the ticket, don't let me stop you.  Don't expect anything in return  from me for doing so, because you're the one trying to prove that you're not a BS artist.  Remember, it's actually funnier for me if you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't</span> try to prove anything.<br><br>For all your claims of being some business whiz, I gotta say that you're pretty hopeless.  The deal you are proposing here is effectively that I have to do something distasteful so that you can try to reedeem yourself from that nameless-ticket fiasco.  Even a school kid would see that there's nothing in it for anyone who takes up that kind of deal, so don't try convincing anyone that you're any kind of wheeler or dealer.  Just stick to your day job and clean that spilt mee siam off that table. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Of course, I fully expect that you're going to do exactly what you did last time, i.e. bluster and posture while you panic in the background and look for the first opportunity to weasel out.  I'll save myself a lot of time here by spelling it out for you right here and now.  Don't miss this bit because I'm not responding to your begging after this:<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Don't beg me for anything because the answer will be NO. </strong></span><br><br>Actually, if you want to cry uncle so that I give you the chance to prove yourself, I might consider it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><span style="color: red;"></span></div>
