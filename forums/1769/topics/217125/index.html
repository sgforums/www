The only references to working life in Singapore I have come from chatting with other Singaporeans on this forum, and from what I can gather, I'm pretty glad to not be part of the rat race there.<br><br>2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Do u miss Singapore?</span><br><br>I miss my parents, who are still in Singapore.<br><br>I miss some of the friends from my childhood days in Singapore.<br><br>I miss the food in Singapore, though not as much now as when I had just left there.<br><br>I do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> miss the heat and humidity of Singapore.<br><br>I do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> miss the perpetually overcrowded buses and trains of Singapore's public transportation system.<br><br>I do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> miss the outrageously overpriced housing in Singapore.<br><br>I do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> miss the ridiculous cost of private vehicle ownership in Singapore.<br><br>I do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> miss living in fear under a paranoid, unaccountable and dictatorial regime so completely out of touch with reality that it thinks rap and hip-hop are viable means of communication with its constituents.<br><br>3. <span style="font-style: italic;">How do u like it over at your new country?</span><br><br>It is by no means perfect. We have a very serious illegal immigration problem about which the government appears unable or unwilling to do anything. We also have serious social problems stemming from a permanently unproductive, underperforming and violent ethnic minority group that sees itself as having the right to live off the teat of public welfare.<br><br>That said, you'd be hard-pressed to find another country with as many freedoms, opportunities and constitutionally-protected rights as the US. Hard work is usually commensurately rewarded, and there's a greater chance of your being able to live your "ideal" life here at a much saner pace than could be hoped for in Singapore.<br><br>4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Is easy to get a job?</span><br><br>If you are an American, generally yes. Jobs are available if you have the proper qualifications and/or experience, and are willing to adjust your expectations as the job market dictates.<br><br>There.

I mean, there is no perfect place in this world where you'll be 100% happy and you really have to take the good with the bad and the big question is, when you weigh in the good against the bad, which stacks up more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>For me, I am happier here overall.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do u miss Singapore? </span><br><br>But of course!  My family and my buddies and friends are all there!<br><br>I also miss the kopitiams and food courts and restaurants and in general, the fact that you can eat out cheaply.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   I miss all the sinful local foods!<br><br>I miss the sights.  I miss hanging out with friends at the Esplanade by Singapore River, gorging myself silly at the Makansutra place near it or at the Food Court in Marina, hanging out with buddies at the... gosh, have forgotten the name of that lovely coffee place that serves lovely food and desserts as well (branches in Great World City, Holland V and below Shaw Lido).<br><br>I miss going out with my parents for dinner at one of the hawker centres.  Dad always brings us out to the best food places.<br><br>I miss the conveyor sushi places.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I miss the wonderful fresh and lovely seafood in the zhi char or restaurants in SG.  ANd oh man, compared to eating out here, the price is cheap, man!  (I shall never complain about food in SG being 'expensive' again, ever!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>I miss the relatively convenient public transport, esp the affordable taxi service!  (I shall never complain about public transport and taxis in SG ever again!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  )<br><br>I miss the shopping belt!  The sales aren't so fantastic but oh, the range of products you can get there!!  SG imports from all over and the extensive variety you have is simply incredible!!<br><br>However, what I do not miss is living in HDB flats where your neighbours do the "aaaaaaack... PUI!" thang!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Also do not miss the crowds, shall never miss being pushed and shoved!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Don't miss the shallow SG men there who have very typical notions of 'beauty'.  Yawn!  And definitely do not miss how harsh the general public in SG can be on people who are 'of generous proportions', nosiree!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Don't miss the working conditions for my profession back home.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How do u like it over at your new country? </span><br><br>I like it!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   I can take the bad with the good.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Here, I'm a 'second class citizen' and yes, I do feel discriminated against in certain ways.  THere are also more drunks and drug addicts about, esp in my neighbourhood late at night on weekends, esp.  The public transport system isn't so fantastic and if you don't drive and don't own a car, you're very isolated in your own li'l niche.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But...<br><br>I like how FREE I feel!<br><br>Nobody tells me I'm fat anymore and they genuinely do not categorise me as 'fat' at all!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> And there are men who choose their women based on character and they have had fat and skinny girlfriends before so you know they walk the talk, unlike in SG where it's mostly just hot air.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I like the sales here!  They are really sales!  I mean, if things are 60-80% off, that is a SALE!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I LOVE my new pay, compared to what I used to get in SG!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   Enuff said!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I love how you can be free to be who you want to be and not feel like you have to conform to a norm over here.<br><br>I like the healthier lifestyle I live now, in part due to all the walking I have to do, and in part due to the fact that quick and easy lard-laden, fried foods are no longer available or if available, aren't cheap and accessible.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I like the possibilities I have.

Never migrate to a country in order to 'escape' an existing problem because like Gedanken said once before, "It will soon catch up on you".<br><br>No one country is perfect and I don't think you can find Utopia on the atlas!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   (If you do, tell us and we'll all flock there!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )  You have to take the good with the bad and like any marriage, you have to make compromises cause sometimes, you find yourself in a win-win deal, sometimes, it's more of a win-lose and you just have to stomach the fact that there are imperfections.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Are you currently taking any step to address that shortfall, like taking driving lessons and saving up for a vehicle? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Imagine: if you had your own private vehicle, you wouldn't be at the mercy of public transit. You''d be able to go places, meet people, go on dates, transport bulky objects (not necessarily your date), participate in 'road rage' incidents, get speeding and parking tickets, be in traffic accidents, etc.<br><br>Yes, all this and more could be yours, if only you'd get off that couch and go buy your very own <strong>CAR</strong>! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
