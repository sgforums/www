This is amusing<br><br>Under sponsorship program , you are not a priority - that is a cold hard fact. Spouse, Children are priorities . After those two ,Parental categories - then you have the contributory scheme and the wait long long scheme - of which the first is pay up and go in fast .<br><br>There is very limited allocated places for other family migrants AND you have to prove that you are dependent on them or you have some compelling reason. You can wait up to 5- 10 years.  Who are you trying to bluff here? Shows that you know nothing.  If you knew something - you would have said you would come through the business migration route  . Next time -want to bluff - don't bother - your cover will be blown.<br><br>As for my parents - continue calling me selfish lor ...I don't care ...they got their own assets and investments to manage in Australia  and unfortunately those are just not as simple as <strong> 0.something part </strong>  of a  property you claim to own.<br><br>As for australians getting out -ever heard of Dual Citizenship? that is smart.<br>Now if someone say they are going to pay you 5 times higher , all your living expenses , give you a car to drive around, a comfy condo to live in  but you have to move to their country ....WHY NOT?  Surely you must already know that some places worship the foreign talent like GODs and treat their locals like idiots.</div>
