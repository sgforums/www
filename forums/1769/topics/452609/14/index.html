              <p>The most scary part is that MBT is but a product of the current system....</p>
              <p>As for houses, as you guys might recall, I did a study on affordability.</p>
              <p>My conclusion was that, segmenting the PUBLIC housing market was going to lead to unhappiness simply because you can't call it PUBLIC, when some of it is designed to be out of reach for the average folks!</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, and what I found to be sad, was that my conclusion was rejected by my fellow group-mates who insisted that it was better to segment the market because <em>that way, the rich and poor get allocated what they prefer more efficiently.</em></p>
              <p>That, is the reason why the MIW is still in power.</p>

              <p>Like I'll say before... COE has a stupid cycle... But it got out of hand as for 1 moment they decided not to use the real proper figures to tally the quota for the next Qtr or H1/2...</p>
              <p>If you ask me, well one fine day, the best solution is buy parking lot just to own a car instead... simple as that...</p>
              <p>as for public housing... so if ppl have to move house all because of their workplace etc, sell back to zheng hu? Zheng hu sell it out directly?</p>
              <p>Now, so we want the govt to take charge of everything? So to play e politics around? I'm not into consent of this matter either.</p>
              <p>Any case, the public housing for matured estates has really gotten out of hand... I'll say this also, (to those who accuses of booklicking, buzz off)... You tell me to stay at Jurong West BTO and I'll tell u I seriously dun mind as there's proper amenities like markets etc...</p>
              <p>That's still a house...</p>
              <p>MBT has a lot of things to explain, for each n every development decision that was made... not just over housing...</p>
