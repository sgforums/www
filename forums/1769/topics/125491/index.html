            <div class='col-md body'>New York delivery man stuck in lift for 3 days<br><br>NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Chinese food delivery man has been found trapped in a broken elevator, more than three days after he was reported missing, police said.<br><br>Ming Kung Chen, 35, who worked for the Happy Dragon restaurant in the Bronx, was reported missing late Friday when he did not return an hour after setting out on a delivery.<br><br>Police said he was found on Tuesday morning and was hospitalised with dehydration. Police were unable to question him immediately because he did not speak English.<br><br>Newspapers had reported the Chinese community feared that Chen, who is from Fuzhou province in China, might have been a victim of robbery or foul play by immigrant smugglers.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Poor guy.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
