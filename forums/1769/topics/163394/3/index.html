It means to think of the welfare of the other first rather than our own.  I suspect that if we start with this premise of thinking for the other first, a lot of problems will become unimportant and will go away.<br><br>Also, for those who plan to get married and want things to work out, hang out with people who treasure their marriage and have made theirs work.  From my experience, I've learnt a lot from such couples.  Most of us tend to have a 'chameleon' response in our social settings and we tend to adopt the behaviours/language/habits etc of the people that we habitually associate with.  As such, if we want our marriage to be great, hang out with couples that have great marriages and learn from their mistakes! :-)<br><br>siginah</div></blockquote>Good points raised!<br><br>In Mandarin, they call it 'Jing4 Zhu1 Zhe3 Ci4, Jing4 Mo4 Zhe3 Hei1', literally meaning that if you immerse yourself in black ink, you'll turn black.  Figuratively, it means that if you hang out with a particular group of people, you will slowly become like them as they start to influence you, either subtly or otherwise.<br><br>That's so true, isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for the bit about long-suffering... ah, that was precisely what I've been trying to say throughout this thread!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

It seems pointless listing the virtues that make a man good husband material when the woman herself lacks the qualities to make a good wife.<br><br>Incidentally, could anyone shed light on a question I have? A friend of mine's decree nisi comes through in a few months but apparently a judge has yet to make decisions on custody and division of matrimonial assets. She isn't planning on looking for accommodation of her own coz she feels that until all $ due to her from the matrimonial home is in her pocket, she has the right to stay on in the house indefinitely.  Is this correct? I'm of the impression once the divorce is finalised, she would need to move out regardless of how much $ is due to her (of the two, she is the one who has to leave the house).
