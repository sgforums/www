            <div class='col-md body'>Just woke up with a start because I was dreaming of working in an American MNC and there was this new expat colleague from the US here with his wife, both working in the same firm.  The man turned to me one day and confided that his marriage is on the rocks and that they're heading for divorce.  Funny I'd dream of such a thing...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Maybe, it was cause after night duty this morning, a colleague was talking to me about her failing marriage and impending divorce.  She also told me to be very very careful when choosing a marriage partner and to be doubly vigilant and keep both eyes wide open when choosing a mate, but after marriage, to keep one eye closed to his faults and what-not.<br><br>Scary... more and more couples around us are resorting to divorce as a final option to end unhappy marriages.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   What's happening?  Is it cause they both made the wrong choices right from the start?  Is it cause we now have a thwarted and warped concept of love and marriage?  Or, is it cause we are now more self-serving, impatient, and no longer long-suffering?<br><br>Sometimes, I'm really glad that I'm still single!  At least, I won't have a partner who'll give up on me and want to walk out on me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  That would surely rip me apart!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's also because the woman have more options open. She no longer rely on the man to bring home the bread and can support herself.<br><br>The other reason is that divorce is no longer a dirty word. Being divorced doesn't carry the negative stigma associated with it in the past.<br><br>The problem is that it is so easy to get a divorce that people no longer sit down and try to iron out their problems. People start to have the "Not happy divorce lor" mentality.<br><br>Ultimately I think that it is a lose-lose situation for both as you really invest alot for your marriage. Especially so if there are kids  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Getting married is just the beginning, and right after that comes the hard work of making things work, and as both live together, adapting to each other and their families, the expected obligations, etc. Suddenly, you're thinking and making decisions not just for yourself anymore, but for your other half as well, and sometimes considerations/sacrifices too have to be made to cater for what his family might think or expect.<br><br>I believe communication cannot be overrated - I find it's always the key to building up the close bonds and furthering mutual understanding of each other (their changing needs and expectations) as both develop and grow throughout the marriage. Sadly, I find that it is usually the breakdown of communication and/or the lack of such a mutual understanding which leads to the beginning of the end of the marriage.<br><br>Just my 2cts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
