            <div class='col-md body'>I think the effect of divorce on Kids can be overhyped. Young kids react depending on the behaviour of those around them. So if the relatives starts gg poor kids, aiyoh so sad...etc... then surely one should not be surprised if the kid turns out to be 'special'.<br><br>In the case of older kids, I would expect them to be able to handle the situation. Now, my parents almost went through a divorce when i was about 12 - 13 (i think) and again when i was about 15. I was pretty passive throughout it all. My relatives were acting all serious asking me such silly qns as "when the court asks who will you say you want to stay with" (something that i now think is highly irresponsible for clearly they are putting pressure on me to make their choice).<br><br>I dunno, i think i turned out alright. i hope.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Anyway, in a Divorce, the court regards the welfare of the child as paramount and will make its decision regarding alimony, housing, custody etc accordingly.  I really dun think divorce really affects a child that much anymore.<br><br></div>

Because families are the basic units, the threads, if you will, that is woven to form the fabric of society.  Families are the basic building blocks of society too!<br><br>Look at the US - divorce is rampant, having stepparents only to see them divorce again and have yet another set of stepparents and stepsiblings over and over again can be so traumatising.  It results in individuals wiht a whole host of emotional / psychological problems who in turn, might just bring their problems into their own marriages.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   It's like a vicious cycle.  How can a sturdy building be constructed on a weak and shaky foundation?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Of course, in many other places, divorce is not as common as in the US, neither does remarrying occur as often.  So, the problems faced in the US might have some sorta multiplier effect in action.  We definitely don't have such a bad situation here.  Well, for now!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

It means to think of the welfare of the other first rather than our own.  I suspect that if we start with this premise of thinking for the other first, a lot of problems will become unimportant and will go away.<br><br>Writing is definitely easier than doing, but if you don't try, you will never improve.  Just as we don't wait for all the traffic lights to be green in our favour before we start a trip, there's no reason to expect a smooth ride in marriage either. :-)<br><br>Also, for those who plan to get married and want things to work out, hang out with people who treasure their marriage and have made theirs work.  From my experience, I've learnt a lot from such couples.  Most of us tend to have a 'chameleon' response in our social settings and we tend to adopt the behaviours/language/habits etc of the people that we habitually associate with.  As such, if we want our marriage to be great, hang out with couples that have great marriages and learn from their mistakes! :-)<br><br>siginah</div>
