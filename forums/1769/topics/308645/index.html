              <p>What apt timing!  We were just discussing whether we bought branded fashion goods in a separate thread here when lo and behold, in the Herald Sun on Saturday (23 Feb 2008), there was an article exposing the luxury fashion industry!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">  Here's the article - it might cause you to think twice before spending all that money on atas brands from now on :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>TO HELL IN A HANDBAG, Dina Rosendorff</strong></p>
              <p>Dana
              Thomas flits between fluent French and her native English as she
              negotiates with a parisian taxi driver while doing this long-distance
              phone interview.</p>
              <p>The American author is on her way to a photo
              shoot for the sleeve of the paperback version of her best-selling book,
              Deluxe : How Luxury Lost Its Lustre.</p>
              <p>The high-end world of fashion hasn't been the same since Thomas peeled off the gloss to expose a decidedly unglamorous reality.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Consumers
              were shocked to realise many of their most coveted brands were actually
              cheaply mass-produced in secret chinese sweatshops for a fraction of
              their hefty price tags. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>We were horrified to learn
              there were tricks to get around a "made in China" label; by sewing it
              into an inside pocket or adding a bag's handle in Italy, thus allowing
              it to carry the "made in Italy" tag. And even more frightening
              was the sneaky way some brands actually imported Chinese workers to
              Italy, using cheap labour but still claiming the goods were "made in
              Italy".</strong></span></p>
              <p>The goal is gross - it's not about producing a beautiful product," Thomas says.</p>
              <p>Once
              the luxury market was the domain of the elite - the only ones who could
              afford the exquisite tailoring and hand-made pieces. Now, Thomas says, the industry is more focused on "massclusivity". Thomas says 60% of young Japanese women own a Louis Vuitton handbag. Chanel's iconic No. 5 perfume is sold every 30 seconds.</p>
              <p>While
              many would applaud the democratisation of luxury, which has rendered
              Gucci, Dior and Prada readily accessible to middle-class masses, <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Thomas
              sees the luxury market as a profit-hungry global cash cow run by
              quality-sacrificing corporations.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The change was spearheaded by Bernard Arnault, a French property developer who, in 1984, broke into fashion by buying Christian Dior. Now the chairman of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy), he runs a conglomerate that includes Fendi, Loewe, Kenzo, Givenchy and De Beers. Under Arnault, the transformation was complete : <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>luxury was no longer lovingly produced by couturiers, but by tycoons, who valued profit over perfection.  </strong></span>(Needless to say, Thomas wasn't invited to Louis Vuitton's last womenswear show).</p>
              <p>Thomas has no gripes with the Joe and Joanne Consumers of this world walking around with logo-embossed handbags.  "I think the democratisation of luxury is fantastic ... a generation or two ago we would walk past the store and if we weren't of a certain class, our mothers would whisper to us if we wanted to go in, "No, we don't belong there', as if it were a country club or a secret society.</p>
              <p>But basically, she says, they just don't make luxury the way they used to.</p>
              <p>"The product that you bought in the early '90's is not the same product you're buying now, which is certainly not the same product your parents bought in the '50's.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Corners have been cut</strong></span>: next to nothing is hand-stitched, one Italian brand cuts sleeves 1cm shorter, and lining is a relic of the past.</p>
              <p>A self-proclaimed outsider, Thomas says she felt free to lay bare the masquerade of high-end fashion without fear of ostracism.</p>
              <p>"The fashion media is in cahoots with the fashion industry," she says matter-of-factly.</p>
              <p>She recently left Newsweek after 12 years - "which is huge: it was a big step, leaving the mother ship"- and joined Portfolio, a new masthead, where she will write about luxury fashion and culture from a business standpoint.</p>
              <p>She also plans to make a documentary based on her book, which made the New York Times bestseller list.</p>
              <p>Thomas says trend-setters have cottoned on to the devaluation of luxury - and have moved on.</p>
              <p>Although the big brands will still sell to the insatiable markets of Russia and China, Thomas believes there is a move towards slow-fashion - a return to real luxury.</p>
              <p>"Like in slow food, it's a return to what luxury really was a generation ago," she says.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I think, if you ARE getting top-quality for the money you are forking out, it's alright. </p>
              <p>BUT, if you are paying through your nose, and getting a product that's of inferior quality or not as good as it's made-out to be, then it's another story altogether. </p>
              <p>Like what fudgie said, if you're paying to get a durable bag that you'll use daily and won't wear out easily and quickly, that's paying for the quality that the brand is known for, not just paying for the brand.</p>

              <p>Hmm... quite true!  Besides, you first see them on the runway or fashion mags, and then you see them in the stores, and then a huge proliferation of imitations flood the entire market, and then everywhere you turn, the ladies are carrying the same designs... a total saturation that makes a unique, sometimes really pretty and creative piece, from some non-branded brand (<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) refreshingly original.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>I'm now considering buying this Japanese patchwork sling bag I saw in the shop windows... makes one look like one's going around collecting herbs like that!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Quite cute!  Think can tie a ponytail, wear 3/4 pants, and slippers, and walk around carefree with that sling bag!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
