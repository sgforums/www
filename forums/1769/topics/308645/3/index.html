              <p>If you keep funding these practices, you keep the sweatshop workers trapped in their current working conditions.</p>
              <p>They can walk away only when the sweatshop closes down. If you, and everyone, supports fair trade, at least they'll find a job where they're paid and treated fairly.</p>
              <p>It's not just the high fashion goods segment which is affected - things like crops and Persian carpets may also have been made and sold through unethical practices.</p>
              <p>Will it raise prices? Only if you let yourself believe the claptrap from the corporations which mark-up the prices of their goods for maximum profit.</p>

              <p>It's well-known that the goods produced by major brands are made by the Chinese.</p>

              <p>Probably they should put a new label "Made in Italy by Chinese." This is how business works. They need to have a high margin of earning. Also, you are paying for the brand name which explains why they are called luxury goods</p>

                                that argument is rather absurd. it takes no notice of cost of living and wages in the state/town the workers are in. Not saying it's so in this case, but it's possible that yes they can't afford the shoe but the wages they get might be an average income level there. Putting it in this way is only sensationalizing the issue.

              <p>Not all luxury items are "made in Italy by the Chinese". Even if it is Made in Italy by the Chinese, they still have strict Quality control. Those that are not up to the standard will be destroyed.</p>
              <p>Louis Vuitton has 3 bases: Paris, Spain and USA. That's why you see some of the LV items are stamped made in Spain. LV, Chanel and hermes do not have sales. they would rather destroy it than sell it at discounted price.</p>
              <p>As fas as I know, Chanel and Dior have only one base in Paris.</p>
              <p>There is one Chanel documentary show on Haute Couture collection (Those who does not know the meaning of Haute Couture, please check yourself). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMcf4O7B74Q  They did the collection by hand (yes by hands, no sewing machine). Can you imagine how long does it take to make a full embroidered wedding gown? How many people are needed to do that? How long does it take to make a fully sequined dress?</p>

              <p>Those intricate embroderies are hand made, not machine.</p>
              <p>To own those dresses, you have to fly to Paris to meet John Galliano (chief designer for Christian Dior). They will take your measurement and you can choose the design or have him desinged a new one for you.</p>
              <p>Those dresses are at least US$60k or above sometimes it can reach US$100k, depending on the embroideries/sequins.</p>
              <p>These are what I called the ultimate of luxury.</p>

              <p>You need to realize also why the luxury products are often overpriced:</p>
              <p>1. They need to present their collection in a runway. The place is never cheap and usually it is 3x a year (S/S &amp; A/W pret-a-porter, cruise) or 5x a year (S/S &amp; A/W pret-a-porter, S/S &amp; A/W Haute couture, Cruise)</p>
              <p>2. They need to hire the models. Supermodels are being paid very high.</p>
              <p>3. They need to make it grand, invite celebrities and fashion editors, give freebies.</p>
              <p>4. They need to advertise it in fashion magazines.</p>
              <p>5. The materials are not really cheap. Cashmere, ostrich skin, silk, alligator skin, chinchilla fur are not cheap.</p>
              <p>6. Those concept stores and locations are not cheap too.</p>
              <p>So even if they hire workers with very low salary, they still need to offset those expenses by selling the bag at very high price. Otherwise, how do they make profit. No one wants to operate on losses.</p>

              <p>Speaking of bags, guess what I've been doing of late? Since I have all this downtime and since more people here are going green, I've been making shopping totes. I hope to sell them at craft fairs, online, etc. Right now the going's slow since it's a one-woman show. It's alot of fun though.</p>

To ensure that they still carry the Made in Italy tag, the manufacturers have gotten sneaky. For eg, if the leather handles are made in Italy, it'll conveniently say so on the tag, totally circumventing the fact that the bag itself was made in China. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p></div>

              <p>actually heard before the sales and marketing for chanel are at loggerheads over this, because the salesmen wants to sell more piecesbut the marketing wants to sell less at a higher price for the image and authorised dealers aren't allow to give any discounts plus they're more strict over who's selling their stuff.</p>
              <p><br>selling branded stuff myself and sometimes when customers ask where products like gucci are made, i really don't know how to answer because its printed on the product but i don't believe it myself. <br>and one incident was there was a brand from a certain country that was actually made in the country of origin for the first batch we ordered but subsequent orders had MIC engraved on it.</p>

              you imagine how long does it take to make a full embroidered

              <p>To own those dresses, you have to fly to Paris to meet John

              <p>What you have in this post (which I can appreciate) is quite different from the 'off the rack' goods that can be mass-produced, and bought by people on the street with big pockets. Anyway, you're saying that the profit margins from the sale of these 'off the rack' products are used to rationalise other costs...right?</p>
              <p>Let's not let this distract us from the essence of this thread - ethical business practices. Can we deny the existence of these sweatshops? Maybe whoever got interviewed had been lying, or everyone else was swallowing their pride. Sure, it gives them all a livelihood, but is this the right way to do it <em>as human beings</em>?</p>
              <p>Does the brand need to sell its soul to Mammon, and by flirting with unethical practices and dumbing down its products, risk an image that will take years to build up again?</p>
              <p>When you can maximise profits, create what you can convince enough people to believe are win-win situations, they say you're cunning, tough and have good acumen. If you stick to values, you're called naive and soft. Only one route though allows you to have a heart and sleep peacefully.</p>

              <p>Rumour is that when those fashion powerhouses send their orders to Chinese manufacturers, the Chinese will always produce a bit more extra. Then those extras will make their way into the local market.</p>
