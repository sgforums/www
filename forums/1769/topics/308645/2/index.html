              <p>I don't think you can compare luxury houses with luxury fashion goods!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Besides, there will always be a market for ostentatious goods, simply because of the way society is, and pure simple economics.  As long as there continues to be a demand, ostentatious goods will always exist. </p>
              <p>What we're discussing in this thread here, is the fact that luxury fashion items may be priced that way for maximum profits, not because of quality nor craftsmanship any longer.  If you would read the very first post with the article exposing the practices, you will then realise that that sets the entire premise for this discussion. </p>
              <p>Whether one chooses to spend one's money on luxury fashion items or not, is not our business.   It is their money to spend as they wish.  The goal here, is to expose the unfair and unethical practices of some of these luxury fashion companies and thus, enable us to make informed decisions when we make purchases.</p>
              <p>And btw, please distinguish between luxury FASHION products, and luxury cars and houses... all are ostentatious goods, but they are not quite the same.  As stated in the article, if you'd read it, high-end fashion houses may no longer be giving you the quality you thought you paid for.  Instead, you are simply paying grotesquely inflated prices for products that do not really warrant that price.  However, for luxury cars, you are paying for quality finishes, for leather seats, and hopefully, for a more powerful engine, top-of-the-line safety features, etc etc etc.  And for luxury houses, you are paying for the price of the land, the quality finishes, the interior design, the architect's fees, etc etc etc. </p>
              <p>Are you now able to see the differences?</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>PARIS:</strong> Next week, a giant store, its façade scintillating with crystalline glass, will open on New York's Fifth Avenue — yet another reason for Louis Vuitton to celebrate its 150th birthday.</p>
              <p>The milestone year was ushered in on the Champs-Elysées with a gigantic re-creation of the house's chocolate-brown traveling trunk with gold initials. For the Chinese New Year, the house beamed a greeting in Chinese characters by satellite around the world, emphasizing the global reach of a company that Louis Vuitton, the son of a carpenter, founded in 1854.</p>
              <p>"We did not want to focus on one single event with a cake and candles, but to make people understand that after 150 years Vuitton is forever young, fresh and creative," says Yves Carcelle, chairman and C.E.O. of the leather-goods company and the man credited with leading its breakneck advance. Working with his boss, Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), Carcelle has made Vuitton the lifeblood — not to say the cash cow — of the luxury conglomerate. Its total revenue in 2003 was nudging €3 billion ($3.74 billion), a multiple of five over 15 years, each of which saw double-digit growth. Even more significant was the house's enormous increase in operating margin, to 45 percent in 2003, far ahead of competing brands.</p>
              <p><em>blah blah blah blah blah</em></p>
              <p>Out of Vuitton's 10,000 employees, 3,600 work in 14 ateliers in France. Arnault, asked about the success of Vuitton, says: "It's the quality, because we do everything ourselves, from creativity through manufacture and distribution. We are the only <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">luxury house</span></strong> to offer such quality at half the price of others."</p>
              <p><em>blah blah blah blah blah</em></p>

              <p>Let's not start getting personal and start calling names just because someone disagrees with you. </p>
              <p>If you feel offended by the posts in here because you happen to be a fashion connoiseur whilst a few of us are 'fashion noobs', and you choose to be snotty about it, it just goes to show that you can't hold a discussion, agree to disagree, and not resort to name-calling. </p>
              <p>I am not an authority on fashion, never have, never will be, never want to be.  Once again, I repeat that this thread was started because of that article I read exposing the luxury fashion industry.  If you feel beholden to defend your favourite fashion houses, don't go shooting the messenger. </p>
              <p>Anyways, it's good marketing to always highlight your strong selling points to your customers and potential customers.  Which fashion house will tell you anything bad about their manufacturing process and all?  That would be like shooting themselves in the foot, n'est pas?</p>

              <p>'Nothing at all'?  Then I suggest that you do your homework and know the meanings of the words you slap on others before using it.</p>
              <p>Noob, according to Wikipedia :</p>
              <p>There are a multitude of words that have emerged from the original
                  "Newbie", each with their own meaning and origins. There are such terms
                  like "nubcakes" or "nubotron" which emerged from generally gamers
                  expressing their anger of success with their fellow players. <strong><span style="color: #800000;">The
                  general rule is to use the nub- or noob- stems in order to create
                  specific insults or expletives</span></strong>, as in "nooblet," or "nubcracker."</p>
              <p>And, Noob, according to the Urban Dictionary :</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>A noob or n00b is someone that lacks intellegance or common sense</strong></span>, most
                  people think that noob is a word used only in the online gaming world,
                  but in reality it is becoming an ever popular word with teenage society.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Noobs ...  know little and have no will to learn any more</strong></span>. They
                  expect people to do the work for them and then expect to get praised
                  about it, and make up a unique species of their own.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Noobs are often referred to as noobs as a sign of disrespect toward them... </strong></span>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't go around slapping a derogatory term on someone and then accuse the other party of over-reacting and pleading innocence.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>I'm sorry, I'm never going to support corporations that are profit-hungry to the extent of being unethical.  Earning profits IS the ráison d'etre of all corporations, but it's then a matter of HOW that is achieved as well as how ethical their practices are. </p>
              <p>Your trend of thought is... amusing.  So we have to support the labourers who work in these corporations because they need the income? </p>
              <p>How about supporting the drug dealers who sell drugs because they also need the income to feed their families too?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Sorry, if someone is out to fleece you blind, I don't think 'compassion' is the appropriate term to apply in this context!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Yes, it is beyond my limited intelligence to comprehend gibberish.  And you actually have the audacity to quote Einstein, implying that you are of 'great spirits' and I am of 'mediocre mind'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  And this time round PLEASE do not shun responsibility by calling me 'defensive' because you didn't mean to insult me / you were just quoting your favourite quote / I have misunderstood you / that's the way you speak, appearing confrontational and aggressive when you are just being compassionate and understanding, yada-yada.  Because face it, your cat claws are out and you are just itching for a full-on catfight but you still want to hold on to some innocent, charming and sweet persona.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I would love to sit here and continue but : 1) the weather is fantastic and I prefer to go out then continue this mud-slinging slimefest with someone who obviously thinks that she knows it all and wants to have the last authoritative word on everything; 2) it's my precious day off and I'd rather do something enjoyable; 3) this discussion is getting nowhere and will continue to get nowhere; 4) this discussion is heading towards a silly name-calling scenario, with obvious pomposity from you; and 5) if you are THAT delusional as to suggest that you are of "great spirits", then I rest my case. </p>
              <p>And oh, the author is known as a 'whistleblower' and if she has exposed
                  unethical practices that have been covered up for years, and her book
                  has hit the best-seller charts because of her exposé, then that's her
                  just reward for being a brave whistleblower.  Afterall, everyone has
                  the right to not buy her book, but there are logical people out there who choose to know what they have been paying for, and rightfully so.</p>
              <p>Feel free to have the last word or words - I refuse to participate in this petty and nonsensical sparring with someone who lacks basic logic because it is getting too tedious and is fast losing its initial entertainment value.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
