              <p>i was doing my NS then...was OOC...so very free to roam around when
                                      the company was having their training...<br> <br> that night the company was having lecture and me and the other OOC
                                      decided to go take our shower first to avoid the crowd later..so we
                                      can sleep earlier...<br> <br> when we were at the door of the toilet ( it is those one story type
                                      building with zinc roof), we heard scratching sound coming out of
                                      the toilet. Those u would hear when u scratch on the old zinc
                                      toilet door.<br> <br> Both of us were shocked..So we applied standard SAF procedure and
                                      shouted into the toilet " Who's there? Identify yourself."<br> <br> The scratching stopped...but no reply came from within the
                                      toilet...<br> <br> We shouted again..."Who's there? Identify yourself. Dun play
                                      hor!"<br> <br> No Reply.<br> <br> We told ourselves we were going to go in and drag that joker out
                                      and skin him alive...<br> <br> so we took broom sticks from the side of the toilet and went into
                                      the toilet...<br> <br> Cubicle by cubicle we probed with the broomsticks...but we saw no
                                      one...We did the second round with me doing from one end and the
                                      other guy doing from the other end..<br> <br> No one~~~<br> <br> then of a sudden...hurried kicking on the zinc door...and hirred
                                      scratching on the zinc door...<br> <br> we looked at each other and saw both our face turned pale..we
                                      dashed out of the toilet...<br> <br> the other guy claimed he felt the entire toilet building was
                                      shaking...but one thing we were sure...we both heard the kicking
                                      and the scratching...but no one was in the toilet...<br> <br> we stayed in bunk and waited for the platoon to come back from
                                      lesson before taking shower</p>
