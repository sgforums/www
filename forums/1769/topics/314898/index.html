              <div class="content">Supporting project co-ordinating   <br>E.g Meeting, catering, documentations for submission to clients etc... dept adminstration for daily admin to travel arrangement for dept etc... <br>Secretary to boss. <br><br>Now he was telling her to find another more subjective scope to do that made her stay in co. more stable.  <br>If not if the managment level ask if they can do without admin, she will be at risk during critical time. <br><br>But she is really clueless what to add into her scope. <br>Btw she is in Engineering company, she doesn't like sales and tender work due to the the market they are facing are very very small (sensitive group) do there isn't much to learn neither.  Liking if she support the sales manager will be doing calling and chasing after supplier for quote and delivery only.   She will not learn any subjective things. Coz everyone can do calling. <br><br>How ? any advice ? She need to reply her boss in 1 week time what she want to do ???<br>By the way, the company is going to sponser her Master.</div>

              <p>Precisely!  My exact thoughts! </p>
              <p>Could this be the boss' way of gradually introducing the concept of a horizontal transfer to another dept or another job altogether for her? </p>
              <p>Her boss could also be challenging her to see how well she can take initiative and define a role for herself.  Could be a test to see how she's going to justify their sponsorship for her Masters cause to a company, it's not the paper qualifications that matter as much as the value one employee contributes to the job. </p>
              <p>It's time for her to grab the reins and carve out a niche for herself.  Her boss has already told her explicitly that he thinks she shouldn't remain in her current role and is indirectly telling her that more is expected.  It's hard to get out of a comfort zone, but in this case, it's necessary if she wants to seal the sponsorship.  Like what ShroCat said, if you want the company to sponsor you, you bo bian have to please them.</p>
              <p>She has to balance her goals with the company's goals.  Don't look down on the Sales and Quotation tasks because they are the vital arteries bringing in the cashflow for an organisation and if she can get into it with a humble, keen-to-learn attitude, she can establish herself firmly in the company.  It's easy to pigeonhole a certain job / task as menial and 'useless', can't learn much, but really, it's what one makes out of it and you never know where it can get  you.  For instance, if she does a fantastic job and relates well to the clients with a resultant increase in profit margins, I'm sure her boss will recognise that.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, we don't have the luxury of choosing which tasks we want to do, and shove the more 'unpleasant and boring, won't-learn-anything' tasks from it.  We are afterall employed by our employers for the value we can add to the organisation, and for what we can contribute; we aren't paid to just sit there and choose to do only tasks that we can benefit from.  I've worked in HR before, and we always ask, "How will it benefit the company if we were to pay for this course for a particular employee?"  Corporations are afterall, not charities and they have to watch their bottom-line.</p>

              <p>Essentially, the boss is teaching her how to 'survive' if the company is ever going to downsize.</p>
              <p>I believe they would have to justify to higher management why the company is sponsoring your friend for her Masters.</p>
              <p>End of the day, it is about how your friend can ADD VALUE to the company. How about HR side?</p>

              <p>Sooner or later, all jobs will somehow turn to be 'dead end jobs'.  We can't always change jobs like changing wardrobes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>And depending on which stage of life you are in, 'dead end jobs' have its advantages too.  Say, if I had to take night classes, 'dead end jobs' will definitely bring in the moolah as well as offer the same low-level stress job that would be welcome if one's energy has to be split between work, night school, and assignments. </p>
              <p>Besides, who says it's a must to be part of the Rat Race?  I'd much rather sit back, relax, enjoy, and watch other rats scurrying around madly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
