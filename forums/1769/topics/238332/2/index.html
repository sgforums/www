They say little and possess great wisdom. They never have to worry about money; they are financially fortunate. Snake people are often quite vain, selfish, and a bit stingy. Yet they have tremendous sympathy for others and try to help those less fortunate. Snake people tend to overdo, since they have doubts about other people's judgment and prefer to rely on themselves. They are determined in whatever they do and hate to fail. Although calm on the surface, they are intense and passionate. Snake people are usually good-looking and sometimes have marital problems because they are fickle. They are most compatible with the Ox and Rooster.<br><br>You are wise and charming.<br>You are a good thinker.<br>You can procrastinate.<br>You save money.<br>You will make a good teacher, writer or psychiatrist.

            <div class='col-md body'>People born in the Year of the Monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever, skillful, and flexible, they are remarkably inventive and original and can solve the most difficult problems with ease. There are few fields in which Monkey people wouldn't be successful but they have a disconcerting habit of being too agreeable. They want to do things now, and if they cannot get started immediately, they become discouraged and sometimes leave their projects. Although good at making decisions, they tend to look down on others. Having common sense, Monkey people have a deep desire for knowledge and have <strong>excellent memories</strong>. Monkey people are strong willed but their anger cools quickly. They are most compatible with the Dragon and Rat.<br><br>You are very intelligent, clever, and well liked by everyone.<br>You will have success in any field.<br><br>Not dis monkey..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese Zodiac - Year of the Sheep or Goat<br><br>The Sheep or Goat<br><br>Comment: The Chinese word for Sheep and Goat is the same, "Yang." That is why the confusion on the name.<br><br>People born in the Year of Sheep are elegant and highly accomplished in the arts. They seem to be, at first glance, better off than those born in the zodiac's other years. But Sheep year people are often shy, pessimistic, and puzzled about life. They are usually deeply religious, yet timid by nature. Sometimes clumsy in speech, they are always passionate about what they do and what they believe in. Sheep people never have to worry about having the best in life for their abilities make money for them, and they are able to enjoy the creature comforts that they like. Sheep people are wise, gentle, and compassionate. They are compatible with Rabbits, Pigs, and Horses.<br><br>You are charming, elegant and artistic.<br>You like to be comfortable.<br>You can complain and worry too much.<br>You will make a good actor, gardener or beachcomber.<br><br>what the? gardener?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
