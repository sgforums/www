              <p>This is right up my alley. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> It's easy, you can't mess it up. Get a caulk gun and the right type of caulk for windows and doors. Applies just like a syringe. To make it swee swee, use your finger to smoothen it out and get it into the crevices. Here's tip to prevent the caulk from sticking to your fingers - wet your finger with saliva. HTHs.</p>
              <p>Check your door frame too. You if you feel a draft, weather stripping will help seal the gaps.</p>

              <p>I try to minimise contact with the landlord because he's extremely frustrating to deal with.  He hems and haws, makes promises he seldom keeps, and then comes up with 1,001 fanciful excuses and what-not.  Hell, dealing with him makes me feel as if I'm back at work, facing some of them patients.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  I consider this making use of his property to learn caulking so that when I have my own property, I can do it like jetta, swee swee!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You are in Sg now right ? Just get the 2nd hand car that has reliable services. Like Toyota , Nissan . Easy parts and good servicing with gurantees so u can bust thier balls if anything goes wrong with ur service.If u service ur Toyota at a Authorised Toyota dealer shop n he cant fix ur car. N its like 2006-2008 .. u can call the manager out to talk to u about it. lol. Thats one way if u are uncertain with ur mechanics. I always send my cars to the authorised dealers. My dad always wants me to send to his personal mechanic.. but no thanks. I'll take my chances. haha</p>
              <p>Because the car dealers are now facing the crunch. Here 2nd hand S2000 auction at 13K..immaculate condition n gone only 80K for an NA engine car its good. OMG i did not go to that one. N apparently only lilke 5 ppl bid for it. CHEAP !!!!!! OMFG! lol</p>
              <p>Well, nowadays the brand spanking new cars thier price will eventually drop also. So it really depends. But now u have more power to negotiate ma right ? If u got an old and busted people mover... time to let it go. I doubt they will take in trade in, but its still a good deal. LoL. keep the old car n go car rolling with it.</p>
              <p>Some cars.. gone 2K KM's 2nd car lo.. n that will be a very good deal. ;p</p>
              <p>Exactly on some ppl cannot afford to finance all thier cars so have to let go. Like i letting go my Civic. So whoever buying it gonna untung cause gone lesss then 3 K n i am selling back to Honda.</p>
