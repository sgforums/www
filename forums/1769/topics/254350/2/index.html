(I have a thing for end units.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">2. Who does most of the housework?  Why?</span><br>When it was just me and the hubster, it was 70% me, 30% him. Now with two pre-teens, it's 70% me, 20% hubster, 10% kids. What are kids for?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">3. How would you describe the condition of your room?  </span><br>Er... pai seh, there are untidy pockets here and there. Mainly not putting books away, or leaving cups/mugs on the coffee table. My main problem area is the damn dining table. I simply cannot and have not been able to clear the table top. It's been months since I've seen the top of the dining table!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> That's why we tend to eat dinner at the coffee table while we watch TV.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">4. If budget is not a problem, how would you decorate your house?  What kind of style?  </span><br>After living here for 6 months, although we have many DIY improvement projects yet undone, I think we are pretty much happy with the cozy ambience of our place. We're casual people and don't like anything fussy. My next project would be to install custom closet organizers in all three bedrooms.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">5. In your opinion, which is the most important room in the house?  Why?</span><br>The kitchen. That's where we hang out most of the time. Besides that's where our PC station is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> with the radio for company. Our kitchen opens to the patio via a sliding door. I went crazy last week and bought lots of petunias and other blooms so now, my patio is a riot of colour. I'm also growing tomatoes for the first time. I'm so excited! No fruit yet but any day now. *kan cheong*<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">6. Is your house always in a clean, organised condition and ready to receive guest without prior notice?  Or do you feel uncomfortable having guests over without prior notice?  </span><br>Depends on which day of the week. Saturdays are major laundry days, when we also wash the bedsheets. I let the house go to pot on the weekends and leave the tidying up, cleaning, etc on Mondays. If guests come when the house is untidy, I always tell them to avert their eyes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">7. Dust Bunnies Test - Do you think someone with a dust allergy will be alright in your house?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </span><br>Hmm... no one's ever said anything. Yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">8. How often do you invite friends / guests over?  Why or why not?  </span><br>We love having people over. But we're new to this area and don't have good friends, so no, we haven't invited anyone over at all.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Type of place I live in is an executive maisionette<br><br>2. My bro does most of the housework coz he's the neat freak and the most physically-able.<br><br>3. Condition of my room is a lil' messy but warm coz that's the way it oughta be when somone is occupying it. It ain't a showroom, y'know?<br><br>4. If budget is no object, I would decorate my house in a contemporary, clean and simple manner, lavishing my budget on a high-end entertainment stuff like hi-fi and a home theatre system.<br><br>5. The modt important area of the house must surely be a fight between the living room and my bedroom coz the living room is where guests are usually entertained while my bedroom is because that's where I spend most of my time, whether I'm on the net or plain vegetating...... but if I really gotta choose, it's gotta be my bedroom!<br><br>6. Of course I can receive guests without notice coz I don't believe in tidying up for anyone.... The house represents me and vice versa. I am an unassuming fella - what you get is what you see - like it or not.........<br><br>7. I've a pretty sensitive nose. If I can live in my house no problem, I don't see how others with some dust allergy problem can't..... unless they have a bigger problem than mine lah..............<br><br>8. I seldom invite friends over coz they'll often leave a mess behind after they leave and my bro will kpkb coz he has to clean up......<br><br></div>
