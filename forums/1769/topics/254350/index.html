            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I'd start a series of questionnaires and discussions for us in Club 30 to get to know each other better.  Instead of asking for personal particulars like filling up some form, there'll be a few questions on different aspects of our lives.  Sometimes, you can get to know a person well just from the way they live their lives, their habits, etc.<br><br>(I know a few twisted individuals here would like to have the information to keep as fodder for criticisms and assaults in future, but nevermind, we'll just let the twisted go their own twisted ways!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>Let's start with Part I where we shall look at our habitat!  Answer them and give as many details and comments as you can!<br><br>Questions :<br><br>1. What type of place do you live in?<br><br>2. Who does most of the housework?  Why?<br><br>3. How would you describe the condition of your room?<br><br>4. If budget is not a problem, how would you decorate your house?  What kind of style?<br><br>5. In your opinion, which is the most important room in the house?  Why?<br><br>6. Is your house always in a clean, organised condition and ready to receive guest without prior notice?  Or do you feel uncomfortable having guests over without prior notice?<br><br>7.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Questions :<br><br>1. What type of place do you live in?<br><br>A one-bedroom apartment in Melbourne.  I love that the kitchen is separate from the living area, unlike most other apartments and abodes in Australia, where the kitchen is open-plan, meaning there's no barrier between the kitchen and the living area!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I also love the huge windows in my living area.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>2. Who does most of the housework?  Why?<br>Me.  There's no one else to push the housework to!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>3. How would you describe the condition of your room?<br>Lived-in.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I haven't bought all the furniture I need yet and the books are all piled up on the floor for now.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   Also, not enough table surfaces so empty boxes act as tabletops for now.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>4. If budget is not a problem, how would you decorate your house?  What kind of style?<br>Contemporary yet with cozy, warm touches throughout.  I love cherry wood.  I shall also need a lot of storage space and would love to have concealed storage and a multi-tier bookshelves system on wheels!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Kitchen has to be with modern appliances!  I love kitchens!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>5. In your opinion, which is the most important room in the house?  Why?<br>The kitchen!  I love to cook, that's why!  It's lovely to cook for others and share meals.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>6. Is your house always in a clean, organised condition and ready to receive guest without prior notice?  Or do you feel uncomfortable having guests over without prior notice?<br>Most of the time, I cannot receive guests without prior notice because ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> <span class="small">not very vigilant when it comes to regular housekeeping. </span>   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   I must have adequate notice one!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>7. Dust Bunnies Test - Do you think someone with a dust allergy will be alright in your house?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Nope!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  They'll sneeze their noses off!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>8. How often do you invite friends / guests over?  Why or why not?<br>I only invite them over after I've done a big housekeeping thing.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   I can't invite more than one at a time because there aren't enough seats in my apartment right now.  Plus, I don't have a dining set yet so it's going to be hard to invite anyone over for meals now unless they are like me, good at balancing plates on one hand whilst watching TV and eating.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

If budget is not a problem, how would you decorate your house?  What kind of style?<br><br>One room will be for hi-fi /home theater/ gaming/ computer and other high tech stuff. The rest of the house will be done in a very minimalist way.<br><br>5. In your opinion, which is the most important room in the house?  Why?<br><br>The room containing hi-fi /home theater/ gaming/ computer and other high tech stuff, because its where I'll be spending most of my time nuaing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>6.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fun quiz, Rhonda! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>1. What type of place do you live in?<br>5 room HDB pigeon hole flat<br><br>2. Who does most of the housework? Why?<br>Distributed quite evenly between the SO and I.  He does floor &amp; toilet.  I do laundry, kitchen and surfaces.  We take turns to do the dishes.  We both tidy our own stuff, but me owning more stuff means I have more tidying to ignore -  I mean, carry out.  Sometimes he threatens to throw my shopping out.  I threaten to dye his shirts pink.  It is a happy arrangement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>3. How would you describe the condition of your room?<br>The room is neat &amp; clean.  The bed however is never made.<br><br>4. If budget is not a problem, how would you decorate your house? What kind of style?<br>My dream house would be a penthouse done up in modern contemporary loft style.<br><br>5. In your opinion, which is the most important room in the house? Why?<br>Bedroom and living room.  Because we spend most of our time there.<br><br>6. Is your house always in a clean, organised condition and ready to receive guest without prior notice? Or do you feel uncomfortable having guests over without prior notice?<br>The house is not in condition to receive guests at any given time.  Not so much because of dirt, but because we do let stuff accumulate.  There is always clutter lying around that we haven't gotten around to putting away yet.  I think it is a sign that we don't have enough storage space. I am trying to psycho him into building or buying more cupboards heheh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>7. Dust Bunnies Test - Do you think someone with a dust allergy will be alright in your house?<br>Probably, yes.  The SO is quite consistant with vacuuming and we don't have rugs.  I have taught him to vacuum under the furniture.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>8. How often do you invite friends / guests over? Why or why not?<br>Seldom.  Because of the cleaning work involved before we have guests. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I should try to learn to be comfortable with close friends viewing my house in au naturel state...</div>

Why?<br>Got cleaners employed by government, they always come in the morning to clean up the whole area. Why? I also dunno, i dun dare to question the government, later they will sue me until i am bankrupt... wait, i am already bankrupt, why should i be afraid?<br><br>3. How would you describe the condition of your room?<br>ok lah, very big.<br><br>4. If budget is not a problem, how would you decorate your house? What kind of style? People will decorate my area for me when festival comes, no need me.<br><br>5. In your opinion, which is the most important room in the house? Why? My bed room the most important, because that is where i sleep.<br><br>6. Is your house always in a clean, organised condition and ready to receive guest without prior notice?
