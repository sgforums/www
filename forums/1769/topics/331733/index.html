              <p>Lay a whisper on my pillow 
              <br>Leave the winter on the ground 
              <br>I wake up lonely, is there a silence 
              <br>In the bedroom and all around 
              <br> <br>Touch me now, I close my eyes 
              <br>And dream away... 
              <br> <br>It must have been love, but it's over now 
              <br>It must have been good, but I lost it somehow 
              <br>It must have been love, but it's over now 
              <br>From the moment we touched till the time had run out 
              <br> <br>Make believing we're together 
              <br>That I'm sheltered by your heart 
              <br>But in and outside I turn to water 
              <br>Like a teardrop in your palm 
              <br> <br>And it's a hard winter's day 
              <br>I dream away... 
              <br> <br>It must have been love, but it's over now 
              <br>It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without 
              <br>It must have been love, but it's over now 
              <br>It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows 
              <br> <br>It must have been love, but it's over now 
              <br>It must have been good, but I lost it somehow 
              <br>It must have been love, but it's over now

              Run, Wolf Warrior, Run
              - From the "Wolf's Rain" soundtrack
              
              Vocal: Joyce
              Music: Yoko Kanno
              Words: Chris Mosdell
              
              
              
              Run, wolf warrior, to ends eternal
              Through the wreckage of the death of the day
              Scent of silence under starlight spinning
              A captured beast within a human skin
              
              Are you searching for long lost landscapes
              Lit by flowers and crystal cascades?
              Where the lamb lies down with the lion
              Where the wolf is one with the wild
              
              Run, wolf warrior, through kingdoms' chaos
              Senseless cities and ghost towns towering
              Howl, O hunter, though few know you're crying
              Face upturned into that midnight moon
              
              Are you hunting for mystic mountains
              Where the air is like liquid laughter?
              Where the beasts inherit the earth
              Where the last again will be first
              
              Run, wolf warrior, to hide your hunger
              The rain will wash away the pains of the day
              In your eyes there are cold fires burning
              Tongues of flame that can never be tamed
              
              Are you running from Man's delusion
              Majestic madness and your exclusion
              To where the lamb lies down with the lion?
              
              Are you running down ancient pathways
              Through this dark and deserted land
              To where man is once more a child?
              
              Are you running to freedom's fortress
              By the side of wide open seas
              Where the wolf is one with the wild?
              
              Run, run, run...
              
              Run, run, run, run, run, run on, run on through the rain...
