            <div class='col-md body'>With increasing divorce rates, we may see more cohabitation outside of marriage instead. Divorce is messy and very expensive, especially for the men. If you are bored and want to see real drama with people sliming each other, just head to the family courts.<br><br>Every thing comes out there.....<br><br>Husband: She was not a virgin when I married her...she slept with ABC...she shoplifted...her boyfriend is a drug addict....I don't think the children are mine...<br><br>Wife: He surfed for porn....he visited Geylang brothels...he pocketed petty cash from his office...<br><br>And then there is video footage and photographs from private investigators...in the end the children really suffer. How do you expect the children to respect either parent after such a divorce?</div>

Then you start to look at the front, the back and the side to make sure that the car looks good in all angle. As you get closer to the car, you start to run your fingers over the curve and feel the really smooth and clean surface....<br><br>after that you start to explore the interior. first thing to do is to smell...make sure the interior smells good...then you start to caress the leather interior, what you should be looking for is for the leather to be soft and the seat is firmed. After that you start to tweak the buttons to turn on every damn thing.<br><br>After that, you insert your key and start the engine. You let the car idle for a awhile as you wait for the pistons to get lubricated before stepping on the accelerator. While doing that you listen to the growl of the engine, make sure the sound of the engine is sexy like a V8.<br><br>Once out of the car park, you set your car to different gear and different speeds and you start to explore the limits of the car. Before you finish with the test drive, the finale will be to check out the reverse gear just to make sure the moving backward is just as fun as moving forward.<br><br>When you are done with the driving, you check out the fuel consumption and the cost of servcing the car.<br><br>Once you are happy with everything, you sign the contract and you get the car.</div>
