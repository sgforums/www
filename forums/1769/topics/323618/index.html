              </ul>
              <p><strong>A</strong>M I the only person terrified by everything
              getting so big? Is anyone else feeling that the bigger things get, the
              more soulless they are becoming? McMansions furnishing each newborn
              with their own room and ensuite. People-movers providing every
              passenger with their own seat and personal air-conditioning settings.
              Buckets of popcorn larger than a human head flavoured not with butter
              but with butter flavouring.</p>
              <p>Families eating around a
              wide-screen TV the size of a dining table. Mega-meal deals devoid of
              nutrition complete with a stuffed cheese crust, chocolate Bavarian and
              1.25 litres of fizzy emptiness to wash it down. Shopping centres so
              massive it can take more than an hour to find your way back to your
              car. And as for coffee, once it was, "Sugar and milk?" These days not
              only is there a dazzling array of sexed-up artificial flavours but we
              have the choice of jug, bucket or trough. A simple cup of coffee is no
              longer enough. We want more.</p>
              <p>If bigger was
              better I'd be thrilled for us. I'd be dancing in the streets wearing a
              T-shirt saying, "SUPER-SIZING IS YOUR TICKET TO SPIRITUAL AWARENESS AND
              INNER HAPPINESS". But it's not. The bigger things get, the smaller we
              are becoming.</p>
              <p>The more we have, the less
              we're enjoying it. The hole just gets bigger and that button inside us
              never turns off, no matter what we buy it, feed it or stuff it with.
              Obesity is soaring and depression is an epidemic. We're knee deep in
              mortgage stress, debt slavery and the time poor. And the water is
              rising.</p>
              <p>Abundance takes the value from everything. Nothing
              seems special any more. And we can't help ourselves because we're just
              mammals programmed to binge in times of plenty. Going to one of those
              all-you-can-eat places makes me feel sick. Eat more. It's cheap. We've
              got heaps! This food means nothing. Pile up your plate. You deserve it.
              You've paid for it. The more you eat, the more value you'll get.</p>
              <p>You
              go from feeling empty to feeling stuffed, empty and sick. It's a false
              economy. And it's not making us happy. We don't know what it feels like
              to be sated any more. We have two settings. Empty or overdosed.</p>
              <p>Costco is opening this year in Melbourne. That sentence seems benign
              enough until you realise what Costco it. It's an American chain of
              warehouse clubs. I hear you ask, what's a warehouse club? Well, it's a
              massive supermarket where you buy things in bulk.</p>
              <p>Cheap. Very cheap. You pay a yearly fee of about $50 to be a member
              and because you've paid you feel compelled to drive out, stock up and
              get your money's worth.</p>
              <p>When I say bulk I'm talking "One-kilogram packets of potato chips …
              toilet rolls in packs of 36. Listerine in three-litre packs. Laundry
              detergent in nine-kilogram boxes … maple syrup by the gallon (3.8
              litres) chocolate bars in packs of 30 … and dog food in 25-kilogram
              bags." Items are displayed on pallets and the shopping trolleys are
              twice the usual size.</p>
              <p>Don't get conned by "it's bulk and there are no plastic bags at the
              checkouts so it's environmentally friendly". It encourages a mentality
              of fear, famine and greed. It encourages people to consume more than
              they need. Eat three chocolate bars for the price of one. I've opened
              that kilogram bag of chips, so I may as well polish it off. We don't
              need any more towels but they're so cheap! Lets get 20. Because it's
              cheap people feel they're getting value for money. They're not. It just
              means they're eating more, spending more and feeling emptier. Instead
              of going to the local supermarket to buy what they need, they're
              driving kilometres, taking 20 minutes to park and buying stuff they
              don't need, because it's cheap. And it's there.</p>
              <p>You may be thinking, "What's she going on about? If people want to
              buy stuff to make them feel better, let 'em. We're all going to die
              anyway. There's more important stuff to write about: war, famine,
              poverty, the environment, the under-funded education system,
              overburdened health care …"</p>
              <p>Can't you see? <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>All this gorging on abundance is destroying the
              environment, creating landfill and making us slaves to multinationals
              with "buying power". It's making us fat, sad and scared, which affects
              the cost of health care and leaves fewer resources for schools and aid.
              We're getting stressed and sad and that impacts on our productivity,
              quality of life and happiness and that of those around us. And it's
              corroding our souls.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Do what you like, buy what you like, drive what you like and shop
              where you like. But ask yourself if you are really getting value for
              money.</p>
              <p>I'm glad the price of petrol is going up and the price of food is
              rising. It's the only way that we're going to stop, look around and
              realise what things are really costing us.</p>

              <p>I don't see it that way. She's telling us to re-examine our attitudes towards buying big and isn't blaming anything bigger than our own gullibility.</p>

              <p>It's perverse, I agree. But people become complacent and do not wake up to reality. You see that in SC, and when people forget the reality of terrorism, and even when they don't buckle up while driving. And then only some learn, while others react instinctively. I'd like to think that sensible people are in the majority of at least the vocal lot, but they aren't. The rest just wallow in DR, and this piece is probably directed at them.</p>

              <p>Precisely.  The article highlight the rampant trend of diminished responsibility so pervasive in society today.</p>
              <p>And I do not see where the writer "sucks people into thinking that they do not
              have the personal responsibility to make their own decisions...", as you put it. </p>
              <p>She is simply trying to wake people up to the state things have become and hopefully, with this awareness of over-consumption and materialism, we will then slowly edge towards change where we no longer abuse and hog resources. </p>
              <p>Frankly, your reaction to her article is a bit OTT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
