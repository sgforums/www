              <p>If you guys duno what paraplegia is, it is the impairment of motor/sensory functions of the lower extremities. May be serious or very mild. Sometimes you wont even notice that the person had cerebral palsy.</p>

              <p><br>i'm not exactly sure if its for all cerebal palsy cases or for just the milder kind. he looks perfectly normal. its only movement problems.. besides not being able to control his hand well, he also cant really walk very steadily. we all have to be very patient when we go out with him..  dinner can be disaster... hmm...</p>

              <p>cerebral palsy is very wide spectrum disability, because it depends on which part of the brain was damaged.</p>
              <p>so it can range from very mild physical disability, to severe physical and intellectual disability.</p>
