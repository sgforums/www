            <div class='col-md body'>There are self interests, and there are self interests.<br><br>The difference would be is it solely self serving interest,  or can it be a societal contributing self interest.<br><br>Becos we live in a system, a society, a community - an individual's actions can have the power to affect and influence the rest. You choose how much you can do in order to serve your neighbour. Question is - why do I want to do that?<br><br>When u only serve yourself, you are simply a selfish individual. Selfish individuals rarely achieve much, simply because they are not willing to step out of their own comfortable zone to risk what they have because they are not able to see how actions can benefit a larger good.<br><br>Because of this, the lack of impetus to actually TAKE action is not there. Compared to someone who realise that a single action from him, may ripple out to cause a much further bigger benefit to the rest of his fellowmen. Serving people MORE than yourself can be empowering in this sense. Becos you act because you believe that your actions have effect beyond yourself, and not simply becos only u benefit by them.<br><br></div>
