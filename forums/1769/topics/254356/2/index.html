You're standing on the balcony of a 25th storey unit. The balcony does not have solid metal / concrete railings but instead, there's only waist-high full glass panels all round. Would you dare to lean over the glass panels with both hands outstretched?<br>- Depends on country <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Perhaps say, in Cambodia the construction is not so secure <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  But in general, yes.<br><br>2. Bungee Jumping... dare to or not?<br>- Enthusiastic yes!<br><br>3. Tandem parachuting (you're strapped in front of an experienced sky diver)... dare to or not?<br>- Enthusiastic yes!<br><br>4. There's a hot business opportunity and you have to liquidise your assets and withdraw all your savings to raise up enough capital to participate. Assuming there's just a 50:50 success to failure chance. Would you?<br>- 50-50 is not good enough.  On the other hand, I do not have much $ to risk  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  and if if the SO has stable source of income to support us both...  But ultimately, no.<br><br>5. You've met this wonderful person and you seem to have so much in common. He/She seems to be a perfect match for you. After knowing each other for just three months, he/she pops THE question. Will you or won't you say "Yes!"?<br>- No.  3 months is too short.  What's the hurry?<br><br>6. You were chosen by a Zookeeper to get up on stage and help him with his next act. He holds a croc's mouth wide open and asks you to put your head into the croc's mouth! Will you do it?<br>- Err. No.  I scared <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>I wouldn't risk my head.  Which body part would be lesser risk?  Maybe I would risk my lower leg <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>7. It's night time and you're on a solo camping trip. Suddenly, you realise that you've left an important personal belonging in the forest, perhaps 500m away from the campsite. You hear the rustling of leaves, and unfamiliar animal sounds and you squint into the forest but it's pitch black! Grabbing your torchlight, you contemplate entering the forest to retrieve your possession. Will you proceed?<br>- Hmm.. No.  I can't sprint 500 m <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Go back in morning with company to get it.<br><br>8. Your drain in the bathroom are clogged! Looking into the drain, it seems that you might just need to put your arm into the murky depths of the drain to clear away the blockage with your bare hands! You know it was probably a piece of plastic that dropped into the drain and all you need to do is reach in, feel around for it, and remove it. You've heard of centipedes and ##*$roaches coming out of the drains though! Would you dare to put your arm in?<br>- Actually I would.  After all, dirt washes off.  But since you mentioned centipedes. &gt;.&lt;   I think I will empty a can of Baygon into the drain, then reach in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

Assuming there's just a 50:50 success to failure chance.  Would you?<br>A4: No.  Too risky.<br><br>Q5. You've met this wonderful person and you seem to have so much in common.  He/She seems to be a perfect match for you.  After knowing each other for just three months, he/she pops THE question.  Will you or won't you say "Yes!"?<br>A5: Yes, if my instinct tells me that he's the one.  Can always have a 12 month engagement and if things don't work out then call off the engagement.<br><br>Q6. You were chosen by a Zookeeper to get up on stage and help him with his next act.  He holds a croc's mouth wide open and asks you to put your head into the croc's mouth!  Will you do it?<br>A6: May be.  Depends on the mood I am in on that day.<br><br>Q7. It's night time and you're on a solo camping trip.  Suddenly, you realise that you've left an important personal belonging in the forest, perhaps 500m away from the campsite.  You hear the rustling of leaves, and unfamiliar animal sounds and you squint into the forest but it's pitch black!  Grabbing your torchlight, you contemplate entering the forest to retrieve your possession.  Will you proceed?<br>A7: No.<br><br>Q8. Your drain in the bathroom are clogged!  Looking into the drain, it seems that you might just need to put your arm into the murky depths of the drain to clear away the blockage with your bare hands!  You know it was probably a piece of plastic that dropped into the drain and all you need to do is reach in, feel around for it, and remove it.  You've heard of centipedes and cockroaches coming out of the drains though!  Would you dare to put your arm in?<br>A8: Yes but with gloves on of course!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Looking at my responses, I guess you can tell that I am not a big risk taker.  Is that good or bad?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Questions :<br><br>1. You're standing on the balcony of a 25th storey unit.  The balcony does not have solid metal / concrete railings but instead, there's only waist-high full glass panels all round.  Would you dare to lean over the glass panels with both hands outstretched?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Normally: No<br>Blindfolded: Yes</span><br><br>2. Bungee Jumping... dare to or not?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Did a 'mini bungee jump' (less than 50 feet) at the State Fair some years back--don't think I have the gumption to try one of the taller ones, though...</span><br><br>3. Tandem parachuting (you're strapped in front of an experienced sky diver)... dare to or not?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Probably would, but it costs way too much to do a tandem jump around here.</span><br><br>4. There's a hot business opportunity and you have to liquidise your assets and withdraw all your savings to raise up enough capital to participate.  Assuming there's just a 50:50 success to failure chance.  Would you?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">HELL, NO!</span><br><br>5. You've met this wonderful person and you seem to have so much in common.  He/She seems to be a perfect match for you.  After knowing each other for just three months, he/she pops THE question.  Will you or won't you say "Yes!"?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hard call. Don't know if three months is enough time to determine long-term compatability, but one's emotions might override prudence at that time.<br><br>Prudence, if it prevails, would dicatate a negative response.</span><br><br>6. You were chosen by a Zookeeper to get up on stage and help him with his next act.  He holds a croc's mouth wide open and asks you to put your head into the croc's mouth!  Will you do it?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Tell you what, Mr. Zookeeper. <strong>You</strong> put <strong>your</strong> bloody head into the bloody croc's mouth! <strong>I'm</strong> getting another job."</span><br><br>7. It's night time and you're on a solo camping trip.  Suddenly, you realise that you've left an important personal belonging in the forest, perhaps 500m away from the campsite.  You hear the rustling of leaves, and unfamiliar animal sounds and you squint into the forest but it's pitch black!  Grabbing your torchlight, you contemplate entering the forest to retrieve your possession.  Will you proceed?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If I am armed, yes. If not, well, why the hell am I camping alone?</span><br><br>8. Your drain in the bathroom are clogged!  Looking into the drain, it seems that you might just need to put your arm into the murky depths of the drain to clear away the blockage with your bare hands!  You know it was probably a piece of plastic that dropped into the drain and all you need to do is reach in, feel around for it, and remove it.  You've heard of centipedes and cockroaches coming out of the drains though!  Would you dare to put your arm in?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">They sell flexible cables at the hardware store intended for the specific purpose of unclogging drains. No need to get one's hands all gunked up for that. Isn't modern technology wonderful? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></span><br></div>
