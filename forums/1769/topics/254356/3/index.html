There's a hot business opportunity and you have to liquidise your assets and withdraw all your savings to raise up enough capital to participate.

Suddenly, you realise that you've left an important personal belonging in the forest, perhaps 500m away from the campsite.  You hear the rustling of leaves, and unfamiliar animal sounds and you squint into the forest but it's pitch black!

Your drain in the bathroom are clogged!  Looking into the drain, it seems that you might just need to put your arm into the murky depths of the drain to clear away the blockage with your bare hands!  You know it was probably a piece of plastic that dropped into the drain and all you need to do is reach in, feel around for it, and remove it.  You've heard of centipedes and cockroaches coming out of the drains though!  Would you dare to put your arm in?  </span><br>Err I think just the thought of putting my hand into the drain is grosser then the thought of centipedes and cockroaches so my answer is no  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Verdict: Pinky Bear is a wuss <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
