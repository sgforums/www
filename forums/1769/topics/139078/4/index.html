Well, I guess it's kinda tough to lay blame on those who resort to it to save their ricebowl.<br><br>BUT, I draw the line when it comes to educated young women who can obviously fend for themselves who suddenly act all helpless and are suddenly soooo in need of a man to 'protect them' because then, the hypocrisy is sooo thick even the blind would know it's fake!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  That's when it gets disgusting.<br><br>Granted, we all need help at one point or other.  Yesterday, I was at a pub and we had to stand at a table cause there were no seats, which was bad news for me cause of my recent knee injury.  So I just voiced out, 'I wish we had seats because I don't think all this standing is going to do any good for my knees!' and 'one gentleman' ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) in our group went over to another table and asked for a chair.  Sooo sweet!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I didn't even need to manja... all I did was to make known my needs and the guy was gallant enough to help!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Tonight, I met a friend after shopping and he volunteered to help with my shopping bags (yeah, I had retail therapy today to celebrate 'Freedom Day'!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) and I didn't even need to manja either.  All I did was look sheepish and grin like a Cheshire cat when he saw me so burdened and then, help was offered.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I guess it feels much better because I didn't have to resort to manja-ing to get  help.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Now, if I had to weasel my way through by resorting to manja tactics, sure, I'll get things done my way but I'd know that I had manipulated the guy somewhat and I'd feel bad about it.  I guess this would disturb some more than others.<br><br>I guess women who manja / der usually resort to it to get attention.  Observe closely - they are the attention-seekers who must be the life of the party, who loves it when attention if focused on them, when they are the 'star' of the show, when they can wrap a guy round her little finger and get him to do her bidding, etc.<br><br>Gedanken, you're right about the flirting and manja bit - it is hard to draw the distinction at times.  I guess you'll know it's manja when you witness it, and it gets you squirming uncomfortably in your seat whilst you get overwhelmed with nausea and you suddenly have an incredible urge to shrivel up and die!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Flirting's when it's done with 'class'... manja-ing is when the above happens!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>And oh, to those people who think that the few of us ladies who are ranting about this issue are doing so because we're 'sour grapes' and are unable to manja successfully ourselves, that's not the real issue.  What motivates me to write strongly about this at times, is that I simply do not like to see people abusing 'feminine wiles' to manipulate a guy.  Maybe I'm frigid, but I don't like to see people being made use of, and I make no apologies for that.  But if you're a 'willing victim', or 'willing bearer' of this, then, erm... my condolences!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Because there will come a day when you will outgrow your fondness for women who manja excessively, and then, trouble will start to brew.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just rem a girl-fren who is very deh-ish.. nothing harmful about her... it's just the way she speaks. very whiny type... And it's quite fun to have her ard cos, knowing her whiny she is, the guys will always disturb and the rest will get entertainment from looking at her reactions.<br><br>but of course, we ruffled a few feathers from ppl nearby who dun know us and buay tahan her deh-ness<br><br>anyway, just a thought.. kids nowadays are more exposed to watching taiwanese shows and learning their mandarin from there. WHAT IF, say in 20 years time, all the kids grows up and speaks with a manja-ish tone.. and manja-ing becomes a societal norm.. very much like in taiwan.. what will be your reactions? if everyone is speaking like that, soon you will be forced to convert to speak in that manner too?</div>
