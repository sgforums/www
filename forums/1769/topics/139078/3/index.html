            <div class='col-md body'>after having read through so much, cannot resist adding my meagre two-pence and playing the adversary defending the "manja"s... rooting for the underdog, being controversial and what not. can't help it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>btw, i realise the subject's " Do guys like it when women act 'der' or helpless?" i prefer to use "manja" / "deh" than "der" as i think the latter sounds like play dumb while it's in actual fact more just a matter of "sa-jiao". as appears to be the direction that this thread is heading...<br><br>the impression i got was that most of the ppl who post here think that:<br>1)  it's ok to manja but only to ONE man in your life (at any one pt in time?) but anything other than that is manipulative and/or bimbotic<br>2) manja-ing is a cheapo way of getting things done for you<br>3) manja girls are chiobus<br><br>i manja and i'm not ashamed to admit it. i manja to my close guy friends and even some of my girlfriends. they do the same to me. i don't "act helpless" but i ask for help when i need / want it. and they give it within their means because they want to. n besides, not all manja-ing comes with an ulterior motive. sometimes, it's simply in jest.<br><br>what's wrong? we're good friends and we know it's all in good fun. if as an onlooker you cannot differentiate between manipulation and good fun, on what basis do you go about classifying it as the former? what happened to doubts and the benefits given thereof?<br><br>just because my guy frens do nice things for me such as help me carry heavy shopping, open cans etc doesn't mean i'm making use of them. i know guys who absolutely refuse to let me carry anything other than my own handbag when we go out together, without me having to ask or bat an eyelash. they're gentlemen. what's wrong?<br><br>i only manja to guys whom i know "can take it". i.e. can see it for what it is - a laugh. and if they're ok with it, wherefore should a third party take offence?<br><br>of course, i stop short of girls who use it to manipulate men to do their biddings like zombies/slaves purely for their own selfish pleasure / convenience. that, of course, is another story. i dun do that, at least not that i know of. hahaaa... but think of it this way, the guys are all willing, thinking adults. if they refuse to or do not want to do something, who can make them? it really does takes 2 hands to clap, u know...<br><br>why do we think less of the girl who manja and get her way as compared to the girl who tried to manja, did not get her way and decided not to manja anymore because of that? what's the difference? success and failure. c'est tout.<br><br>of course, if it's not in your nature to manja and you prefer to be independant, then good for you! i admire and applaud your strength.<br><br>but that's no reason to put down the other camp to the extent of expressing such extreme emotions such as disgust and vomit over their behaviour.<br><br>p.s. not refering to all those who posted here. just the more extreme cases... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>oh yes, btw, i'm not a chiobu and i dun think i'm a bimbo so... kinda refutes the case, huh? :p</div>

That's why I dislike hanging out in big groups, because they are usually one dimensional and cliquish with nothing interesting to share except look that girl/guy is hot. SO? Can he write? Is he intellectual. I bet those w hores only care if he has good grades from which they could copy his homework. NUS is one of the lamest and most depressing place. It's brimming with excitement of youth, except the phony quotient is much more overpowering.</div></blockquote>NUS..never had any real spirit to begin with.<br><br>Heh.You were from an all girls school..I was from an all boys school.10 years of that.I do understand what you mean, some of the guys I know are easily manipulated by a sweet face and a weak voice.<br><br>Me?If a lady cannot help herself, she does not deserve any help from me.I want independant ladies, not manipulative poofters who only know how to nuzzle their way into a guy's pocket or his car.<br><br>Walk alone and walk tall, you will find your own circle that feels the same,and that a close circle of like minded intellects is better than a large gaggle of airblown coneheads.</div>

Just as there are women who are over achievers, independent or plain lazy, there are those who really can't do their jobs to save their lives. But they need to survive in this world too and for that to happen, they have to resort to any help they can get from their colleagues so they don't get the boot. Women colleagues generally aren't as helpful as the men, particularly if their fellow colleague is prettier than they are or has men swarming around her like bees. It's really quite pitiful, especially if they're saddled with family responsibilities. They can be among your friends and you won't have a clue why they choose to 'charm' a guy into helping them. They might rather have their women pals think they're able to supposedly twist men around their fingers than to be looked down on for their near zero capacity working ability.</div>
