              <p>The FS and I went to Punggol with an open mind..... we weren't expecting large, condo-like flats with awesome amenities and sea view or anything like that, but thinking that it was new, we at least expected some reasonable, decent flats.....</p>
              <p>What we saw completely shocked us. No kidding. Whatever happened to good architectural and engineering practices like building in a north-south orientation, using good-quality building materials and avoiding crazy angles where possible is beyond me....</p>
              <p>I think it's really dumb to have a living room getting the full force of the afternoon sun, while the laundry-drying area gets no sun at all. And I think that peeling paint and cracked tiles in a new housing estate are downright unacceptable, and I don't see why anyone would want to literally live above a dumpster.</p>
              <p>We're both East-bred, and ideally we're thinking of either Simei or Pasir Ris.... at least they're still relatively recent (late 80s - early 90s) with none of the stupid 'innovations' of Punggol....</p>
