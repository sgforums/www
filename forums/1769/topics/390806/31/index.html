              <div class="byline"><cite class="vcard">By Chris Meyers <span class="fn org">Chris Meyers</span> </cite>– <abbr class="recenttimedate" title="2010-02-18T00:15:49-0800">1 hr 22 mins ago</abbr></div>
              <p></p>
              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>TOKYO (Reuters) – A Japanese restauranteur has turned the nation's <span id="lw_1266480951_0" class="yshortcuts">everyday comfort food</span>, ramen or noodle soup, into a pricey, gourmet affair that costs more than $100 (64 pounds) and takes three days to fully prepare.</p>
              <p>The "Five-taste Blend Imperial Noodles" offered at Tokyo's Fujimaki Gekijyo restaurant is ultimately just a bowl of soup and noodles, albeit an expensive one especially as Japan's economy slowly recovers from its worst recession since <span id="lw_1266480951_1" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: medium none; background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand;">World War Two</span>.</p>
              <p>But owner Shoichi Fujimaki said it's the soup, and the more than 20 ingredients used to make it, that elevated the dish from <span id="lw_1266480951_2" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed; cursor: hand;">street food</span> into five-star cuisine, with the price tag to match.</p>
              <p>"It's not really ramen. This is my cuisine, it's my 25 years of experience distilled into one bowl," Fujimaki told Reuters as he poured ingredients into a bubbling pot. "This is the only place in the world that people have this kind of soup."</p>
              <p>A bowl of ramen from any of the tens of thousands of little shops and stalls that are everywhere in <span id="lw_1266480951_3" class="yshortcuts">Japan</span> will usually set you back $10, at the most.</p>
              <p>Fujimaki's ramen costs $110 a bowl and uses top-grade Chinese stock blended with another stock inspired by the spicy, Thai tom yum soup as well as spices, meats and vegetables.</p>
              <p>Initially, the restaurant sold a ramen dish with more than the average toppings for an above-average $33.</p>
              <p>Then Fujimaki decided to create the even more complex dish, with an even higher price tag, to serve at his reservations-only eatery that has no menu and which customers can only dine in after they sample cheaper fare at another restaurant he owns.</p>
              <p>Some of the patrons who eventually get to tuck into the pricey ramen say its worth every yen.</p>
              <p>"It's certainly expensive, however, I think that it is sometimes better to come here and spend ten thousand yen than to go to another place and spend a thousand, ten times," said Hideko Furusawa, a 49-year-old diner.</p>
              <p>Fujimaki plans to open a restaurant offering the same noodles in <span id="lw_1266480951_4" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: medium none; background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand;">Los Angeles</span> by August, although he has yet to decide on whether he'll charge the same.</p>

              <p>yeps, bukit panjang, the thinking is that we can deposit the dog and kids with my parents before going off to work in the mornings, the kids have a place to go after school before we go pick em up. both of us don't like the idea of having a maid.</p>
              <p>and we can wait out the ballot cos fatumnette's already got her own bachelorette apartment at marine parade liao, plus we have 5 bedrooms in my house ... there'll always be a place to stay while we wait.</p>
              <p>the resale market is crazy crazy right now, you know the ad that bear put up ? showing a listing for 900k for a 30 yr old 5 room marine parade flat ?</p>
              <p>well, the agency grapevine says a different unit was just transacted, at that price .... the COV is around THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND !!!!! It never make the news cos resale prices have become a political hot potato ....</p>
              <p>some sucker actually paid 300k for a full on sea view. of course, for that kind of money, you can't get a seaview condo anywhere but still .... -_-"</p>

              <p>yeps, bukit panjang, the thinking is that we can deposit the dog and kids with my parents before going off to work in the mornings, the kids have a place to go after school before we go pick em up. both of us don't like the idea of having a maid.</p>
              <p>and we can wait out the ballot cos fatumnette's already got her own bachelorette apartment at marine parade liao, plus we have 5 bedrooms in my house ... there'll always be a place to stay while we wait.</p>
              <p>the resale market is crazy crazy right now, you know the ad that bear put up ? showing a listing for 900k for a 30 yr old 5 room marine parade flat ?</p>
              <p>well, the agency grapevine says a different unit was just transacted, at that price .... the COV is around THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND !!!!! It never make the news cos resale prices have become a political hot potato ....</p>
              <p>some sucker actually paid 300k for a full on sea view. of course, for that kind of money, you can't get a seaview condo anywhere but still .... -_-"</p>
