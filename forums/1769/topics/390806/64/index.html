              <p>That was the reply my aunt got when my cousin was picked on in school in USA.<br>I think the boys there just hated him because the girls were all over him. My cousin was a very handsome boy. I think he is less handsome now but still very good looking. Haha </p>

              <p>here in singapore, schools do not take bullying seriously either. its either "boys will be boys", or they punish both bully and victim....which in turn makes the bully whack the victim even harder as revenge later.</p>

              <p>I think there's always psychological damage to kids who are bullied in school and whose parents do not do anything.  It's like, if your parents can't even protect  you, then who can? Although this mom's court action is overboard, in a way, I applaud her cause it's high time someone stood up against school bullies and it's high time parents of bullies realise that their kids cannot get away with their horrid behaviour anymore.</p>
              <p>I'm really against bullying.  There was a recent case of a young female adult who committed suicide after being bullied relentlessly in the workplace by three male colleagues.  It will make you cry when you realise how badly she was bullied.  I cried watching the news on TV and how sad her family were to lose her.  The father broke down and cried and said he felt so helpless that he couldn't protect her daughter and only found out about it too late. </p>
              <p>I know most of you here take a hard stand and not surprisingly, in Singapore, there is still a huge non-acceptance of mental health and psychological health matters.  However, these issues like depression and other psychological ailments that are very real and sometimes, school bullying is the root of some of these issues.</p>
              <p>I'm not for mollycuddling, but I'm totally against bullying.  I think what the boys did to that poor boy was horrendous - tying his hands with rope and pulling his arms apart, etc.</p>

              <p><br> You can get a whole range of Old Spice stuff there</p>
              <p>I think there is Old Spice shower products too if I didn't
              remember wrongly</p>
              <p>I know ppl from India come to Singapore to buy Old Spice back by
              the carton</p>
              <p>At least that is the request MPB always gets if he goes to India
              by the indian engineers</p>
