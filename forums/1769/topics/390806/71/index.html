              <p>during my kid days, i remember i was with mom at Kwang Min San Temple.</p>
              <p>the temple is generous to offer devotees free lunch.</p>
              <p>was seated patiently with mom at table, waiting for the food to be ready.</p>
              <p>there was this kid taking the temple's plastic chopsticks and hitting against the table.</p>
              <p>the mom just bor-chap.  the chopsticks broke, and the mom took another pair to give to son to continue to vandalise.</p>
              <p>i was about 11 years old and i dunno where i got the nerve.  i told his mom off.</p>
              <p>"how god will bless u when u break the temple things!"</p>
              <p>she stared and tell my mom "how could your daughter say this to me."</p>
              <p>the others at the same table cannot tahan and scold her back.  she grabbed son and left in a huff.  we all grinned after that, cos we have less 2 mouths to share the food. :)</p>
