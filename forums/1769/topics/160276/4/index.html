Push factors in sg is so numerous that people who left don't mind being called quitters!<br>sg is full of the new-rich with a shallow history and not much of culture to talk about. Everything that happens, it all comes from top down. Don't blame the people at the bottom of the social ladder for their attitude as this is strongly influenced from the policies enforced with no much flexiblilty from top mdown<br><br>Ppl adopted apathy as a means as the law is not going to be flexible. Say the taxi picked up the mother/daughter and started to speed.<br>- Its possible that other cars do not give way and the taxi gets into an accident. Then what? The cab company and  the cab driver are penalized.<br>- Its possible the police stop the taxi for speeding and the poor cabby has to pay a fine and put his livelihood on the chopping block and looses his license.<br>- Say the doctors give up saving another critical fellow in the hospital to save this girl. Then the other fellow died and the family from the dead writes in and condamn the woman and her daughter.<br><br>Say if the cab or police man help but drive into a traffic jam, then should all the others be blamed for the issue.  Its all hard decisions and really no one is obligated to help another person if its not within their means. And as I said, cabs =/= ambulance. They are a profit making entity, and they do not service the public as would a ambulance.<br>Everything is a judgement call. And the mother also made a bad judgement call. The writer worse still wrote something so flaming should also think about his actions.<br><br>I would say those in the public service should since they are public service. But to blame society as being apathy for not helping. Then I've got nothing to say.<br><br>Kosovo was having a civil war. they asked for help but no country stepped forward. But any oil producing country ask for help. Everyone fight tooth and nail to go in and grab a piece of the action.<br></div>
