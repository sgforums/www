Should the doctors drop all the critical patients and say the lady's daughter? is the girl's life worth more than anyone else? This is a moral question liao.<br><br>Then failing to save the girl, would the writer then blame the society for the road accidents and hospital for not having enough doctors and better service to save the girl?<br><br>It all really comes down to being prepared. Yes, anyone would panic. But panic aside, one needs to try the best to correct the situation. Panic like a mad woman would not save anyone. And to blame everyone for not helping is just plain irresponsible.<br><br>Being prepared is the responsibility of the mother - not the job of every stranger on the road.<br></div>
