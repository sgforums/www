I will do what I can do even if it has little effect. Little effect is still some effect. Thats the difference. I try to change the world for better even if it is little bit by bit. U think, oh this talk no use de, so no point. But thats apathy isn't it? U dun get the point that it is irrelevant whether it is drilled into your heads or not. The point is to do something to change this notion which is drilled into your heads. Surely not everyone have been drilled with the notion equally deeply, so like I said, if I can get even just ONE person to change his thinking, that is already enuf effect for me.<br><br>ok fine if u're apathetic because its been drilled into your heads, u dun have to say anything. but what i dun understand is, why u have to come here to speak against other people who want to get people to think?</div>
