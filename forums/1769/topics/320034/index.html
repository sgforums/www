              <p> </p>
              <p>The Xingu River flows from the tropical savanna of central Mato Grosso, Brazil northward to the Amazon for 1,979 km (1,230 miles). Some 14,000 indigenous people, from nine distinct ethnic groups, live along the Xingu. In 1989, an international mobilization, led by the Kayapó Indians, stopped state electric company Eletronorte´s plans to construct a six-dam complex on the Xingu and its tributary, the Iriri.</p>
              <p>Now, Brazil is planning the construction of a huge dam on the Xingu, called <a title="Tenotã-Mõ executive summary" href="http://www.sgforums.com/en/latin-america/amazon-basin/xingu-river/tenot-m-executive-summary"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Belo Monte</span></span></a>. Belo Monte would require diverting nearly the entire flow of the Xingu through two artificial canals to the dam´s powerhouse, leaving indigenous communities along what is known as the Xingu´s Big Bend without water, fish, or a means of river transport. The dam would be highly inefficient, with its turbines grinding to a halt for three or four months every year during the river´s lowest stream flow. Facing this reality, the electric sector is now planning to build four additional dams upstream to store water during the dry season, as well as to generate electricity. Original plans for dams on the Xingu would have meant the flooding of more than 18,000 sq km (8,300 sq mi) of the rainforest. The latest dam plans would cause the flooding of indigenous villages and other protected areas, as well as irreversible impacts to the Xingu´s fish stocks.</p>
              <p>International Rivers is working with the Kayapó and other indigenous groups and environmental and social activists to protect the Xingu River Basin from large dams. Indigenous peoples and their allies are planning a huge gathering in 2008 to voice their opposition to dams on the Xingu.</p>

              <p>My heart bleeds for the to-be cub and all the other cubs of the world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png">  We don't know of a society where you have to fight to get food onto the plate, or slog our asses off just to feed ourselves and no more, but I think we're getting there sooner or later.</p>
              <p>I think a lot of people have cubs because the world is so desolate, they need hope and joy... and they get it from watching their cubs grow up in the first few magical years.  And then the cub goes into school and realises that there's something called 'homework', 'competition', and 'bullying'. </p>

              <p>Just flip to the Bible, very last book - Revelations.  Things happening now had already been predicted centuries ago, and one-by-one, it's all coming true! </p>
              <p>We ARE on the cusp of worse to come.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, there will be a food shortage driven mainly by climate changes affecting crop yield.  There will be a world leader who'll rise up to the challenge of providing food for the world because he will come up with some manner of irrigating the vast desert lands for agriculture,  thus propelling him to power and fame.</p>
              <p>And it has also been predicted that China will be the next world superpower, overtaking USA.</p>
              <p>All this and more in the old Book of Revelations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
