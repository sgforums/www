              <p>What the ............ !</p>
              <p><strong><span>Canadian parents board flight, leave toddler at airport</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">OTTAWA - TICKETS, check. Passports, check. Luggage, check. Baby ... oops.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">A family boarded a flight on Monday in westernmost Canada, and
              forgot their toddler at the Vancouver international airport, media said
              on Tuesday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The 23-month-old boy's family had just arrived in Canada from the
              Philippines, but they were forced to repack their overweight bags
              before catching a connecting flight to Winnipeg, causing them to run late.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In their sprint to the gate, the family became separated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The boy's father, Mr Jun Parreno, told local media he had thought
              his son was with his wife and the boy's grandparents, who ran ahead.
              They thought the boy was with his dad.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">On the plane, the family members were seated separately and so did not immediately realise they had left the child behind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sometime later, a security guard found the boy, who speaks no
              English, wandering near the departure gate, and Air Canada officials
              tracked down his shocked parents on the flight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Because the boy was so young, he was not issued a boarding pass and
              would have sat on a parent's lap during the flight, so airline
              personnel did not notice a passenger was missing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">According to the Vancouver Sun, airport security found a
              Tagalog-speaking Air Canada agent who looked after the child while his
              father flew 2,300km back to Vancouver to pick him up and then return to
              Winnipeg to rejoin the immigrant family on their first day in Canada.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The baby was kept in Air Canada's offices and staff found him some toys, said local media.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">'Air Canada took good care of him,' Mr Parreno told the daily Winnipeg Free Press upon arrival. 'I'm grateful.' -- AFP</span></p>

              <p>WTF?!?! Not leaving a 1 year old home alone is considered overprotective?</p>
              <p>I can think of many compelling reasons why you should not leave such a young child home alone.</p>
