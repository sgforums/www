            <div class='col-md body'>Jan 22 2005 marks the 32nd anniversary of Roe v Wad, the supreme court's historic decision recognising a woman's right to privacy in deciding whether to have an abortion. Making the decision to terminate a pregnancy or to bring a fetus to term is by far the most wrenching decision I've ever had. The right to choose is not a luxury, it is a resposibility that demands intense introspection and awareness<br>I had an abortion several years ago when I was eight weeks into my pregnancy and in my final year of a law degree. My partner who is warm and loving was writing his thesis. We had discussed all aspects of our aspirations, careers and feelings about my pregnancy. We agreed mutually that an abortion was the right decision at that point and time. He had been present at the procedure to provide support and care.<br>Now, both of us feel we had made the decision in haste. We do experience a degree of sadness which manifests itself around certain times of the year, particularly the anniversary date of the abortion. The wound is not red raw, however we need to gather our strength, embrace and find solace in each other in order to get through the day. An abortion choice is not a topic my partner can share readily with other men. It is a decision we both have to live with and find healing.<br>Conversely, the fundamental right of every individual to decide freely and responsibly when and whether to have a child is a reaffirmation of the principle of individual liberty cherised by most worldwide. It helps ensure that children will be wanted and loved and that choice rather than chance will guide the future of humanity.</div>
