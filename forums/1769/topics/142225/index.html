So the Ultrasound technician hv 2 insert a tube-like ultrasound device into my private part. Tis way, my bb could be seen. Then the gynea said too small 4 abortion, they could not do it. Give me appt 2 go back a week later.<br><br>But the next mornin, I got brown discharge. So I went 2 KK A&amp;E, hoping they jus get rid of it. Then the A&amp;E MO did the tube-scanning again! He said if I dun wan the bb, no pt let me stay hospital. Asked me 2 go hm, if bleed than go back.<br><br>The next day, I bleed like menstruation. So I went back 2 KK. The MO did the tube-scanning AGAIN!!! He said ok, can do it liao. But I also need ligation at the same time. The MO said he's not specialist, can't do both. Made an appt n asked me 2 go see specialist 2 days later! So I go back n bleed 4 another 2 days. I lied in bed most of time, so painful n no strength...<br><br>It was a Wed appt, before seeing the specialist, I had 2 do the tube-scanning AGAIN!!! The specialist then informed me tat my bb got no heart beat liao. n he assured me he will do the abortion n ligation 2gether safely. He tried 2 book the operation theatre on Thu. But FULL liao! So he had 2 book on Fri!!! Meaning bleeding another day lor!<br><br>I tell u lor, it was all torturing! It was very painful!<br><br>Fortunately on Fri, everything went on smoothly.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi..was reading this page...using my bf's account now. Might as well share mine with you. I was almost 6 months pregnant before I got the abortion done. I had a twin boys. Was studying in Melbourne, and mum didn't know. I lost my father 3 years ago. So I had to toggle with school, and pre-natal care and endless most expensive visits to the doctor which I had to starve myself to pay up for. I rang mum to send me extra cash, not like she didn't have, but she just kpkb. In the end said no, but told me if i needed help I could go to her. When I did, she turned away...even moral support was denied.<br>In the end, I sold everything I had, my i-pod, my electronic keyboard, some electronic things like an mp3 player, and with the help of my friends, we managed to raise enough money for me to buy a ticket home from Melbourne. Austrian Air, already around 600+ and I only get 785 a month, sometimes less.<br>In the end, to cut a super long story short, I went for the abortion, whcich cost me not only 4k(that one doesn't bother me as much as what it did to me), but a very scarred person. My mother heck care, threw me out of the house.<br>What I mean to say is, that although yes, the nightmares and the guilt and feelings of being a murderer are more than strong in ladies who have gone through abortions, sadly, life must go on. The doctor told me one of my boys had an abnormal head, a kind of birth defect, so i might not survive if I gave birth, let alone the two boys. I turned out fine, but my boys are dead. Maybe its kind of unfair, but at the moment just try to lift yourself up and carry on. It hurts like hell, but it truly isn't the end of the world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>flyme2moon, I'm so sorry that you had to go through all that.  It didn't sound like Standard Operating Procedures and what you had to endure certainly seemed to make everything worse.  I guess sometimes, we make mistakes that fill us with regret for a long, long time but we do have to learn to make peace with our mistakes, pray for forgiveness, and then move on.  By sharing your experience, I'm sure you'll help a few other ladies who are in the same dilemma of deciding to abort or not, make a more informed decision.  It's time to let go and forgive yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>GwenSilv, you sound like a very strong person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  It's not easy to do what you had to do but you seem to have learnt from your experience, and moved on with a positive attitude.  You made the best of a bad situation and whilst it was very tough having to sell everything you've got to get things done, I'm just relieved that you managed to pick up the pieces.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I guess if I ever found myself to be pregnant outside marriage, I'll probably keep the baby no matter what.  I believe in the sanctity of life and even if I was abandoned and have to become a single mom, I guess I'll just hope that my friends and family will provide a support network as I go through the process of pregnancy and single motherhood.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">   I've seen abortions happening in the Operating Theatres and the minute they turned on the suction, I started to squirm and wince and it was tough to tell myself, 'Be professional!' and continue standing there to assist.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Deep inside me, I just wished the girls would say, 'I don't want to proceed with this abortion now - I want to think about it some more' after the doctor and/or nurses give them a last discussion to ascertain that they really want to go ahead with the procedure.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Sadly, during my stint there, I realised that there are still a minority out there, who persist in using abortions as a form of contraception!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Hopefully, your experiences would help others who are in similar circumstances right now, make a better decision.<br></div>
