Out of respect for each other, they'll say who they're going out with and what they'll be doing.  They don't question each other in detail.  I like that kind of freedom and mutual respect.<br><br>Some of us need our private time to think about stuff, to just enjoy the peace and solitude, to calibrate our internal radars... stuff like that.<br><br>It depends on how the need is communicated, of course.  If the other party is assured that should there be an urgent need to, one is contactable even during one's private time, things should be fine.  I guess one has to work out with one's SO how this issue should be handled so that no one feels upset over it.<br><br>My ex and I gave each other a lot of alone time.  During the alone time, I got to catch up with my other friends, spend time doing my hobby, pay more attention to my cats, etc.  Sometimes, indulge in whimsical stuff like sitting by the wide open kitchen windows, enjoying a nice glass of iced lemon tea, looking at the stars and just daydreaming.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>All said, if a guy is so insecure that he can't even bear the thought of me going off for a few hours of alone time, then he's really not my type!  I won't be able to tahan the sticky-ikky sort who clings to you 24/7!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   And yes, I have shirked off such guys before back in my schooldays!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   The recollection still makes me shudder!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ooh.. I guess I didn't classify spending time apart as private time, just freedom from each other. Definitely a couple should have the freedom (and independence) to spend time with friends or do whatever they want. (e.g. hubby not in living room watching tv and me in computer room playing computer hee). A healthy normal relationship doesn't need a couple of stick to each other!<br><br>Rather, I refer to private time as time spent that is private FROM your partner - meaning your partner is not privy to how you spend your time and privacy referring to things which you do not share with your partner at all and should not need to explain to him/her because it is private to you.<br><br>E.g. I have a friend who is an artist and have those type of temperament and she needs a lot of private time. She doesn't like to explain to people what she needs to do in order to 'discover' or watver she does to fuel her artistic inclinations, because if work is in progress, she doesn't liek to talk about it. She also cannot predict when one of these moments comes when she suddenly becomes uncontactable for a day or two.  While her friends accept her 'disappearances', Unfortunately, this has caused stress to her relationships, despite her reassurances that she is not UP TO anything unfaithful or illegal or watever. She cannot understand why her need for this privacy cannot be respected and accepted.</div>

If you do trust each other then there is no reason why you should feel that you are being interogated when he or she asks, "what do you get up to when i am not around"<br><br>If you do indeed want private time, you better be damned sure you choose a partner who understands that and also understands private time is not "do what you want" time. Ofcourse i generalise and you may be opened to such relationships.</div>

WAAA so many 'yous' i assume the 'you' you are talking about is not me, but since u quoted my post its kinda weird. But anyway I dont have issues with privacy with my partner... hurhurhur.. except when he demands i go elsewhere to fart or something when I ate something REAL baaaad.<br><br>But.. the thing is.. some people apparently DO want this form of privacy - I don't get it either. i.e. in Japan, there is a trend of married couples keeping  different rooms and different lives and they believe it keeps their love 'fresher' as if they are still dating. So.. takes all types of make the word ah!</div>
