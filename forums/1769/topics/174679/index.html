            <div class='col-md body'>well...heheheh I'm pretty comfortable with my partner cos.. hmm having met each other first in a trekking environment where we got to be pretty open about body functions anyway, you don't have much to be embarassed  and squeamish about.<br><br>Even with other girls, going to poo is a communal event where we chit chat while doing the necessary purging. There is nothing that bonds people more than toilet humour *ahem*<br><br>I think it is not so much proving a point to purposely DO things like this with your partner but rather, having to live together with someone, it gets rather inconvenient if you value your privacy a lot or are squeamish about such things.<br><br>I honestly will go mad if I live with a squeamish guy who can't stand looking at me shaving my armpits or farting or don't dare to buy sanitary pads for me or whatever. More than that, I guess I will also find it difficult to imagine him looking after me if I fall badly ill or old - what if I become incontinent (used in the Lacking normal voluntary control of excretory functions meaning of this word)?
