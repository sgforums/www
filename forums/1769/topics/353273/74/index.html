              <p>I had supper witha cute guy.</p>
              <p>I got the last bus home.</p>
              <p>I just had a good long showerr and clearing the mess from my bed now.</p>
              <p>There is a fresh pile of DVDs and Cds to be ripped into my little creative zen player.</p>
              <p>And sat, I am helping at the station again.</p>
              <p>I am saying I am helping.  I am not transferring there nor is there a exchange a personnel.</p>
              <p>The person who tot that she was to be exchanged, came to my cubicle and actually was asking why I have not moved into her tiny desk and she can moved into my cubicle.</p>
              <p>I fob her off with that there is no exchanges, because there is no exchange.  I am currently farm out to special projects, recruitment and is currently still with welfare.  Welfare team may be terminated, so exchanging me and her, is going to be still the same where she eventually has to f off.</p>
              <p>Its probably some politics at play, but no way was my head going to settle for someone that cannot do work, commit nor actually knows my work in exchange to his dept.</p>
              <p>I think my HOD was kinda quite proud and pleased that I not only picked up the pace but was doing more then what he request for me to handle.  I am seriously now doing more then required or expected.</p>
              <p>Heck, if I handled whole HQ for 2 years before. Whats so difficult about handling 3 departments now?</p>

              <p>Was remembering last night.</p>
              <p>My HOD received a email about us having to start to take temperature from 01 May onwards.</p>
              <p>I casually mentioned it to the Manpower Admin Officer.</p>
              <p>And I casually mentioned that his predessessor has a big box of themometers in her cupboard.  He should use them first.</p>
              <p>He told me he never seen the inside of that cupboard since that madam never gave him the key.  I then helpfully rummaged thru my assortment of keys and found the key to his cubicle's main cupboard.</p>
              <p>Opened that cupboard and help to emptied out that cupboard of stationaries.</p>
              <p>Then apparently later, he checked the emails and found out that POlice HQ has instructed him to go to New Pheonix Park Centre to collect thermometers and face masks.</p>
              <p>He then got one of my dept officer to go home, change out his car for a class 4 lorry and they went to collect the thermometers before 10pm dateline.</p>
              <p>When they reached there, the officers can only give them 7 pieces of thermometers. "-"</p>
