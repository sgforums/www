              <p>But I kenna once before, when I was a pedestrian, carrying loads of groceries... .. a cyclist on the pavement comign from behind at high speed ringing his bell, so i tried to avoid by stepping to the side closer to the grass</p>
              <p>(how I know which side he's coming from? he is coming so fast! he's behind me!)</p>
              <p>then he almost crash into me.. but he didn't - but he went to the grass patch instead, almost lost his balance then had the audacity to STARE AT ME and shout "WALAO EHHHH"  like its my fault.</p>
              <p> Then like a typical HDB housewife... i shouted back at him :D</p>

              <p>I share your agony. I really feel that all those PCN... a lot of them are totally not designed BY cyclists! Don't say those Changi/East Coast park places lah.. but those that actually link places together via more urban/suburban places... it is really quite weirdly planned. Sigh...</p>
