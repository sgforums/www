            <div class='col-md body'>One day, the queen of the jungle gathered the animals, and told them. Each animal must tell a joke, if someone does not laugh, the joker will be executed.<br>So, monkey told a very funny joke. All the animals laughed and rolled about, except tortoise. So, monkey was executed. Next, rabbit, told a joke, and tortoise, again was unmoved. So rabbit's fate was sealed. Interestingly, when rabbit's head was chopped off, tortoise suddenly burst into laughter and laughed till he cried. The bewildered animals asked what happened. Tortoise choked and said. Monkey's joke is damn funny!<br><br>One day, 3 bored vampires who lived in castle decided to have a contest. Whoever drank the most blood in the fastest time wins. So, off went the 1st vamp in bat shape. He came back in 5min, and had blood on his lips. He said. I drank the blood from pp in 3 villages.<br>The others were awed. The 2nd vamp came back in 1min, and had blood on his cheeks and lips. The 2 shocked vamps listened to him say. I drank blood from pp in 10 villages.<br>The last vamp changed into a bat also, and came back in 15s, he had blood on his face, and some dripped onto his cloak. The other 2 were flabberghasted and the victor said. I went down the stairs and failed to see the pillar.<br></div>

They'll even decorate it for you.<br><br><strong>Martha Stewart</strong>: If you accidentally over salt a dish while it's still cooking, drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess for an instant "fix me up."<br><strong>Real Women</strong>: If you over salt a dish while you are cooking, that's too darn bad. I made it and you will eat it.<br><br><strong>Martha Stewart</strong>: Wrap celery in aluminum foil when putting it in the refrigerator and it will keep for weeks.<br><strong>Real Women</strong>: Celery? Never heard of the stuff.<br><br><strong>Martha Stewart</strong>: Brush some beaten egg white over a piecrust before baking to yield a beautiful glossy finish.<br><strong>Real Women</strong>: The Mrs. Smith frozen pie directions do not include brushing egg whites over the crust, so I just don't do it.<br><br><strong>Martha Stewart</strong>: Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your forehead. The throbbing will go away.<br><strong>Real Women</strong>: Take a lime, cut it in half and mix it with tequila, etc., chill and drink. You might still have the headache, but who cares?<br><br><strong>Martha Stewart</strong>: If you have a problem opening jars, try using latex dishwashing gloves. They give a non-slip grip that makes opening jars easy.<br><strong>Real Women</strong>: Go ask the very cute neighbor to open it for you.<br><br><strong>Martha Stewart</strong>: Don't throw away all that leftover wine.
