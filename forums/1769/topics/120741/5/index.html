So, he sent a cheque<br>for $250.00 and enclosed a note:<br><br>**********<br>Dear Madam:<br>Enclosed find a check in the amount of $250.00 for the rental of<br>your apartment.<br>I am not sending the amount agreed upon because when I rented the<br>apartment,i was under the impression that:<br><br>1. It had never been occupied.<br>2. There was plenty of heat.<br>3. It was small enough to make me cozy and at home.<br><br>Last night, however, I found out that it had been previously occupied,<br>that there wasn't any heat, and that it was entirely too large.<br><br>Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately sent back the<br>following reply:<br><br>**********<br>Dear Sir:<br><br>First of all, I cannot understand how you expect such a beautiful<br>apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. As for the heat, there<br>is plenty of it if you know how to turn it on. Regarding the<br>space, the apartment is indeed of regular size, but if you don't<br>have enough furniture to fill it, please don't blame the landlord.<br>I will expect full payment due immediately or I<br>will be forced to hire someone to remove your furniture!!<br></div>

Though<br>they were far from rich, they managed to get by because they watched<br>their<br>pennies. Though not young, they were both in very good health, largely<br>due<br>to the wife's insistence on healthy foods and exercise for the last 2<br>decades.<br><br>One day, their good health didn't help when they went on a rare<br>vacation and their plane unfortunately crashed, sending them off to<br>Heaven.<br><br>They reached the pearly gates, and St. Peter escorted them inside.<br>He<br>took them to a beautiful mansion, furnished in gold and fine silks,<br>with a<br>fully stocked kitchen and a waterfall in the master bath. A maid could<br>be<br>seen hanging their favorite clothes in the closet. They gasped in<br>astonishment when he said, "Welcome to Heaven. This will be your home<br>now."<br><br>The old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost.<br><br>"Why, nothing," Peter replied; "remember, this is your reward in<br>Heaven."<br><br>The old man looked out the window and right there he saw a<br>championship golf course, finer and more beautiful than any ever-built<br>on<br>Earth. "What are the greens fees?" grumbled the old man.<br><br>"This is heaven," St. Peter replied. "You can play for free, every<br>day, any time of day that you want."<br><br>Next they went to the clubhouse and saw the lavish buffet lunch,<br>with<br>every imaginable cuisine laid out before them, from seafood to steaks<br>to<br>exotic deserts, free flowing beverages. "Don't even ask," said St.<br>Peter to<br>the man. "This is Heaven, it is all free for you to enjoy."<br><br>The old man looked around and glanced nervously at his wife.<br>"Well,<br>where are the low fat and low cholesterol foods, and the decaffeinated<br>tea?"<br>he asked.<br><br>"That's the best part," St. Peter replied. "You can eat and drink<br>as<br>much as you like of whatever you like, and you will never get fat or<br>sick.<br>This is Heaven!"<br><br>The old man inquired, "No gym to work out at?"<br><br>"Not unless you want to," was the answer.<br><br>"No testing my sugar or blood pressure or..."<br><br>"Never again. All you do here is enjoy yourself."<br><br>The old man glared at his wife and said, "You and your damn bran<br>muffins!  We could have been here twenty years ago!"<br></div>
