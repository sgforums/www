When I was your age, I could hit the ball far over the tree.<br>The man took it as a challenge and hit the ball as hard as he could. The ball hit the tree in mid-trunk and thudded back to the same place.The old man pipped up. Of course, when I was your age, the tree was only a metre tall.<br><br>A priest was tired of giving sermons and prayers. So one Sunday, he drove to a faraway golf course to avoid attention and played golf. St Peter asked God. Will you let him off?<br>God shook his head. The next moment, the priest teed off and it was a hole-in-one! The priest tried again and it repeated. This went on ten times. St Peter was outraged and he asked God. I thought you would punish him? You rewarded him instead!<br>God replied. I have punished him, now who is he gonna tell?<br><br>Hope you enjoy these 2 jokes.</div>

While at his favourite bar, he manages to attract one rather scandinavian looking blonde woman.<br><br>So they're back at his place, and sure enough,they go at it.<br><br>After a long while ... He climaxes loudly.  Then he rolls over, lights up a cigarette and asks her, "So<br>.... you finish?"<br><br>After a slight pause she replies, "No."<br><br>Surprised, but pleasantly, he puts out his cigarette, rolls back on top of her, and has his way with her again, this time lasting even longer than the last...<br>and this time completing the deed with even louder shouts.<br><br>Again he rolls over, lights a cigarette, and asks, "So .... you finish?"<br><br>And again, after a short pause, she simply says "No."<br><br>Stunned, but still acting reflexively on his macho pride, he once again puts out the cigarette, and mounts his companion du jour.<br><br>This time, with all the strength he could muster up, he barely manages to end the task, but he does, after quite some time and energy is spent.<br><br>Barely able to roll over, he reaches for his cigarette ... lights it again, and then asks tiredly, "So ... you finish?"<br><br>To which her reply is, "No. I'm Swedish."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the very first day, God created the cow. He said to the cow, "Today I have created you! As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer and work all day long. You will work all day under the sun and help provide for the farmers family! I will give you a lifespan of 50 years."<br><br>The cow objected. "What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 years? Let me have 20 years, and the last 30 years - I'll give back to you."<br><br>So God agreed.<br><br>On the second day, God created the dog. God said to the dog, "What you<br>are supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house. Any people that<br>come by, or in, you will have to bark at them! I'll give you a life span of 20 years!"<br><br>The dog objected. "What? All day long I have to sit by the door? No way!  Let me live for only 10 years. I give you back my other 10 years of life!"<br><br>So God agreed.<br><br>On the third day, God created the monkey. He said to the monkey, "A monkey<br>has to entertain people. You've got to make them laugh and do monkey tricks. And I'll give you a 20 year life span."<br><br>The monkey objected. "What? Make them laugh? Do monkey faces and tricks?<br>Ten years will do, and the other 10 years - I'll give back to you."<br><br>So God agreed.<br><br>On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, "Your job is to sleep, eat, and play. You will enjoy very much in your life. All you need to do is to enjoy and do nothing. For this kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life span."<br><br>The man objected. "What? Such a good life! Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?  Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years? No way, man!....... Why don't we make a deal? Since Cow gave you back 30 years, Dog gave you back 10 years, and Monkey gave you back 10 years, I will take them from you! That makes my life span 70 years, right?"<br><br>So God agreed.<br><br>AND THAT IS WHY.........In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing much. For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support the family. For the next 10 years, we entertain our  grandchildren by making monkey faces and doing monkey tricks. And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, sit in front of the door and bark at people.<br><br></div>
