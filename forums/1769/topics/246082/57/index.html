And yes, I believe her attire is as what she had described more or less. After a while of taking popcorns from me (she took it herself using her own hands, I did not feed her), she actually pulled my arms closed to her bre*st. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong> I never pulled your arms to my boobs!</strong></span>I did not retaliate. But I did moved my arm away from her because I had to take popcorn for myself. The process repeated itself for a while.<span style="font-style: italic;"><strong> Repeated itself... more like when I stopped eating, your hands continued moving!!!! WTF.</strong></span> Sometimes she would pull my arm close to her to feed on the popcorn, sometimes I just moved my hand to her.<br><br>[quote]<br><br>devil seems to prey on every young girl. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
