            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">i think the coyote is going to burn out pretty soon</div></blockquote>It's been a pretty harsh semester.<br><br>1. You know about that friend of mine who tried to do something really stupid. Suffice to say that while it's under control, it really burnt me out pretty good. I actually went for professional counselling after that.<br><br>2. The plagiarism saga. That took up a lot of time and effort on my part to solve.<br><br>And one thing I learnt - the guy actually does visit sgforums. He came across the thread in Whinehouse about my rants on the whole saga. While he was understandably pissed at me, at the same time he finally understood just how serious his actions were. He got pretty dismayed at the fact that he could have gotten three other people face serious disciplinary action because of his lack of responsibility.<br><br>Suffice to say that I'm now at peace with him and I've deleted the thread... but I still refuse to work with him again in the future.<br><br>3. Missing things. My pencil case and calculator both went missing. Each loss cost me $20 - no small change to a cash-strapped undergrad.<br><br>4. The usual academic demands. To be frank, I coped pretty well with my studies for much of the semester. It has only been in the past two weeks or so that all the sh*t has been coming together. Consider my major tasks till the end of the month:<br><br>11th: CA test with 25% weightage<br><br>12th: Prototype presentation for the Rotary Club<br><br>18th: Public exhibition for finished prototypes<br><br>21st, 23rd, 26th, 30th: Exams<br><br>I'll try to take it easy as much as I can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
