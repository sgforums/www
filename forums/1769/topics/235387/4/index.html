            <div class='col-md body'>You must be just a kid so that women at 30 are labelled "aunties" as they are far too  old for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>No way man. Contrary to what many people think, some women actually reach their prime when they reach 30. Just look at Maggie Cheung, Lin Ching Hsia, Lin Chi-ling, etc.<br><br>And this is not just in the looks department. I believe they are much more mentally mature to be able to commit themselves to relationships.....<br><br>Therefore the statement that all women over 30 are aunties is far too sweeping and absolute crap.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Especially since they are not well off, and by the time their children are in primary school, are usually unemployable or suffering from health problems, so the poor young brides who thought they would have a better life by marrying the singaporean ah peks find themselves having to work to support/look after both the ah peks and the children!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I'm not speculating btw, I know this for a fact.</div>

Ultimately, the same standards in the relationship of being FOR each other still stands - nobody wants to be part of a relationship where her/his only attractiveness lies in being low maintenance. The effort required to commit to a relationship remains similar - I think many an independent woman have been disappointed that simply because they 'look' stronger they are expected to require 'romancing' less.<br><br>After all nowadays many women even after marriage would give birth at an age after 30.

FYI women over the age of 30 are in their prime, wrong to say that only men are in their prime after they hit 30. Its a fact that women do get sexier, more elegant, attractive and wiser as they age. They dress much much better with so much more class compared to a lady in her 20's. The age is jus a number mah. Its how you present yourself and behave.</div>
