            <div class='col-md body'>Age gap is not an issue IMHO. But it depends on which phase of life you are in. At 20 yrs old, she will be exposed to many 'exciting' things in this materialistic world. What if she wakes up one day and decide to call it quit? Then you are farked. But if she is 35 and you are 49, then likely she is somewhat settled down and knows what she wants.<br><br>My advice is don't force it. If it comes, it comes. You can be lonely even when you are with your girlfriend or wife or friends. Singlehood can be interesting too. If you are jumping in just to forget your ex, then you end up with more scars.<br><br>Hope it helps.<br><br>Cheer up buddy....<br><br></div>

What you wrote have always been so inspiring!!<br><br>I have dated girls 3,5,6,9 years younger than me then there was one 3 yrs older than me .. Most girls who are already in their mid 20s and been working for a while usually are alr attached.. so we are left with ...are usaullay the younger ones... pple change all the times ..sometime maturity do not correspond with age .. its all life experience which shaped us as what we are today.... One of the gal 9 yrs my junior is mature way above her age.. cos I think she stepped into the working society at the ripe old age of 16 ,...she has gone thru more than her peers ...who had a breezy life in the poly , Uni then progress on to some cushy jobs..<br><br>guess it doesnt matter what the age gap afterall... its our mental condition..<br><br>Wish myself and all the brother here Good Lucks!! .. May you find your lovely belle soon !!!</div>

I am in a dilema will there be future with her.. its not that she has hinted to me that she will give me chance or anything... its more of my wishful thinking on my part.. Good thing about her is she is more simple minded that the older women I have gone out with.. yes she feel like a little girl... maybe she just want to get to know more pple that all .. she probably never suspect.. I just have this ulterior motive to make her my girl fren ..<br><br>i dun really care what other  will think about us .. if we really are an items ever!... but i am not sure if  this is the meeting of the minds .. will we make it ???.. consider our age gap.. guess I dun have much energy left in me liao.. just my wishful thinking anyway...as if I will ever have a chance with her... infact i am not even sure whether she is attached..(from our converasation she seems not attached yet) . just painting a hypothesis kind of scenario of me being a couple with her .. sorry for wasting your time if  you find this thread bo liao..</div></blockquote>I feel that she's just simple minded because maybe she had not had enough contact with the real world yet. However, she may wanna have fun and not be tied down at such an age.<br><br>On the other hand, I may be completely wrong. She could really be that pure and simple. I'm just making a conjecture based on statistics here.</div>
