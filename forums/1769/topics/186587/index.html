            <div class='col-md body'>This is a thread that originated from a discussion we were having over in our Jive Pad.  (Yup, I'm shamelessly plugging our Jive Pad!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>So, picture this scenario... an accident just occured, and a Good Samaritan rushed over to help.  The driver appeared to be stuck behind the wheel and in great pain, and in his bid to help the driver, the Good Samaritan tried to assist by trying to pull the driver out of his seat and whilst doing so, aggravated the spinal injury already suffered by the driver, unbeknownst to both.<br><br>In the hospital, the driver's family, angered by the fact that the Samaritan's bid to pull the driver to safety aggravated the spinal injuries, decide to sue the Samaritan.<br><br>What do you think of this ethical situation?<br><br>Or, how about this... a person trained in administering CPR rushed up to administer CPR on someone who suddenly collapsed whilst shopping in a mall.  In so doing, he saved the person, but broke two to three ribs in the process.<br><br>The family decides to hold the person liable for the broken ribs.<br><br>Ethical issues are always tough to debate, but let's do so here.  Share your thoughts, but let's agree to disagree.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this is interesting cos when I got my First Aid cert, this is what I asked my trainer. I also asked the civil defence guy who came to teach us basic first aid.<br><br>What they both shared was that as long as we show that we tried to do according to what we have learnt, then a broken rib is preferable to loss of life. I also asked, what if the broken rib leads to complications which leads to injuries such as punctured lung? I also asked, what if I forgot what I learnt and therefore misapplied it. But both parties said, even if we are scared and don't do a deep enough compression, it is still better than no compression.<br><br>But having said these, I think if someone collapses in front of you and heartbeat stops AND there is no one else available to assist. I really don't think most people will think about being sued or not but will do all that is possible to help the casualty. I also think that if the person CHECKED that there is indeed no heartbeat and no breathing - the person they are saving is technically dead! How can they kill someone who is dead liao?<br><br>Lastly.. Hmm.. recently a friend's father had a cardiac arrest at home. No one around knew CPR. They called the ambulance but by the time it came, he was already dead. It would be a pity if the fear of being sued prevent people from learning how to do CPR. I'm not sure if faced with this situation I will have the mind power to do it... but... the feeling of being totally helpless in the face of a loved one's agony... is not something I hope to face.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When thinking about this subject, the saying "no good deed goes unpunished" comes to mind.<br><br>That being said, its really a grey area. One can argue that in the case of the first person, he should be sued for rashly trying to render first aid despite being untrained. However, you can also say that he had no malicious intent and was only trying to help out of the goodness of his heart! How?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>The second person, trained in first aid/cpr,  saved the victim's life but broke ribs in the process. His ungrateful family decided to sue their benefactor. The case should be dismissed outright with costs borne by the plantiffs and a stiff reprimand delivered by the judge.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Personally, I decided not to renew my first aid/cpr license so that I will never be placed in a dilemma. Since my license is not current, it is in fact illegal for me to render any aid. So I just stick to calling the emergency services in such cases. Except , of course if the victim is my own family member.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me tell you a real incident, but I will exercise 'creative judgement' and change details to protect the identities of people involved.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>When I was still a Nursing Student doing an attachment in a local hospital, my tutor and I was walking towards an MRT station when we saw an elderly man who suddenly collapsed and lay on the floor, looking quite dazed and weak.<br><br>I told my tutor, "Oh no!  Let's go over and help that man!"<br><br>My tutor pulled me back saying, "No, let's just move on, see, there are uniformed nurses who are going to help the man already!  Let's not invite trouble and get ourselves involved!"  (It was the end of a working shift so that's why there were nurses around the MRT Station heading back home).<br><br>I was extremely stunned to hear her say that!  Being my tutor, I thought she should be a good example instead of holding me back!<br><br>It was only much later that I sorta understood her reticence.  She was probably afraid of any unpleasant repurcussions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>It's sad that the fear of any legal repurcussion would deter people from helping, but the sad truth is, people ARE becoming more litigatious these days, and unreasonably so too!<br><br>Imagine, doctor or not, nurse or otherwise, First Aid trained or not, we all have our off days when we're tired or exhausted after a day's work and am heading home in a 'switched off' mode.  When suddenly confronted with a collapsed man in such a situation, we may rush forward to help but in our quick response, we may inadvertently not do something right, or forget a few steps, etc.  Being CPR certified does not guarantee that you would not have any off days or be caught off-guard or in your haste, miss a step or two.<br><br>Of course, trained personnel have to be competent and there ought to be no excuses about it.
