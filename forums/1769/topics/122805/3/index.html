            <div class='col-md body'>Neuros, I know what you're getting at, and I kinda agree too.  Thing is, we tend to seek solace at the end of a love relationship and well, we just tend to gravitate towards the more attractive notions as a sort of salve and balm for the hurting soul and bleeding heart.  Natural human reaction, I guess.<br><br>Also, a lot of times, once we lose a person, we end up placing him / her on a pedestal where he / she appears more flawless than they really are.  Suddenly, no one else can hold a candle to him / her...<br><br>I guess different folks engage different mechanisms to get over a breakup...</div>

'in the end, we all sleep alone...'<br><br>It can be very heartbreaking to find out that the other person does not cherish you as much as you cherish him/her.  Or like what Eric said, that what once used to amuse him/her no longer exacts the same mesmerising charm on them.<br><br>All of us are different and we operate on different levels of needs and wants.  However, central to the core of everyone is a need to be loved and accepted for who we really are.  The more transparent you render yourself to your loved one, the more vulnerable you become and subsequently, the worse the hurt when the axe falls.<br><br>And yet, knowing all these, experiencing all these too, we still carry this teeny hope in our hearts that somewhere out there is someone meant for us.
