However, in my personal opinion, divorce is not the way..however it really depends on individual.  What u want in life may not be the same as what others want.  Divorce rate in sg is very high.  And in many cases, it's due to the fact that the man could no longer bring bread home or could not satisfy the wife in the materials or other aspect.  It's very saddening that all those vows made seems to be forgotten now.<br><br>What is true love?   Some people put off marriage because of financial instability.  It seems that money is a very important factor if two persons want to get married.  From wedding dinner, honeymoon expenses to buying of flats, future planning and even include diapers money and kids education....and without money, most of these things can't be done.  So we need money to survive.  But then, especially in sg, many people focus too much on the financial part that they forget why they want to get married..Is it to be guaranteed a future with comfort and materialistic life or to find a soulmate and spend the rest of their lives with the one they love and whom they can't live without.  Well...I know..people always say that most of the times the one we marry may not be the one we love most.<br><br>And because of this high divorce rate..it might seem that marriage is not a thing that we will really look forward to, for..what's marriage? what's vow?   A couple may get married today and wana divorce tomorrow.  And due to the fact that women can better support themselves financially now, they dun need men to give them comfort and all those luxuries.  Hence they will tend to find someone who can support them financially and spiritually before they consider marriage.  </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Rhonda that we are no longer cavemen/cavewomen.<br><br>Our level of needs and wants have evolved and we should no longer think like neanderthals. If survival or money becomes the reasons a couple got married, then it's no wonder if one of them bails when these reasons are threatened. There are many ways to survive in this modern world. Ever noticed single working men/women are often living a 'better' life? They don't have children to worry about and this itself is a huge money saver. Then wouldn't you say that they are surviving better?<br><br>The decision to be together for life should not be lowered to a level of 'Need'. It should be a 'Want' -<br><br>I want to commit my life to making that man/woman happy,<br>I want to build a life with him/her and be a part of his/her life,<br>I want to set my eyes on none other,<br>I want to declare to the world that in sickness or in health, for richer or for poorer, i choose to love, hold and cherish this man/woman till death do us part.<br><br>Marriage is a covenant that is not to be broken. No how much the world has perverted the sanctity of such a beautiful declaration of love, I believe the there are still people out there who would still hold true the real reason for marriage. Now all is left is to find the one who also shares your views and cherishes them like you do.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">We're not cavemen now, I think we left that waaaaaaaaaay behind us and I like to think that we're more developed intellectually, psychologically and culturally now.<br><br>And, whatever happened to the sanctity of marriage?<br><br>Has it all been reduced to self-gratification now?  Has it become a 'if I can't get what I want then I'll just leave for greener pastures' thing?  How about actually MEANING what one said when one happily recited, 'in good times and bad, in sickness and in health' or has it all become just a cliche?<br><br>When you marry someone, it really means that if the guy becomes retrenched tomorrow and you lose all your material luxuries and have to struggle alongside him, you do so.<br><br>Or should we now make it 'DEFINITELY in good times and PERHAPS in bad, MAYBE in sickness but DEFINITELY in health'?<br><br></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Imperfect:</div><div class="quote_body">We can also say that there is actually no change since the day humans roam the land...<br><br>In the past, man marry to continue their genes and woman for someone to protect and provide for them. Though time has changed and woman do not need to marry just for the sake of finding someone to protect and provide for them as they are more independent now. However, we cannot forget that the purpose to get together is for survival.<br><br>In the modern world, one needs money to survive, especially in singapore... since she can't find what she needed in the marriage anymore, she decide to find it elsewhere... everyone will be looking for different things in different situations, and if it cant be found, s/he finds it elsewhere... </div></blockquote></div>

The vast majority of people think that they know themselves but they actually haven't delved deep enough.  They THINK they love you, they THINK they want to live the rest of their lives with you, they commit to you because they THINK they are ready for it... but as the years go by, more is discovered about the self and the other and then issues start to surface and differences start to be glaring.<br><br>There's actually an 'acid test' that I apply to people I like that usually shows in a short space of time, whether they are true gentlemen or otherwise.  It's what I call, a 'reverse closeness' strategy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  It can end up hurting like hell because you make yourself vulnerable in the process, but it helps me decide in a relatively short space of time, whether to start building the walls or to continue to trust that person.<br><br>I feel self-awareness is very important.  How can you contribute fully in a relationship unless you understand yourself well enough?  Only when you start to understand yourself can you then be a step closer to perceiving who would be an ideal partner for you.  Otherwise, you'd be bringing false hopes and various ills into a relationship.  Sad, but you see a lot of marriage doomed to failure before they even sign on that piece of paper...<br><br>Too many folks enter into a marriage thinking it would solve problems, but they forget that marriage in itself presents a new set of challenges that requires tough work, sheer commitment and steadfastness, and deep love to pull through.  It is definitely not all lovey-dovey all of the time.<br><br></div>
