Then again, I've always known KB to be a particularly astute and intellectually-responsible lad.<br><br>The fact is that within the script thinkdifferent agreed to, I did nothing wrong.  You will see that your moralisation is severely misplaced (although I appreciate your well-meaning intentions in a provincial manner) within the context of my previous answer to you.  From the point thinkdifferent brought up the matter of parody, I have been in fact dealing with what has been said, and unfortunately I am not accountable for your inability to see that.<br><br>Besides, even if we were to take thindifferent at her word in the first post, you seem to missed my addressing the point of the breakup issue, in particular the matter of defining "happiness".  If YOU, in fact, choose to focus upon how something is being said instead of what I have said, I am again not accountable for it.<br><br>In any case, my degrees are neither in English nor Philosophy, and I'll be charitable in giving the benefit of the doubt and avoiding the assumption of an inferiority complex on your part here.</div>

And I have heard of more such cases which gave me the idea of writing this. We should take everything with humour even when it is hard. Thinking positive. Here it goes:<br><br>The tragical phenomenon of todayÂ’s society Â– a guy dumps his gf. There are many species of the dumping guys (hey hey guys, donÂ’t curse me yet Â…) but I want to mention only one species. The Â“Promise me to be happy anywayÂ” species.<br><br>Yes, there are really guys who dump their gf and tell her Â“Be strong and promise me to be happy.Â”  (Yes, there are really such guys.)<br><br>HelloooÂ… guys, do you know what you are asking from the girl??? You are asking her to be schizophrenic. She just got dumped! Do you think she can jump from joy and scream: Â“I am soo happy!!!! Yeeeehaaaa!!!!! LetÂ’s party, I am so happy because that bastard has dumped me!Â”  and then really make a party somewhere downtown, oozing with happiness, the party so wild that the police arrests her and the rest of the party people for disturbing the silent hours? Come on! Do you know whatÂ’s going on in her mind?<br>The lights are going off in your exgfÂ’s wonderland. The sun stopped to shine, the birds are falling down dead, the rabbits are motionless rotting and stinking on the meadow with wilted flowers, the fairies are committing seppuku, make up shops and fashion boutiques have no sell outs and are closed. And she is deciding whether to buy a ticket to USA from the money she saved thanks to using you as her wallet and jump off the Empire State Building kicking King KongÂ’s nuts, slapping him with her handbag and shouting: Â“Die you baboon, you are a man too!!!!Â” or to buy a new night dress and eat grandmotherÂ’s pink sleeping pills which are on the bedside table beside the glass full of water in which her third teeth are swimming happily.<br><br>Dear guys, you were the reason for the happiness of your girlfriends. To dump a loving gf is like to remove all oxygen from the air she is breathing. To dump a girl and asking her to promise you to be happy is the same as cutting her both hands off and telling her: Â“Promise me to write letters (for those hi tech freaks also emails and sms) to me every day!Â”<br><br>So dear guys, next time you dump your gf, give her a huge box of tissues and a baseball bat with which she can bang you if she feels like that.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>i think the guy trying to live up to a saying.<br>"if you love her, let her go"<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

This thread was misunderstood, almost everyone is taking it too seriously but it's ok. Everyone is unique, everyone perceives the things in his own way. We have seen serious reactions, also funny reactions, even bitter reactions. The reactions, opinions and views depend on the personal experience of everyone posting here. I don't think that some opinions are not correct. Everyone is correct in something else. As I said, it depends on the personal experience about this topic.<br>This is a public forum and everyone can express his/her opinion.<br>We have seen so many reactions on this thread, but the most unconventional was the focus on the meaning of the word "happy" while everyone else was focusing on break ups and relationships. As my thread was meant to be a parody, it's ofcourse that the words have an enhanced meaning - it's typical for a parody, joke, comedy ...<br><br>When I make some typos or grammatical mistakes, look at the watch and excuse me. I'm pretty tired evenings and nights after my busy days.<br><br>I want to thank to all who have posted in this thread and please feel free to express your opions, but please do so in a kind and not accusing manner.</div>

If thinkdifferent's friend had remained in a deteriorating relationship, would she have experienced satisfaction and joy?  I think not.  Therefore, I don't see anything wrong with the now ex-boyfriend's wish for her to be happy.<br><br>Well and good if thinkdifferent's friend would prefer to live in blissful ignorance, but obviously the boyfriend saw what was coming and decided to cut both their losses.  It is only the short-term view that justtifies thinkdifferent's castigation of this guy, so of course there's cause to object to the defintion of happiness, isn't there?  Obviously harping on it, instead of taking the longer-term view and moving on, is simply a waste of time.<br><br>This isn't comedy, this isn't parody - it's a mindless rant based upon a childish definition of happiness.  Since thinkdifferent already set the tone to be used in the first post, I don't see any reason for putting on the kid gloves, do you?</div>

And I have heard of more such cases which gave me the idea of writing this. We should take everything with humour even when it is hard. Thinking positive. Here it goes:<br><br>The tragical phenomenon of todayÂ’s society Â– a guy dumps his gf. There are many species of the dumping guys (hey hey guys, donÂ’t curse me yet Â…) but I want to mention only one species. The Â“Promise me to be happy anywayÂ” species.<br><br>Yes, there are really guys who dump their gf and tell her Â“Be strong and promise me to be happy.Â”  (Yes, there are really such guys.)<br><br>HelloooÂ… guys, do you know what you are asking from the girl??? You are asking her to be schizophrenic. She just got dumped! Do you think she can jump from joy and scream: Â“I am soo happy!!!! Yeeeehaaaa!!!!! LetÂ’s party, I am so happy because that bastard has dumped me!Â”  and then really make a party somewhere downtown, oozing with happiness, the party so wild that the police arrests her and the rest of the party people for disturbing the silent hours? Come on! Do you know whatÂ’s going on in her mind?<br>The lights are going off in your exgfÂ’s wonderland. The sun stopped to shine, the birds are falling down dead, the rabbits are motionless rotting and stinking on the meadow with wilted flowers, the fairies are committing seppuku, make up shops and fashion boutiques have no sell outs and are closed. And she is deciding whether to buy a ticket to USA from the money she saved thanks to using you as her wallet and jump off the Empire State Building kicking King KongÂ’s nuts, slapping him with her handbag and shouting: Â“Die you baboon, you are a man too!!!!Â” or to buy a new night dress and eat grandmotherÂ’s pink sleeping pills which are on the bedside table beside the glass full of water in which her third teeth are swimming happily.<br><br>Dear guys, you were the reason for the happiness of your girlfriends. To dump a loving gf is like to remove all oxygen from the air she is breathing. To dump a girl and asking her to promise you to be happy is the same as cutting her both hands off and telling her: Â“Promise me to write letters (for those hi tech freaks also emails and sms) to me every day!Â”<br><br>So dear guys, next time you dump your gf, give her a huge box of tissues and a baseball bat with which she can bang you if she feels like that.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>*YAWN*  <blockquote> Dear guys, you were the reason for the happiness of your girlfriends .......... blah blah fluffy bunny dead</blockquote>  .<br>Please don't make me gag . Am I reading some dear miss agony aunt section in a teenage magazine ?<br><br>Move on , get over it .  Relationships are based on respecting each other - who says you cannot be friends with your ex . If a person is matured to admit that they cannot be in a relationship with the other because they feel it is wrong, then respect them for being truthful . At least they know how they feel and they actually have the guts to tell ya . True it sucks to get dumped but as you grow , you meet more people and who knows one day you meet the right person.<br><br>A baseball bat is reserved for the unfaithful .</div>
