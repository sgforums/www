            <div class='col-md body'>I have been inspired to write this when a friend of mine told me what happened to her. And I have heard of more such cases which gave me the idea of writing this. We should take everything with humour even when it is hard. Thinking positive. Here it goes:<br><br>The tragical phenomenon of todayÂ’s society Â– a guy dumps his gf. There are many species of the dumping guys (hey hey guys, donÂ’t curse me yet Â…) but I want to mention only one species. The Â“Promise me to be happy anywayÂ” species.<br><br>Yes, there are really guys who dump their gf and tell her Â“Be strong and promise me to be happy.Â”  (Yes, there are really such guys.)<br><br>HelloooÂ… guys, do you know what you are asking from the girl??? You are asking her to be schizophrenic. She just got dumped! Do you think she can jump from joy and scream: Â“I am soo happy!!!! Yeeeehaaaa!!!!! LetÂ’s party, I am so happy because that bastard has dumped me!Â”  and then really make a party somewhere downtown, oozing with happiness, the party so wild that the police arrests her and the rest of the party people for disturbing the silent hours? Come on! Do you know whatÂ’s going on in her mind?<br>The lights are going off in your exgfÂ’s wonderland. The sun stopped to shine, the birds are falling down dead, the rabbits are motionless rotting and stinking on the meadow with wilted flowers, the fairies are committing seppuku, make up shops and fashion boutiques have no sell outs and are closed. And she is deciding whether to buy a ticket to USA from the money she saved thanks to using you as her wallet and jump off the Empire State Building kicking King KongÂ’s nuts, slapping him with her handbag and shouting: Â“Die you baboon, you are a man too!!!!Â” or to buy a new night dress and eat grandmotherÂ’s pink sleeping pills which are on the bedside table beside the glass full of water in which her third teeth are swimming happily.<br><br>Dear guys, you were the reason for the happiness of your girlfriends. To dump a loving gf is like to remove all oxygen from the air she is breathing. To dump a girl and asking her to promise you to be happy is the same as cutting her both hands off and telling her: Â“Promise me to write letters (for those hi tech freaks also emails and sms) to me every day!Â”<br><br>So dear guys, next time you dump your gf, give her a huge box of tissues and a baseball bat with which she can bang you if she feels like that.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If you got dumped, usually its because the relationship isnt working out in the first place but you are still hanging on and mayhaps hoping for a miracle. It's just that the other partner chose to end it first, thus shattering all hopes that you might have cherished and causing you much grief and despair.<br><br>There was one r/s I was in when I didnt feel anything at all for the guy. So, when we broke up, it was a mutual relief... Erm. Strangest r/s I had but heck, I was young and a bit of an idiot at that time.</div>
