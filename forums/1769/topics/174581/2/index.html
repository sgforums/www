The mourning is there for a reason. It's a way to deal with the trauma. But one should be careful as it can easily happen that the person gets stucked in this state of mind for a very long time or for ever. Especially the weak personalities are in such a danger.</div>

This is the risk of the "dangerous game".</div></blockquote>Let me start by saying boo hoo hoo<br><br>I find it comical that u ask us guys to be kind to our gf when we dumping them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">. What about the reverse? Infact can you realy be kind when you are leaving a relationship no matter the duration.<br><br>As i and most people understand the dumper is never in a frame of mind of being kind. And yes the dumpee always suffer, regardless of male or female.<br><br>It takes 2 to form a relationship and if 1 side does not want the relationship, no matter what you want/need there is no future.<br><br>I have a close cousin that has been recently "dumped" with very little explanation as to why, after 6 years. He is ready and willing to marry her, if rthat has crossed over the minds of many a female here. I can tell you he bothers me everyday with his sadness and self blame, the "what if i had done bla blah blah". Now he doesnt smoke, womanise or even go out with chicks other than groups with her friends and he has kinda chosen her over his friends, as a result have no ties with his old friends. So to claim that guys be kind to your girlfriends is sterotypical at its most extreme.<br><br>My advise to your greiving friend is consider that if he realy loved you he would have stayed and it is (using the cliche) "Better to have loved and lose, than never have loved at all."<br><br>Be humble that you have given it your all and you are not the reason why he left.<br><br>Love is not a game and if you see it as such, remember that the other person will probably see it the same way. We all know games come to an end.<br><br>The Danger of such a "risky" game is if he comes back many months, even after several years, and you take him back, thats when the games is dangerous. I have seen many of my friends fight and split, and come back after a week or month, but non of them left each other cause they did not love the other or wanted to see what was over the other fence.<br><br>Another cousin (yes they are all sops lol) took his gf back, after she had her "room" and relationships in between no doubt, only to be dumped again many months later. I think hes still hooked up on her as any realtionships he forms have been short at best.<br><br>well thats my 15cents worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In life, we go through different stages and milestones and we're always on the journey of self-discovery and change.<br><br>Someone who might seem right for you in your teens might not be heading towards the same direction when you're both in your 20's, and so on and so forth.  You might no longer see eye-to-eye or your goals in life might have changed and what you thought you wanted, you no longer want because you are now pursuing different goals and values.<br><br>Change is inevitable and sometimes, sadly, relationships cannot weather the stormy changes.<br><br>What Kan-i said is so right - if one party no longer wants to make a relationship work, why insist on pursuing it?  It's easier said than done, of course, esp if the dumped one has always felt comfortable and happy in the relationship and had no inkling at all that something bad was brewing underneath the glossy surface.  Times like this, don't you wish that the other person had been kind and honest enough to discuss issues bothering him/her instead of accummulating all their unhappiness and dissatisfaction only to drop an atomic bomb of a breakup on you suddenly?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>However, like av98m said, sometimes, we don't know which outfit fits us best until we've tried several on.  That said, I guess the best we can do when we're being dumped is to mourn over it for a while, and then force ourselves to realise that ultimately, it's all for the best - it's best that we get dumped by someone who isn't sure they can and want to walk life's journey with us rather than to marry them and then find that you're on different tandems and you can't jive together.  Divorce is infinitely worse because of the legal implications and all that.  If you've broken up, you tick 'Single' under Marital Status but well, a divorce is a divorce and there are still sorry souls out there who'll think that something's wrong with you if you're a divorcee, the sorry sods!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ah well, let's raise a toast to all who are still single in here!

It is true that you will hurt for a long time to come and every time you see two people together you long for that half that has gone from your life. However I do not beliee that the person was "your soulmate".   I consider soulmate mutuals, clearly to lose someone you have spent many a years with is awful to say the least.<br><br>But its amazing how quickly you get over a person when you finaly meet someone better  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just give new people in your "new" life a chance. For fear of getting hurt will mean you will never allow someone else close to you, and that will be a tragedy.</div>

What about the reverse? Infact can you realy be kind when you are leaving a relationship no matter the duration.<br><br>As i and most people understand the dumper is never in a frame of mind of being kind. And yes the dumpee always suffer, regardless of male or female.<br><br>It takes 2 to form a relationship and if 1 side does not want the relationship, no matter what you want/need there is no future.<br><br>I have a close cousin that has been recently "dumped" with very little explanation as to why, after 6 years. He is ready and willing to marry her, if rthat has crossed over the minds of many a female here. I can tell you he bothers me everyday with his sadness and self blame, the "what if i had done bla blah blah". Now he doesnt smoke, womanise or even go out with chicks other than groups with her friends and he has kinda chosen her over his friends, as a result have no ties with his old friends. So to claim that guys be kind to your girlfriends is sterotypical at its most extreme.<br><br>My advise to your greiving friend is consider that if he realy loved you he would have stayed and it is (using the cliche) "Better to have loved and lose, than never have loved at all."<br><br>Be humble that you have given it your all and you are not the reason why he left.<br><br>Love is not a game and if you see it as such, remember that the other person will probably see it the same way. We all know games come to an end.<br><br>The Danger of such a "risky" game is if he comes back many months, even after several years, and you take him back, thats when the games is dangerous. I have seen many of my friends fight and split, and come back after a week or month, but non of them left each other cause they did not love the other or wanted to see what was over the other fence.<br><br>Another cousin (yes they are all sops lol) took his gf back, after she had her "room" and relationships in between no doubt, only to be dumped again many months later.
