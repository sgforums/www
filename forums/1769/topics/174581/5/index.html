            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Gedanken,<br><br>Please, why donÂ’t you make peace with me? I havenÂ’t attacked you and you are picking on me anyway. I donÂ’t have your arrogance, nor your ego to argue with you, neither I feel the need to feed and show my ego off. If you  canÂ’t make peace with me, then atleast tell me what you  want to reach or prove with your arrogant comments and I give it to you. I donÂ’t see any point in arguing about the meaning of the word Â“happyÂ”, this is really an irrelevant issue and nobody here canÂ’t understand why it is bothering you so much, that you probably canÂ’t sleep because of it. If you want to make me in the eyes of the others mindless, childish, shallow or whatever, just tell me and I admit all those to make you happy and to make you feel like the winner. The same applies to the meaning of the word Â“happyÂ” and to my thread, tell me what you want to prove about them and I admit it here in the forum. You have commented them, but please summarize the things you want to prove so that I can admit all of them.<br><br>I have asked you if you have something against me in my PM and also asked you to solve it via PM and not in the public forum, but you have replied that you will carry on with this till I get it. If you still want to discuss about the meaning of the word Â“happyÂ”, I again ask you to do so via PM and without your arrogance. Why canÂ’t you be friendly? I would like to discuss with you about anything but only when you put your arrogance away.<br><br>The only thing which you have with your comments reached is, that the others see you as an arrogant ( Â… I donÂ’t want to be rude so you can put here any word you like). Congratulation!<br><br>I have got many supporting PMs since you started picking on me in which the forumers tell me I shouldnÂ’t mind you and that you often bully others. I canÂ’t believe you are a psychologist, I thought you were some arrogant guy around 20 years old who has nothing better to do then to act like the winner. I thought people in your age Â–  older then the most of us here, are wiser and humble and have learnt from the life.<br><br>I know that you will use the words I wrote here against me and keep picking on me. Maybe you choose some statements from here and would try to prove I am contradicting to myself or I am this or that or whatever. I wonÂ’t react on your comments. Why not? I explain it with the words of the Bear or maybe someone else used these words : Â“donÂ’t feed the trollÂ”<br><br>The only comment I am willing to make is to admit everything you want to prove to make you feel like the winner and me the loser and I hope it finally creates peace and you stop your arrogant comments, ofcourse you are free to make any other comments. Unluckily for you, you will have to find a new victim to feed your ego, but I donÂ’t think it is hard for you.<br><br>I would prefer to be friends.<br><br>I want to apologize to all for solving it in the public, I donÂ’t intend to make more posts of this kind. All I want is to end the arrogant comments of Gedanken, preferably in a friendly manner; I hope he is capable of it.<br><br>Gedanken, can you make peace with me in a friendly manner?<br></div>

Hypocrisy just rankles, and surface-level treatment carries little currency with me.<br><br>The points that I consider pertinent and worth discussing are all in my previous posts already - if you do want peace (an objective that is clearly not reflected in your posts), take on the subject matter and either justify your stance or develop an understanding of the alternative view.

The definition of happiness is skewed . Men are the reason why a woman is happy - OH PLEASE.  Happiness is found in oneself rather than found in others.<br><br>I know Ged ....he may be too blunt to the point but he has a point. He ain't feeding no ego - he just speaking what he thinks and that takes guts rather than some guy who refrains from debating a point with a girl just because he is scared of the emotional outbursts .<br><br>Frankly this topic should not be even in a 30s section since it just reflects the thoughts of a teenager who just got jilted from puppydog love. It just makes me think of those girly mags ...Oh he loves me Oh he loves me not  *shudder*<br><br>FOR GODSAKES....stop crying "OOOH someone is bullying me"  as implied. Defend your position and tell us why you think happiness should be borne on the shoulders of a man rather than out of a partnership .<br><br>P.S I AM NOT EVEN 30 and this topic is irritating the sh*t outta me.</div>

Mr Tough and Mr Cool all in one persona.<br><br>From reading the comments of others, i am surprised that you as a psychologist do not recognise, and if you do recognise it, then admit that your are indeed "ego tripping" and enjoying the victimisation of thinkdifferent. With the pretence of talking about the topic of this thread.<br><br>My apolgise for insulting one such as yourself to state that your have a mere teching degree. But your interest of critically anylsing the litery works of thinkdifferent lead me to beleive this. You seem to have no concern or seemingly try to see what thinkdifferent is or maybe talking about behind what she wrote.<br><br>But now that she has indeed asked you to back off, i think any person should respect such as wish and do so. Even i can not believe that you can be so petty.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh* Here we go again.<br><br>First and foremost, you choose to impose your little world view on things, conveniently sidestepping what has been made painfully explicit.  OK, you're forgiven for not knowing about either Razor Ramon or Tony Montana (Al Pacino's character in Scarface), so I'll explain it to you.  Both characters' hallmarks are freely and openly admitting to being the bad guy - that would have been obvious in the quotes if you hadn't distracted yourself with trying to read an imagined subtext.  As it is, Razor Ramon (aka Scott Hall) has been run out of wrestling for a drinking problem and Tony Montana was ultimately gunned down, so the conclusion to their, ahem, "tough and cool" images certainly puts paid to any emulation of them on my part.<br><br>*sigh again*  Translated: the "I'm the bad guy" part is the key point of my using the two examples, not being tough and cool.<br><br>Second, I've raised the issue about happiness and how it pertains to the original post.  So far, only Schrodinger's Cat has had the decency to attempt addressing that point.  I raised it, you avoided it, and <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>I'm </strong></span>the one working under pretences?  Take a reality check, Kettle.<br><br>Third, whatever hallucinogenic substance makes you think that I would be swayed by what everybody else is saying?  As fymk has observed, I'll speak my peace and bugger the political correctness, thank you very much.  Also, if the physician is to heal himself, best that he not do it with Marie-Claire-article notions of "ego tripping". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>By the way, according to real psychology, that little "pretence about the topic" stunt you tried pulling is called projection within Anna Freud's framework of ego defence mechanisms.  Just thought you might want to try some real knowlewdge sometime instead of rotting your brains with trashy magazine quizzes.<br><br>Now I'm not going back off, and I'll be forthright in telling you why.  The passive-aggressive hit-and-run tactics employed by thinkdifferent in her post at the top of this page are cowardly to the point of being offensive - "I'll say you're arrogant, blah blah blah - let's be friends".  Why should I wish to resolve this with someone who chooses to make attacks under an entreaty of peace?  If you've got a problem, spit it out - don't try the saccharine-sweet cyanide approach because it's despicable.  In fact, I'll lead by example - I choose to be on the offensive here, and I'll be blunt about it and pronounce myself the bad guy.  At least I can live with my honesty.  Am I aggressive?  Yes.  Am I offensive?  I prepared to acknowledge that.  Am I a bully as she claims?  Get real - she's giving it as good as she's getting, and you've been fooled by her underhanded approach.<br><br>Just in case, I'll say it again: the problem with the first post is that it uses a childish, surface-level definition of happiness, and therefore does not do justice to the ex-boyfriend's wish for the girl's future happiness.  In fact, I propose that the ex saw the long term view and did them both a favour by cutting both their losses.  I object to his being misrepresented.  I eagerly await to see what excuses you'll come up with to sidestep this key issue.</div>
