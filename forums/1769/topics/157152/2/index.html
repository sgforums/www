            <div class='col-md body'>What i think of SAF regulars:<br><br>Its a job. The SAF offers something other jobs can't. For one thing, you are really shielded from 'real' life. It is difficult to starve in the SAF, accom is more or less guaranteed, and, at the end of the day, its not really a difficult job. Now, to say that it is not a diffcult job does not mean that its an easy life; it is not. However, it is something that almost anyone can do because the SAF is really, within reason, quite forgiving towards its members. The pay's not bad at all as well.<br><br>However, i think that a career in the SAF is, at the end of the day, an acceptance of mediocrity. I think this applies especially to Specialists. There really isn't anything wrong with mediocrity. A large majority of people have no more than mediocre careers as some kind of office 'executive', or as a 'supervisor' of some sort. But, this applies more to the SAF than elsewhere because, unlike in civvie street where there are clients to win over, presentations to make, networking to do, profit margins to watch, and projects to complete, the aren't really that many ways to shine in the SAF. For the most part, you drift through each post barely even making a ripple in the status quo. You get promoted if you wait long enough (and if you dun fcuk up too badly of course).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kAdEn:</div><div class="quote_body">see what i mean? It is ppl's perception to the army that's degrading the job itself. Not everyone in the army behaves the same way....No wonder ppl always comment that army personnel are a bunch of lazy bummers. Only lazy, people with no ambition, not educated and what have you sign on with the army. I'm not going to try to deny any of the above, in fact, i agree and testify, to a certain extent, the truth that can be found in that statement cause there are bound to be black sheeps in every occupation, i.e. Bishops with sex scandals, Presidents' and prime ministers with sex scandals, infidelity among royalties, Major crimes, rapes and drug abuse, committed by sports/superstars who are idolised by millions. I think i've made my point.<br><br>You could argue that these are isolated cases, but why can't you do the same for people who carve out a career in the army? People who literally bleed and sweat to earn their pay, how many jobs out there can say the same thing? (no offence to the coustruction/building industry or foreign labours and any other whom i missed out) Though i won't be able to say that the majority of the army personnels are there because of patriotism or honour, but at least 20% of them fall into that category, the rest are just there to earn their keep. But i'm quite positively sure that in times of needs, most, if not ALL of them will be there to do their job, look at who went for up to Timor and Iraq. That's called professionalism. And that's what some of the guys in the job have. They deserve more respect than they are getting....</div></blockquote>True, there are black sheeps everywhere. but we're not even talking about the black sheeps in the army. we're talking about the nature of the job. your future has been streamlined into specs and officers, and farther into degree holders and diplomas, and even more so into scholars and non scholars, and then pay grade, etc etc...<br><br>There is absolutely no need to work hard in the army, since promotion is almost a given according to your entry qualifications. hence giving rise to the 'lazy bummers' perception. True, they may not be lazy bummers, but there isn't a perceived need for them to work hard now, is there?<br><br>In any case, the 'patriotism' or 'honor' that you speak of, i'm almost positive that in times of war *any* 1/2 decent singaporean would rise up to the challenge. being a regular dosen't afford him any more chance to skive or awol then any other normal singaporean. and no, going to timor and iraq is most certainly not an indication of their love for singapore. it's for the money. i mean, that's so duh.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since the formation of CRF, the role of the Commandos has expanded to the point where some of the work they're doing is fairly similar to that of SOF.  I'd say that the NS Commandos are not like we used to be, but then again, the guys from the early batches would probably say the same thing about my lot.  Commando regulars, on the other hand, do maintain higher standards than the NS men out of pride if nothing else, and some of the guys who could quite easily fit into SOF simply choose to stay in the battalion because they prefer their role there.  My former platoon sargeant was often asked by the SOF guys why he didn't move over, and he always replied that stayed where he was because he liked working with the men in the battalion.</div>

I think this applies especially to Specialists. There really isn't anything wrong with mediocrity. A large majority of people have no more than mediocre careers as some kind of office 'executive', or as a 'supervisor' of some sort. But, this applies more to the SAF than elsewhere because, unlike in civvie street where there are clients to win over, presentations to make, networking to do, profit margins to watch, and projects to complete, the aren't really that many ways to shine in the SAF. For the most part, you drift through each post barely even making a ripple in the status quo. You get promoted if you wait long enough (and if you dun fcuk up too badly of course).<br><br></div></blockquote>i dont think what the specialists do is mediocre.<br><br>but before the argument starts, i must say that this is, after all, a matter of personal opinion.<br><br>this mentality that these and some other jobs are mediocre, and there is a need to "accept" mediocrity - it just gives me a sense of either the person not being very onward looking, or that the person is being labelled and looked down upon.<br><br>really, why should we consider an executive or supervisor or a specialist in the SAF mediocre?<br><br>so being able to do win clients, make presentations, network, watch profit margins, complete projects - that is what a non-mediocre job should consist?<br><br>what about nursing, doctoring, counselling, teaching, policing, fire-fighting, etc etc. so those are mediocre as well? i suppose then construction work, toilet cleaning, road-sweeping, etc are mediocre then?<br><br>if a person thinks what he/she is doing is indeed mediocre and he/she chooses to accept it, then it is quite sad. other than that, i don't think we should make such comments as to label jobs (and hence connote the persons in the job) as mediocre.<br></div>
