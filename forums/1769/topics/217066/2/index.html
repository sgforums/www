Raising kids alone is hard enough, and much harder when you have to pay for two on the income of one.<br><br>Tax that singles pay will ultimately be returned when they do get married and receive a subsidy. Further, while they remain single - rather than not seek out a soulmate (hey no free lunch in the world, especially not one delivered right to your door), they could make use of SDU services (which is again funded by the taxes they pay). If the choice to remain single is because he/she enjoys the freedom blah blah blah, then again, no reason why govt should subsidize when, let me stress, that person would have less to pay than most.<br><br>Single parents pay for their taxes, but they have the additional burden of dependents. Singles on the other hand .. I don't see how you can possibly consciously say "singles have it harder" - like HOW !? distinguish between single parents with a one income, two mouths to feed + all the misc. expenses of having a kid blah blah blah.<br><br>I recognise that singles have liabilities (study debt etc) as well, but that pales in comparison to most single parents/snr citizens etc. - they have the same as you do (in different forms) plus the additional liabilities that you will never have.<br><br>Alot of examples quoted by the other forumers go to the extremes of Singapore (e.g. falling out with parents). Which is why I acknowledge there must be some discretion in granting relief. But the general consensus should, and should always be, that singles do not DESERVE as much relief as single parents or others more needy.<br><br>I believe you'll be hard pressed to find reasons why singles deserve a housing subsidy more than parents/families/senior citizens.<br><br>On a final note, as you said, "If you cannot survive or barely survive on your means, why should the governement use your money to give to others who can survive" - two things:<br><br>1) The govt is not giving money to those who can survive - I don't know how you ever came to the conclusion that single parents/snr citizens are more adapt at "surviving" than you, as a young single.<br><br>2) If you can barely survive on your income right now, do not live beyond your means and want to move out. You will go bankrupt.</div>

Raising kids alone is hard enough, and much harder when you have to pay for two on the income of one.<br><br>Tax that singles pay will ultimately be returned when they do get married and receive a subsidy. Further, while they remain single - rather than not seek out a soulmate (hey no free lunch in the world, especially not one delivered right to your door), they could make use of SDU services (which is again funded by the taxes they pay). If the choice to remain single is because he/she enjoys the freedom blah blah blah, then again, no reason why govt should subsidize when, let me stress, that person would have less to pay than most.<br><br>Single parents pay for their taxes, but they have the additional burden of dependents. Singles on the other hand .. I don't see how you can possibly consciously say "singles have it harder" - like HOW !? distinguish between single parents with a one income, two mouths to feed + all the misc. expenses of having a kid blah blah blah.<br><br>I recognise that singles have liabilities (study debt etc) as well, but that pales in comparison to most single parents/snr citizens etc. - they have the same as you do (in different forms) plus the additional liabilities that you will never have.<br><br>Alot of examples quoted by the other forumers go to the extremes of Singapore (e.g. falling out with parents). Which is why I acknowledge there must be some discretion in granting relief. But the general consensus should, and should always be, that singles do not DESERVE as much relief as single parents or others more needy.<br><br>I believe you'll be hard pressed to find reasons why singles deserve a housing subsidy more than parents/families/senior citizens.<br><br>On a final note, as you said, "If you cannot survive or barely survive on your means, why should the governement use your money to give to others who can survive" - two things:<br><br>1) The govt is not giving money to those who can survive - I don't know how you ever came to the conclusion that single parents/snr citizens are more adapt at "surviving" than you, as a young single.<br><br>2) If you can barely survive on your income right now, do not live beyond your means and want to move out. You will go bankrupt. </div></blockquote>i've got nothing against the single mothers though why you never included single fathers might be a problem.<br><br>your slant is all wrong i never argued that the single parents senior citizen do not deserve it. i'm just arguing that the single deserve it too.<br><br>your taxes paiid will be returned is just nonsense.  if thats the case its a matter of holding the money ransom and i wouldn't find that to be a good idea too. you really think singles can find soulmates easily and surely thru sdu etc? i would beg to differ; so what about those who can't find one?<br><br>i said singles have it even harder paying for a house than couples/married pple. if anythign else the couple has an option of an additional income on the same house( note that the requirement is marraige not pple with liabilities or dependents)<br><br>you want reasons why singles may need the houses more? lets see, what about singles will use the houses longer than the elderly so it may be more beneficial to give it to them? or maybe because the as stated earlier the couple/family is more able to fund house buying due to a double income which means more extra money can be pooled? there are definitely reasons to be had.<br><br>similarly if the family can barely survive then don't get a house??</div>
