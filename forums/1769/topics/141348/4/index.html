            <div class='col-md body'>OK, visited <a href="http://www.dove.com/real_beauty/news_library.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.dove.com/real_beauty/news_library.asp</a> and here's the driving force behind their recent ads :<br><br>"What is real beauty?  Join the debate...<br><br>"A new definition of beauty is needed.  One that's not defined by unrealistic media images.  Let's widen the definition of beauty and inspire women to celebrate themselves.  ... ...<br><br>"Our mission : To make women feel beautiful everyday by widening today's stereotypical view of beauty and inspiring women to take great care of themselves.<br><br>Apparently, when Unilever first published the ad with six women of various ages, sizes, and race in the UK, there was some sort of 'media furor' and it even 'sparked a debate on society's narrow definition of beauty, particularly concerning everyday women with real bodies'.<br><br>Dove even commissioned a global study, 'The Real Truth About Beauty : A Global Report' where Unilever partnered with research firm, Strategy/One in collaboration with Dr Nancy Etkoff and the Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Program in Aesthetics and Well Being and Dr Susie Orbach of the London School of Economics.  The study participants were some 3,200 women from 10 countries.<br><br>"The study's most startling find, according to Dove, is that <span style="color: red;">only 2% of the women surveyed consider themselves beautiful, and only 9% feel comfortable describing themselves as attractive.</span>  Some 49% responded that women who are more beautiful have greater opportunities in life.  And, while they allege the media consistently bombards society with images of idealised women, the majority of respondents strongly agree beauty can be achieved through attitude and spirit.  What's more, 85% said every woman has something beautiful about her.<br><br>Now, that's food for thought, and fodder for discussion!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wanna pose a thought-provoking question to all of you here...<br><br>What if one day, you, or a female friend, discovered that one of you have been struck with a condition that made it necessary to go on hormonal therapy and medication, which means that essentially, you'll start to bloat up and gain weight very fast and it might be irreversible?<br><br>Almost overnight, you'd go from 'slim' to 'fat and bloated'.  What happens to your self-esteem then?  Does that make you ugly overnight since you no longer fit into the 'beautiful size', as defined by society?<br><br>There are women out there who suffer from this.  I come across them in my work.  Often, their ego gets torn to shreds and they end up depressed because they are no longer 'beautiful'.  There have been marriages that have ended up in a divorce because the husbands couldn't stand the sight of their 'fat and ugly' wives.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Shocking, but it happens...<br><br>Whilst I wish good health on everyone, I'd like to give a 'wake-up call' of sorts that beauty isn't everything and it gets dangerous when all a guy cares about in a lady is whether she's 'chio' or not, which is what you hear a lot of here in the forums.  I say, it's time to remove the myopic haze and start gazing upon what's really important and valuable.  Not gonna be easy to reprogram a concept or notion that's been held fast for donkey years but, we can start right here, right now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

They obviously have no qualms about showing off who they really are - that's healthy self esteem indeed.<br><br>I am a Christian who believes that our Creator made us in His own image - and to say that a lady (or man) cannot make it is like insulting His creation.  Like saying that even what God made isn't good enough for us.  I mean, if you were a parent &amp; someone comes up to you &amp; says your daughter/son cannot make it cos he's too fat/ugly etc etc, how would you feel? Insulted, right?

If men want women who look perfect all the time it not only puts tremendous pressure on women (some might go for liposuction &amp; all that jazz), but, more importantly, what kind of values are we implanting in our kids? The kids may grow up to have low self-esteem, that everything will be perfect with plastic surgery.

If they hear their parents constantly criticise fat folks, they'll quickly pick up that fat folks are 'lesser humans', and if they want to be loved, they cannot be fat because fat folks get no love.<br><br>That is dangerous because unless you eat a stringent diet and exercise regularly, it's easy to tip over your weight range as you grow older and your metabolism slows down.  Then, what?<br><br>Worse, the child grows up with a morbid fear of becoming fat and unloved that he/she develops eating disorders.  In the US, it's affecting young girls as young as nine!!  Can you imagine a sweet and innocent 9-year old refusing to eat because she's mortified that once she becomes 'fat', she'll be unloved and unpopular??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  I mean, at nine years of age, the little girl shouldn't even be thinking about this!  Unless, she has been hearing her mom and / or dad harp on and on and on about being fat, or heard her classmates do so because of their own parents and the glamourisation of the Hollywood lifestyle on TV.  Sadly, once you develop an eating disorder at such a tender age, welcome to your future legacy of health problems!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   At that age, the body NEEDS nutrients to grow healthily!<br><br>There's no need for us to judge people so harshly based on their appearances.  Basically, fat or skinny, we are all still people.  Just because you're fat, does not mean you have less of a right to live or enjoy yourself.<br><br>If we discriminate against the fat and the ugly, I shudder to think what we'll think about the disabled, the injured, the crippled, the sick, and the elderly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
