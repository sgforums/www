              <p>Hi there Im back , Back again as a dream buster.</p>
              <p>Tourism Queensland has admitted it "messed up" by not making it
              clear a video of a woman tattooing the Great Barrier Reef on her arm
              was an example and not an entry in a $150,000-a-year job contest.</p>
              <p>Thousands of desperate job seekers have entered an internet
              competition to provide a 60-second video to become Hamilton Island's
              new caretaker, which has a salary of $150,000.</p>
              <p>Among the videos entered was that of a woman visiting a tattoo
              parlour to have a 10cm tattoo spruiking her love for the Great Barrier
              Reef on her arm.</p>
              <p>But the video in fact featured Rhiannon Craig, a digital project
              manager at the Cummins Nitro agency in Brisbane, which created the job
              campaign, and the tattoo was a transfer.</p>
              <p>Nowhere on the site did it say the video was created for Tourism
              Queensland as an example and media outlets across the world reported
              the entry as legitimate.</p>
              <p>The oversight has drawn criticism from Queensland Treasurer Andrew
              Fraser who said it would be inappropriate for Tourism Queensland to
              plant a bogus entry.</p>
              <p>"Obviously what we've got is an exercise in them getting a lot of
              attention, that's certainly been achieved worldwide, but ... I would
              have a dim view of that (posting a fake video)," he told reporters.</p>
              <p>Tourism Queensland chief executive officer Anthony Hayes apologised for the mistake.</p>
              <p>"The simple answer is that we messed up," Mr Hayes told AAP on Monday.</p>
              <p>"We did two example videos of what an application could look like
              but we didn't put the words example or sample on those videos and as a
              result we have caused some confusion.</p>
              <p>"They were really there for people to have a look to see what creativity they could use."</p>
              <p>Both examples have been removed from the site.</p>
              <p>Mr Hayes said the response continued to be overwhelming with 6,600 video blogs from people across the globe on the site.</p>
              <p>An announcement on the island job will be made on May 6 with the contract beginning on July 1.</p>
