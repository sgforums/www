            <div class='col-md body'>actually, i wonder about escalators...<br><br>at where i work there are HUGE lifts... signs everywhere (including luminous signs) with pictures telling people to use the lifts if they are carrying luggage or are elderly...<br><br>so 2 nights ago, there's this elderly lady (with her whole sewing circle), lugging an unreasonable amount of luggage, fell at the escalators... and get this: she was just discharged from the hospital after a BYPASS!!<br><br>so, to test out the new bypass, her silly friends decide to TAKE A PUBLIC BUS with LOADS of luggage and rushing about, lugging the whole lot of luggage up the escalator!!<br><br>she fell and almost had a bloody heart attack and had to sit in my office for about half an hour!<br><br>and guess what? she and her friends refused our offer of calling an ambulance.. and worse, they actually went ahead with their trip!!<br><br>points:<br><br>1. if you are loaded with stuff or are elderly, and there are lifts around, USE THEM!<br><br>2. fricken get well and don't let a trip cost you your life<br><br>3. don't be stupid to travel using a mode you cannot physically handle (especially after a BYPASS!)<br><br>4. sewing circles are dumb.. don't listen to them...</div>
