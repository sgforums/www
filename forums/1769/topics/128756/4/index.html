            <div class='col-md body'>One 'new' trend I've noticed... patients or their family members who pick at nitty-gritty stuff, find fault, and list down multiple complaints about anything and everything so that bottom-line, they achieve their goal, which is, to make the hospital waive their bills.<br><br>It is a nasty, ugly trick.<br><br>There are exceptional cases where bills would be waived if it was a genuine wrongdoing by the organisation.  BUT, folks got wind of this and now, almost everyone we see is trying this trick.<br><br>You'll KNOW what they're up to because they come in very combative, very very rude, and they really find fault.  Then inevitably, they will use the, "I will complain!  I will refuse to pay!" declaration.<br><br>I've recently politely informed someone to please wait outside at the waiting area where he can be seated cause a procedure will take half an hour or more.  He crossed his arms, and shouted aggressively, 'I want to know that you nurses are doing your jobs!  I want to stand here and take note!  How would I know if you're doing your jobs right or not?!'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Yeah, right... as if you know enough to supervise us!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>My colleagues and I became nurses because we had noble intentions but yet, these days, we are being treated as if we're out to kill and murder and injure.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">   Our fellow Singaporeans not only treat us with contempt, they 'bully' us and step out of line, being unreasonable, demanding, uncooperative, wanting us to explain every single thing several times a day to anyone who turns up and that really eats into our time.<br><br>I've once stood by a patient's side for more than 6.5 hours at a stretch, and two other colleagues about 5 hours or so... and the remaining two outside at the counter had to take care of everything else, and ALL of us didn't have a single minute of break that day... and when we came out, the relatives glared at us like they wanted to kill us with their stares and exclaimed with anger, 'Why take so long!!  We want to see our mothers!!  What are you hiding?  Taking so long behind closed curtains!'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Not a single word of thanks.  At the 6th hour, I felt slightly giddy and faint cause of the gear I was wearing.  I was sweating like a steamed chicken and my blood sugar level was low cause the last meal I had was like 8 hours ago... and instead of a simple, 'Thank you for taking care of my mom!', it was that!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>What does senior management do?  Instead of putting them in their places, they kow-tow to them.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">   Does no one teach good graces and proper behaviour anymore??!!!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>We may be educated... but we're becoming a nation of educated barbarians.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
