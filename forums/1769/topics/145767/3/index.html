Sometimes it takes a couple of unsuccessful r/s with the frogs/toads (or scum of the earth   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  ) for us to recognise the 'prince' in our midst. Some of my gf and I finally met our significant other in our late-20s or 30s - so don't fret yet.

I can understand if they feel very hurt after a break-up, provided they were indeed in a real deep relationship.
