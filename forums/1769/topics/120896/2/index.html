There's really no way to know if you will be happy living with another person in the future, you just have to follow your heart and take that leap of faith.<br><br>Of course, before taking that leap of faith, you have to be already happy with your partner under the current situation. In this case, these people are already unhappy before marriage, so what more after marriage?<br><br>I think part of the reason why such a relatively high proportion of Singaporeans are unahppy with their future partners is that they compromise too much. They marry for the sake of getting marriage, for reasons like <span style="font-style: italic;">marriage is the next logical thing to do after a long relationship</span>, or because <span style="font-style: italic;">we're not getting younger</span>, etc...<br><br>Lastly, where did you get your figure of 83% from?

You think you are buying cars huh? test driving before buying. Do you know that cohabitation usually contribute to unwanted babies and unplanned marriage due of pregnancy?<br><br>You have said it right, it is only a sneak preview. And sneak preview only show you the best part of the movie!!<br><br>Everybody will have their own version of marriage life, and I think it is not that important to talk to everybody about it because every relationship is unique and they all comes with different challenges.
