            <div class='col-md body'>Got this in a mass email. Think it's pretty interesting. Though I can't help wondering, "what's the cleaning lady? a saint? an alien?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>-----Original Message-----<br><br>It looks like we will be getting a casino in Singapore. Just to share the following story I just read in one of Bernie Siegel's book of four men who won millions of dollars:<br><br>"The men went to a Las Vegas casino together and made a pact to share equally all their winnings or losses. The first night, one of the men hit the jackpot. He won millions and brought the money up to the room so they could all sit around and have fun looking at it. After a while, they became hungry. Two of them went out to eat and bring back food for the other two who stayed to watch over the money.<br><br>The two guarding the money got to talking about how long their new found fortune would last. They calculated how much longer it would last if they didn't divide it four ways, and decided to kill the other two when they returned. Meanwhile, the two who went out to get dinner were doing some calculating themselves, and also decided it would be a shame to split the money four ways. So they poisoned the dinners they were bringing back for the other two.<br><br>When the two men returned with food, the ones guarding the money let them in and lured them into the bedroom, where they shot and killed them. While they waited for nightfall to dispose of the bodies, they recounted the money and started dividing it up. Since they were hungry, as they finished counting the money, they ate the dinners the dead men had brought back. The next morning the housekeeper found four dead men and their money. Before she called the authorities she flushed the money down the toilet so it wouldn't cause any more grief."<br><br>Bernie made the point that wealth by itself is not a problem, but if you have great wealth your feelings about it can cause you great problems. Knowing what people can be like, the cleaning woman was wise to get rid of the money.<br><br>Indeed, we will do well to always remember that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting... well, we will know the outcome at 3pm...<br><br>Anyway, it's not about whether Singapore will have a casino... It's more about how many casinos!<br><br>1 or 2, that's the question...<br><br>The stock market has already fully factored in having 1 casino and partially factored in 2 casinos.
