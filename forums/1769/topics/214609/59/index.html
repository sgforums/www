            <div class='col-md body'>What I find most commendable is this article I read in The NewPaper today about this disabled man who is earning like $500 or $700 a month.<br><br>When asked why didn't he apply for social welfare, his reply was why depend on others when he can still support himself to make a living. He also took ever chance he has to look for a job and if he canÂ’t, then he approached the government for help to look for a job.<br><br>He really puts those lazy youngsters who canÂ’t be bothered to look for a job to shame. Here is a guy with 1 hand who works hard to support himself. He knows that he can never get a high paying job but he doesnÂ’t bitch about it but is happy that he can support himself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>copied from mr brown's blog  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  :<br><br>Not our bus never stop for you, you never flag the bus early<br>Saw this in the news, "SBS Transit launches 'Flag the Bus Early' campaign"<br><br>SINGAPORE : The SBS Transit has placed signs at 100 selected bus stops across Singapore, encouraging passengers to flag the bus early.<br>This will help bus captains stop at a timely manner and to ensure a smoother and safer ride for those onboard.<br><br>The operator has launched the public education campaign after receiving complaints that bus captains drove off from bus stops without picking up passengers.<br><br>Its subsequent investigations found that many commuters missed the bus because they often flagged too late.<br><br>Commuters can also pick up brochures on safe bus stop practices at 16 bus interchanges. - CNA /ls<br><br>So people, it is YOUR fault, ok?<br><br>Some forummers from Hardwarezone felt that instead of a "Flag the Bus Early" campaign, there should be campaigns for bus companies like:<br><br>"Slow Down the Damn Bus When Approaching Bus Stop" campaign<br>"Do Not Overtake a Fellow Bus When Approaching Bus Stop" campaign<br>"Buses Come More Regularly and at Shorter Intervals" campaign<br>"Buses should brake properly" campaign<br>"Cut down Bus Hikes" campaign<br><br>and of course, this gem:<br>"Stop Wasting Money on Useless Campaigns" campaign<br><br>Feel free to suggest some more campaigns. In Singapore, we can never have too many campaigns.<br><br></div>
