Describe your Dream Kitchen!  Come on, no holds barred!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">ANSWER : Bright, preferably with Cherry Wood and Black Laquer counter tops.

A very efficient exhaust unit.  A separate small fridge for drinks, a stainless steel large one for storing everything else, and maybe an extra separate freezer.

Which is your preferred method of cooking?  Eg. Stir-frying / Baking / Grilling / Frying / Poaching, etc etc.  Why?<br><br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">ANSWER : Stir-Frying.  Baking as well, cause it keeps all the grease spatters confined within a space so less cleaning up to do!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></strong><br><br>8.

Otherwise, I like to try new recipes or modify old ones.  I love to read cookbooks and cooking mags!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   Got a sizeable collection of recipes too!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Someday, I want to categorise and organise them all!  </span></strong><br><br>9.

I've had to do that most of the time in Melbourne, cause I like to buy the freshest vegetables / fish at the market, then decide there and then what to cook, or come home and mull over it a little after looking at what else I've got in my fridge and larder shelves.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></strong><br><br>10.

There are many of us who do the same each Thanksgiving and Christmas. For those who have duty on holidays, the hubster will take them a home cooked meal. During the festive season, I bake cookies for the hubby to take to single sailors or geographical bachelors. Again, it's the least I can do besides, the hubster was a lonely single sailor one. We're just paying it forward.</div>
