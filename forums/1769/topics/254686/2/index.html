What brands do you have there? Generally speaking, all dishwashers do a good job. Some just do it better. If you have a small house, you'll appreciate one that's quiet with a low dbA. Bosch has a model that's the lowest at 45 dbA. It's so quiet they had to put an infolight feature that shines a red dot of light on your floor so you know it's running.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> The higher in price you go, the quieter the dishwasher it, the more features you get.</div>

Being a super high end brand means it's expensive which means parts are expensive which means service is too. Since production quantities are small, repairs are costly too.

Plodding along.<br><br>Brey, if you want a good machine, pick one with a stainless interior. This tends to resist stains, is more durable than plastic and holds high temps better.<br><br>Get one that's at least 54 dbA or lower. 50dbA is the sound of a light conversation. I have a 56 dbA machine in my small house and it's quiet.<br><br>Dishwashers today are energy saving, saving you about $25 to $60 a year, depending on the model you choose and the washing options you select.<br><br>If you don't run the machine everyday, get one with a rinse only cycle. This allows you to rinse and hold until you're ready for a full load.<br><br>If you tend to pre-rinse your dishes before loading, get one with a Fash Wash feature. This is a 30 minute cycle.<br><br>Dishwashers today have a sensor to detect the soil and load levels. This takes the guesswork out of button pushing for you. Some even have rotating jets that target a specific spot in the lower rack if you have extra dirty dishes. The jets shoot water at a high pressure to do this.<br><br>Adjustable top racks are great. This allows you to maximize your loading options so that you can wash 10 inch dishes on the top rack, or fill the bottom rack with taller items.<br><br>Dimensions are also important. Most US models measure 24" W by 24" D by 34" H. Get one with pretty standard measurements. When it comes time to upgrade, replacing will be a breeze.</div>

Gourmet cooks will only cook on gas stoves. Dual fuel will be the way to go because you get the best of both worlds. You get better baking results in an electric oven because unlike gas, the heat is consistent and true to temperature. On the cooktop, look for dishwasher safe continuous grates. This makes it easy to clean and you can slide heavy pots from burner to burner. Make sure you look for sealed burners so cleaning will be easy. Also look for a recessed cooktop so that spills can be contained and easily wiped up. Look for a good cross section of BTUs too. You'll need a one that's low for simmering about 5000 BTUs, a couple of 9500 BTUs and a power burner of about 1600BTUs which is great for boiling water, deep frying, etc.<br><br>In the oven, look for porcelain coated racks so that you can leave them in when you run the self clean feature. Convection ovens come with 3 racks because you can bake 3 racks of cookies at one time, saving you time, effort, energy and money. Some higher end models have a built in probe so you won't have to open the oven door and stick your hand into the hot oven to check the temperature of your baked goods. The convention feature allows you to say, cook a turkey an hour sooner than in a regular oven.<br><br>Some come with a warming drawer which is great for proofing bread, keeping dishes warm or just keeping food warm.</div>
