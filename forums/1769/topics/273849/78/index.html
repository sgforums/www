            <div class='col-md body'>This piece of news disturbs me... because i was told to wait 4 months for the doctor to see me because of my slipped disc..  they were overworked to hell... so, public hospitals are seeing foreign patients while being hopelessly inadequate to handle local volume?<br><br><strong>ST Â– 20 Aug 2007, pH9</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Public hospitals seeing rising numbers of foreign patients</strong></span><br><br>Over 20% increase last year, even though patient fees are not subsidised<br><br>By Jessica Jaganathan<br><br>PUBLIC hospitals in Singapore are taking a bigger bite out of the growing medical tourism pie.<br><br>Last year, both clusters of public hospitals - the National Healthcare Group (NHG) and the SingHealth Group - treated more foreign patients than the year before.<br><br>NHG, which includes National University Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Alexandra Hospital, saw 52,769 foreign patients in 2005 and 65,125 last year. That is a 23 per cent jump.<br><br>The SingHealth cluster, including Changi General Hospital (CGH), KK Women's and Children's Hospital and Singapore General Hospital, which tracks only the number of 'patient visits' by foreigners, saw its numbers jump 25 per cent - from 80,000 in 2005 to 100,000 last year.<br><br>'Patient visits' count those seen more than once at outpatient clinics, in the wards and for day surgery.<br><br>Nationally, one in about five foreign in-patients now stays in public hospitals.<br><br>Dr Jason Yap, director of health-care services at the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), noted that private hospitals are still seeing the bulk of foreign patients, but public hospitals were matching them in clinical and customer service.<br><br>One foreigner who was satisfied with the treatment his wife received at CGH last month was Bangladeshi businessman Amanat Hussain Dewan, 42.<br><br>He chose CGH to get the lump in his wife's breast seen to after extensive research on both public and private hospitals here and in Thailand.<br><br>He said: 'To us, what is more important than price is that the infrastructure and treatment facilities should be good.'<br><br>To meet the needs of foreign patients like his wife, most hospitals here have set up a patient liaison centre, a one-stop concierge service that handles medical referrals, follow-up care, accommodation and travel arrangements for patients and accompanying relatives.<br><br>CGH, for instance, provides this service through its International Medical Services Centre.<br><br>Dr Wong Chiang Yin, the hospital's chief operating officer, said: 'When foreigners walk into a hospital, it can be a little forbidding, so we hope the new centre will meet their needs.'<br><br>Half the renovation bill for the $120,000 centre, which was officially opened this month, was borne by STB.<br><br>As the hospital is located near Changi Airport, it sees transit passengers needing medical attention, and this adds to its influx of foreign patients.<br><br>The hospital also actively recommends its services to potential foreign patients - through its network of 11 medical associates stationed in Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh and India.<br><br>But Dr Wong said that providing additional services like these was not an indication that the hospital was going all out to court foreign patients.<br><br>'It's not about making money,' he added.<br><br>Foreigners accounted for 1.6 per cent of CGH's annual turnover of $266 million last year - too small a proportion to hurt its primary focus on caring for Singaporeans, he explained.<br><br>Although foreigners receive the same level of health care as Singaporeans, the primary difference is in what they pay.<br><br>They stay in the non-subsidised A1 wards, and, in CGH, pay about 10 per cent above the usual rates for rooms there.<br><br>The Health Ministry said the increase in numbers of foreign patients puts Singapore on track to pulling in a million international patients by 2012.<br><br>STB's Dr Yap added: 'Singapore is a major destination for medical economy, as we do research, clinical trials and medical conferences, so public hospitals should have a share in that too.'<br><br>Hospitals, both private and public, saw 410,000 foreign patients last year, 15 per cent more than in 2005.<br><br>These patients come mainly from the region - Indonesia and Malaysia, with increasing numbers from China, the Middle East and developed countries.<br><br>Dr Yap added that Singapore needs to have patient volume in order to keep and maintain medical expertise and to afford technology.<br><br>'So, in essence, we are seeing more foreign patients in order to see local patients.'<br></div>
