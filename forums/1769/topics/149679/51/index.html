It's not connected to the skyway system, but it's only a short walk across the freeway to a building that is. Does Toronto also have a skyway system linking all of the buildings downtown?<br><br>I know what you mean about the widely varying workload. Some days, I'll come into the office and have <strong>absolutely</strong> nothing to do. I just end up surfing the 'net all day. On other days, I'll be inundated with work up to my neck, and barely keep up. That's the nature of programming work--when everything is working fine, it's plain sailing. When a system goes down, the users are screaming for the blood of the programmers, and we're scrambling to have fixes put in place.<br><br>Me? Drive somewhere over the LD weekend?
