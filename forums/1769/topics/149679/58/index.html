Cool down, okay?<br><br>Well, actually both of you have really your side of the story.  I mean he has is point of being upset of your no-show or was it late-showing?  You can't blame him, right?  I mean, put yourself in that shoes?  Would you be upset if someone did exactly the same thing to you?  Well, in a way, it was lack of responsibility on your part in not keeping the appointment.<br><br>Having said that, everyone makes mistakes, however, minor or major.  So, given, you have made one but that doesn't give him the right to curse.  To me, a really good friend embrace the negative part of me too.  I am no angel.  Of course, I will carry some traits that are not acceptable or comfortable with my friends.  So, if they can accept me that I meant no harm when behaving that way, I really do appreciate it.  Like wise, I will do the same in accepting them as they are.<br><br>Let your friend cool down.  Don't worry.  Whatever you both communicated during anger......are all rubbish.  What we say, anger words.  Cannot be taken seriously one.   So, don't get work up.<br><br>First of all, do you agree you are initially at fault?  If you can accept or agree, it will be easier for you to accept his outburst, although, still I don't think he should have cursed.  Now that he is angry, nothing will get into his head.  Let him cool down and you too.  And when peace is in the air, talk to him nicely that you didn't like what he did and that you felt hurt about it.  If he is a friend, he will not do this to you (again).  Because you have told him, how you felt.  Don't let him assume.<br><br>As well, you must apologize to him too.  Any time, there is a conflict, there is no one winner or loser.  Both have done something, either small or big to have cause a conflict.  Just that both have to come to terms and be open about it.</div>

Not worth it to be upset lah.  How people behave or talk, we can't control but we can control our own behaviour or emotions.

Cool down, okay?<br><br>Well, actually both of you have really your side of the story.  I mean he has is point of being upset of your no-show or was it late-showing?  You can't blame him, right?  I mean, put yourself in that shoes?  Would you be upset if someone did exactly the same thing to you?  Well, in a way, it was lack of responsibility on your part in not keeping the appointment.<br><br>Having said that, everyone makes mistakes, however, minor or major.  So, given, you have made one but that doesn't give him the right to curse.  To me, a really good friend embrace the negative part of me too.  I am no angel.  Of course, I will carry some traits that are not acceptable or comfortable with my friends.  So, if they can accept me that I meant no harm when behaving that way, I really do appreciate it.  Like wise, I will do the same in accepting them as they are.<br><br>Let your friend cool down.  Don't worry.  Whatever you both communicated during anger......are all rubbish.  What we say, anger words.  Cannot be taken seriously one.   So, don't get work up.<br><br>First of all, do you agree you are initially at fault?  If you can accept or agree, it will be easier for you to accept his outburst, although, still I don't think he should have cursed.  Now that he is angry, nothing will get into his head.  Let him cool down and you too.  And when peace is in the air, talk to him nicely that you didn't like what he did and that you felt hurt about it.  If he is a friend, he will not do this to you (again).  Because you have told him, how you felt.  Don't let him assume.<br><br>As well, you must apologize to him too.  Any time, there is a conflict, there is no one winner or loser.  Both have done something, either small or big to have cause a conflict.  Just that both have to come to terms and be open about it. </div></blockquote>Let me say this,whatever i said was from my mind and not my heart,i do know how to control my anger as i have a somewhat high tolerance level for it,i even apologized,but the fact is that he cursed me,and thats what made me pissed.He probaly thought nothing of it as i'm a usually happy go lucky person who is pretty used to getting sweared at..So yea,none of my words can be considered as "angry words" as i didn't lose control of myself..But anyway goodnight.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
