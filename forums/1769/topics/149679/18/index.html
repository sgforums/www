The teachers on hand didn't know what to do,they waited awhile before calling the ambulance and was pronounced dead soon after..We only knew about it when we tried calling his hp wanting to tell him about training the very next day only to be told the news by his bro.During the wake funeral,the people from SP could be seen laughing as though nothing happened..Well infuriating as it sounds,no matter how much anger was burning in us,we can't do anything as we knew the peaceloving guy that is he would never condone it..Soo in a way we are partly responsible..And bloody crap that whole day i seem to keep hearing the sone you'll be in my heart...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stellazio, I'm sorry that you lost a friend that way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I guess it's not healthy if you and your friends still hold yourselves responsible for his death, because you're not.  No matter what others say, you have to convince yourselves of this fact and stop blaming yourselves and move on.<br><br>The proper thing at that point in time, would be to administer CPR immediately. Sometimes, when the chest is hit with a sudden force, the electrical activity in the heart gets kinda 'short-circuited' and depending on the situation, it will either stop suddenly, or become irregular.  CPR MIGHT have helped.<br><br>The US is lobbying for malls and other public places to have portable defibrillators on hand.  They're also encouraging more people to be trained in basic CPR.<br><br>I wish there was a defibrillator on-hand and a CPR-trained person around then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Not sure what your friend really died of but in certain situations similar to this, a fibrillation shock might help to restart the electrical activity of the heart and helped save his life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
