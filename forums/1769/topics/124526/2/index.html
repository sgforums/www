            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">I guess if you delve into Psychology, you'll see that there are several life stages we go through as we progress in age.<br><br>In our 20's, we're concerned with completing our studies and/or establishing our career.  There's also the social scene which tends to be very active and vibrant at this stage.  The 20-yr olds might feel that the world is their oyster.  This is also the time when most would start to manage their finances and investments, and for others, they would be in relationships and might even be planning their marriage.<br><br>Once you proceed into your 30's, things start to change, little by little.  You may already be married and if so, you'd be concerned with paying off home loans, car loans, taking care of the needs of the family, and if you have children, a substantial amount of time and energy would be spent on nurturing them.  Most would be pretty stable in their careers now whilst for a small minority, they might be contemplating a career switch after being disillusioned in their current jobs.<br><br>If you're in your 30's and attached, you might be seriously evaluating your relationship(s).  Do you take it to the next level?  Is he / she 'the one' you can imagine travelling life's journey with, hand-in-hand, side-by-side?  You might be debating the singlehood vs marriage issue.  You'll also look into your financial state and setting aside your 'nest egg' for the future.<br><br>For those who are 30's and single, you might feel that the social scene can be very alive still but as more and more of your peers get married and have children, you'll see less and less of them.  Slowly, the number of friends you have whom you could call and spend time with at a moment's notice start deteriorating.  You'll now either ardently seek new friends or you'll start to feel loneliness creeping in.<br><br>It's not too bad if you have a group of friends who are in their 30's and still single too, like yourself.  Otherwise, things might start to get a little ... challenging.  You might yearn to be in a relationship yourself but you might be nursing a broken heart from previous broken relationships, or you could be jaded and cynical from the setbacks you've suffered so far.  It's easy to pay lip service and say stuff like pick yourself up and move on, don't look back, etc etc but the heart speaks a language different from the mind and sometimes, the heart weeps louder than the logical theories and rationalisations we spout.<br><br>I guess central in each of us is the desire to have companionship and to feel accepted and loved, even if we show the bad side of ourselves.  Let's leave relationships for a while here and look at friendships.  It gets harder and harder to make firm friends with people the older you get.  Time is a factor - you won't have as much time to spend at leisure as you did when you were in your teens, for instance.  Also, people tend to give you less time of day and become more and more impatient.<br><br>For instance, a little difference in opinions and you might find yourself ostracised from a group or left out of group outings and what-not.  Differences in opinions, temperaments, characters, etc just aren't tolerated well.<br><br>In the end, you just need to learn to be self-confident and to love your own company.  Never ever be needy.  People tend to run away from needy folks.<br><br>Heard of the book, 'Thick Face, Black Heart'?  Sad but that defines a lot of relationships we have as we grow older.<br><br>Sure, I yearn for companionship, to have someone to go out to bookstores with, to watch movies with, to have a cuppa with and just relax and talk about life with, to travel with, etc.  but I've also learnt to love my own company and will not wither and die if I have to watch movies alone, which I often do, or to travel alone, which I've done.  Life does not stop just because I'm alone.  Of course, we're social animals and good company is always preferred but in the absence of friends, enjoy solitude.<br><br>Lonely?  It's just a bitter pill I'll swallow just before downing a sweet, syrupy cold drink to make it better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div></blockquote>I think I have premature ageing.

I've never had much difficulties with being alone, until recently too, no idea why.  Maybe, the fact that most of my close buddies are now living overseas or are too busy with their own lives have got a lot to do with it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
