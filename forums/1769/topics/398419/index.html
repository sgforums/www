              <p>and if the women don't open their eyes and get overcome by their own lust, they're adults, they've made their choices, right or wrong, they gotta live with it...</p>
              <p>just like the men who go trawl the streets for streetwalkers get a case of herpes, or worse, HIV.. they made their choices, they gotta live or die with it...</p>

              <p>I dunno about that .......</p>
              <p>I mean, I thought at the very primal level, the physical characteristics for "attractiveness" cut across cultures ?</p>
              <p>look at that chap in the middle, some men can probably cup and span his entire waist with both hands, would women feel "protected" by someone like that ? ......</p>
              <p>actually, the stories I hear about these "cowboys", is that they all employ some sort of bomoh black magic ... that's why women would succumb and spread their legs and wallets for them so easily. Some of them would still look like a bum however you cut it, and I doubt the beggar look is in.</p>
