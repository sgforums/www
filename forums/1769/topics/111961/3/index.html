Are you going to say that 50 cent, Run DMC, James ingram are all jazz band or singer? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Btw, Jazz music has got it influence from African rhythm, so why dont you just  say that Gilberto is a African tribe singer?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And do you know the Bossa Nova music are all written with a straight four feel, while jazz are all in triplet swing feel?
