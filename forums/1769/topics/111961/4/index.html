            <div class='col-md body'>I absolutely agree.  Let's face it - the vast majority of people who enjoy jazz are listeners and not jazz musicians.  I don't reckon anyone's got any business shoving their strict definitions down anybody else's throat.  If they like to define and listen to jazz in a certain way, well and good, but why go spoiling anybody else's enjoyment of it?  It's not as if there's a discussion among hard core professional musicians going on here, so there's no need to get one's knickers in a twist.<br><br>Speaking of classical, Claude Debussy was derided by the classical community when he first borrowed jazz elements to use in his compositions.  These days Debussy's known as a classical composer.  So much for categorising.</div>

You are simply trying to make yourself feel better, what a loser. Next time when you go into a jazz club, please take a look at how the audience response to the music,. it is alway 2 and 4. Btw, it is not 2/4 from a 4/4. It is 2 and 4 within the 4/4. (the more you talking jazz, the more you are exposing your lack of understanding in the fundamental of the music. Just read your first post here...wah damn bloody impressive...monks milees contrane and bla bla bla...)<br><br>Havent your heard of the song by Duke Ellington "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)."<br><br>You must be one of those dude that listen to jazz because you think it makes you look cool and want to get into the scene....what a bloody broken nose loser!!<br><br>And btw, I have been asking your this simple question about brazilian jazz, dont you have the guts balls or nuts to tell the world about your knowledge in this area? Or are you chickening out because you dont even know what the F are you talking about. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Wannabe wannabe cool huh!!!
