A well-managed plan should offer a selection of investment options from which you can choose one or several that match your particular risk comfort level. Most of these plans allow you to transfer money between available funds to maximize your overall rate of return. It's a little like playing the stock market (which in effect you are) except that you can't legally liquidate the investments until you retire, and you don't pay any taxes on the capital gain.<br><br>Once you've selected the funds to include in your plan, try to maximize the amount of the contributions into the plan from your paycheck. In fact, try to have the maximum amount of pre-tax dollars allowed by law deducted from your paycheck and put into your 401K/403B plan. Yes, I know it takes discipline, and your particular financial situation might not allow you to take the maximum deduction. But consider this: debt levels amongst Americans are currently at an all-time high (currently estimated to be an average of around $9000 for [b]every</strong> household), and most will not have enough money to fund their retirement years. A little bit of financial discipline now will go a long ways to help make your retirement years less of a financial stress.<br><br>Just a thought.[/b]</blockquote>Thank you MG. For the longest time the military had no 401K until 5 or six years ago. I only wish we had started sooner because we're playing catch up now. I've since increase our monthly contribution since they removed the cap. You sound like a banking man, are you?<br><br>You're right. It's a well-known fact that Americans don't save. An article in yesterday's paper says for every $1 they earn, they spend $1.22.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

The investment scene has changed significantly in that period; for example, mutual fund managers have apparently learned from the IT stock crash of the late-90s and are moving away from the high-growth/high-risk, IT-heavy portfolios, and into more conservative money market-oriented funds geared towards lower but more stable returns.<br><br>A federal or state job isn't considered glamorous, but it does offer stability and reasonably good benefits.<br><br>With at least 18 years in the military, your hubby probably already qualifies for a pretty generous pension with full medical benefits, yes?</div>

Little by little, we're seeing our benefits eroding. They're revamping the health care system, the housing system and more. Full medical benefits for him until he kicks the bucket, co-pay for us after he retires.  While we were overseas, dental for the family was free. Not stateside.</div>
