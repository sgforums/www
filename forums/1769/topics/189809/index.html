Most of these plans allow you to transfer money between available funds to maximize your overall rate of return.

A little bit of financial discipline now will go a long ways to help make your retirement years less of a financial stress.<br><br>Just a thought.[/b]</blockquote>It's scary the way Americans spend, I tell you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I've got American friends living in humble circumstances and yet, when I went over to visit them, they constantly shock me with how fast they'll whip out their credit cards to pay for purchases that are really unnecessary.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And then, come Christmas, it's scary how freely they spend!  They even spend money that's not earned yet, chalking up huge debts!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   The gifts they purchase are expensive and whilst it's nice to want to give nice things to your loved ones, I don't believe in going for broke when doing so.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Frighteningly, it's considered 'normal' to be in debt before you graduate and start work over there.  I've heard of credit cards that college kids can apply for so they start chalking up the debts long before they can actually pay it off!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
