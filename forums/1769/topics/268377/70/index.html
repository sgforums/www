They know that this age group has a higher tendency to exercise less self-control on their spending.<br><br>And surely they know that in many cases the kids' parents would bail them out if they were at risk of defaulting their payments.<br><br>I say that if you want to teach them financial responsibility, then debit cards are good enough. Let them use their own savings instead of credit to buy things.<br><br>For goodness' sake.... I'm already 24, am one year away from graduation, and my debit card is good enough in the rare occasions when I need to make online purchases.
