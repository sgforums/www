            <div class='col-md body'>An Alternative View - Remembering the forgotten<br><br>By: Jason Evans, Staff Columnist<br><br>Imagine driving home one night when you're suddenly involved in an auto accident. Your injuries will prove fatal without proper medical treatment. Thankfully, EMT's arrive on the scene as you regain consciousness. They approach you, begin to administer treatment... but then suddenly stop! You're horrified as they back away.<br><br>A gathering crowd is pleading with them to "get to work," but instead the EMT's ridicule and taunt you. A supervisor finally arrives to find you crawling away from your harassers. The EMT's are at last ordered to "get to work or lose their jobs." But their efforts are reluctant, negligible, delayed. You later die in the Emergency Room as a result. All of this simply because the EMT's didn't like how you were dressed.<br><br>Is such a scenario absurd? Unfortunately not. It happened to Tyra Hunter in Washington D.C. on Aug. 7, 1995. Tyra was a pre-op transsexual female, and the EMT's, upon removing her clothing, found that she had a penis. They felt that gave them the right to refuse treating her, and so they harassed her even as she lay dying.<br><br>Dozens of scenarios like this occur annually in America. In August of 2001, Willie Houston was beaten to death after standing outside of a restroom waiting for his wife. His crime? He'd been holding his wife's purse when he decided to assist a blind gentleman into the men's room. On July 5, 1999, PFC Barry Winchell was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat by another soldier in his platoon. His crime? He was dating a transgender female. In January of 1999, Robert Eads died of cancer after 20 doctors refused to treat him. Why? He was a transgender male.</div>
