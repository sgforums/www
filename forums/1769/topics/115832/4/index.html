Metro section page 2.<br><br>We would like to say a BIG THANK YOU to Mr Sturt Michale (metro news reporter) who did a fablous job. Sturt thru an interview style delivers the MESSAGE on why all of us should take up running (exercise) and a healthy life style.<br><br>The photos were AWESOME and also a BIG THANK YOU to Joe the Star photographer.<br><br>Let me tell you gals and guys that being interviewed by the press is not an easy task. Believe it or not the photo shoot was very professional. We had to do lots of poses ranging from <span style="color: red;">stretching, running and other sexy pot-belly pose</span> to get the right shot. Next came the interview session which took 2 hours because Sturt had to ask interactive questions to 7 penguins so that he could filther out the BEST stories.<br><br>After the interview, we debated that some HONEST .. "witty/cute" .. answers could not be reveal to Sturt (because one might get mis-quoted accidentaly), but could be eloborated in some detail here.<br><br>The main question from Sturt was .. Why Do You Run ?<br><br>Answer by Penguin-X ..<br>"Non runners call me CRAZY. Yes! My family may have a history of having mental problems (amok) but let me stress here that I run because I am NOT CRAZY.<br><br>I believe that running can improve one's SEX life (as one tends to meet runners of the opposite sex). Especially the long runs because it really builds up endurance. With improvements in adventures of passion there are doubts that I would ever be dispatched by the current "flavour" of office stress.<br><br>Anyway, if you asked me this question 20 years ago .. I probably would have told you that I run because I want to be the next ..
