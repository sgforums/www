              <p>Do you know a singer, a band, an instrumentalist or a songwriter who is less popular and famous than his/her talent deserves? Share it then! It can be of any genre and language.  It can be someone who is known for only one song but has great but lesser-known ones, or someone with limited popularity outside a region (or in SG).</p>
              <p>Before you talk about them and post videos, remember that they should actually be able to make music. No Autotuned-wailing, and they should still sound good live without lip-synching or distracting dance acts.</p>
              <p>I tend to gravitate towards a few kinds of music, so please add to the variety!</p>

              <p>To get the ball rolling, I'll introduce Nerina Pallot, an English singer-songwriter of French and Indian parentage. She isn't well known outside Europe but she's made 4 albums (the last being this year's 'Year of the Wolf').</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.nerinapallot.com/images/dynamicImages/image/Nerina%20Gaydar%20Session.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="332"></p>
              <p>What's remarkable about Nerina is her clear singing voice and diction, even on the high notes. It's still very good at her live gigs, which tend to be stripped down. You may have heard one of her songs before, especially if you watched Johnny English Reborn. She and her husband have also written songs for other musicians including Kylie Minogue.</p>
              <p>She's been here once before, at 2007's Mosaic Music Festival. Below is a video from that gig (not mine - I hadn't discovered her then, sadly)</p>
              <p>Albums: Dear Frustrated Superstar (2001), Fires (2005), The Graduate (2009), Year of the Wolf (2011)</p>
              <p>My (humble, random, opinion-based) rating: 8.2/10</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2D7GGkrJPM">Nerina Pallot - Put Your Hands Up (feat. in Johnny English Reborn - it was actually meant for Kylie's last album)</a></p>

              <p>Next up is the lady on the left and below - Laura Marling</p>
              <p><img src="http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/assets_c/2010/07/lmarling1-thumb-480x319.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427"></p>
              <p>She may be only 21 years old but she's made 3 albums, received 2 Mercury nominations and won a BRIT award. This folk artist is not particularly well-known outside the UK where her concerts sell out in minutes, but she's coming to Singapore next February as part of the Laneway Festival line-up.</p>
              <p>Laura first started out as a part of the band Noah and the Whale but has firmly established herself as a solo performer since 2008. She is a prodigious songwriter, whose content is exceptionally mature for her age. Coupled with her alto range, it may seem dark and maudlin at first but there are those who dub her the new Joni Mitchell. She has also appeared to overcome her early nerves and grown into a confident live performer.</p>
              <p>My rating: 8.6/10</p>
              <p>Albums: Alas I Cannot Swim (2008), I Speak Because I Can (2010), A Creature I Don't Know (2011)</p>

              <p>If you like folk, you can't not know about Kenny Anderson, aka King Creosote:</p>
              <p><img src="http://soundsxp.com/artman2/uploads/1/KingCresote-GF01_1_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400"></p>
              <p>He's been heavily involved in Scotland's folk music scene for the last 16 years, as founder of The Fence Collective and organiser of the Homegame festival and he's worked with acts like Kid Canaveral and KT Tunstall early in their careers.</p>
              <p>KC is an incredibly prolific musician, have realeased 40(!) albums, with the latest being Thrawn. Diamond Mine was nominated for this year's Mercury Prize. Many of his tunes are short and have a distinctive acoustic flavour, even amid the production in the more recent tracks. He sounds a shade like another favourite singer of mine, Neil Finn. For me it's makes good rainy day music when I'm not in the mood for jazz.</p>

              <p>I'm possibly cheating because this Russian-born American musician has a strong cult following. I'm talking about Regina Spektor.</p>
              <p><img src="http://liveon35mm.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/reginaspektor5.jpg?w=497" alt="" width="497" height="393"></p>
              <p>People have called her music everything from anti-folk to what-Tori-Amos-used-to-be. She employs Eastern European and Jewish elements and techniques (how often do you hear the glottal stop used in pop music?).</p>
              <p>She's a classically-trained pianist so her melodies often sound like they could came out of an early 1900s concerto. She also has some guitar songs, and how can one voice take on so many textures in different songs - haunting, gritty, gentle and more.</p>
              <p>Her early work (in the 1st 3 albums) was "dry" in production, with next-to-no vocal reverb. If you watched 500 Days of Summer, the song at the beginning ('Us') is a weak example of that. The last 2 albums (and the most popular to date) are less raw, whether that's good is debatable.</p>
              <p>The best thing about her is that she can make up complete songs on the fly (one of them's below), so you're never exactly sure what's on her setlist at live gigs. And her wit still shows through in the lyrics of songs like 'Us', 'Hotel Song'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Albums: 11:11 (2000), Songs (2002), Soviet Kitsch (2004), Begin To Hope (2006), Far (2009), What We Saw From The Cheap Seats (coming 2012)</p>

              <p>Not bad at all. A countertenor voice was the last thing I was expecting from him. I don't recognise the songs he sang in the videos though.</p>

              <p>here's someone who isn't very well known if at all here.. he's John Butler.. he has his own band The John Butler Trio...</p>
              <p>mostly he's an amazing guitarist and somehow, i would not classify him in any genre... but if pushed, i'd say blues, bluegrass, folk, roots...</p>

              <p>he's pretty well known in Australia, where he's from... originally from the US, he moved to Australia with his father and lived there...</p>
              <p>he started out busking in Fremantle and sold his own recordings on cassettes and paid his dues playing his own compositions...</p>
              <p>here are some of his pieces:</p>
              <p><a href="http://youtu.be/TzkXP3turZ0">Ocean - John Butler</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V-Em41OZ8U">Daniella - John Butler Trio</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlziqygVQ1g">Treat Yo Mama - John Butler Trio</a></p>
              <p>as with good artists and musicians, John Butler is a hell of a lot better live than he sounds on his albums.. and his albums are damned good already!</p>
              <p>like i said, i'm partial to the blues  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Amy Mac's one of my personal favourites too, even though she's not the best lyricist or vocalist. (a) Her songs can be preachy like 'Footballer's Wife' and 'An Ordinary Life', and (b) her live voice is very different especially when it's strained. I don't what is it about her that German-speaking people love, her gig tickets sell like hotcakes in Switzerland and Germany. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Time to add a bit more variety here....if you happen to be looking for good J-pop stuff that does not include trashy stuff like we tend to see (think Ayumi and girl/boy dance bands), why not try Suga Shikao?</p>
              <p>His music is more mainstream, but proves to be such to the point that his music is very radio-friendly, and yet with his distinctive style, is no slave to pop. Sadly it would appear that he has finally succumbed to more popular tastes and in my opinion his recent music is starting to sound like he's trying too hard.</p>
              <p>This guy is like the Japanese modern Hall &amp; Oates. Groovy rock music with a dose of soul. Other defining features of his music includes funk, R&amp;B, strong bass-lines and his husky rough-hewn voice that is most distinct. Vocal-wise, he is nothing like those "good singers". But he projects a great deal of emotion in his singing and again, his style of singing is no slave to what is considered "good" or "bad". His singing goes a lot with his music, which means that he syncs a lot better with his songs that most performers.</p>
              <p>A good example of his style can be seen in his 2004 single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVSa61vtvOI">Hikari no Kawa</a>. This video has english subs.</p>
              <p>But he is also versatle enough to push the boundaries a little and came up with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWI0Pg8SWnI">Kono Yubi Tomare</a> which is a popsy acid jazz piece. This song was what caught my attention about him. </p>
              <p>Suga Shikao is best known for his theme songs for anime xxxHolic. I loved <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slnt3o70gyU">Sanagi</a>, yet another funky creation, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gVsSGZd_5Y">Sofa</a>, a decidedly post-rock piece that I absolutely love listening to at night.</p>
              <p>A little raggae can be heard here. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsss-asr7XY&amp;feature=related">Yuudachi</a></p>
              <p>And yes. I'm a sucker for radio-friendly music like these.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Regina's one of two Jewish singers that I have on my bucket list (to see in concert).<br>And the other? She's Keren Ann:</p>
              <p><img src="http://images.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer/keren-ann/large_image-1.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="490"></p>
              <p>This Paris-based Israeli singer-songwriter has made 6 albums, and then produced some more for other singers. Her work covers lots of genres, from French chanson and pleasant acoustic tracks to some massive atmospheric pieces and radio-friendly hits (her latest album is mostly this).</p>
              <p>Her talent's in making dream-like and surreal tunes that alter your mood and suck you in from start to finish, and her vocals are like a soft layer of icing over the music. If you like left-of-centre stuff, see her collaboration with Bang Gang called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUABRknXXhM">Lady &amp; Bird</a>.</p>
              <p>Albums: La Biographie de Luka Philipsen (2001), La Disparition (2002),<br>Not Going Anywhere (2003), Nolita (2005), Keren Ann (2007), 101 (2011)</p>

              <p>She's very popular in the 1980s but is unheard of now, her music being drowned by the new-waved jpop and kpop.</p>
              <p>This is from wiki:</p>

              <p>Her first studio album entitled <em>Shoujo</em> was recorded in Los Angeles, produced by GRAMMY Award winner John Fischbach, with distinguished musicians such as David Campbell, <a title="Carole King" href="/wiki/Carole_King"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Carole King</span></span></a> and Charles Larkey who was King's husband at that time. Owing to her introspective compositions, Itsuwa was often nicknamed "Japanese Carole King", along with other Japanese singer-songwriters like <a title="Yumi Matsutoya" href="/wiki/Yumi_Matsutoya"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yumi Matsutoya</span></span></a> (who had worked under her <a class="mw-redirect" title="Birth name" href="/wiki/Birth_name"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">birth name</span></span></a> "Yumi Arai" during the mid 1970s) and <a class="new" title="Minako Yoshida (page does not exist)" href="/w/index.php?title=Minako_Yoshida&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ba0000;">Minako Yoshida</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>Itsuwa has gained moderate success on the Japanese albums chart in her early career, and received massive popularity and acclaim through a single "Koibito yo" released in 1980. A song topped the Japan's Oricon chart for three consecutive weeks, and won the 22nd <a title="Japan Record Award" href="/wiki/Japan_Record_Award"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Japan Record Award</span></span></a> for "Gold Prize" in a same year.<sup id="cite_ref-oriconno1_0-0" class="reference"><a href="/forums/1769/topics/#cite_note-oriconno1-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22rt_1-0" class="reference"><a href="/forums/1769/topics/#cite_note-22rt-1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> It was covered by the country's legendary singers including <a title="Hibari Misora" href="/wiki/Hibari_Misora"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hibari Misora</span></span></a> and <a title="Noriko Awaya" href="/wiki/Noriko_Awaya"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Noriko Awaya</span></span></a> in later years, and became a <a title="Signature song" href="/wiki/Signature_song"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">signature song</span></span></a> for Itsuwa.</p>
              <p>After "Koibito yo" became a hit, Itsuwa gained popularity also in non-Japanese Asian countries during the 1980s.</p>
              <p>In Indonesia,"Kokoro No Tomo" and "Amayadori" become the most popular songs ever released by her. In 2006, Mayumi Itsuwa and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Delon Thamrin" href="/wiki/Delon_Thamrin"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Delon Thamrin</span></span></a> recorded an Indonesian and Japanese version of the song. This was later included on the 2006 compilation album "Duet Love Songs".</p>

              <p>I'll add another bloke to the mix. This, friends, is Nathaniel Rateliff.</p>

              <p>I watched him open for Laura a couple of years back. That performance received mixed comments from our bunch, because even in his inebriated, slurring state that voice caught our attention. He's been going places since, like Jools Holland's show:</p>

              <p>He looks like a truck driver (which he once was), and comes from the unlikeliest of places (Denver, Colorado), but he has that weary voice, the tunes are very rootsy and the tracks have plenty of space.</p>

              <p>No folk tunes from me this time. Here's some quirky pop by Marina &amp; The Diamonds.</p>

              <p>You can think of her as a Greco-Welsh Lady Gaga without the sleaze and attention-grabbing stunts. You can draw the parallels - her songs and videos are often an artistic critique, with quite a few aimed at America, and an unusual fashion sense (which does not include food items). And her voice is employed in rather unique ways and it grows on you. I don't like all of her work, but these songs are quite agreeable.</p>

              <p>I've been asked a couple of times about this "indie phenomenon" called Lana Del Rey.</p>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.idolator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lana-Del-Rey-flowers.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="457"></p>
              <p>I gave 'Video Games', 'Blue Jeans', 'Fake Mountain Dew' and a couple of other songs a go, and they're pretty ho-hum without the music videos, even if the lyrics are good. Her voice isn't special enough to pull them off. She screwed up on Saturday Night Live but that's probably due to nerves.</p>
              <p>But what really annoys me is the deceptive astroturfing that surrounds her. Fine, it's okay to fail with the first album and repackage yourself to make a better living, and maybe I can ignore the lip enhancements. But she has claimed to be some kind of trailer park trash and "gangsta Nancy Sinatra" when she's really a rich daddy's girl who's signed to a major label. I cannot stand that.</p>
              <p>Sorry if I burst your bubble, but you are free to enjoy her music if you like it.</p>
