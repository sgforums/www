Also, each of us have different levels of need for alone-time and for company.  I know there are some folks who'd literally wilt and die without seeing friends for even a short time.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Sometimes, I feel like I'm a hermit crab... I dig a hole deep deep and hide in it.  And if anyone tries to dig me out, I'll just retreat even deeper into my shell and stay there till I'm ready to come out again!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think I'm really lucky to have friends who care... if they don't hear from me for a while, they'll call and ask if I'm alright.  Thank God they're not those who won't even call because imagine, what if I were to die suddenly one day and nobody bothers to call until a year later!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Actually, I did tell a few colleagues and friends recently, a pretty amusing scenario... Imagine this - I live alone and sometimes, I get three days off in a stretch.  What if I died suddenly at home on the night before my three days off and for the following three days, nobody would miss me at work and all that and it'll only be three days later when I didn't turn up at work that folks will start to panic and then my neighbours start to smell some not-so-nice scent.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Morbid thought, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  But yeah... I get 'creative' on idle time!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
