Take that elderly guy today who asked to speak to the manager after I told him we had none to sell him. My manager knows zero about a/c's so I was corralled to talk to this customer again. Piangz. I had uttered the very same words to the customer before the manager was involved and the stupid customer was actually polite. What gives man??!?! And you know what rubbed salt into the bloody wound? After I told him that he could order one in for a Thursday pick up, he tells me he was going to go check out other stores in the area. Piangz, when he came in, he was already cussing that other stores had none to sell. So what changed in the 30 minutes he was in our store??!?!?!? People!</div>

My mum tends to hoard but she's not a chronic hoarder. The house is neat, clean and tidy. Speaking of this, you know when I moved to the States, I never expected to see the horrible state of housekeeping in many people's homes.<br><br>I had a friend who was always neat and clean so you would imagine that her house was the same. Nooooooooooo....... OMG, dishes were piled high and all over the counter; clothes were all over the floor, furniture and everywhere else. The floor was filthy and hadn't been cleaned in God knows how long and nothing was put away. Good grief.</div>

When I first moved here, I lived in Seattle and had to take the bus everywhere. The first couple of times, when the person seated next to me chatted with me, I thought she was so genuine and I put effort into the conversation. The second time it happened, I thought the same thing. After the third and subsequent times, I was emotionally tired. Good Gawd, they tell you personal things about their life, family, etc, for all and sundry to hear. Then you have other people piping in, in agreement or worse still, to share their own sorry tale. On subsequent rides, I would make myself less accessible by burying my nose in a book.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
