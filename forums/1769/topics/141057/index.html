            <div class='col-md body'>Is condo or stock a better investment?<br>The Business Times, 17 May 2005<br>By DAVID LIANG<br><br>I just moved to Singapore from New York City several months ago. I can't help but notice the stark difference in the investing mentality between investors in the US and their counterparts here in Singapore.<br><br>In the US, the most 'popular' investment is stocks. Even after the bursting of the Internet bubble, the percentage of US households that have some exposure to the stock market remains above 50 per cent. Those who cannot afford to put a downpayment for a house are likely to have some types of brokerage accounts.<br><br>In Singapore, real estate, particularly the condominium, is the first choice of investment. The stock market is regarded as one giant casino, and a lot of people here have the perception that putting money in the stock market is akin to gambling.<br><br>Because of the way most market participants trade stocks and the overwhelming popularity of technical analysis, I am not surprised that the stock market has such a bad reputation.<br><br>This makes my job as a fund manager that much tougher - although it is somewhat offset by the fact that I see many opportunities to make money in the Singapore stock market.<br><br>Because most market participants here treat buying and selling stocks like gambling, some valuations are completely out of line with the companies' fundamentals. At present, there are a lot of good companies selling at ridiculously cheap prices.<br><br>Then there is the fact that residential property investments offer extremely low returns. This is consistent with the law of supply and demand: because so much investors' money goes into real estate, property prices are sky-high, driving down rental yields.<br><br>The opposite occurs in the stock market. Lack of investors' enthusiasm keeps prices low - which means earnings yield combined with dividend yield from stocks are much more attractive than rental yield from properties.<br><br>Let's look at one example: a three-bedroom unit of about 1,100 sq ft on Killiney Road less than 10 minutes' walk from the Somerset MRT station.<br><br>According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority website, which compiles past property transactions, the fair market price for the condo should approximate $800,000.<br><br>Let's assume you buy the property by putting down 20 per cent ($160,000) and borrowing 80 per cent ($640,000) for 30 years.<br><br>The bank may charge you lower interest rates in the first two years of the loan. But after year 3 and beyond, the interest is likely to climb to over 3 per cent.<br><br>Yield vs inflation<br><br>The market rental price for similar apartments in the area is less than $2,000/month, but let's say you manage to get a tenant who does not mind paying $2,100/month - just slightly below your asking price of $2,200 (according to late March/ early April 2005 rental property listings).<br><br>After paying the building maintenance fee of $200/month, you are left with $1,900/month to meet the monthly payment to the bank. At a 3 per cent interest rate, your monthly payment to the bank comes to about $2,700/month, which means you have $800/month or $9,600/year negative cashflow from this property.<br><br>Let's say you do not mind paying the principal portion of the payment from your own pocket as long as the rental income covers the interest. Over the 30-year life of the loan, the interest portion itself averages $1,600/month.<br><br>After deducting $200/month maintenance and $1,600/month average interest, your profit is $300/month or $3,600/year. Because you paid down $160,000, this means that you make about 2.25 per cent annual return on investment on your rental property.<br><br>A 2.25 per cent rental yield barely beats inflation which, according to the Singapore Department of Statistics, stood at 1.75 per cent in 2004. In fact, there are even some bank CDs that offer annual interest rates higher than 2.25 per cent.<br><br>You may think you can profit more if the price of property goes up. Well, think again. So far we have been ignoring the fact that if you had bought the condo directly from the developer in the late 1990s, it would have cost you $1.25 million instead of $800,000 today.<br><br>Whoever bought the condo then would have lost $425,000 in equity by now. Also, just drive along River Valley Road, which is adjacent to Killiney Road, and count how many new residential projects are currently being built. With so many new units entering the market in the next few years, how can prices go up?<br><br>The laws of supply and demand suggest it is highly unlikely.<br><br>The situation is exacerbated by the fact that many property owners currently have negative equity on their property investments. In other words, the proceeds that they stand to collect by selling out are less than the loan balance they owe to the banks.<br><br>This structural problem keeps prices artificially high because even the most desperate property investors cannot afford to sell out, unless they compensate the banks for the balance.<br><br>Stock yields<br><br>What about stocks - can they provide investors with more than a paltry 2.25 per cent return? Yes, very likely. First of all, just from dividend alone, there are a lot of stocks that offer yields higher than 2.25 per cent.<br><br>In addition, stocks are selling at relatively cheaper valuations compared to residential properties. According to Bloomberg, stocks in the Straits Times Index traded between 11x and 14.5x P/E multiples in the past 12 months. This 11x to 14.5x P/E translates into between 7 per cent and 9 per cent earnings yield.<br><br>Outside the STI, there are many stocks that are selling at even lower P/E multiples, which means even higher earnings yields (P/E multiples are inversely related to earnings yields).<br><br>There are even profitable companies whose stocks are selling very close to their net cash per share. Therefore, just from the dividend alone, stocks can be a more profitable investment vehicle than property.<br><br>If total earnings yields are taken into consideration in addition to dividend yields, investing in stocks certainly provides a better return than investing in residential properties.<br><br>It is true that stocks can be extremely volatile. Just look at what happened to US equities in April. They declined sharply although the outlook for profit growth has actually improved. Stock prices fluctuate up and down every day, every hour, and every minute.<br><br>The underlying business fundamentals, however, do not change that quickly. Stock prices are influenced by human emotions. The underlying business is much more stable, and in the long run, stock prices do eventually reflect underlying business fundamentals.<br><br>Another thing that you have to consider is buying at reasonable prices. Of course, this is true of all types of investment assets, not just stocks.<br><br>A lot of people lost money after the Internet bubble because they bought when valuations were highly unreasonable.<br><br>At present, however, stocks are selling at much more reasonable levels compared to residential properties.<br><br>The point is that if you buy stocks of companies whose underlying businesses are in good shape and growing, if you buy them at reasonable valuations and if you ignore short-term gyrations, you would stand a very good chance of making good returns on your investment.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">David Liang is a fund manager for a private investment partnership</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally we must understand what the term "real estate" means:<br>the "real" used here is actually a spainish volcabulary means "royal" or "somethings belongs to the king or gov.<br><br>For short, "real estate" simply means land belongs to gov.<br><br>To invest in property, the standard procedure is to look out for good location, rental yield and pray everyday that the propert price keep going north.<br><br>But in recent years, we have found that Singapore market is more quiet than before. Why?<br>-&gt; Singaporean population profile<br>more and more old people, but less and less young people in the country. Where are the young ones? Ans: working or studying overseas.<br><br>-&gt; China Hot Market<br>everyboby, regardless you are angmo or indian, malay, jap, korean or chinese, as long as you have $$, china is the magic pot. Just look at capitaland latest annoucement for the new 15 malls purchase in china!<br><br>-&gt; Market Factors:<br>Generally, our starting salary are going up, but the catch is that not as many people are as highly paid as before in the GOLDERN ERA 1990 -1998. We can say that the Government report for our standard of living is true, average salary increase but median income group has experience a drop in real purchase power. In addition, there are still many "available" choice condo / HDB unit left on the shell for you to pick. Now PR and 30+ can also purchase new HDB flat liao.<br><br>But there is a silver lining:<br>the property price is galvanise by our CPF. In addition, IRs and new CBD (BFC development) will support the property price a bit. If singapore dollar drop a bit more, more people will still come in to the market for investment!<br><br>Choice is all yours, my pal<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>want to invest in property must think a little bit lah.<br><br>Buy a shop is better lah, it may cost more than a house but the tenant turnover is higher as compared to renting a house.<br><br>You buy a house you must ask yourself what is so good abt the house that ppl will pay the rent that you demand? Are there really that many people out there willing to shell out 2-3k per month just to rent with you?<br><br>A shop on the other hand the way I see it is like that, people have dreams and aspirations many people at some point in their lives want to try doing some business whether it's clothes, hairdressing, internet or even bubble tea etc .... the shop location is subjective, what is good for some trades may not be good for others but there is a high chance somebody will rent it so long there is decent human traffic. Most business startups fail within the first year abt 90% fail but the good news is every second there are thousands born into this world who will one day grow up to be doctors, tailors, enterprenueres who will potentially need to rent a place to do their trade or business so therefore your market for tenants is huge as compares to someone who needs a roof over his head ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I would think a few small shops is better than owning 1 big huge shop, when people start doing business for the first time their funds tend to be limited by their own personal savings so they tend to start out with a small base banks will not risk lending to such startups as there is no earning history, so having 1 or 2 small shops means you are targetting startups but it's a huge audience.<br><br>It also means that during bad times like recession your risk is diversified and the rental you collect being low(as it is a small shop) means your tenant has a chance to survive longer hence continuing to pay you in the process. Observe   how your neighbourhood provision store owner manages to stay in business for so many years both good and bad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And happen that in the neighbouring vicinty a major tourist attraction is being built the value of your premises will surely appreciate and rentals go up.<br><br>makes sense  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

To me he is just putting his sales speech into words for BT to publish.<br><br>E.g. If I pay 800K cash for the property, my rental return will be 2.85%. Property price in that sector is expect to grown by about at least 3% this year, and that will give me a return of at least 5.85% per year.<br><br>As for stock, it is like property, there is always a up and down cycle.
