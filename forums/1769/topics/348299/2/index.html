              <p>Now that we have selected the house based on the external landform and gua number, let's look at the internal, interior design and decorations.</p>
              <p>As the ba zhai has a history of more than 500 years, the original assessment were only on  the location of the ï¼ˆ<strong>é—¨(door)ï¼Œè·¯(passage)ï¼Œç�¶(stove)ï¼Œæ°´(well)ï¼Œæµ‹(toilet)ï¼Œç£¨(milling room). </strong>Furthermore, during the ancient time, all the houses were constructed based on the å››å’Œå›­ theory or the square or rectangle shaped.</p>
              <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/87/243880140_434f3dee6e.jpg?v=0" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
              <p>The <strong>é—¨(door)</strong> is the first place when you enter or exit the house therefore has the most important placing. Thus the most ideal location of the door is the ç”Ÿæ°” (Generation of Life) of the trigram, followed by å»¶å¹´ (Harmony), å¤©åŒ» (Health) and then ä¼˜ä½� (Stability).</p>
              <p>Next is the <strong>è·¯(passage). </strong>This refer to the passage leading into the various rooms. However, this is only applicable to big landed properties.</p>
              <p>The <strong>ç�¶(stove) </strong>still carries an importance in modern days feng shui although todays stove is no longer the olden type where firewood is the only source of cooking.</p>
              <p>In the olden days, <strong>æ°´(well) </strong>is the source of drinking water in each home thus the importance. But with modern days facilities like tap water, the tap will be refered to the well</p>
              <p>During those time, without the proper toilet drainage system, toilets were never convenient like today. Toilet should never be too far away but had to be far enough to keep the smell at bay</p>
              <p><img src="http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/7807/pictdb.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="588"></p>
              <p>Another room the <strong>ç£¨(milling room) </strong>is also no longer in used so the storeroom may be refer to its equivalent.</p>

              <p>Today, houses are sometime odd shaped with corners cut or missing. And today, with houses door, toilets, kitchen  location fixed, and well, milling room no longer in used, things changed.</p>
              <p>What is it about odd shape house then?</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Island/2589/sy/houseplan.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="923"></p>
              <p>For example, if a house is "L" shape, then refering to the later trigram, a missing top left corner (location 2 below) may refer to the disadvantage to the (å�¤ = mother) elderly woman</p>

              <p>Today, modern people will asked for assessment like the placing of the shrine <strong>ç¥žä¸»ä½�</strong>, wealth place <strong>è´¢ä½�</strong>, study table <strong>æ–‡æ˜Œä½�</strong> even when all these were never mentioned in the original assessment.<strong>.</strong>However we will attempt to talk a little about these.</p>
              <p>If you have watched enough <strong>å�¤è£…æˆ�</strong> shows, as of ancient time, shrine and ancestor's tablets were never placed at home but in temple åº™and ancestor's temple. But today, for the convenience of the people, these are sometime placed at home. thus the request for shrine location.</p>
              <p>So how does one choose the best location and the best type of shrine/altar table for their house?</p>
              <p>Using the selected compass, the shrine/altar should be located at the best location in the compass. Thus the most ideal location of the door is the <strong>ç”Ÿæ°”</strong> (Generation of Life) of the trigram, followed by<strong> å»¶å¹´</strong> (Harmony), <strong>å¤©åŒ»</strong> (Health) and then <strong>ä¼˜ä½�</strong> (Stability). Also, it is best to select the shrine that has a view of the outdoor, such as windows or main door. To select the ideal table, use the Lu Ban ruler for the proper dimension. Most of the ready made altar table are already of such dimension.</p>
              <p>Do bear in mind that fengshui can also intergrate modern interior design. You do not have to buy those "chinese" altar. You can alway incorporate modern design and material into them such as granite or marble tops.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i14.ebayimg.com/02/i/001/1e/2f/9cd5_1.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="400">  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do bear in mind to keep the shrine as clean and neat as possible as the shrine reflects the owner states of mind. Keep it simple and do not leave unrelated items such as keys, small changes on it.</p>

              <p>Next, lets talk about <strong>æ–‡æ˜Œä½�,</strong> usually referred to as study table. This is a very important location to all parents who's concerned about their children education. </p>
              <p>First, look for your child kua number. Then place the selected compass onto the child room. As usual, locate the favourable spot and place the table there. The usual principle applies, such as the back does not face the door etc.</p>
              <p>In order to acitvate the <strong>æ–‡æ˜Œä½�,</strong> place items such as the <strong>æ–‡æˆ¿å››å®�</strong> shown below. You may also use simpler item such as 4 caligraphy brushes tied together or simply placing his educational certificate at that location.</p>

              <p>This should be the most interesting chapter in the whole of the fengshui topic to many. The wealth place <strong>è´¢ä½�. </strong>How do you find the wealth place? Easy!. see the picture below. The spot is usually at the corner where the air circulation meets. Check if this spot is also your favourable spot in your Kua compass.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you activate the spot?</p>
              <p>You simply place items that represents money at that spot. Items such as fish tank, fountains and plants etc. Items that brings life! Do keep the place spick and span and avoid too much vibrations such as a rushing water fountain. Dead leaves, dead fishes must be removed and water must be kept clean</p>
