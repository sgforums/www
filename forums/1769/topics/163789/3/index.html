Or are you trying to show others being single is the right thing to do?<br><br>Is having children in a marriage a good ol mistake? common, dont try to talk like you know about married life when you are still a single. You are making too much assumption to please your lonely self. having a child (planned) after marriage will only enhance the bonding in the family.<br><br>Those shot-gun cases are the one you should avoid. So dont try to mix those 2 together.<br><br>Please do me a favour, get yourself a partner first before giving your comments.<br></div></blockquote>i don't think she's saying having children in a marriage is a mistake. i believe she's actually referring to having children for the <strong>sole</strong> purpose of <strong>saving</strong> a dwindling marriage.<br><br>and i agree. if the marriage is failing and a child is brought in as a last ditch attempt of resuscitation then it's probably not fair to the child.  isn't that too heavy a burden to put on an unborn child?<br><br>children, being the joy and wonder that they are, should be brought into the world for the sake of being. not as an instrument.[/b]</div>
