              <p>certain knowledge is not meant for everybody, spilling certain
                      things out will have reprecussions beyond our comprehension.
                      Society functions as such on a very basic level too, you will have
                      certain views and opinions of people that you'd keep only to
                      yourself, or you'd discuss with only a few confidantes, say one day
                      someone spills out your msn conversation history to the world, and
                      everyone else would know what you think of them, vice versa, warts
                      and all, would there be trust between you guys ever again ?</p>
              <p>And so it goes up the levels, certain knowledge would have
                      strategic significance that could spell human lives, These
                      dickheads have just made the world a more dangerous place, I doubt
                      if they really understood, or cared, about what they are pretending
                      to be standing for. It's like many of those clueless liberal arty
                      farty types I met in the uni at my elective classes, weed smoking
                      dandies whose favourite website was counterpunch.org and the
                      likes.</p>
              <p>And say if you argue, what harm could it do if the world now
                      knows LKY thinks kim jong il is an adulation seeking flabby old
                      fart, then the flipside would be, what good would it have done, in
                      the name of freedom of information, either ? It's just pandering to
                      people's curiosity and voyeuristic streaks, no ? Except that now,
                      perhaps, people like LKY would be a bit more tight-lipped and
                      circumspect, would divulge a lot less, and people and countries in
                      the power game would be more suspicious and distrustful of one
                      another. Remember, wars have been started because of mistrusts,
                      misreadings and suspicions. These dicks are just casual and
                      clueless anarchists, out just for the pleasure of fame and
                      nose-thumbing at authority, nothing more.</p>
              <p>And, I repeat again, as much as these air-filled flower-child
                      type like to denigrate uncle sam as the hegemony seeking
                      imperialist badass, there'll come a time pretty soon, when they'll
                      remember uncle sam fondly, warts and all ............ just look
                      today's rags, china squeezing nuts over the nobel peace prize.
                      ......... remember this episode when china ascends to
                      superpowerhood in the next decade .....</p>

              <p>Whistleblowing's more often than not beneficial to the general populace. People in power need to reminded once in a while that they cannot get away with corruption. This sort of activity is not borne out of voyeuristic whims but of a distrust for authority which time and again ruins the lives of the people that it is supposed to serve by wiping out savings, destroying livelihoods and denying them better living conditions. You have mad hatters who have their misgivings for just one country, but many more people distrust politicians and the people who run the market as a whole.</p>
              <p>It's naive to believe that politicians actually have any trust in one another, and as I've said, this information is probably old news to them thanks to espionage. They're more worried about this information going public and tarnishing their public image. US cables were released, but I don't believe that Wikileaks's beef is solely with that nation, as their past leaks have shown. No one of sound mind is saying that China's a saviour, an angel or a victim.</p>
              <p>We are living in a world where people are disillusioned with the systems and constructs of society and are questioning the assumptions about and the trust placed in them. But no, I can't say what's the answer to all these ills and abuses.</p>

              <p><br>That I agree.</p>
              <p>Its discriminate info-giving at best, and the way they hand it out is machiam giving us lollipop.</p>
              <p>On a more sinister side, its now obvious the shift of power now went over to the wikileaks people. They are now temporarily empowered with what I wouldn't even consider people power.</p>

              <p>who are those coding up mirror sites and hacking at visa anyways ?</p>
              <p>looking at those who've outed themselves, they are mostly a bunch of teenagers who learnt how to download a DDoS bot from a "security" forum they've googled up and thought it's so cool when clueless reporters identify them as "high-tech teenage hackers", that's all .....</p>
              <p>but of course, to be badged as a bona fide pimpled rebel you must have a cause ....... and wikileaks came along .... I get to flip the bird at authority ! .... I'm sooooo cool ! woohoo ! </p>
              <p>like those pot smoking flower childs of the seventies, they don't realized that they are undermining the very societies that enable them to get away with such acts.</p>

              <p>compromising our own country's foreign policies, can you still
                  say it's directed solely at embaressing the US ? What good would
                  such information have done ? Towards these dickhead's causes ? Does
                  it goes towards assauging people's distrust of the US goverment
                  ?  What good would come out of this, really ? like I said,
                  it's just a bunch of mischevious farktards who just thought it'll
                  be fun to play a prank on the world's authorities, that's all.
                  Whatever they pretend to stand for is just an afterthought for them
                  to pretend to justify their crimes. They had their fun, people in
                  other countries like ours pay for it.</p>
              <p>I would love to see the main perpertrators shot, let's start
                  with assange.</p>

              <p>Okay, revealing what the leaders of countries think of one another may not be beneficial to us, but I still do not think relations will be compromised unless the said leaders are in denial. It's an editorial decision the site's operators made and they may not believe in discriminating the information that they get, but I still want them to expose shit like Trafigura and the Iraq war documents.</p>
              <p>Getting Assange isn't going to stop Wikileaks, just as killing terrorist leaders hasn't destroyed the groups. What good does it do to keep the wool pulled over our eyes?</p>
              <p>P.S. The title of this article is incredulous (and I don't believe in such 'person of the year' awards) but some of the things written resonate: <a href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/39327/julian-assange-man-of-the-year/">http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/39327/julian-assange-man-of-the-year/ </a></p>
