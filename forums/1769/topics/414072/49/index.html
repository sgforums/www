              <p>It's not as if all these countries and groups, including the US, have spies everywhere. The recent espionage case involving Russians in the US highlighted that. They will get the information sooner or later, but now it's public knowledge.</p>
              <p>Like Wikipedia, it publishes only what is submitted, or so I'd like to think. They've also published stuff from Kenya and Peru, as well as the gag order that the Trafigura company placed on newspapers. Information will continue to leak to Wikileaks and other parties unless the authorities rethink the way it is handled.</p>
              <p>And Assange is only a public face for many people who founded and run the site. Taking him out won't stop the revelations. I'm looking forward to more exposés, and it's only a matter of time before the spotlight turns to the corporate world again.</p>

              <p>It's not as if all these countries and groups, including the US,
              have spies everywhere. The recent espionage case involving Russians
              in the US highlighted that. They will get the information sooner or
              later, but now it's public knowledge.</p>
              <p>Like Wikipedia, it publishes only what is submitted, or so I'd
              like to think. They've also published stuff from Kenya and Peru, as
              well as the gag order that the Trafigura company placed on
              newspapers. Information will continue to leak to Wikileaks and
              other parties unless the authorities rethink the way it is
              handled.</p>
              <p>And Assange is only a public face for many people who founded
              and run the site. Taking him out won't stop the revelations. I'm
              looking forward to more exposés, and it's only a matter of time
              before the spotlight turns to the corporate world again.</p>

              <p>certain knowledge is not meant for everybody, spilling certain things out will have reprecussions beyond our comprehension. Society functions as such on a very basic level too, you will have certain views and opinions of people that you'd keep only to yourself, or you'd discuss with only a few confidantes, say one day someone spills out your msn conversation history to the world, and everyone else would know what you think of them, vice versa, warts and all, would there be trust between you guys ever again ?</p>
              <p>And so it goes up the levels, certain knowledge would have strategic significance that could spell human lives, These dickheads have just made the world a more dangerous place, I doubt if they really understood, or cared, about what they are pretending to be standing for. It's like many of those clueless liberal arty farty types I met in the uni at my elective classes, weed smoking dandies whose favourite website was counterpunch.org and the likes.</p>
              <p>And say if you argue, what harm could it do if the world now knows LKY thinks kim jong il is an adulation seeking flabby old fart, then the flipside would be, what good would it have done, in the name of freedom of information, either ? It's just pandering to people's curiosity and voyeuristic streaks, no ? Except that now, perhaps, people like LKY would be a bit more tight-lipped and circumspect, would divulge a lot less, and people and countries in the power game would be more suspicious and distrustful of one another. Remember, wars have been started because of mistrusts, misreadings and suspicions. These dicks are just casual and clueless anarchists, out just for the pleasure of fame and nose-thumbing at authority, nothing more.</p>
              <p>And, I repeat again, as much as these air-filled flower-child type like to denigrate uncle sam as the hegemony seeking imperialist badass, there'll come a time pretty soon, when they'll remember uncle sam fondly, warts and all ............ just look today's rags, china squeezing nuts over the nobel peace prize. ......... remember this episode when china ascends to superpowerhood in the next decade .....</p>
