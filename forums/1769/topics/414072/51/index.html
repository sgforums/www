              <p>Okay, revealing what the leaders of countries think of one
              another may not be beneficial to us, but I still do not think
              relations will be compromised unless the said leaders are in
              denial. It's an editorial decision the site's operators made and
              they may not believe in discriminating the information that they
              get, but I still want them to expose shit like Trafigura and the
              Iraq war documents.</p>
              <p>Getting Assange isn't going to stop Wikileaks, just as killing
              terrorist leaders hasn't destroyed the groups. What good does it do
              to keep the wool pulled over our eyes?</p>
              <p>P.S. The title of this article is incredulous (and I don't
              believe in such 'person of the year' awards) but some of the things
              written resonate: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/39327/julian-assange-man-of-the-year/">http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/39327/julian-assange-man-of-the-year/ </a></p>

              <p>well mate, in case you haven't noticed, many of the leaders to our north and south are not only in denial, but also petty and bigoted. I mean, just think back to some of the things they've said openly ? About us, about certain races and religions, about the west ?</p>
              <p>And remember a few years back, when our goverment took the unprecendented step of going public with private diplomatic communications with singapore, when najib threatened war with Singapore as m'sian defense minister ?</p>
              <p>Gentlemen borne with great responsibilities are usually not concerned with petty issues of course, but you sure everyone in this game is a gentleman ?</p>
              <p>And true, killing julian assange would not stop wikileaks, because the damage is already done, but isn't that saying he should not be punished just because it's too late to undo what he's done. Don't we punish a criminal, a murderer, say, for his crime ? Or do we say, heck ! We can't unkill the victim ... so, oh well, nevermind, there's no point in punishing the one responsible, eh ? That dick, and those acting with him, must still be punished, regardless. </p>
              <p>We're not Iraq or Afghanistan. So exposing our country's confidential diplomatic maunderings does nothing for the US, or us, except to impede or hinder the people who executes our foreign policy in our country's interest. So it's really just casual mischief or simple malice and bloody-mindedness.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the war files.</p>
              <p>If you think about it too, what good would it do, really ?</p>
              <p>Say for example, one of the cables details a bomb that took out a farmer's hut in afghanistan instead of a bunch of taleban. The US and other allies do care about accidental civvy deaths, not just because it's one of the values that underpins these societies, but also, even if you approach it from a purely operational point of view, it would only push more people towards the side of the group they are trying to defeat.</p>
              <p>And in case anyone forgot, it's the same group that flew two planes into two separate towers and killed a bunch of civilians, deliberately, and started this whole shitfest in the first place, a group with no compunction or considerations for mass killing civilians.</p>
              <p>But that's the effect of these exposes, each one of these pushes more people towards such people, prolonging the war, causing more casualties, more distrust, more hatred, more "clash of civilizations", more people will certainly die. You know that some fundamentalist websites are already linking and mirroring wikileaks ? ...... well done, assange, eh ?</p>

              <p>I'm not protecting Assange. By all means punish him if he acutally did something illegal, but it won't stop the phenomenon and it won't stop espionage. And shouldn't we be putting the blame at the door of <em>the gits we put in power</em> for cover-ups and unjust wars, and <em>not the whistleblowers</em>? Shit will hit the fan sooner or later, but scandals make them happen sooner. Take the case of Enron years ago; it would be ridiculous to blame the auditors for the loss of people's savings and not the accounting failures, wouldn't it? It's the same here if you want to accuse Wikileaks revelations for whatever fallout is to come when politicians already know this stuff through other means.</p>
              <p>Transparency in the decision-making process is lacking in governments and organisations and is vital when we want to make informed decisions. Notice that all these revelations (not just the cables) take place after the fact and do not concern future plans? I think that is fair and haven't gone too far to jeopardise security. Let politicians be petty and terrorists already have a vendetta against everyone else and don't need reasons.</p>
              <p>Will this actually change anything? Rules will be tightened and politicians and businessmen will have to find other ways to get around them. Although everyone gets an idea of what goes on behind the scenes, most of us know that the shady dealings and hypocrisy will continue in some other form.</p>
              <p>The way I see it, you're telling me that Cablegate will throw the world into chaos, as if some kind of fragile peace has been achieved and is going to be shattered. But from my cynical and jaded point of view, that is just a sham. The mistrust and hyporcrisy can't get worse; it's always been that way and will remain as long as humans run the show. Scandals merely open our eyes to what <em>those in power already know</em> and confirm our suspicions <em>as bystanders</em>.</p>

              <p>I'm not protecting Assange. By all means punish him if he
              acutally did something illegal, but it won't stop the phenomenon
              and it won't stop espionage. And shouldn't we be putting the blame
              at the door of <em>the gits we put in power</em> for cover-ups and
              unjust wars, and <em>not the whistleblowers</em>? Shit will hit the
              fan sooner or later, but scandals make them happen sooner. Take the
              case of Enron years ago; it would be ridiculous to blame the
              auditors for the loss of people's savings and not the accounting
              failures, wouldn't it? It's the same here if you want to accuse
              Wikileaks revelations for whatever fallout is to come when
              politicians already know this stuff through other means.</p>
              <p>Transparency in the decision-making process is lacking in
              governments and organisations and is vital when we want to make
              informed decisions. Notice that all these revelations (not just the
              cables) take place after the fact and do not concern future plans?
              I think that is fair and haven't gone too far to jeopardise
              security. Let politicians be petty and terrorists already have a
              vendetta against everyone else and don't need reasons.</p>
              <p>Will this actually change anything? Rules will be tightened and
              politicians and businessmen will have to find other ways to get
              around them. Although everyone gets an idea of what goes on behind
              the scenes, most of us know that the shady dealings and hypocrisy
              will continue in some other form.</p>
              <p>The way I see it, you're telling me that Cablegate will throw
              the world into chaos, as if some kind of fragile peace has been
              achieved and is going to be shattered. But from my cynical and
              jaded point of view, that is just a sham. The mistrust and
              hyporcrisy can't get worse; it's always been that way and will
              remain as long as humans run the show. Scandals merely open our
              eyes to what <em>those in power already know</em> and confirm our
              suspicions <em>as bystanders</em>.</p>

              <p>You'd notice that I'm refering to the things the site has exposed as a whole. I'd agree that the wide variety of things exposed - some examples of injustice, others less clearly so (like Cablegate) - makes it difficult to uphold as a crusader of justice. Hence I do have my reservations because it's hard to tell whose standards of ethics and justice Wikileaks is using, which makes it difficult for us to hold them accountable to what they claim:</p>

              <p>Its ""primary interest is in exposing oppressive regimes in Asia, the former Soviet bloc, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, but we also expect to be of assistance to people of all regions who wish to reveal unethical behaviour in their governments and corporations."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So if it makes public, for instance, Russian plans to stake a claim on oil deposits in the Arctic, and causes people to put pressure on their governments to stop it, that's the sort of situation which would make me a detractor.</p>
              <p>But nevermind the antisocials and the hackers who create the DDoS shitstorm. They are no different from rioters at a demonstration - they'll use any cover to create mischief. I never considered Assange a martyr because that would be giving him too much credit. Though this incident has brought about a lot of ill-will, it's a reminder to authority that they cannot always get away with anything. It also exposes the constructs of authority and makes us examine who we entrust with high-level affairs and how they got there.</p>
              <p>The media are wont to do what they do best, and that is picking out the soundbites to spoonfeed the population and sell more issues. The suspicion that the population had that Anwar was set up has been given further weight. We know what kind of characters the politicians who represent us are and they are just human.</p>
              <p>The Malaysians have their spies in Singapore too and I'm pretty certain of that. Every country partakes espionage and knows that other countries have operatives within their borders - they just don't know where they are. It's a fact that's just been made public yet again. They're calling on us to explain the comments to save their own faces.</p>
              <p>To me, this whole scandal is all about public image and very little of it will compromise actual relations when politicians already don't trust one another's guts. Let them make more rules and devise ways to get around them. Like a sports tournament, the opponent gets more difficult with every victory but he doesn't become invincible. I'm sure that secrecy is never going to be absolute; spies will find their ways to get what they need.</p>
