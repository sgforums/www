            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Gedanken:<br><strong>You're the one who's missed the point.  The fact of the matter is that you've argued your way around a circle and ended up showing that you couldn't reason your way out of a paper bag.<br><br>Now you're throwing in enough red herrings to wreck the Japanese and Norwegian seafood markets in an attempt to hide your screw-up.  You may be of limited enough intellect to miss the forest for the trees, but don't insult the rest of us by assuming we have the same limitation.  You can say that it's contextual usage and piddle on about grammatical accents, but at the end of the day it's still all bullsh!t because you're still wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I will again bring up the key point here.  You started saying that Rhonda was writing in a way that was not natural to Singaporeans, as a way of arguing against elindra's point about fake accents.  I showed how, as a result of Singapore's education system, Rhonda's writing is in fact natural to Singaporeans since that was the way we were taught to write according to the standard school syllabus in Singapore.  Let me put it in short form since you seem to have difficulty concentrating on the salient points:<br><br>[b]YOU ARE WRONG.</strong><br><br>So, don't go trying to distract from the issue with crap like contextual usage and grammatical accents.  Because you're too dumb to realise it, let me tell you in plain English:<br><br><strong>NONE OF YOUR PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL JARGON CHANGES THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRONG</strong><br><br>Don't go trying to tell anyone how clever you are by pulling clever-sounding phrases out of your arse.  In fact, I now have you wrong on a second count:<br><br><strong>YOU SAID SPEAK IN PLAIN ENGLISH, AND NOW YOU'RE BRINGING UP FANCY JARGON TO AVOID ADMITTING YOU'RE WRONG</strong><br><br>The <strong>context</strong> here is the issue of your not recognising your mistake in claiming that Rhonda's writing is unnatural for Singaporeans, even though I've clearly hauled you up on that point.  Instead of recognising the context when it slaps you in the face, you ironically go on a tangent of contextual usage.  Therefore:<br><br><strong>YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO APPLY THE FANCY NONSENSE YOU'RE SPEWING</strong><br><br>I've got no compunction about calling you a hypocrite when the situation calls for it.  You're a hypocrite, and a dumb one at that.<br><br>Don't waste anybody's time trying to sound educated - it doesn't take a whole lot of education to see right through you.  To quote Quint in Jaws, you "don't have the education enough to admit when you're wrong".<br><br>Stop with the rubbish already.  Just answer this simple question: "<strong>Given the way English is taught in Singapore, is Rhonda's writing really unnatural for Singaporeans?</strong>".  A simple yes or no will do, and nothing else you say will count.[/b]</blockquote>I'm not going to bother arguing with your one irrelevant point after another.<br><br>I just want to clarify that to you, "Conversely, speaking Singlish does not a Singaporean make.", is in fact the way Singaporeans in general speak?<br><br>Get your head out of your arse.  It's been there so long.  You can keep arguing about "PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL JARGON" all you want, but the simple fact of the matter is that all that started because you couldn't understand a simple term like grammatical accent and instead chose to pull out your much needed dictionary and give a definition of accent instead.<br><br>If using it in conjuction with grammatical the way I did is what is known as contextual usage, then as simple as that, it is contextual usage.  Now again after first "muddying the point", to use your phrase, by attacking the use of accent in that context, you choose to further muddy it by attacking the term contextual usage by calling it "PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL JARGON"...<br><br>Hypocrite?  Is that the word you used?<br><br>It's easy to call someone dumb and attack them personally, in fact that's the best way to cover up your own stupidity.<br><br>In the same way, it's easy to look down on others for "unnatural accents" or whatever else...</div>
