            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Bloop...:</div><div class="quote_body">I would say that you can add a knack to assume things and take them as fact to your list of egocentric mannerisms, but you've already displayed that to death.<br><br>The mass majority of Singaporeans went to school in Singapore and no,  no one was taught to speak that way. If we pick it up by reading own own books or watching television and had it validated in school... yes.  Taught to speak that way in school no.<br><br>The same way, an American accent is also picked up from watching television and movies which airs in Singapore day after day after day.  So if someone chooses to emulate it, badly or not...  They are just as entitled to do that.<br><br>Anymore insults to add to your badly thought through, pulled out of the air "facts"?</div></blockquote>Bloop, I hate to say this but is trying to be right making you myopic? I'm not trying to substantiate what Ged is trying to say but he was talking about WRITING, not SPEAKING.<br><br>In school, we are taught the Queen's English or whatever you want to call it, with grammar rules, sentence structure etc. Yes you are being taught to write, grammatically correct English.<br><br>We were never taught to speak with an accent in school though the school tries to instill in their pupils to speak grammatically correct english without the elements of singlish in it. That is a fact.<br><br>We are not taught American or British or Aussie slangs nor were we taught the accents. That is picked up from the TV programs etc. Sure, they are entitled to emulate the accent.<br><br>The question now is, "Why do they need to do that when speaking to someone who obviously have difficulty understanding them? Wouldn't the local accent or singlish be a more effective communication tool? Does speaking in a foreign accent to someone who have difficulty comprehending you make one more superior? Or is that just an ego trip?"<br><br>You have successfully misunderstood the initial topic by saying that I'm doing the same thing because I didn't type the title in Singlish  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> and it just when on because it's either you still don't get it, or you don't want to admit that you misunderstood.<br><br>As Lingos so nicely put it across on page 1,"I  think there is a distinction between proper english and putting on a facade."<br><br>By the way, I have nothing against a foreign sounding accent. I have friends with foreign sounding accents as well but I'm cool with it because that is how they speak all the time and they don't switch around or lose it mid-speech.<br><br>Anyway, I think this topic has gone far enough. It is closed and if there is any unhappiness, just start a new thread.<br><br>As for Ged and Gaz, both of you act like 2 kids fighting all the time when you're near each other  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Just chill out guys  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Let's just say that both of you have your differences and you're like oil and water  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Both of you just don't mix!!! (PS. Your arguments are wayyyyyyyyyy out of tangent here!!! Geddy what are you thinking???)<br><br>I don't care what Gaz says or do here as long as he leaves me alone irl <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
