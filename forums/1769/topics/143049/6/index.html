            <div class='col-md body'>Some Singaporeans do perceive the American or English accent/influence as superior.  My mom's one of them LOL.    It is a societal problem, partly brought on by government but perhaps also from our colonial past.  I think it's difficult to shake off the societal inferior complex.<br><br>There's no need for this faux-accent pretense, but sometimes it just slips out subconsciously.  You can't remain totally unaffected by the foreign media influence around you.  Some phrases, slangs and accents get absorbed and occassionally it slips out in your daily conversations, even if you don't intend it to.<br><br>As for the accusation of the bombastic application of language in this forum's discourses... hahaha all I can say is, whatever you read here is not a deliberate act.<br><br>As long as the content is comprehensible, I like that everyone writes in their own unique way.  It's what makes you, you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at Elindra's story, I rem that i encountered one even more extreme case.<br><br>At a kopitiam, the auntie was taking orders for drinks. So she was saying, "Xiao jie, ni yao shen me." Usually, it's common courtesy to reply back in the same language rite.. But this lady, purposely, Die-Die also want to speak in English.. somemore her English is cannot make it one loh!!<br><br>"Wah, Tolay, wea-ler veli.. erm.. jialat horr. Arr, I want that b*tch one." the kopi-soh looked stunned. "Aiyah! There.. that pink colur, pink colour one." Points to Peach Tea. "Ice small small can."<br><br>When the kopi-soh was gone, she turned to her other relatives at the table and started to speak in Hokkien.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .. please loh.. think she was just trying to show that she is higher class than the kopi-soh just becos she knows a little In-ger-lish, but she doesn't know she's just making a fool of herself.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been living overseas around 8 years.. tho its quite long, I never or thought of changing my accent..unlike others. I really deteste people who try to be bananas or potatoes. I mean, why cant they be proud of their culture? I dont like to hang out with these kind of people who try to show off or pretend to be something they not. Dont they realise no matter how hard they try they will still look and remain Asian..not a westerner. But I dont mind people who have asian parents but was born and bred overseas as a result, they acquire the western accent.</div>

Accents are nothing more than different speech intonations.  What all of you perceive to be "accent free" English is heavily accented to another person.<br><br>What makes one manner of speach "accented" and another not, is just what you've grown accustomed to hearing day to day.  In the same way, grammar can also be accented when used out of the usual manner in a country/city/town/etc.<br><br>Eg.  You tell a small town American audience that you're taking two days "holiday" next week and see what they tell you.   Or if you see a sign saying, "The funniest ride on the boardwalk", in Sweden, don't expect to be laughing when you're on it.<br><br>So for all of you to be pointing at other peoples speech patterns, be it consitent or otherwise, while using a manner of English not consistent with that of the majority of the English speaking population in Singapore...<br><br>...fill in the rest yourself.</div>

Well and good if that's the case, but I think some people here are taking you more seriously than you intended and that's causing some problems.  Would it be fair to recommend that they take all of this as just a bit of play fighting?<br><br></div></blockquote>..but you're also right that I'm not taking this seriously.  What do I care?
