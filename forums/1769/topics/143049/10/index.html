I tend to vary my english depending on who i speak to. I don't have any accent... if anything I speak with a singaporean accent.<br><br>But when i speak to my US colleagues, I will tend to be more accurate and articulate my words better and not to use local terms like "MC", "shiok" etc etc....<br><br>Not because I want to "suck up" to them, but we have to communicate with them and make sure they understand what we are saying.....<br><br>When I was in the US and Ireland working , esp Ireland, i noticed something.... when the "engineers" speak to the singaporeans they will slow down and their english sound very correct. but when the same engineers talk amongst themselves there is a very thick irish accent which sometimes we sporeans cannot understand....<br><br>But if you speak to like the operators lower level people, we find that they are unable to "vary" their accents and can only talk in a Irish way.<br><br>Similarly for singaporeans, if you are relatively educated, you SHOULD vary the way you speak depending on who you are speaking to and ensure that the other party understand....<br><br></div>

Si beh cheem sia! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>OK, if you want to play the "let's make up clever sounding phrases" game, we could have some fun with that.  Hell, I'll throw in some alliterations, just to make it a bit more fun.<br><br>First of all, it's not a case of us being know-it-alls - it's a case of you wading in here with your "postmodernist pontifications", trying to apply a frame of reference that is entirely inappropriate.  That's the problem with postmodernism - too often it's used as a fancy excuse for "I can do whatever I bloody well please".<br><br>Despite it being pointed out to you that you're way off the mark, instead of employing any "intellectual integrity", you instead developed a case of "didactic diarrhoea" and went on a "jargonistic junket", backtracking on your initial plea to speak plain English.<br><br>The problem is that, while Rhonda could handle writing in non-plain form, you've gotten too clever for yourself and instead made youself look stupid with some nonsensical term.  Whoops - did you figure that everybody would be too dazzled by your "vocabularic voluminosity" to notice that you were spewing crap?<br><br>Tough luck, Tiger - on a daily basis, I wade through tons of jargon-filled piffle to get to the simple points that some eggheads are trying to make, and what may sound clever to you is in fact nothing more than a tissue-thin covering for an argument which is so full of holes it would make a teabag look like a submarine.<br><br>To summarise, your "demagogical desires" have fallen flat on this forum, not because we are a bunch of know-it-alls, but because of your "sagacious shortcomings".  Deal with it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote>See?  Exactly what I meant.  You know everything... yet you don't know that Contextual Usage is an actual term, and if you don't know it, that means it's, what did you call it again?  "Jargonistic junket" and "Didactic diarrhoea" ?<br><br>Maybe you need to let the rest of the English speaking world know this too.<br><br>Before you do that though, at least learn what a catch-phrase actually is.   You may be able to fool some people here by trying to dodge around, and instead on focusing on the messages, you try to distract by showing that you only know how to use the word "accent" as it appears in your dictionary (what's that bit again about muddying the point?).. but ultimately if you can't admit, even to yourself, that there is more to language, any language, than what you already know. Then now knowing that something like Contextual Usage actually exists, that's the least of your problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're the one who's missed the point.  The fact of the matter is that you've argued your way around a circle and ended up showing that you couldn't reason your way out of a paper bag.<br><br>Now you're throwing in enough red herrings to wreck the Japanese and Norwegian seafood markets in an attempt to hide your screw-up.  You may be of limited enough intellect to miss the forest for the trees, but don't insult the rest of us by assuming we have the same limitation.  You can say that it's contextual usage and piddle on about grammatical accents, but at the end of the day it's still all bullsh!t because you're still wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I will again bring up the key point here.  You started saying that Rhonda was writing in a way that was not natural to Singaporeans, as a way of arguing against elindra's point about fake accents.  I showed how, as a result of Singapore's education system, Rhonda's writing is in fact natural to Singaporeans since that was the way we were taught to write according to the standard school syllabus in Singapore.  Let me put it in short form since you seem to have difficulty concentrating on the salient points:<br><br><strong>YOU ARE WRONG.</strong><br><br>So, don't go trying to distract from the issue with crap like contextual usage and grammatical accents.  Because you're too dumb to realise it, let me tell you in plain English:<br><br><strong>NONE OF YOUR PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL JARGON CHANGES THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRONG</strong><br><br>Don't go trying to tell anyone how clever you are by pulling clever-sounding phrases out of your arse.  In fact, I now have you wrong on a second count:<br><br><strong>YOU SAID SPEAK IN PLAIN ENGLISH, AND NOW YOU'RE BRINGING UP FANCY JARGON TO AVOID ADMITTING YOU'RE WRONG</strong><br><br>The <strong>context</strong> here is the issue of your not recognising your mistake in claiming that Rhonda's writing is unnatural for Singaporeans, even though I've clearly hauled you up on that point.  Instead of recognising the context when it slaps you in the face, you ironically go on a tangent of contextual usage.  Therefore:<br><br><strong>YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO APPLY THE FANCY NONSENSE YOU'RE SPEWING</strong><br><br>I've got no compunction about calling you a hypocrite when the situation calls for it.  You're a hypocrite, and a dumb one at that.<br><br>Don't waste anybody's time trying to sound educated - it doesn't take a whole lot of education to see right through you.  To quote Quint in Jaws, you "don't have the education enough to admit when you're wrong".<br><br>Stop with the rubbish already.  Just answer this simple question: "<strong>Given the way English is taught in Singapore, is Rhonda's writing really unnatural for Singaporeans?</strong>".  A simple yes or no will do, and nothing else you say will count.</div>
