            <div class='col-md body'>Just the thought that crossed my mind today as I was queuing up at the Deli counter at Jason's Supermarket today.<br><br>Girl in front of me was speaking to the aunty at the deli counter in what I call a deliberate American accented English. I thought she sounded pretty unnatural but didn't want to read too much into things. Then, her friend came up and spoke to her and the words that came out was in our local accent!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I mean seriously, yeah, you're in an upmarket supermarket but do you have to speak with a foreign accent to buy your items.<br><br>I wonder if it is because others around will have the perception that she is of a "higher class" or is it due to low self-esteem trying to fit in with the "well-heeled" crowd?<br><br>Seriously there are just too many examples to quote.<br><br>Sometimes I wonder if it is a societal problem in the sense that our own government is so "wayang"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Latest example would be the NKF fiasco which they are trying to kick in  the damage control.<br><br>Or is it because Singapore is such a young nation and the policies have been switching around that we do not have a really unique identity that we can identify ourselves with?</div>

Usually the insecure ones.. but nobody else over here does it. hahah.. I think it's more of an "inferiority" complex that developed in our country. That westernised is good.. chinkiness is deemed as inferior. Might be the colonial bastardisation days or the fact that western media has always been copied in our youth culture. Might also be the fact that expats hold the majority of high ranking positions in Singapore therefore... there's that love/hate relationship going on.</div>

I do work with a large number of mainland Chinese and other foreigners and yes, they do work hard to improve their language skills.  Out of a sheer desire to learn / improve, they frequently come up to me to clarify English grammar, ask me to teach them how to improve their reports, etc.  They exhibit a hunger to learn that is sadly, not reflected in the locals.  We're not just lackadaisical, we're becoming too laid-back and content with our lot.  We're sitting on our laurels, thinking that we'll always maintain our economic position in this region, forgetting that our neighbours are slowly but surely, catching up on us.<br><br>I do worry a lot about the appalling English standards amongst the younger generation.  I think we've discussed this issue in previous threads.  There's too much rampant complacency and sadly, there seems to be a sort of misplaced pride in using 'bad' English.<br><br></div>
