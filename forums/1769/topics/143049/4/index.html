            <div class='col-md body'>allow my 2 cents worth on this issue.<br>*puts on fire-resistant armour to protect myself from Flaming*<br><br>At my work place, I work with Ang Mo's, Indians and Chinese.<br>- When speaking with the Ang Mo's, I found it so difficult to stamp out the Lah's and the Leh's, and in doing so, i seriously feel like Jackie Chan in his first English movie- someone who barely knows english.<br><br>- When I spoke with the Indians, they barely understood the English that was coming out from my mouth! Not that I understood them well either.. but the fact was that- even with their heavy accent and their head shaking (  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  ). They were speaking in grammatically correct sentences. So who says that you must speak like a British to be grammatically correct?<br><br>- When speaking with the Chinese (in Mandarin), I realise that we are so used to adding English or Singlish into our Mandarin. The China Chinese who are working here have learned to adapt to our style. But if you need to do biz in China, who will bother to adapt to you?<br><br>I'm sure i'm not the only singaporean that faces this. People just don't want to admit that <strong>on a macro level, our linguistic aptitude here in singapore (both Mandarin and English) is simply ATROCIOUS.</strong><br><br>When the government steps in to say that it is becoming a problem, SG-reans just love to complain and say that the government is trying to erode our identity, propaganda, etc., etc...  and undermine all the good intentions.<br><br>There's nothing wrong in using Singlish. if you look at my other posts, u'll find me using them all the time. But when the time comes, where you need to step up to the world stage and do a proper presentation.. Are you sure, with the standard of English you are so used to, you will be up to it?<br></div>

People just don't want to admit that <strong>on a macro level, our linguistic aptitude here in singapore (both Mandarin and English) is simply ATROCIOUS.</strong></blockquote>I feel that part of our linguistic problem is due to the compulsory learning of both English and mother-tongue. I can't speak for the Malays and Indians, but most Chinese who prefer their mother-tongue tend to think in Mandarin, before translating their sentences into English. If you think about the sentence structure of Singlish, you will see what I mean.<br><br>I come from a school where almost everyone speaks English. The problem with the students is that the majority has very poor grades for second language. People like me think of a sentence in English, then translate it into Mandarin.<br><br>Classic case of 'you can't have your cake and eat it'.<br><br><blockquote>When the government steps in to say that it is becoming a problem, SG-reans just love to complain and say that the government is trying to erode our identity, propaganda, etc., etc...  and undermine all the good intentions. </blockquote>I have no problems if the government sees a potential problem and acknowledges it. But when the root of the problem is caused by a policy of their own design (in my opinion), I should have the right to be sceptical.<br><br>I also disagree that their current stance of using rap and hip hop to better our mastery of English, and the use of English to facilitate the teaching of Mandarin is a step forward.</div>
