You don't know as much about  English, or language in general, as you try to make it seem you do.<br><br>I'm not going to bother explaining to you what a "grammatical accent" is.<br><br>I suppose if someone told you that they are on a "financial diet", you're going to pull dictionary definitions and tell them it makes no sense either?<br><br>Yeah... you're SO far ahead...  </div></blockquote>Oh, I see!  You're one of those "let's pick up the latest catch-phrase neologisms sort"!  It's hilarious how you're trying to recover from having your bluff called by questioning my knowledge of English, to the point of desperately citing another neologism like "financial diet". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> BTW, the last time someone questioned my credentials on the forum, he ended up with egg on his face because he only proved that I am exactly who I say I am.  Take the risk if you want to, but you're just going to end up proving how dumb everybody knows you to be already.<br><br>No, you're right, please don't bother defining anything - I already know you're the sort to fall for any nonsensical phrase, as long as you imagine it makes you sound half intelligent.  Besides, it's because you can't provide a definition that's not going to make you look even dumber than you are, not that you're not going to bother.  It's OK - I'll let you off the hook here - this is embarrassing enough for you as it is.<br><br>I don't know what kind of snake-oil-sales circles you move in, but if you're going to try and convince me of anything, making things up on the fly is the worst way to go because I'm going to call your bluff every time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lemme give you a bit of a heads-up, booster - I've chewed up and spat out more than enough undergrads who've tried to get your brand of crap past me.  You look to me like one of those who slithers their way past the pass line and then has a big party at graduation like it was some achievement.  So yeah, I'm so far ahead, and I've seen plenty of your sort.  I'm here to keep you honest.<br><br>You're bullsh!tting, and you and I both know it, so don't go acting indignant when the proper response is to be ashamed instead.</div>

It shouldn't offend you because that is your accent. My gripe here is why put on the pretense on having a foreign accent when you do not?<br><br>Anyway, you're not there. So should I have recorded the whole incident and post it here to show how darn funny it is when someone tries to impress god-knows-who???

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, back to your original topic, Elindra!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think I've seen similar scenarios to the one you described, where someone puts on some fake accent to gain a 'one-up' on someone else.  The accent was put on to accentuate the perceived difference in class, complimenting the speaker's hoity-toity attitude.  Yeah, seen it before.<br><br>I have friends who grew up overseas and they ended up picking up the accent of the place where they grew up in.  Now, it's authentic when you don't trip over your 'R's and 'S's and 'T's because if you listen to enough fakers, you realise that they end up adding consonents to the ends of words where there shouldn't be any, and they use their S's and all that excessively.  Some don't fake too good!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I enjoy listening to different accents, it makes life interesting, but, I only enjoy listening to authentically-acquired accents.  If you grew up in Boston, no one can chide you for having a Bostonian accent.  However, if you've only been there for a month and you return home with a Boston accent, then, that's really questionable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  And putting on that accent certainly does not improve nor accentuate your communication skills with the locals, especially with that poor auntie working behind the counter.<br><br>I had a friend who left to study in Australia right after our 'A' levels.  He returned after three years there, with a heavy Aussie accent.  Basically, I told him, 'Hey, look... you grew up here!  You spent the first 19 years of your life here, and you only spent three years in Australia... and you're telling me that you have entirely forgotten your native accent??!!'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  So the guy gave me a really sheepish look and we got back to talking, sans that fake, acquired accent.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Elindra, I guess your thread touched a raw nerve in our dear errant friend here... he confessed to putting on various accents, remember?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I'm sure it was definitely not to communicate with the tourists here in order to promote our tourism industry, I'm sure of it.  Now, I wonder why he'd have the need to, say, put on a fake Texan accent right in our local heartlands?  My, to do exactly what the lady you were criticising was doing!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And he also made us realise that we ought to be ashamed of minding our grammar when we post, because tsk! tsk! all who observe grammar rules are 'GrammEr Elitists'!  I guess, there's only one person here who has a standard of English soooo superior, that he has the audacity to criticise everyone else's.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  And woe be to you if you should use 'bombastic' words that probably necessitates a search in some online dictionary for our dear chap here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  We should be more 'reader-friendly', and be mindful of who's reading our posts, and adjust our writing level appropriately mah!  Otherwise, some people will have difficulty understanding our posts and keep missing the point wor!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everyone else is committing grand mistakes in English and communication, save for one very enlightened soul mah!  He's the only one allowed to put on his arsenal of fake accents, and criticise everyone else's English, because he's the smartest nincompoop to have ever walked the face of earth, see?
