            <div class='col-md body'>I've always frowned upon the government's efforts to wipe out Singlish.<br><br>Singlish is something which naturally evolved out of the efforts of the various races of our society to integrate and get to know each other. As a young nation with a relatively short history, we don't have much of an identity, Singlish is one of the few things that defines who we are. If anything, it is one of the few things that make us truly, uniquely, Singaporean.<br><br>The government's efforts to discourage Singlish has helped to reinforce the perception in some people that the only way to speak 'good' English is by speaking it with a foreign accent. I remember reading parents who send their children to special English language courses demanding that their children be taught to speak with a foreign accent.<br><br>Sheesh... have we dropped so low as to think that our own local accent is inferior? Not everything from the West is good, alright.<br><br>Still, do not glibly assume that all locals who speak with a foreign accent are all faking it. Trust me, some of them are not. I should know. I'm mixed Indian and Malay. Somehow, after my voice broke at puberty, I developed a Brit-like accent. I know I'm not faking it, cos my brother has my voice, and both my sisters have slight accents in their voices as well.<br><br>Quite a number of people shunned me back in Sec 3 just because of my voice... it took months before they finally woke up their bloody ideas.</div>

I think it's awesome that you are keen to learn how to pronounce different languages the way natives would.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  That's something we should all work towards.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Way to go!<br><br>I guess there's a distinction between trying to speak a language well, and faking an accent.  People who try to fake an American accent usually end up tripping over their tongues and putting in 's's where there shouldn't be.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   It's quite easy to tell, really.  I'm sure elindra bumped into one of those 'wannabe's' just now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All said, sometimes, it's necessary for us to 'adopt' an accent so that we can make ourselves understood.  In my previous jobs, whenever I spoke in my locally-accented English, my American bosses and colleagues would keep on going, 'Pardon me?', 'Would you care to repeat that, please?' until I got fed-up one day and started to 'adopt' their accent and voila!... they understood me perfectly!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I found that pretty amusing and nowadays, in my current workplace, whenever we come across a local who's trying to appear 'posh' and do the 'one up' on us by faking an accent, my colleagues will come get me and I'll speak to him/her with an accent back!  The war of the accents, fake accent meets fake accent, with my colleagues nearby, trying very very hard not to giggle.  Usually, the other party gets the message and stops faking it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
