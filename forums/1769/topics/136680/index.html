            <div class='col-md body'>Chris and I had a recent bad experience with a retailer on their installment program. (I think Rhonda's ears must be red and sore from all the complaining I did to her)<br><br>Now, they have been advertising their installment program as having<br>"Maximum Credit up to 8X your salary"<br><strong>"It's one-time pre-approved credit limit"</strong><br><br>Besides that, they advertised (yes you can even see if off their webpage), additional perks like<br><strong>"Hassle-free, one time approval"<br>"No need to reapply with subsequent purchases"</strong><br>"No home ownership required"<br>"No minimum income needed"<br>"Up to 60 months to pay"<br><br>Since some months back, we bought our TV and entertainment system from them, and we were automatically added to their Ready Credit program and they even gave us a card for it.<br><br>Now, what does the average consumer understand from "One-time Pre-Approved Credit Limit"? We read it as pre-approved credit limit which we can use and pay on instalment basis, something like a credit card, but only with the store, and we do not need to have to face and deal with approvals on whether we can buy the product via instalment and go back another day to collect the item we want to purchase with the "No need to reapply with subsequent purchases"<br><br>Anyhow, the 2nd time we made a purchase,  it was to buy the iPhoto and a digital camera. We thought we could collect the item immediately but the sales person advised that she needs approval from their credit officer before she can hand us the goods, as we were down late that day, we agreed to go back the next day to collect our items.<br><br>However, the sales person called back the next day telling me that she can't get it approved as "the credit officer cannot reach anyone at the office" I said that it is a Sunday, so how does she even expect to reach anyone. I said that what I understand is that this is supposed to make life easy for the consumer, and if this is the case, I should have paid with my credit card, which has 0% instalment ANYWAY and I earn points. To add insult to injury, the reason why the credit officer won't approve was because they had to check if Chris still had a job!<br><br>I understand if the company have to make periodic checks on the customer's financial standing but we bought this in slightly over 2 months and for our first purchase, we are paying much more per month than the required instalment amount. I really question the company's ad which they have been pushing and advertising so aggressively because they are advertising one thing, practising another. The company should have an understanding of a customer's payment history, and not inconvinencing the customer by having checks with every purchase.<br><br>If this Ready Credit Card given cannot act like a credit card, they might as well make customers reapply with every purchase since this is exactly what they are doing now, since we have to reproduce our IC again for the purchase.<br><br>What I find amazing is how the customer service (yes we wrote in a lengthy letter about their advertisements and the actual delivery) has no better explaination than a standard bureucractic reply that it is their SOP to check on all purchases, which really goes back to the point of "WHY ADVERTISE THAT IT IS HASSLE FREE AND A ONE TIME THING" if you are going to check EVERYTHING from scratch anyways, without taking into consideration the payment history and such!<br><br>Anyway, we won't be buying anything from this retail chain again.</div>
