              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen ordered fresh troops
                  to the border with an ultimatum to Thailand: Pull military forces back
                  today or the border will become a "life and death battle zone".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Hun
                  Sen told reporters in Phnom Penh that he had warned Thailand's visiting
                  Foreign Minister Sompong Amornvivat that without a quick pullout, Thai
                  soldiers could face being fired upon by Cambodian troops in
                  "large-scale armed conflict". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"If they cannot withdraw tonight, they must withdraw tomorrow," said Hun Sen. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"We have tried to be patient, but I told the Thai foreign minister today that the area is a life-and-death battle zone." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">His comments came after talks with Mr Sompong in Phnom Penh. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mr Sompong also met with his counterpart Hor
                  Namhong in a bid to resolve the dispute over the area near the ancient
                  Preah Vihear temple. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Cambodian foreign minister said yesterday's
                  talks failed to end in agreement because his Thai opposite number
                  "could not sign anything". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Hun Sen and Hor Namhong both told reporters that
                  Cambodia could choose to take the border dispute before an
                  international court if it was not resolved soon. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The comments made by the Cambodian prime minister
                  and foreign minister surprised Mr Sompong and Thai officials, who were
                  adamant that the meetings had not been a failure. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mr Sompong said the tone during the meetings
                  between the two countries had been different as the Cambodian leaders
                  agreed that both sides had to be patient in resolving the border spat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said no Thai troop withdrawals would be made
                  from the 4.6 sq km overlapping area between Kantharalak district in Si
                  Sa Ket and Preah Vihear province of Cambodia until the dispute over
                  ownership is cleared through negotiations in the Joint Boundary
                  Commission that was set up to demarcate the land border. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Thailand reiterated its ownership over the area,
                  Mr Sompong said in Bangkok and rushed to report the talks to Prime
                  Minister Somchai Wongsawat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Suranaree Task Force commander Maj-Gen Kanok
                  Netrakavaesana will hold talks with his Cambodian counterpart tomorrow
                  on the border issues and the Thai and Cambodian defence ministers will
                  meet next Tuesday , according to Mr Sompong. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Cambodian Deputy Defence Minister Gen Neang Phat
                  said more Cambodian troops were heading to the area after up to 500
                  Thai soldiers had tried to cross the border near an ancient Hindu
                  temple that is claimed by both countries. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"We are building up our troops at the border in response to Thailand, but I cannot reveal the number," he told reporters. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Maj-Gen Srey Deok, who oversees the Cambodian
                  military in the disputed area, said: "Thai troops have already entered
                  the area. They are confronting our troops." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But Maj-Gen Kanok denied that more troops had been sent to the disputed area near the Preah Vihear temple. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Thailand and Cambodia have 10 soldiers each at
                  the Keo Sikha Kiri Svara pagoda near the Preah Vihear temple and 45
                  around the compound on joint patrol, according to the agreement between
                  the two countries to ease border tension. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The two countries also have back-up troops near the border. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The number of soldiers there remained unchanged, Maj-Gen Kanok said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Maj-Gen Kanok slammed Cambodia for distorting
                  information and taking advantage of the political crisis in Thailand to
                  launch an offensive move for its own political benefit. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Suranaree chief, his patience wearing thin,
                  called for a quick solution to the border spat and a clear direction to
                  be provided by the government as it could become an armed conflict if
                  it was left unsettled. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"I want the government to solve this problem and
                  make it clear what to do. If it is left this way, nobody knows what is
                  going to happen," he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia first
                  flared in July after the Preah Vihear temple was awarded World Heritage
                  status by the World Heritage Committee. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The International Court of Justice ruled in 1962
                  that the temple belongs to Cambodia, but the surrounding land remains
                  in dispute. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tensions escalated into a military confrontation in which up to 1,000 Cambodian and Thai troops faced off for six weeks. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The two countries have swapped accusations of violating each other's territory in the dispute.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">(with Agency reports)</span></p>
