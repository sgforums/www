              <p>Just talked to my prof..... he'll be leaving in January. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>He laid out the options for my future, and they are:</p>
              <p><strong>1. Continue with my project and find a new supervisor who's willing and able to take it up.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2. Abandon this project totally. Find a new supervisor and a totally new project.</strong></p>
              <p>My preference is (1). I really like the project that I'm doing, and it's totally relevant to what I'll be doing in the future when I work at the environment ministry. And my prof did say that even in his new uni, he can still act as a secondary supervisor - and he might even be able to bring me over to work with him for a few months.</p>
              <p>But the difficult part is finding a primary supervisor who's willing to take me on (and works in this research field). I need one good professor who's physically at NUS who can do this. And the hard part is.... many of the profs don't work in this field, and many of them have quite a lot of postgrads under them already anyway.</p>
              <p>Going for (2) is the easy way out...... but then it would mean having to totally abandon one semester of work! Even the modules that I'm taking this semester would go to waste because they're actually cross-departmental modules which are relevant only to my research!</p>

              <p>Huh.... but I want to do my current project leh..... I like what
              I'm doing!</p>
              <p>I need to go for option (1) in that case, and pray that I can
              find a suitable prof to replace my outgoing prof. It's finding a
              suitable prof that will be difficult.... my outgoing prof is the
              only one who's really good at my field of research. The other profs
              are all specialists in their own fields which are only somewhat
              related to mine. So I cannot be assured of proper support.</p>
              <p>If I were to take option (2), all my current work will go down
              the drain. But then I can at least be assured that I have adequate
              support from above for the next 3 1/2 years, because I know that my
              next supervisor will be good at whatever project I'll be doing. And
              as my outgoing prof has pointed out, losing 1/2 year of work is
              better than having inadequate support for the next 3 1/2 years.</p>
              <p>Arrrgh... dilemma..... dilemma..... I have a headache....

              <p>I would go for Option 1.. its really a waste of half a semester if you change now. Why don't you ask your prof to suggest other profs in the related field to take u in? I'm sure your prof will know the other related profs well ....</p>
