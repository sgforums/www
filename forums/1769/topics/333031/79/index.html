              <p>That's the problem.  We can't relocate possums.  Even if we trapped the possum, it has to be released within 50-100m.  This is because possums are territorial so they will not survive if being relocated.</p>

              <p>From <a href="http://www.insanepoly.com/">http://www.insanepoly.com/</a> :</p>
              <h3 id="post-572" class="entrytitle"><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.insanepoly.com/blog/?p=572"><span style="color: #ffffff;">The Age of Greed</span></a></h3>
              <div class="entrybody">
              <p>It seems like ages since the last time I wrote something in this blog. It’s not that there’s nothing to write about, but the times we are living in seems so depressing that I guess I’d rather play Warhammer than write something that will only make me angry.</p>
              <p>This is the age of greed that we’re living in. Everything that is wrong with the world is the result of greed. Money is not the root of evil, rather it is the love of money that is the root of all evil. Environment devastation, melamine in dairy products, the collapse of gigantic financial institutions and the relentless hikes that we Singaporeans have to bear with on a seemingly monthly basis- it’s all the result of greed.</p>
              <p>I think the age of greed was officially inaugurated the moment Gordon Gekko uttered the immortal phrase- “Greed is good” in the movie Wall Street. Whereas greed used to be part of the seven deadly sins, these days it seems more like the defining characteristic of the business and political elites. Everywhere you see, it seems like only the greediest motherfuckers will make it to the top. Bank CEOs, Presidents, Prime Ministers and hell, even CEOs of charity organizations. You couldn’t swing a dead cat without it hitting some greedy fucker these days.</p>
              <p>I am tired of it.</p>
              <p>I am tired because my country seems to be governed by the principle of greed. How else do you explain the rounds and rounds of pay increment for our millionaire politicians while the income of the middle and lower classes stagnate. How else do you explain the rounds and rounds of price hikes we have to endure- in good times or bad times by our GLCs while they post yearly record profits.</p>
              <p>In our parliamentary sessions, the only one who seemed to care about the poor is Lily Neo- who has to shout just get the rest of her compatriots to hear her out. Contrast their disinterest with that of their passionate arguments for more ministerial fair hikes.</p>
              <p>Greed is inherent in all men in varying degree. Nobody starts a business without wanting to make a handsome profit. I can accept that. But sometimes the profit motive can get out of control and that is the time when we need the government to step in to regulate businesses so that it don’t get out of control. But here in Singapore, where we have the same small group of people incharge of both politics and big businesses, when push comes to shove, how certain are we, that the politicians will stand on the side of the people.</p>
              <p>Thus far, I’ve yet to see one person stand up in parliament and speak against these prices hikes and fair hikes. Instead what we have is them speaking in favour of and justifying those hikes. Forgive me for naively thinking these politicians are supposed to be working for my welfare.</p>
              <p>Here we have so-called union “leaders” telling us pay increases is not the answer to inflation and their increasing the pay of the lower classes will only lead to more inflationary pressures. Meanwhile state owned and controlled power companies with billion dollar profits are allowed to increase their electricity tariffs by a whopping 21%. Not content, the public transportation companies and telecommunication companies are also following suit.</p>
              <p>So pardon me, while I take one minute to process this- so all these hikes are not going to lead to even more inflationary pressures?</p>
              <p>F.U.C.K. Y.O.U</p>
              <p>So we are expected to cope with this by cutting back on our expenses? And what are those who already have nothing to cut back on? Instead of eating, so we should be just drinking water from off the tap for our daily nutritional needs?</p>
              <p>Double F.U.C.K. Y.O.U</p>
              <p>The “leaders” of this country have but one goal- that is to increase the national reserves and if we the people have to pay through the nose, with our blood and sweat, so be it. Nobody fucking knows, what the fuck the reserves is for, who is for or even how much we have. Instead, the mythical answer is given- it’s for the day when Singapore needs it.</p>
              <p>How bailing out failing foreign banks can be equated to Singapore needing it is never fully or adequately explained. Instead we are suppose to trust in their fucking wisdom.</p>
              <p>F.U.C.K. T.H.EM.</p>
              <p>Nothing they have done have convinces me they work for the welfare and interest of this country.</p>
              <p>No.</p>
              <p>The are just greedy fuckers. And in the age of greed, it will be the greediest of the greedy that will rule. And so rule they will- much to the detriment of all.</p>

              <p>i have to spend a huge wad of time today explaining away a bunch of things she caused.. and i have to spend the morning rushing out a delivery of the things she promised.. and i have to make a delivery another day of things we do not have to a bunch of people who would rather not have the things..</p>
              <p>all that in the midst of a project which should not be mine, snagged by my lunatic boss and then placed in black and white on my portfolio.. and in that project, i am the lowest rank, and i have to boss around people in the senile management.. and those who are most uncooperative are those who always pull rank...</p>
