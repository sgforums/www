              <p>I think all of us are facing concerns about rising costs whilst disposable income remains the same and the buying power of the dollar is driven downwards.  </p>
              <p>Therefore, why not give vent and discuss about the issue?  There are things about inflation I do not understand well, and perhaps, can learn from those of you who are well-versed in Economics.  I know in Club 30, there are peeps like Bear, Fatum, elindra, Gedanken, etc etc who are knowledgeable and will be able to provide insight. </p>
              <p>Anything and everything with regards to inflation, let's discuss it here.  Hopefully, we'll all become wiser on the topic at the end of the day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I'll start the ball rolling with a letter printed in the forum section of The Herald Sun in Melbourne on Mon, 25 Feb 2008.  It touched on a number of points that apply to Singapore too :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Get Serious About Savings</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"If the Govt is serious about cutting inflation, it will stop giving away so much money and make people responsible for their own lives.</span></p>
              <p>"There are a number of stregies which could be employed toward this end.</p>
              <p>"The first-homeowner grant should be a sliding scale conditional on the amount prospective buyers save towards a deposit. This would cut spending and encourage saving.</p>
              <p>"The baby bonus should be paid over a number of years as kindergarten and school fees to prevent it being wasted on holidays or the pokies.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"Interest-free periods offered by retailers should be outlawed, so we return to the days of not spending money until we actually have it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"While it doesn't apply to everyone, many young people have never taken responsibility for their financial welfare because there is always easy money being offered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"It is time ot learn a little restraint,</span> and the benefits will be evident in the future. "</p>

              <p>i look at Zimbabwe and i'm thankful for the 7% inflation... instead of the 100,000% inflation (and i think that's a monthly number) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>we don't just face inflation in Singapore ... we are also facing deflation .....</p>

              <p>I

              <p>the point isn't really about rising food costs ... the

              that they have to start making do with less on their existing wages
              .... because they know the lower middle classes are already up against
              the wall, and something has to give ? .... because all the fat's already been cut out, and you'd now have to start on the meat ? ....</p>
              <p>my father's ITE
              graduates are now looking at wages barely nudging past the thousand
              dollar mark .... and I have no idea what the poly people are getting nowadays when my indonesian friend got a job here on a 2k salary with a good BSc .....</p>
              <p>a thousand dollars .... a few years ago ITE grads were getting 1.3-1.5 ..... what has happened ? ... that wages are not even keeping up with inflation, but sliding backwards ? ....</p>

              <p>Dunno... but maybe, that's what happens when wages are determined by free market forces?  I think in Singapore, there isn't any guaranteed minimum wage for any one profession?  I do remember sifting through SNEF's (Singapore National Employers Federation) guidelines back when I worked in Human Resources and I recall seeing Min, Max, and Mean wages for various professions in various industries, but there was never a guaranteed minimum wage declaration. </p>
              <p>My understanding of economics is rudimentary, but I do have a question - if the Govt starts to impose minimum wages on the major professions and industries, won't that, in turn, exert an inflationary pressure on businesses?  Already, businesses face inflation in the cost of raw materials, essential services, taxes, etc.  To also face sudden rising costs in wages as well might be the straw that breaks the camel's back. </p>
              <p>In such circumstances, is it better to be employed for less, or not to be employed at all?   Given, the good times are over and we are now in bad times.  Back in the '80's, when we were hit with recession, the worry on everyone's minds was whether or not they'll be able to keep their jobs.  Now, in the US, although they are not officially admitting it, a huge percentile of Americans surveyed by CNN believe that they are now in recession.  I believe there are people who are losing their jobs, or facing reduced salaries over there, as a direct result of having their working hours cut, or benefits taken away. </p>
              <p>Times like this, is not the time to question why there's so little, but rather, to just bite the bullet, get on with making ends meet, and know that bad times won't be forever. </p>

              <p>you know ... if we speak purely in terms of economics alone, then yes, there's no contest ... every single marco econs prof would tell you the same thing .... but, as one of my former profs said, economics cannot exist political and social considerations ....</p>
              <p>we are a country ... we cannot be run as a business ... costs to businesses is but one side of the story ... yes, Singapore is a tiny island state, which will forever be swayed by outside economic forces ... but if there is unbridled competition, when we face overwhelming outside competition without flood gates at all, then I'm sad to say, we cannot compete ....</p>
              <p>The average Singaporean worker may be able to compete in terms of productivity with the average foreigner, but he cannot accept third world wages and live and love and raise his family and retire in first world singapore ... that's the crux of the problem ....</p>
              <p>we talked about the example of the 55 years old toilet cleaner aunty yesterday, who would hire the Singaporean aunty when he can employ a younger, more energectic bangla or PRC at a lower wage, who can work longer hours, who doesn't have to be an home by 5 to cook dinner for her family ... or the 38 years old retrenched technician with a wife and two school going kids ? .... when he can get a young strapping burmese engineer with a degree at the same wage ? ...... and who doesn't have to go for an annual two weeks "holiday" in the SAF besides ? ....</p>
              <p>we have to acknowledge that Singaporeans are  being asked to fight with one hands tied on an uneven field ....</p>

              then yes, there's no contest ... every single marco econs prof
              would tell you the same thing .... but, as one of my former profs
              said, economics cannot exist political and social considerations
              ....</p>
              <p>we are a country ... we cannot be run as a business ... costs to
              businesses is but one side of the story ... yes, Singapore is a
              tiny island state, which will forever be swayed by outside economic
              forces ... but if there is unbridled competition, when we face
              overwhelming outside competition without flood gates at all, then
              I'm sad to say, we cannot compete ....</p>
              <p>The average Singaporean worker may be able to compete in terms
              of productivity with the average foreigner, but he cannot accept
              third world wages and live and love and raise his family and retire
              in first world singapore ... that's the crux of the problem
              ....</p>
              <p>we talked about the example of the 55 years old toilet cleaner
              aunty yesterday, who would hire the Singaporean aunty when he can
              employ a younger, more energectic bangla or PRC at a lower wage,
              who can work longer hours, who doesn't have to be an home by 5 to
              cook dinner for her family ... or the 38 years old retrenched
              technician with a wife and two school going kids ? .... when he can
              get a young strapping burmese engineer with a degree at the same
              wage ? ...... and who doesn't have to go for an annual two weeks
              "holiday" in the SAF besides ? ....</p>
              <p>we have to acknowledge that Singaporeans are  being asked
              to fight with one hands tied on an uneven field ....</p>

              <p>Dunno... but maybe, that's what happens when wages are
              determined by free market forces?  I think in Singapore, there
              isn't any guaranteed minimum wage for any one profession?  I
              do remember sifting through SNEF's (Singapore National Employers
              Federation) guidelines back when I worked in Human Resources and I
              recall seeing Min, Max, and Mean wages for various professions in
              various industries, but there was never a guaranteed minimum wage
              declaration. </p>
              <p>My understanding of economics is rudimentary, but I do have a
              question - if the Govt starts to impose minimum wages on the major
              professions and industries, won't that, in turn, exert an
              inflationary pressure on businesses?  Already, businesses face
              inflation in the cost of raw materials, essential services, taxes,
              etc.  To also face sudden rising costs in wages as well might
              be the straw that breaks the camel's back. </p>
              <p>In such circumstances, is it better to be employed for less, or
              not to be employed at all?   Given, the good times are
              over and we are now in bad times.  Back in the '80's, when we
              were hit with recession, the worry on everyone's minds was whether
              or not they'll be able to keep their jobs.  Now, in the US,
              although they are not officially admitting it, a huge percentile of
              Americans surveyed by CNN believe that they are now in
              recession.  I believe there are people who are losing their
              jobs, or facing reduced salaries over there, as a direct result of
              having their working hours cut, or benefits taken away. </p>
              <p>Times like this, is not the time to question why there's so
              little, but rather, to just bite the bullet, get on with making
              ends meet, and know that bad times won't be forever. </p>

              <p>Hi Rhonda,</p>
              <p>Yes your correct, minimum wage does indeed increase the inflationary pressures faced by firms and ultimately the consumer.</p>
              <p>The intuition is simple: Consider a situation when you operate a firm that employs low-wage labour but because of the implementaion of minimum-wage laws, you are faced with a higer wage expense. You therefore can either a) demand less labour (increase the unemployment rate) or b) transfer the higher wage expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices (adding to existing price inflation).</p>
              <p>I guess its always better to be employed for less then not to be employed for more, given the lesser of 2 evils. And as you pointed out yourself, bad time or recession alike, they don't last forever.</p>

              <p>I am really happy at the direction this thread is heading.  Controlled civility whilst expressing valid ideas from all perspectives.  Kudos to y'all... so far!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Fatum, I'd like to highlight something elindra said.  The poor are the ones suffering even more than ever.  I feel the Singapore govt should extend a helping hand to the poor - those too uneducated to retrain effectively, and those who are stuck in ruts and can only obtain jobs that will never pay more than decently - these are the people who deserve to be offered more financial assistance. </p>
              <p>However, I draw the line at sympathising with fresh grads.  You seem to think that they deserve to be paid more and have a better lifestyle in "First World Singapore" (and btw, the terms 1st, 2nd and 3rd worlds have long been abolished as being politically incorrect decades ago and has since been replaced with developed, developing and ... what's the worst? ... Undeveloped?  Underdeveloped?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png">). </p>
              <p>Here, in "First World Melbourne", I see fresh grads in Nursing, struggling all the time.  Traditionally, grads are offered lower salaries simply because they do not yet have any substantial experience to be of any great contribution to the employer.  On top of that, the employer has to rope in resources to train them, as well as to bolster any losses and etc resulting from mistakes made by an amateur.  In good times, employers fight for the best grads, offering more remuneration to employ the cream of the crop.  But when the tide turns, as it often does, grads will suddenly find themselves in a disadvantaged position when it comes to bargaining power and starting salaries.</p>
              <p>It's the "I'm entitled to a better life" mentality that I abhor.  No one is 'entitled' to a better life.  You work for it.  Even here, in Melbourne, I see grads struggling financially everyday.  They get much lower salaries until after they have clocked in a year's worth of solid working experience, then they suddenly get a gratifying increase to acknowledge their experience.  It is sort of like a probation of sorts, and also a rite that acknowledges that you are no longer a rookie, you can actually make contributions to your employer right now.  Nothing wrong with starting humble, and that should be the case.  Start small.</p>
              <p>These grads get paid so little, and on top of that, they have to pay off a huge education debt.  I know of grads who, after paying off their education loan, the car loan, and the regular living expenses, have barely enough to eat well.  And yet, do they go around shouting that they live in first world Melbourne, they deserve a better life?  No.  We sit around at the table and talk about how tough life is, but then, they roll up their sleeves, and ask for extra shifts so they can earn a bit more that month.  Some of them work agency shifts on their days off so they can make ends meet and / or pay that extra surprise bill that crept up on them.  No one has it easy.  And yet, instead of asking for the govt to give them more, these people just accept it as a fact of life, and work harder.</p>
              <p>Why should young Singaporeans have it any differently?  All around the world, it's a rite of passage almost, that you start small, start tough, and as you move on, your lifestyle gets substantially better. </p>
              <p>Look all around the world, Singaporeans aren't doing any worse than any other developed country.  And for that, we have to be thankful.  I've met migrants who come from countries where they are still dealing with basic hygiene, basic bread-and-butter, basic safety and welfare issues.  Singaporeans, in comparison, have had it easy, have had lots of abundant, fruitful years.  Be thankful for those good years, but if times turn bad, it affects everybody.  Of course, the upper eons won't have it as rough, but that is something that is seen the world over.  The rich are always cushy... otherwise, why would anyone work hard at all if life "up there" isn't cushy and nice? </p>
              <p>It will bother me if the more experienced and skilled people in the workforce in Singapore aren't getting better remuneration.  But that doesn't seem to be the case.  As long as you continually upgrade yourself and invest in  your own self-development, as long as you work hard and prove yourself to be a valuable asset to your employer, you will be kept employed. </p>
              <p>Once again, I want to repeat the point made by elindra last night - that some FT's work harder than the locals.  Why?  They have a hunger.  A hunger to build a better life for themselves by working hard.  Their circumstances back  home are often worse than what we enjoy  here, and they are fired up by the sheer determination to 'make it good'.  Whilst we are busy screaming bloody murder for our lives getting tougher, these guys are rolling up their sleeves, grinning and bearing it, and working away diligently. </p>
              <p>If I were an employer, I will hire the FT - they work hard, don't complain, and are committed to making it good.  Basically, if you want to compete with the FT's, beat them at their own game.  Otherwise, face the reality that only the fittest survive.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Citigroup cuts Asia growth forecast, ups inflation</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, March 26 - Citigroup has cut its forecasts for Asia's 2008
              economic growth to 7.6 percent from 8.2 percent due to the U.S.
              slowdown, while lifting its inflation outlook because of rising food
              and energy costs in the region.</p>
              <p>"Recent rapid deterioration in economic and financial conditions in
              the United States have dimmed the outlook for emerging Asia," said
              Citigroup's chief Asia economist Yiping Huang in a research report
              published on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The bank had cut its growth forecast for
              China to 9.8 percent in 2008 from previous 10.5 percent and trimmed
              India's growth outlook to 7.7 percent from 8.3 percent, it said.</p>
              <p>Asia's economies, excluding Japan, grew 8.8 percent last year, the bank said.</p>
              <p>Citigroup had halved its forecast for U.S. growth to 0.8 percent in 2008, despite rapidly falling interest rates, it said.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              the bank raised its inflation forecast for Asia-Pacific to 5.1 percent
              from 4.6 percent, led by price rises in China, Singapore, Taiwan and
              Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Asian economies have remained solid because the U.S.
              economy was initially hit by the housing sector, which had little
              impact on Asia's exports, but the picture had started changing now that
              U.S. consumers have started suffering, Huang added.</p>
              <p>Asia's exporters would feel the pinch from weaker global demand in the second quarter, probably in May or June, he said.</p>
              <p>"Rising
              inflation has been the main policy concern in most Asian economies, and
              recent high inflation data probably contributed to official tolerance
              for currency appreciation in China, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam," the
              bank's report said.</p>

              <p>You don't listen to what others are trying to say, do you?  Last night, in Night Owls, when we were discussing FT's, I've already pointed out that it is not their presence alone that drives down wages.  Again, I reiterate here, it is up to the Govt to enforce minimum wage rules, and if the Govt chooses to leave wages to free market forces, then what you see in Singapore is a direct result of that policy.  Repeating the same points over and over again is rather unnecessary - I heard you the first time round, and I have already provided you with an alternative way of viewing this whole matter.  We will not be able to come up with any viable solutions, simply because we aren't in politics, all we can talk about are theories, ideals, wishes, etc.  It always helps to view something from all available angles.</p>

              <p>This topic is internationally controversial, with good-and-valid
              arguments on both sides of the onging debate. Prices on a number of
              food types used for biofuel have doubled in the last couple years.
              There are those that say biofuel is not the main cause. Some say the
              problem is a result of government actions to support biofuels. Others
              say it is just due to oil price increases. The impact of food price
              increases is greatest on poorer countries.
              Some have called for a freeze on biofuels. Some have called for more
              funding of second generation biofuels which should not compete with
              food production so much.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel#cite_note-48"></a></sup></p>

              <p>The external factors affect other equivalent economies as well, it's doesn't solely affect only Singapore.</p>
              <p>Taking into account the external factors, our inflation rate is far higher than other comparable countries.</p>
              <p>Then we have to look at the internal factors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who has a direct hand in managing the internal factors?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rising housing prices due to increase immigrants, GST increases, rising rentals, rising electricity rates, rising medical cost and rising transportation cost.</p>
