            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><strong>Here are big example and major reasons "Why should every parents choose Autism Step Singapore?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
              <p>Liyuan was Jenson’s, my three-year-old son’s, Case Manager/therapist 
              from May 2013 to January 2014. Although Jenson had gone through more 
              than a year of speech and occupational therapy, as well as early 
              intervention programmes then, he had serious compliance issues and he 
              could only verbalize no more than five words. Jenson was unable to sit 
              down for more than five minutes, threw frequent tantrums, was very rigid
               and had no eye contact with other people.</p>
              <p>When Liyuan first came 
              to assess Jenson, I was impressed with his knowledge and application of 
              the Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) approach. The two-hour assessment 
              session took three-hours as I had endless questions to ask and he 
              patiently answered all my questions. Liyuan also came across as very 
              approachable, which I think is an important criterion for a Case 
              Manager, as both the child and parents need to feel comfortable working 
              with the Case Manager.</p>
              <p>Liyuan was always cheerful yet firm with Jenson. He was focused in helping and stretching Jenson’s ability appropriately. <span style="color: #181818; font-weight: bold;">I was amazed that after the first session with Liyuan, Jenson could say “help me” and used it appropriately subsequently.</span>  Liyuan would always stay behind after his session to share with me 
              what he had done during the session and Jenson’s progress. When he 
              learnt that Jenson would be performing in his school year-end concert, 
              he requested to attend the concert with us to show support for Jenson. 
              The smile on Jenson’s face was priceless when he saw Liyuan at the 
              concert.</p>
              <p>Liyuan has always displayed a <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>high level of professionalism</strong></span> in whatever he does, while at the same time not lacking the personal 
              touch. He would reply to my messages promptly, regardless of the time 
              the message was sent. His advice was very useful as it <span style="color: #181818; font-weight: bold;">taught
               me how to manage Jenson’s behaviors and I successfully overcame 
              Jenson’s obsession of playing with the sliding door and escalator</span>!
               Whenever I was depressed and worried about Jenson’s future, he would 
              give me words of encouragement and I really appreciate his support. When
               Liyuan knew that I had problems getting my family members to be 
              consistent and firm with Jenson, Liyuan took time off on Saturday to 
              speak to my family members on what autism was and the traits. He also 
              emphasised the importance of being consistent, asked them for their 
              concerns and proposed strategies that they could apply when dealing with
               Jenson. After that session, my family members’ awareness on autism 
              definitely increased and they were much more receptive towards what I 
              said and what should be done.</p>
              <p>From observing and identifying the 
              areas of concern, to tailoring the programme to suit Jenson, Liyuan 
              followed through diligently. Due to his commitment, belief in the 
              potential of Jenson and his close working partnership with my family, 
              Liyuan was able to bring about significant positive changes in Jenson 
              within a short period of time. Jenson can now site through a two-hour 
              therapy session, eye contact has been established and his vocabulary has
               definitely increased. I am very grateful to have Liyuan as Jenson’s 
              therapist. Though Liyuan is no longer Jenson’s Case Manager/therapist, I
               still keep in contact with him as he is now a friend and I never 
              hesitate to seek his advice and support.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I would highly recommend Zhang Liyuan as he has the heart, passion, knowledge, skills and experience as a competent therapist.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I trust that the information provided will be of assistance and would be happy to provide further information, if required.</p>
              <p><strong>Reason:</strong></p>
              <p>This is the big reason that an autistic child live as a normal human being without spending more money. Many autistic child and their parents live as happliy life.</p>

Research shows that autism can be caused by a variety of conditions that affect brain development, which may occur before, during or after birth. </p>

Other research findings suggest that there may be an imbalance in certain chemicals in the brain. Genetic factors may sometimes be involved in certain families. In reality, what we know is that autism may develop from a combination of several “causes”.</p>

A number of traits of autism are common to Asperger’s Syndrome including: difficulties in communicating, social relationships, and a lack of social imagination and creative play.</p>
              <p style='margin: 0px 0px 25px; line-height: 1.4; font-family: "Open Sans", Arial, "Microsoft YaHei", å¾®è½¯é›…é»‘, SimHei, é»‘ä½“, STHeiti, å�Žæ–‡é»‘ä½“, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box !important;'>Persons with Asperger’s Syndrome usually have fewer difficulties with language than those with classical autism, often speaking fluently, though their words can sometimes sound formal or ‘unusual’ to the listener. Even though they have few difficulties with language, they do have significant difficulties with social aspects of communication.</p>
              <p style='margin: 0px 0px 25px; line-height: 1.4; font-family: "Open Sans", Arial, "Microsoft YaHei", å¾®è½¯é›…é»‘, SimHei, é»‘ä½“, STHeiti, å�Žæ–‡é»‘ä½“, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box !important;'>Many children with Asperger’s Syndrome are able to adapt to learning in a mainstream school setting.

              The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) which was published in May 2013 no longer includes Asperger's disorder as a separate diagnosis and has homogenized it under autism spectrum disorder, with severity measures within the broader diagnosis.</div>

There is currently no known “cure” for autism. Children with autism do not ‘outgrow’ autism but symptoms may lessen with intervention. Structured intervention and training will help the individuals acquire skills, but not cure the condition. There is a wide body of research to support the knowledge that young children with autism experience significant improvements when intervention is started at the earliest possible age.</p>
