              <p>if future fatumnette turns out to be some gold digging harpy from the gutters, or even someone like you've described, then it'll be the biggest mistake of my life ... but it still won't be something I'd hedge ... </p>
              <p>some things in life you jump in with eyes wide open .....</p>
              <p>I like to think of marriages as something like having kids ..... you think long and hard about whether you'd managed, whether if your kid will turn into those terror tykes on MRTs, whether they'll be smart enough to do well in the PSLE, whether they'll fall into bad company, whether they'll be able to get into uni, whether it'll be expensive .... whether the CPF would be enough for the school fees .... yadda yadda .....</p>
              <p>you can't hedge the risks of having a kid ... there are no "reset" modes for that ... once the BB pops out, the babe's your responsibility for better or worse, whether the kid turns out to be the next einstein or forrest gump, whether he's well behaved or a terror ... you give him or her unconditional love, without reservations, without holding anything back .....</p>
              <p>I think marriage, and love, is exactly the same thing ... it should be unconditional, without reservations, without holding anything back ... that is why people don't fall in love, or even in crush, every day ... because the primal instinct is to cherish and love and protect and give your all for that person.</p>
              <p>if your secret heart says "look, something may go wrong in the future, she may turn out to be not who I want, or what I had imagined her to be" .... then I have to say that you've either jumped in with eyes wide shut, that you haven't known her well enough, or did not test the person well enough, before you commit, it'll be your mistake alone .... </p>
              <p>or perhaps really, you don't really love her all that much ... certainly not enough anyways .... if your secret heart is saying such things to you before the big leap, then I'd suggest holding back and re-evaluating what the other person really means to you ..... "oh sure, this is the person I'm sharing my life with till death to us part, to share all the joys and pains, the laughters and the sorrows, the good times and the bad, the person who I'd share my inner most fears and hopes with, my most intimate thoughts and actions, the one who'd succor me in the bad times, the one I'd go to for comfort and she too in turn  .... the one who'll share all my burdens .... but I just draw the line at sharing my fortune with, her ? " ..... errrrrmmmm .... okaaaay ... that doesn't sound quite, right, does it ? </p>
              <p>I'd never let anyone whom I've not prepared to share everything with, into my life ...</p>
              <p>if someone were to ask me to sign a pre-nup, I'd simply walk away, that person is NOT the one  ....... for I know, in her secret heart, she's already thought of her options for leaving me .... </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>if future fatumnette turns out to be some gold digging harpy
                  from the gutters, or even someone like you've described, then it'll
                  be the biggest mistake of my life ... but it still won't be
                  something I'd hedge ...</p>
              <p>some things in life you jump in with eyes wide open .....</p>
              <p>I like to think of marriages as something like having kids .....
                  you think long and hard about whether you'd managed, whether if
                  your kid will turn into those terror tykes on MRTs, whether they'll
                  be smart enough to do well in the PSLE, whether they'll fall into
                  bad company, whether they'll be able to get into uni, whether it'll
                  be expensive .... whether the CPF would be enough for the school
                  fees .... yadda yadda .....</p>
              <p>you can't hedge the risks of having a kid ... there are no
                  "reset" modes for that ... once the BB pops out, the babe's your
                  responsibility for better or worse, whether the kid turns out to be
                  the next einstein or forrest gump, whether he's well behaved or a
                  terror ... you give him or her unconditional love, without
                  reservations, without holding anything back .....</p>
              <p>I think marriage, and love, is exactly the same thing ... it
                  should be unconditional, without reservations, without holding
                  anything back ... that is why people don't fall in love, or even in
                  crush, every day ... because the primal instinct is to cherish and
                  love and protect and give your all for that person.</p>
              <p>if your secret heart says "look, something may go wrong in the
                  future, she may turn out to be not who I want, or what I had
                  imagined her to be" .... then I have to say that you've either
                  jumped in with eyes wide shut, that you haven't known her well
                  enough, or did not test the person well enough, before you commit,
                  it'll be your mistake alone ....</p>
              <p>or perhaps really, you don't really love her all that much ...
                  certainly not enough anyways .... if your secret heart is saying
                  such things to you before the big leap, then I'd suggest holding
                  back and re-evaluating what the other person really means to you
                  ..... "oh sure, this is the person I'm sharing my life with till
                  death to us part, to share all the joys and pains, the laughters
                  and the sorrows, the good times and the bad, the person who I'd
                  share my inner most fears and hopes with, my most intimate thoughts
                  and actions, the one who'd succor me in the bad times, the one I'd
                  go to for comfort and she too in turn  .... the one who'll
                  share all my burdens .... but I just draw the line at sharing my
                  fortune with, her ? " ..... errrrrmmmm .... okaaaay ... that
                  doesn't sound quite, right, does it ?</p>
              <p>I'd never let anyone whom I've not prepared to share everything
                  with, into my life ...</p>
              <p>if someone were to ask me to sign a pre-nup, I'd simply walk
                  away, that person is NOT the one  ....... for I know, in her
                  secret heart, she's already thought of her options for leaving me
                  ....</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Pre-nups not about not sharing during the marriage, but protecting what is originally yours in the aftermath of a split, so that some things don't get liquidated and you still have them, just as at the start of the marriage.</p>
              <p>As for kids, while you don't have much control over how quickly they develop, you try to manipulate (or mould) them into whatever you want them to be by teaching them values, enrolling them in top-notch schools and sending them for whatever enrichment classes, in the hope that it will influence the result somehow.</p>
              <p>It's not the same with marriage. There's no such thing as knowing enough about a person to commit. And there's no such thing as trust that is given freely without prerequisites to earn it or conditions to maintain it.</p>
              <p>You'll be surprised how quickly they can change under a different set of testing circumstances, or different temptations, when someone else's opinion starts to matter more or when one more day or compromise is one too many. And more surprises await when they start taking advice from unsavoury sources to heart.</p>
              <p>Why make the process of letting go harder by allowing the things that you treasure to become her trophies or souvenirs?</p>

              <p>a pre-nup makes the risks unequal on both sides ..... if I respect her for who she is, and love her unreservedly, completely, and is willing to witholds nothing from her (the preconditions for marriage in the first place in my books), then why would I need a pre-nup ? ... because I think I have more to lose in a failed marriage than the other party ? ... what of HER risks then ? ... on the same corrollary, I think partners should have a little more self respect than to so readily sign some sort of legal contract even before a formal marriage, now if I were a girl, first thought in my head should be, why is he protecting his assets already, does he intend to treat me as a two year cho cho san ? ... does it means he's not really serious about me ? ... maybe he wants a trophy wife, an accoutrement for his cars and address ? ...with this contract, he can get rid of me later, when he's tired of me, at minimal costs ? .... have a little self respect ladies ! .... if a man loves you enough, he should never ask you to sign one ! ....</p>
              <p>of course ... the other sad thing about this whole business ... is that so many are ready to place material considerations over love ...... cynicism ? ... jadedness ? ... I hope that my view on love would never ever change ... </p>
              <p>mean while, ladies, my deal holds (what's mine shall be yours, what's yours shall still be yours) ... taking in fatumnette applications now ... v<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>So not true!  That's like saying people buy into shares expecting losses.  Getting involved in a relationship is akin to buying shares - you WANT it to be successful, but you cannot be so foolish that you do not recognise the risks and the possibilities that it just might fail. You go into both with your eyes wide open, and experience, wisdom and observation will teach you to hedge your losses if they are losses you cannot bear to have.</p>
              <p>That is not cynicism or bitterness.  That is wisdom.  Being idealistic is like walking around with a candy-floss fluff-cloud around one's head.  Being hopeful despite knowing better is what most wise people do when falling in love. </p>
              <p>However, there comes a point when there are losses  you KNOW you just cannot bear.  If, like that Frenchman, I have inherited a family heirloom that's a castle and it's been in my family for generations and generations, THAT is priceless!  It's something that you simply cannot afford to lose!  In cases like that, a pre-nup is best to safeguard priceless, irreplaceable things because once love turns sour, both sides can turn extremely vicious overnight. </p>
              <p>Basically, you can guarantee your own behaviour, morality and love but you can never guarantee how the significant other will react in a fallout.  Therefore if there are assets you just cannot bear to lose, it's better to make things clear-cut right from the start. </p>
              <p>Things are simpler for me - I've got nothing of value so I won't need to initiate a pre-nup!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  And I don't think anyone will fight with me over grandma's heirloom - her Nyonya Sarong Kebaya or grandpa's yandao black-n-white photo taken when he was a rich young adult playboy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
