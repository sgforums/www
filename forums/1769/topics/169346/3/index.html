(not really that surprising to me though...)<br><br>Emo Kid<br>You are 28% Rational, 0% Extroverted, 14% Brutal, and 14% Arrogant.<br>You are the Emo Kid, best described as a quiet pussy! You tend to be an intuitive rather than a logical thinker, meaning you rely more on your feelings than your thoughts. Not only that, but you are introverted, gentle, and rather humble. You embody all the traits of the perfect emo kid. You are a push-over, an emotional thinker, gentle to the extent of absurdity, and so humble that it even makes Jesus puke. If you write poetry, you no doubt write angsty, syrupy lines about depression, sadness, and other such redundant states of emo-being. Your personality is defective because you are too gentle, rather underconfident in yourself, decidely lacking in any rational thought, and also a bit too inhibited.<br><br>I probably made you cry, didn't I? Fucking Emo Kid.<br><br>To put it less negatively:<br><br>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational.<br><br>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted.<br><br>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal.<br><br>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.<br><br>the (soft-hearted) (abolitionist) (democratic) pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Starving Artist<br><br>You are 14% Rational, 0% Extroverted, 42% Brutal, and 57% Arrogant.<br><br>You are the Starving Artist! You are more intuitive than logical, and are primarily guided by your heart and emotions. You are also very introverted and gentle. Of course, this does not mean that you do not have an ego. In fact, you are surprisingly arrogant for someone so emotional and gentle. This is why you are best described as a starving artist. You are very introspective and quite sure of yourself, as any accomplished artist is, yet your views are impractical, guided by feelings, and overly gentle. You probably find math, logic, and similar intellectual pursuits offensive to your artistic sensibilities, and you prefer the open-endedness of artistry because then you know you can never truly have a wrong answer. So really you have no reason to be arrogant, you big doofus, because the skills you value (emotion, spirit, art, etc.) in yourself are valuable only on a subjective level, meaning your arrogance is purely masturbatory. In short, your personality is defective because you are arrogant, introverted, introspective, gentle, and thoroughly irrational...posessing most of the traits needed to be a starving--and useless--artist. So get out there, write a few short stories that are allegories for the spirit, and starve!<br><br>To put it less negatively:<br><br>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational.<br><br>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted.<br><br>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal.<br><br>4. You are more ARROGANT than humble.<br><br>Compatibility:<br><br>Your exact opposite is the Capitalist Pig.<br><br>Other personalities you would probably get along with are the Haughty Intellectual, the Televangelist, and the Emo Kid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bitch-Slap<br>You are 14% Rational, 28% Extroverted, 57% Brutal, and 42% Arrogant.<br>You are the Bitch-Slap, the hallmark response of any abusive husband! You are more intuitive than others, focusing more on feelings than rational explanations, and you are also probably very brutual because you care more about yourself than the well-being of others. As most of us know, brutality combined with emotion often leads to BITCH-SLAPPING, which is why you are called "The Bitch Slap". (This does not mean you are emotional, only that you are more affected by emotions than rationality when making decisions.) Another trait you possess is that you are very humble, which could mean you are insecure because very few people are brutal AND humble. Not only that, but you are also rather introverted, and any tendencies towards brutality you possess may also result from the fact that you bottle up your emotions and don't show them to others until you explode in rage. Most likely, however, you are not a VIOLENT person, just someone who is rather selfish. At any rate, being a bitch-slap does not necessarily mean you will abuse your spouse; it only means you are rather intuitive, uncaring toward others, brutal, introverted, and possibly insecure.<br><br>To put it less negatively:<br><br>1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational.<br><br>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted.<br><br>3. You are more BRUTAL than gentle.<br><br>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.<br><br></div>
