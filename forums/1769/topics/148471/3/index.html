We missed you yesterday.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>No heavy rains yet today here, but it is cloudy and expected to rain later this afternoon and into the weekend. Just in time to screw up the weekend for us. Thank you, Mother Nature...<br><br>No kidding about gas prices!!! I'm surprised that there have not been riots about them yet. Here in the upper midwest, it's currently at about $2.60/gallon; I spoke with some friends living in the SF bay area in CA, and they're paying upwards of $3/gallon! Ridiculous!!!!<br><br>Good thing I do the 'park-and-ride' routine and take the bus to work. What about you? Do you drive all the way in to work?<br><br>MG</div></blockquote>Thanks MG, yeap, feeling better.<br><br>Oh, I heard our West Coast (BC) has been paying the dollar mark for a while already.  But this morning, it dropped to 98 cents.  We have to play cat and mouse with the gas stations.  I noticed the pattern is price goes up in the morning, dropped in the evening and then up again after midnight.  Then, got to catch the day of the week also.  Typically, high on Fridays, catch those going up north, mah and come down again on Sunday.  Okay lah, don't laugh lah.  I know I have a cheap car or economic car but also can play the game, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I've done the park and ride when I worked downtown but after a taste of mid town, I like the proximity to home lah.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

For me, if I work downtown, my fare will be about C$200 for a monthly pass.</div></blockquote>You can purchase a transit pass, known here as the Metropass, that allows you unlimited rides on all buses and trains in the Twin Cities metro area and surrounding suburbs. Some companies and organizations will subsidize the cost of obtaining Metropasses for their employees, in order to encourage the use of public transportation. In my case, I pay a subsidized amount of $60 per month for the Metropass.<br><br>MG</div>
