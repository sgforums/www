It is such a beautiful, expansive place with diverse cultures and soooo much freedom!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Y'know, it's extremely odd, but when I'm here, I tend to prefer to keep to myself and take a long time to warm up to strangers.  But, when I'm there, I notice that I will even walk up to total strangers and say 'Hi!' to them!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>I feel that they don't intrude on your privacy and I somehow feel more liberated to approach them!

I mean, look, the guys here, when they see the women in the new Dove ads, they start to criticise the ladies relentlessly but I see the beauty in each and every one of them!  In the States, they tend to appreciate beauty in all forms - flat-chested, boobsy, dark, fair, skinny, slim, plump or 'well-padded'... they are more accepting in a way, compared to here.  Hey, when I was there, there were actually men who turned back to look at me as I walked past!!  Woooooohoooooooo!!!!
