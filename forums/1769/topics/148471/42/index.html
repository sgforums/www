I'll take single digit anytime.  The heat drives me nuts and with pounding headaches.<br><br>Aiyoh, airline strike ah?  Terrible.  Very chaotic.  A chain reaction for other airlines as well.<br><br>We were yakking nicely and then the server went down yesterday eh?<br><br>Oh, you were mentioning to Kopio about going West.  Is it really cheaper out there?  But NYC is THE place to be isn't it?  Anyways, honestly, don't know much about the States so really can't comment.  Likewise, Americans don't know much about Canada too.  I still can't forget this joke that the American tourists actually brought their skis with them in summer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>Yeah, I can't stand hot weather either, and the steamy weather we're experiencing this summer has me withering. Ideally, I'd like to live in a region of the US where the temperature ranges between 50ÂºF and 70ÂºF year-round, as I find that to be my optimal "comfort zone."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Don't get me wrong: living in any of the coastal cities going to be astronomically expensive. However, I'd imagine that the cost of living in the west coast cities like LA and SF is marginally cheaper than NYC because of the greater geographic spread of those cities. Working in either LA or SF doesn't necessarily mean working downtown; in fact, you're more likely to be living in one suburb and commuting to your place of work in another suburb.<br><br>I don't know if NYC is "the place to be" for someone pursuing a career specifically in photography. A professional photographer probably travels frequently, and doesn't need to be "based" in a particular locale.<br><br>But I could be wrong.<br><br>MG</div>
