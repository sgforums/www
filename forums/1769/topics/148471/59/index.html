Now, they are just republishing it but with a good marketing strategy - they've divided it into FIVE separate cookbooks, with colour photos of all the recipes!  It costs a bomb to have the entire collection - more than S$100!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Economically, it definitely doesn't make much sense but her older editions are no longer in publication for years already, and well, the 'new' look is more pleasing.<br><br>Remember the old 'Mrs Lee's Cookbook', written by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's mom?  Her grand-daughter has also edited it and re-published her cookbook into two separate books with full-colour photos of every recipe.  It's available in a complete boxed set, in hardcover, or paperback.<br><br>I will definitely miss locally published cookbooks when I migrate.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  I'll also miss the local foodie mags, although Australia publishes 'Taste' and 'delicious', pretty good foodie mags too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>However, here, we sometimes have cookbooks / mags from Malaysia / Taiwan / Hong Kong that won't be available outside the region.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  I even have a few cookbooks in Mandarin!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Sure I'll struggle with the translation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ... but the recipes are just too authentic, y'know!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If you see me at a gazebo, it's probably because I'm attending a company picnic, and I'll likely be holding a brat in one hand and a bottle of Mountain Dew in the other, burping, farting and yakking with other guys from my department.<br><br>Not a very poetic scene now, is it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The fall colors will probably come earlier to you, since you're farther north. When the colors peak here in MN, I'll usually take one of the club's Cessnas and fly with a couple of friends up to the north shore of Lake Superior to view the colors. There's a very narrow time window when the colors are at their most vibrant, and people are usually out and about enjoying them, so it does get crowded for these few days on the byways and highways, especially along the rivers and lakes.<br><br>I have an el-cheapo Weber gas grill that I'll occasionally throw a piece of meat on when I don't feel like messing about in the kitchen. Other than that, I'm not a big BBQ fan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>MG</div>
