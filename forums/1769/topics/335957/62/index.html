              <p>As Fatum pointed out..... that girl probably just wants affirmation and not real advice.</p>
              <p>Reminds me of that messed-up idiot who suggested that all L-plate drivers be banned from the roads. It's obvious that he just wanted to whine about a bad experience and to get people to agree with him.</p>
              <p>He certainly didn't expect every single person to whack him to high heaven. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>In the first place, how the *bleep* does he plan to study
              part-time while doing full-time NS? Even weekend classes won't be
              easy - I lost count of all the weekends and holidays burnt due to
              all sorts of nonsense I got thrown at in my NSF days.</p>

              <p>I knew one who completed his degree part time in NS. can be done, the problem though is if the pple in charge of him want to let him use the down time (at night) to go attend classes. I've seen both sides, some the camp allows them to book out to do so, some don't. Same vocations, similar background. really down to the OC/CO to decide i guess.</p>
