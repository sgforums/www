(that's how he got into law school, that extra piece of paper)</p>
              <p>best of all, he still performed well enough as a PC, that he ORD'ed as a company 2IC ...</p>
              <p>that's called fortitude ......</p>
              <p>this chap here, if he really is in depression over a little bump like this ... then I'd say he's pretty screwed in life, cos there will be much bigger bumps ahead, which there's no way he'd be able to handle ...</p>
