Since I was a little girl.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   I was the ribbon and lacey dresses kinda girl.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Not allowed to do outdoorsy stuff like climb trees and what-not, so bo-bian... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Kena punished badly if I went wild like some tomboy like that.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Ah ma a bit overboard.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Well, I didn't frame them cause I couldn't afford it.  Mom paid for the framing for the first three cause I was still a Secondary School student.  I remember she was boasting to the shop lady very proudly and helping me select what colour to frame it up in and all that.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   It was pretty pricey back then, but I think it's many times worse now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>There are lots of creative framing shops here nowadays.  There's a posh shop called 'Framing Angie' in Holland Rd Shopping Ctr where a lotta expats frequent - this lady, Angie, does 3D-framing... where you can frame your favourite items and she does it kinda like scrapbook-style with depth some more.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   Her pieces turn out real nice, but, as expected, costs an arm and a leg!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Since I lost those three pieces, I was so heartbroken that I've started several pieces at one stage or another, but never ever completed any.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

But cross-stitch is appreciated by stitchers because of the patience it takes to complete the pieces, esp challenging ones.<br><br>Besides, there's always the challenging task of making sure your piece is very neat.  I got to the point where it wasn't just enough to have the crosses uniform and neat - the back has to be neat too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Well, a lot of craftwork isn't exactly original either.  If you make clothes, the patterns and designs aren't original.   If you make origami, it isn't exactly original either because you do not invent new designs but you're just reproducing something that's been tried-and-tested.  And you do origami, don't you?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Actually, if you come right down to the crunch, only painting and a handful of other handiwork can be original... all other craftwork isn't exactly a true artistic expression in terms of originality.<br><br>And yes, whilst cross-stitch is easy to learn, it isn't easy to master.  The more complicated pieces have colour changes, half- and quarter-stitches, back-stitching, beadwork, french knots, etc. in them.  Stuff like whitework... that's not easy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  The basics are easy, but who's talking about the basics here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And, sorry, it isn't 'just a guy talking', it's just you talking, cause I know of many other men who would feel nothing short of a sense of pride or bliss if someone they knew stitched something nice.<br><br></div>
