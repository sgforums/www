            <div class='col-md body'>There's an ad on TV now that makes me realise how much I do prefer life here.<br><br>As the elections are approaching, Labour and Liberal have been airing ads on TV to try to win more voters.  In one ad, a videoclip is shown of John Howard's face on some banner touting how well things have become under him and a voiceover of him saying that "Australians have never had it better" or something like that...<br><br>Then, zoom in to a housewife with her kids in the background saying, "Really? How can you say that when my kids will probably never be able to own their own homes?" and something about the IR laws making life tougher for the man in the street.<br><br>Then the housewife looks squarely into the camera and says something like, "With all due respects but Mr Howard, but you're out of touch!"<br><br>Now, THIS is the kind of politics I like!  I love watching John Howard and Kevin Rudd fight it out!  The media coverage here gives fair game time to both.  Unlike in Singapore, where the PAP is always portrayed as White Angels and the opposition... wait a minute...

Many people were outpriced so they trekked up to the next county and bought there. That's a solid 90 min drive one way. Some have bought even further north than that. Because of the high cost of living here, last year San Diego recorded it's first ever decline in population. Many have uprooted for cheaper pastures. As for us, bo pian. Here is where we have to be for the next 8 years at least.</div>

No one plans to be a slave to their mortgage for life. I do plan to pay off my home loan within the next few years plus 1 investment property every year after.<br>No I do not have any grand inheritance.<br><br>I'll give you a plan to work on so as you can get into your first home.<br><br>Nurse A makes around 75000 a year (+1 makes 75000 per year)<br>Nurse B makes around 75000 a year (+1 makes 75000 per year)<br><br>You need to do your full calulations on it. If you are unsure, drop me a message, I'll send you a spreadsheet.<br><br>Nurse A &amp; +1 buys a brand new house (investment property) for $450,000<br>Nurse B &amp; +1 buys a brand new house (investment property) for $450,000 next door to Nurse A &amp; +1<br><br>Interest rates is around 9%<br><br>Nurse A &amp; +1 rents Nurse B &amp; +1 house for $1<br>Nurse B &amp; +1 rents Nurse A &amp; +1 house for $1<br><br>Nurse A &amp; +1 installs Aircon and other stuff due to Nurse B's request.<br>Nurse B &amp; +1 installs Aircon and other stuff due to Nurse A's request.<br><br>Basic tax laws.<br>Because both your (Nurse A &amp; B) houses are investment property, you are able to claim the following.<br>1) Interest rates for the loan.<br>2) property depreciation<br>3) Cost of any installation. Aircon &amp; stuff<br>4) depreciation of the stuff in your property (curtains, aircon)<br>5) Cost of all repairs<br><br>You will be claiming a fair bit from the gov. This is known as negative gearing. This technique will work if both (Nurse A &amp; +1) are earning good income.<br><br>Why is this legal, if you follow Oz election, you might find out that Kelvin Rudd is given housing allowance because of his job. He is paying rent to his wife.<br></div>
