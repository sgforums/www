Squeaky toy duck<br>Loved it so much that my mum said it's the first word I learnt. 'Duck'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  (Btw I can't remember this but my mum had this journal of me growing up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br><br>2. Squeaky toy cat<br>Not sure what happened to it. But, from what I know, I have this thing about squeaky toys and shoes when I was young  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>3. Porcelain Cat piggy bank<br>Really beautiful cat which I got for my birthday but kids being kids....broke it by accident and cried my eyes out<br><br>4. Tiny rubber ball that can bounce really high<br><br>5. Collection of shells and pebbles (still have them)<br><br>6. A jewel My Little Pony (still have it)<br><br>7. This Japanese toy doll (not sure what happened to it)<br><br>8. A Pomar Swiss Made Wind-up watch given to me by my grand aunt.<br>I still wear it but I had to change the stripe.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have plenty of childhood treasures and a few of them are still around, thanks to grandma, who keeps the toys 'for my kids'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyways, here are a few of them :<br><br>- Long-necked giraffe on wheels with different-coloured rings around its neck.  The rings get larger around the base.  I loved that toy, for some reason or other!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   As I grew up, I didn't play with the rings around its neck as much but still, I loved to have it around.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>- Kiddy plastic stool with a red top and beige base.  I upturned it and it became my 'stove' for imitating the porridge lady!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   I even imitated how she would knock her scoop against the side of the saucepan just before she pours the porridge into bowls!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>- Kiddy Dim Sum Trolley with fake food, a teapot set and a fake birthday cake.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  My absolute favourite toy!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   We weren't rich and mom had to save up for a few weeks then before she could afford to purchase that for me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>- Giant Panda Soft Toy from uncle.  I loved it to bits cause when I was a kiddo, it was taller than me!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   However, grandma wanted to keep it in pristine condition,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> , so she kept it in a large transparent plastic cover and only let me play with it on my birthdays!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   A few years back, she wanted to show how well-kept it still was but when she removed the cover, fur flew all over!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   She should've jus tlet me play with it when I was a kiddy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> !   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>- Red and Yellow 'Tractor' that my brother and I would ride around the house.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   We used to fight over whose turn it was to ride the tractor.  It was discarded years later when the wheels got so worn-out smooth, we'd try to pedal as hard as we could but still remain on the same spot!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hmm... can't remember the other toys for now.  Will add another post in here as and when I can recall.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
