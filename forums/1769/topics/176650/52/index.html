(mother in law is very old, so just wish to make her happy ba) ... I didn't really mind ba. It was a nice way to get to know my hubby's relatives too.<br><br>Well.. while she was very inconsiderate, I think there's a tendency for many brides to become very self absorbed. I don't really give a damn abt the whole 'trappings' of the wedding, but many get real excited about it, it is afterall a big huge fairy tale event for many (understandably so). Perhaps that is why she became more inconsiderate. Afterall it's (hopefully) once in a lifetime, so well..for the sake of your bro and family too, let's hope she gets better in time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
