Like sometimes when I'm doing my photography at places like the botanical gardens, people will stop and wonder just what the heck I'm shooting at. They're always pleasantly suprised when I point out the tiny but very interesting looking insects and plants/flowers.  And mating insects always amuse people!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Amazing the things you see if you open up your eyes big big.</div>
