I do understand how you feel though, no maid, no extended family to help... I remember when I was learning how to cook, my flatmates were very tolerant. But now I do enjoy cooking. I find it very relaxing for some reason.<br><br>In canada huh? When my better half and myself are in Toronto next, maybe we could meet up? Been wanting to go back to the USA and Canada for a while now. Its been about 12 years since I last set foot in the USA.</div>
