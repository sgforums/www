            <div class='col-md body'>There, you've got a few handy tips and advice already!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Try out elindra's suggestion of role-playing.  It's very helpful.  Doing a visualisation of yourself walking into the room confidently, fielding all questions well and having the interview process proceed smoothly also helps.  I often do that visualisation thing the night before any big events.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I guess you could think of the possible questions the interviewers would ask you and then think of your answers to those.  I'll talk to myself in the shower or as I walk around the house, pretending that I'm answering interview questions and before you know it, voila, you're good at it!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Be well-prepared.  Then, be confident and relax!!  Tell yourself that you will be a valuable member of any organisation that hires you, so they will want to hire  you, therefore there's no need to worry because if this one doesn't employ you for whatever reasons, there are always others!<br><br>Good luck!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One other thing: try to get your hands on some of the questions they're likely to ask and prepare for them.  One eternal favourite is "what do you think your greatest weakness is?".<br><br>It's been years since I've had to do interviewing, and I hate asking questions like that - I'm more from the structured-interviewing sort - but let me see if i can compile a list of such questions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i used to be very nervous in interviews, esp when i was still young and fresh out of school - can feel my face heating up n heart pumping furiously.<br><br>but like everything else, practice makes, well, not perfect, but better?<br><br>and a switch of mentality too, perhaps.<br><br>now, i look on interviews as ME interviewing THEM as much as they interviewing me. the interview's also a chance for me to ascertain whether the job's right for me, whether the scope is what i'm looking for, what development opportunities / career prospects there are, whether i feel comfortable with the hiring manager etc.  if any of the above are not compatible with my expectations, then i've as much a right to reject them as they do me.<br><br>i guess in that sense, the pressure's off.<br><br>i always do enjoy a good interview, even if nothing comes out of it as i'd most likely have learnt something from it. in fact, i prefer being interviewed than doing the interviewing... the latter of which i find to be such a bore!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the best way to approach job interviews is to be yourself completely.<br><br>There's really no point in memorizing standard answers to standard questions like what's your greatest weakness. I mean, almost every other candidate has their own textbook model answer, so might as well just answer what you like to answer.<br><br>A sense of humour should help... If macaroni and cheese is your greatest weakness, so be it and say so... Of course, do it in a natural way such that the interviewer knows you're making a joke... Hahahaa, ok, not funny.<br><br>Anyway, at the end of the day, even if you manage to bluff your way through the interview, either they will find out that you're not what you make yourself to be, or you will find out the job is not what you make it out to be...<br><br>Of course, anyone going for an interview has to first do some basic homework about the company's background and what they are doing... Being well prepared with information is the best you can do to avoid major brain breakdown during interviews.<br><br>Lastly, have confidence in yourself that you're the best candidate for the job.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm always curious about one thing during interviews, is there a standard list of questions that the interviewers must ask?<br><br>cos when i go for interviews, without fail, the first qn will be "Tell me abt yourself".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Anyway, to prevent brain freeze during interviews, I always prepare answers for the standard questions. The first few questions are usually standard questions, once u get it out of the way, then it will be like chit-chatting with the interviewer.<br><br>EXCEPT for 1 interview which i went, where the interviewer actually took out a paper and ask me to do a mini electronics test on the spot.!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me clarify one thing, Eric.  When I was talking about preparing for certain questions, I was talking about coming up with one's own answer for the questions, not memorising some fabricated answer.  Of course the answer had better be an accurate reflection of the candidate.  You don't need to hire them to find out if they're lying - an experienced interviewer will look at their track record and do a proper reference check, and pick a liar out from a mile away.<br><br>If an interviewer's got 20 candidates to interview in the space of an afternoon, he's not going to have time for someone who's going to um and ah, plain and simple.<br><br>SL's complaint is that she freezes up in interviews, and for that specific situation it's best to have some SOPs to fall back on.  The very fact that she walks in there knowing she possesses those SOPs will provide her with some confidence.  It's easy enough to tell somebody to have confidence in themselves, but unless you've got some way for them to do that, it's hardly more than empty cheerleading - if you're going to mention the what, it's your responsibility to back it up with the why and how.<br><br>Even more importantly, the level of a candidate's preparedness for an interview is something the interviewer would take as an indicator of the candidate's future performance.  Put bluntly, if you're showing me that you're the sort to wing your way through an interview, you're telling me that you're going to wing you way through the job as well, so why should I hire somebody who's too sloppy to get his act together?  Over the years I've lost count of the number of candidates I've turned down for this one reason - if they're not prepared to put in the work and get themselves ready for the interview, they obviously don't want the job badly enough for me to justify recommending them for the position.  Skills can be acquired along the way, but if the person's attitude is wrong right at the start, it's a no-go.</div>

Stick to the requirements listed in the job ad, and describe how your habits, characteristics and work experiences match those requirements.  If you get the chance to find out more about the job during the interview, but before you're asked the question, address the new points in the same way.<br><br>Essentially, the second question is asking for the same thing.  Essentially, your answer has to be, "Well, you're looking for somebody to do X, and I've got skill Y, which is exactly what you're looking for".  Whatever you do, don't go into talking about "somebody else" - you don't want to get into the minefield of mentioning anybody else's weaknesses.<br><br>A properly-constructed behavioural question will require an answer with a STAR structure - if the interviewer hasn't described the STAR structure to you at the beginning of the interview, he's screwed up.  The STAR structure, originally developed by PDI, is:<br>Situation - where were you working and what was your role?<br>Task - the specific situation that you are describing to illustrate your point.  In particular, what issue(s) were you supposed to address?<br>Action - what did you do to address those issues and solve the problem?<br>Review - did your solution work?  Describe HOW the solution worked to solve the problem.<br><br>It's not a case of blowing your trumpet - it's a matter of logically making your case about why you're ideal for the job requirements.</div>
