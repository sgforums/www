Just be honest. If the job is just a "stepping-stone" just say it and explain the reason why. do it in a professional manner and convince the interview you are clear of your future directions - be it staying on the in job, or looking else where in 3-4 years time.<br><br>2.

I mean, out of all the bosses, we're bound to come across one or two whom we dislike or have a clash of personality/style.
