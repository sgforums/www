It's DDI - Development Dimensions International (http://www.ddiworld.com/) - they're the company that made structured interviewing a widesprread practice.<br><br>Their STAR srtucture is aimed at talking about the candidate's actual past experiences.  It's a lot better because it gives a more accurate measure of what the candidate's capable of - it's not so much what they do in the examples they provide, but in the way they analyse and describe their examples.  If that can do that well, they're showing that they have a good grasp of the job requirement being looked at.  Personally, I don't buy into the "what would you do..." questions because it's simply too easy for the candidate to make up a good-sounding BS answer - I'd much sooner ask "what have you done?" because the best indicator of future performance is alwasy past performance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SL, you're right about the ang moh's being better at tooting their own horn.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If you work in an American firm with a high proportion of expatriates, you graudally learn to do that too, without wincing.  hehehe!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I've been on both sides of the table - I've been the candidate, as well as part of the interviewing team.  Some observations :<br><br>- NEVER appear scared!  I've seen candidates shivering, literally shivering.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Half your battle is lost already because what happens next would usually be stammering, stuttering, requesting simple questions to be repeated followed by a long lag time before an answer is given, etc.  A "What's happening, cat got your tongue?"  kinda situation.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>- Tell yourself that you're a professional and you're NOT DESPERATE for the job.  It's ugly when you see how desperate some candidates can be.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Sit back comfortably in your chair, be at ease, and remember that like neuros said, you're interviewing the interviewers as well because hey, you're a professional, you have a right to choose the best job and the best working environmnent for you too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  That will immediately up the ante on your side and change the entire 'tone' of the interview because then, the interviewers would know that here's someone who's interested in a career and professional development and not just a job.<br><br>-  Memorised 'stock' answers are blah!  The interviewers would have heard the same 'stock' answers a thousand times before you and if you give them the same ol' humdrum stuff, they'll immediately shut you off mentally and you'll be no different from the hundred before you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  So, dare to be yourself.  Offer answers that are unique because they're not the 'typical' answers.<br><br>Lastly, remember that there are lots of reasons why a candidate is not chosen for the job.  Sometimes, you'll be surprised, it has nothing to do with you even!  I know for a fact that there are firms in Singapore that go through the recruitment process even though they already have an internal candidate in mind who's snagged the job 99% already simply because it's a process / policy they have to adhere to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Sometimes, they choose someone less vibrant because they might think that the person would have a higher chance of staying on in the job, which might turn out to be pretty monotonous in reality.  Etc. etc.  I can give you a few other scenarios so yeah, don't take rejections personally because it might not even be about you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>One of the most challenging interviews I went for started with grouchy interviewers firing this question at me, straight-faced, 'So, tell us why we should hire you.'  I was  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  but kept my cool composure and I guess they liked my answer cause in the end, I got the job!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Have courage!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Can't remember which one we used but it was pretty interesting.  I had tons of fun sitting in the interviews, then administering the personality test and reading the analysis first.  hehehe!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Hey, SL, remember that job fit is very very important too.  Sometimes, we may not have the requisite experience or personality for a particular job and in such cases, it's best that we walk away from the job, instead of hankering after it.

Wat a waste of everyone time!!<br><br>Another thing is never be demoralised even being rejected.... there is always hope !!!<br></div></blockquote>Thx Sean for your good advice!!

I dunno why!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Or maybe it was because they were desperate for librarians in Singapore that they just took in anyone with the right qualifications, whereas here, they can afford to be more choosy cos there's so many of us around  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>How about those of you who are working overseas... do you think the interviewers don't 'grill' you so much in Singapore compared to overseas?</div>
