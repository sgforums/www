              <p>Frankston... I went there a few weeks ago.  The Frankston train station surrounds is quite bustling. </p>
              <p>I think if you get hold of a street directory, and go online to Metlink's tram-train-bus guide, you can get around quite easily.  I plan my trips these days using these simple tools.  It can feel quite daunting at first, but don't get intimidated, and systematically go about it, you'll soon find it's child's play.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Been to Melbourne City yet?  I gather you must have watched the movie in Highpoint Shopping Mall?</p>

              <p>Welcome to Melbourne.  Hope you had a pleasant stay in Melbourne.</p>
              <p>Frankston is long train ride from the city , I hope your friend that you're staying with has a car to take you around.</p>
              <p>Mornington Peninsula is a pretty place and there are few wineries around the areas if you're interested in wine.  You can also catch the ferry from Sorrento to Queenscliff.  Arthur seat is also another place you can go although the chairlift is no longer in operation.</p>
              <p>Anyway, have fun! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

Highpoint Shopping Centre is about an hour away from my place. I am currently at Leawarra station but the service is pretty limited. lol. I have walked the streets at Frankston at night but i don't see anything scary like my friend advertised. But one thing for sure that the grafitti around is plentiful. They're everywhere.! just like the pretty australian babes around ( but i find that some are abit on the plump side =D ) I need a car to get around man! omg..!</p></div>

              <p>Well, not all Aussies are that rude.  There are a few really polite and sweet ones. </p>
              <p>Actually, it's hard to talk about 'Aussies' because there's not one homogeneous race that makes up 'Aussies'.  An Aussie is simply anyone from any part of the world that happens to hold Australian citizenship so it's really hard to lump them all together and make one blanket judgement as such.  I find that generalisations are hard to apply here, as the people are far too diverse and the circumstances are too varied. </p>
              <p>Please do not be one of those really silly people who go around thinking that it's safe and not heed the warnings of well-meaning residents because all it takes is one split second of bad judgement to land you in deep trouble!  Regret is always too late and I'd rather be forewarned than to reflect on hindsight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Hello there, i went out to the city on Anzac Day. Luckily my friend drove into the city area so i am able to avoid the crowds. Unfortunately parking is a nightmare and due to my friend being a countrybumkin he din know where are the places to park. So after going in circles for like forever we found a spot and went to the river side to see the 'fire' by the river. That place reminds me of Singapore River, only like 10 times better atmosphere, people and the ambience! WOAH! Beautiful!</p>

              <p>Hmm... the only 'fire' by the river in the city that I can think of is Southbank, where there are these flaming torches outside the Crown Casino by the Yarra Riverfront. </p>
              <p>I had a friend who lived on the 28th floor of Freshwater Place and we used to lie on the carpeted floor, looking down at the crowds walking along the Crown Casino and every hour or so, when the flames ignited, we could hear the Whoooosh!! and then sense the fierce fire casting an orangey glow and pixie shadows all around us.  Hehehe!  I called it the fire-breathing dragons.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Life here?  It's getting tougher.</p>
              <p>In yesterday's newspaper, a two-bedroom house in Richmond sold for A$760,000 this month.  Thing is, in 1996, the same house went for A$186,500 and in 1988, A$137,000.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  I don't think the price increase is due to renovations and improvements done to the interior.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Property prices have become pretty crazy here over the past year.</p>
              <p>Also in the same paper, "Inflation triple the official rate : Soaring prices have many families struggling to put food on the table".  Examples were given, first price is for April 2007, second one's for April 2008, in A$ :</p>
              <p>Toilet Paper, 8 x 190 sheets, $6.57 to $7.12 (pray for no diarrhoea!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">);</p>
              <p>Frozen 1kg Chicken, $3.55 to $6.05;</p>
              <p>White Bread, $3.23 to $3.60;</p>
              <p>500g Butter, $3.58 to $4.25;</p>
              <p>500g Processed Cheese, $4.85 to $5.92;</p>
              <p>1 Dozen Eggs, $4.26 to $4.95;</p>
              <p>150g Instant Coffee, $7.05 to $8.80; and</p>
              <p>1 kg Laundry Detergent, $5.75 to $6.53.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And again, in the same paper, "Rising petrol prices have triggered a crime wave across Melbourne".  Increasingly, it's been reported that people who pump up on petrol and then drive away without paying are mom's driving station wagons with kids inside and no longer just hooligans.  Some of them use false plates too, to escape being caught on security camera. </p>

              <p>Victoria Market, and most of the other markets like the Prahran Market, the South Yarra Market, the Richmond Market, etc are often very much cheaper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png">  That's where you can get apples for A$1.20 / kg if they are in season, or cherries for $6.00 / kg and even a dozen huge, plump blushing mangoes for $10 or less!  Since you're not driving yourself around, it'll be tough to lug all those fruits and vegetables around on public transport so just stick to whatever's most convenient for you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Should you have a craving for Mee Pok or Wanton Mee, you can head down to Singapore Chom Chom along Bourke Street, near Target Central.  If you crave Hainanese Chicken Rice, or Laksa, head over to Old Raffles Place on Johnson St in Collingwood.  If you crave chi char, Pacific House Restaurant just opened a branch in a street right next to QV Central... hmm... Lonsdale?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  Laksa Yong Tau Fu is available in the food court in Crown Casino and is pretty tasty although the one at Boxhill's Dai Pai Tong is still my favourite. </p>
              <p>Don't forget to try the Lix Gelati at Melbourne Central!  Their smallest scoop is a three-scoop on a cup / cone and it costs only A$4.50 or so.  Buy one, then hop across the road to sit outside the Melbourne Library to enjoy your ice-cream, and watch the world go by.  And no matter what you do, DO NOT feed the seagulls, because they will then cling to you and harrass you no end for more scraps!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>Don't leave Melbourne without visiting one of the Vietnamese restaurants to eat a steaming hot bowl of Pho!  Also don't leave without eating baked-on-the-spot pizza from one of them hole-in-the-wall Greek / Italian joints, which usually turns out to be way more delicious than Pizza Hut.  And then, there's Souvlavki, which you must try at least once.  Not to mention the Schnitzels, esp if you love cheese.  There's a famous Korean restaurant opposite Melbourne Central that sells really authentic Korean food too, should you be feeling cold and want to tuck into a bowl of hot Samgyetang (Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup).  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>And even at McD's, try the McFeast and find out why the beef patties here taste so much better than back in SG.  Even the McChicken Deluxe tastes awesome!</p>
