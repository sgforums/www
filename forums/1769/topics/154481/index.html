            <div class='col-md body'>Got this in an email... thought some of these were quite true!  Anyway, just wanted to share it with you all <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>========================================<br><br>If a man wants you, nothing can keep him away. If he doesn't want you, nothing can make him stay.<br><br>Stop making excuses for a man and his behavior. Allow your intuition (or spirit) to save you from heartache.<br><br>Stop trying to change yourself for a relationship that's not meant to be.<br><br>Slower is better. Never live your life for a man before you find what makes you truly happy.<br><br>If a relationship ends because the man was not treating you as you deserve then heck no, you can't "be friends". A friend wouldn't mistreat a friend.<br><br>Don't settle. If you feel like he is stringing you along, then he probably is.<br><br>Don't stay because you think "it will get better." You'll be mad at yourself a year later for staying when things are not better.<br><br>The only person you can control in a relationship is you.<br><br>Avoid men who've got a bunch of children by a bunch of different women. He didn't marry them when he got them pregnant, why would he treat you any differently?<br><br>Always have your own set of friends separate from his.<br><br>Maintain boundaries in how a guy treats you. If something bothers you, speak up.<br><br>Never let a man know everything. He will use it against you later.<br><br>You cannot change a man's behavior. Change comes from within.<br><br>Don't EVER make him feel he is more important than you are...even if he has more education or in a better job. Do not make him into a quasi-god. He is a man, nothing more nothing less.<br><br>Never let a man define who you are.<br><br>Never borrow someone else's man. If he cheated with you, he'll cheat on you.<br><br>A man will only treat you the way you ALLOW him to treat you.<br><br>All men are NOT dogs.<br><br>You should not be the one doing all the bending... compromise is two way street.<br><br>You need time to heal between relationships...there is nothing cute about baggage... deal with your issues before pursuing a new relationship.<br><br>You should never look for someone to COMPLETE you... a relationship consists of two WHOLE individuals. Look for someone complimentary, not supplementary.<br><br>Dating is fun...even if he doesn't turn out to be Mr. Right.<br><br>Make him miss you sometimes...when a man always know where you are, and you're always readily available to him - he takes it for granted.<br><br>Never move into his mother's house. Never co-sign for a man. Don't fully commit to a man who doesn't give you everything that you need.<br><br>Keep him in your radar but get to know others.<br><br>Share this with other women and men (just so they know)... You'll make someone smile, another rethink her choices, and another woman prepare.<br><br>They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them and an entire lifetime to forget them.</div>
