              <p>Here in the states, when you buy a new car, your new license plates take about a month to be mailed out to you. Once you receive them, you should immediately install them on the car. My beef is, many people just install their plate either the front or back end! Wassup with that? Driving around with the dealer's name on your license plate is just stupid. Another guess is that they can't be caught on film when they run red lights since there are no license plates on the bloody car. *%&amp;()#$_%&amp;)%&amp;)&amp;%#!!!!!</p>

              few of the same questions he's been asking me repeatedly and which
              he should already know the answers to, just to see if his brain's
              been messed up in some way.  He managed to answer everything
              correctly, so I told him, "Strange, you know the answer to all your
              questions already... I wonder why you keep repeating them.  Oh
              well, at least, it's not some brain injury!"   *sweet
              smile... </p>
              <p>He didn't know whether to smile back, or feel insulted. 
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">  But he did shut up... for the next half
              hour only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p>Update on this same man... a combination of him refusing to rest for the next three days post-op, the morphine in his system, and possibly his underlying psychological problem, made him extremely confused and agitated by Day 3.  He apparently squirmed and tried to get out of bed (possibly doing much harm to his just-operated-on back), tried to yank out all his tubes, including his own urinary catheter, which was somehow reinserted wrongly by the nurse, ending up in his prostate and draining out fresh blood in the process <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> !!!), finally had to call in a Urologist to reinsert the violently yanked-out urinary catheter, and he became psychotic, hallucinating and not making much sense.  As a result, in an attempt to prevent him from hurting himself further, we had to give him Haloperidol, which is a psychotic meds and acts as a sedative.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>Jia Lat!  Luckily he's not a young steed liao cause I'm sure his balls probably suffered damage liao.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
