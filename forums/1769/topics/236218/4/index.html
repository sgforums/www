Line base and sides of deep 28 X 18 cm rectangular tin with baking paper, extending over all sides of the tin.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You really need a deep tin because if u use a thin one, the caramel layer(2nd layer) will be thick... and then when u remove from fridge, it's really difficult to separate the whole caramel slice from the baking paper... The Caramel will stick to the paper de! </span></span><br><br>2) Place the coconut, sugar and flour in a large bowl and mix together. Make a well in the centre.<br>Stir in melted butter and essence; mix well. Press mixture evenly into base of prepared tin.<br>Bake 12-15 min; remove slice from the oven before the edges begin to brown.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Beware if ur oven doesn't have a stable heating... some ovens heat up in the center first beside the sides... so keep a close watch.</span></span><br><br>3) TO MAKE TOPPING:<br>Place condensed milk, butter, golden syrup, and combined coffee and water in a small pan.<br>Stir over medium heat until miture boils.<br>Reduce heat and simmer, stirring, for another 5 min.<br>Pour caramel mixture over the cooked slice base.<br>Return tray to over and bake slice for another 10 min.<br>Remove from oven and set aside to cool in tin.<br><br>4) TO MAKE ICING:<br>Place the chocolate and butter in a small, heatpoof bowl.<br>Stand the bowl over a pan of simmering water.<br>Stir until chocolate and butter have melted and the mixture is smooth.<br>Spread icing evenly over the still-warm caramel layer of slice; smooth icing using a flat bladed knife. Refrigerate Caramel Slice until icing sets.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You can use any method to make the chocolate melt actually... I used <strong>Hershey Dark Chocolate</strong>. Please... use dark chocolate instead of sweetened one because Caramel is already sweet. If u use normal/sweetened chocolate, you'll find the slice too sweet to be eaten =x. </span></span><br><br>Cuting into squares or bars Lift carefully from tin, removing corner slice first.<br>Store Caramel Slice in an airtight container in a cool place for up to one week.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All these ingredients can be found in NTUC. I bought all of them in Jurong Point's NTUC, including Hershy Dark Chocolate for baking. </span></span><img src></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i stole this from the webbie of the guy who made bacon cereal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">Bacon Cheese Baconburger</span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Ingredients:</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb1.jpg"><br><br>The first thing you'll notice is two different types of bacon. You've got your thick sliced on the left and the traditional sliced on the right. The thin sliced was much fattier and I thought this might be necessary to help hold the patty together and excrete bacony goodness that would become the glue of my baconburger. I also opted for wheat buns and light Ranch dressing. We've all read about the health advantages of wheat bread over white bread, so that choice should be obvious. That white bread stuff will kill ya. Without wasting any time I began to slice the bacon into pieces roughly 1" in width:<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb2.jpg"><br><br>You're probably wondering how I turned bacon into ground bacon. I had initially wanted to buy a meat grinder for this, but after pricing them realized it was a little excessive for this project. Then I remembered that I own a food processor and that should do the job just fine. Grinding raw bacon was probably not a use my parents had thought of when they bought it for me.<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb3.jpg"><br><br>You may think you've done a lot of strange things in your life, but until you've put slices of raw bacon into a food processor at 10:30pm, you really haven't even scratched the surface of strange. Without a doubt, this was the oddest experience of my life. Even weirder than witnessing a homeless man arguing with a hot dog wrapper.<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb4.jpg"><br><br>Strike that. Pressing the "Pulse" button on my food processor and watching raw bacon being ground into tiny pieces was the strangest moment of my life. I'd write more, but there's no metaphor to properly describe this experience.<br><br>After grinding over a pound of bacon, I was left with a bowl of this:<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb5.jpg"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I couldn't imagine that I would shortly be eating that. It's kind of like when you first found out what hot dogs were made of and thought you could never eat another as long as you lived. Certainly an unsettling experience, but something we all get over. Just like I got over looking into a bowl of ground bacon.<br><br>The next step was to form the bacon into patties. Originally I was planning on making one monster patty, but realized it would be nearly impossible to cook it all the way through. Raw pork and the human body don't agree with each other so well. So, I made two thinner patties:<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb6.jpg"><br><br>The one on the right was significantly thicker than the one on the left, but I was so proud of my work that I couldn't re-form them. I decided to practice with the large patty, learn from my mistakes and ideally perfect the thinner patty. To the best of my knowledge, nobody had done this before. I was venturing into uncharted culinary waters. I felt like the Christopher Columbus of bacon.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Method:</span></strong><br><br>Here's the first, thicker patty cooking:<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb8.jpg"><br><br>As expected, the first burger was a bit of a disaster. The patty came apart in a few places and was spitting hot grease at me continously. It was like a king cobra defending its territory, only with hot grease instead of venom. Tasty, tasty venom. I was able to perfect a method of flipping the bacon patty utilizing two spatulas.<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb9.jpg"><br><br>There is a lapse in pictures here. The only explanation that I can offer up is that I had inhaled a few days worth of sodium from the cooking fumes and was not thinking straight. I think I am the first person to have freebased bacon. Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of the second, thinner patty cooking. Nor are there any pictures of the many puddles of grease on my stove that later joined forces to form a grease lake.<br><br>Without further ado, I present The Bacon Cheese Baconburger:<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb10.jpg"></div>

Yes, the only way to top a baconburger topped with 2 slices of bacon is with a bacon mustard. Mustard with bacon in it. Talk about a timesaver. If anyone knows where to find mayo with bacon in it, please e-mail me.<br><br>If there's one thing I've learned in my years of bacon consumption, and I believe it's the only thing I've learned, is that you need a big glass of water at the ready:<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb12.jpg"><br><br>What good is a burger picture without a cross section view:<br><br><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~sjmaks/bcb/bcb13.jpg"><br><br>I can almost smell it.

But I haven't. I think I've made it abundantly clear that I will continue to do stupid things without any regard for my health.

              Funny thing happened while I was making dinner. My spahetti dinner turned into chicken parmesan. I was about to add minced meat into the sauce when I realise that I had none! Panic!!! Since I had to make chicken parmesan, I had to make bread sticks too.
