              <p>I'd say there's a flaw in that reasoning, Fatum.  There's
              yet to be any particularly compelling research that demonstrates
              the link between genetics and intelligence.  Hell, Spearman
              suggested the concept of <em>g</em> more than a century ago and
              nobody's yet been able to measure it.  Bottom line is that
              notwithstanding the political incorrectness of the concept, we
              still don't know enough to "breed for intelligence".</p>

              <p>well, the way I see it ged, it's like those scientists who say global warming and climate change is nothing to worry about, cos we have not determined whether there's a real link between human activities and climate change yet, so it's okay to go on burning hydro carbons, it's okay to keep stripping forests.</p>
              <p>I've been pretty stoked by this topic every since I picked up a copy of the bell curve yonks ago (yeah, more political incorrectness !)</p>
              <p>I still think what I've suggested is something instuitive. Like the puppy example I gave over in night owls last night. You want certain physical traits in a puppy, floppy ears, bushy tail etc, you get together a pair with these traits and breed them. the resulting pupsies, at least some of them, would exhibit the traits you want eh ? So why not humans ? And if physical traits can be inherited, why not mental ability ?</p>
              <p>I was quite disturbed when I read the bell curve of course, but that book and related publications I followed up with threw up a lot of uncomfortable correlations between socio-economic circumstances and cognitive abilities. Between teenage pregnancies, substance abuse, delinquency, family dysfunction, welfare dependency and cognitive ability. Oh I'm sure sociologist can come up with lots of other reasons, poverty cycle, pure bad luck etc etc. But I think the correlation is a fact, an uncomfortable one, but one that's got to be taken into account.</p>
              <p>True, offspring cognitive ability is probably a function of a lot of other more complex factors than just pure genetics alone, but I think we'd be deluding ourselves if we pretend genetics is a determinant in all other physical traits except mental ability. It's definitely part of the equation, the only real question should be just, by how much, eh ?</p>
              <p>I think if we're to get down from the ivory tower and not talk about breeding for the species and colonizing the stars etc, each of us has a duty to pass on the best genes we could to our intended offsprings, to give them the best headstart in life. Cos like is or not, the processor one is born with, is the one one is stuck with, for life. Not pretty, not handsome, nevermind, surgery can fix, not smart ? well, no one's invented a smart pill yet eh.</p>
              <p>Sure, people like to talk about the latter day's hard work being more important, but let's not kid ourselves, an overclocked 486 would never compare to the latest i7 core from intel, eh ? The potential is innate. A chap gifted with an i7 can choose to be lazy and not go to school etc, but we mustn't confuse that with the lack of innate potential eh ?</p>
              <p>And I think this line of thought is getting more and more important nowadays. Modern life is incresingly demanding, mentally. The IQ required to function in modern society has been inching ever upwards. Computers, hps, traffic systems, transport systems, our work tools, are all getting more and more complex as we move into an information based age. Our ability to thrive and prosper in this environment increasingly depend on our ability to process and react to information. Our IQ, in other words. People on the left side of the bell curve would be left further and further behind in this new world.</p>

              <p>that is not true even in the communist system.</p>
              <p>But yes, I think such inequalities are self-perpertuating to a certain extent in most societies. They don't call it the poverty cycle for nothing eh ? Of course, social dynamics would mean that every now and then, someone would break out from the cycle, or someone from outside the cycle would descend into it. But I think it's important to recognize all the drive factors in these cycles, not just from a pure sociological standpoint, if we were to address the issue.</p>
              <p>whether or not doctors are "more useful" than farmers is besides the point. It depends on what your determinants are, but generally speaking, in modern society, can you not acknowledge that certain vocations which are more mentally demanding, brings you bigger economic rewards ? That's not the entire story of course, for we humans have free will and choice. We can chose to be slothful, we can chose a certain calling, a particular job. Being a doc would make you more than say, teaching, but the mental demands would be not much different. That's why not all mensa members are millionaires.</p>

              <p>but such farmers would be more efficient and successful than
              someone who just grunts and sweat and changkol, no ? ....</p>

              <p>Hmm.. there are places in the world where there isn't any test equipment to assess phosphate in soil, and therefore you are not able to analyze the quality of soil 'scientifically'</p>
              <p>And even in these places, there are farmers who through sheer powers of observation, innovation and hard work - manage to create decent farms to feed their families.</p>
              <p>So those with better tools and education available may achieve more - but does not mean they are equipped with better genes.</p>

              <p>well, that's only half the story, observation and innovation would require a certain mental capacity too, no ?</p>
              <p>It takes something to make the connection from the weather, soil observations, to improve corps yield, to devise new ways for irrigation, for pest control, for fertilizer etc etc.</p>
              <p>All things being equal, you put two equally hard working farmer in an equal plot of land, don't you think the chap who can observe better, refine better, improve better would yield more ?</p>
              <p>Actually, I think this is really part of the story of our species. That's how we progressed from hairy cavemen to modern life. Natural selection worked on other species' physical traits, but on our species, the mental one. That's how we, a hairless, rather weak biped could subjugate most of nature and colonize every corner of this planet. We don't have claws or fangs, we are not big enough to escape natural depredation, we as a species succeeded by our brains, not our physique.</p>

              <p>I sorta work with some people dealing with special needs and the numbers diagnosed with learning disorders keep increasing every year. partly its due to greater awareness of such conditions, and part of me thinks it might have to do with the increasing trend of people having children only in their late 30s to 40s. Many of these kids have both parents as highly educated white collar professionals. </p>

              <p>that is not true even in the communist system.</p>
              <p>But yes, I think such inequalities are self-perpertuating to a certain extent in most societies. They don't call it the poverty cycle for nothing eh ? Of course, social dynamics would mean that every now and then, someone would break out from the cycle, or someone from outside the cycle would descend into it. But I think it's important to recognize all the drive factors in these cycles, not just from a pure sociological standpoint, if we were to address the issue.</p>
              <p>whether or not doctors are "more useful" than farmers is besides the point. It depends on what your determinants are, but generally speaking, in modern society, can you not acknowledge that certain vocations which are more mentally demanding, brings you bigger economic rewards ? That's not the entire story of course, for we humans have free will and choice. We can chose to be slothful, we can chose a certain calling, a particular job. Being a doc would make you more than say, teaching, but the mental demands would be not much different. That's why not all mensa members are millionaires.</p>

              <p>well, that's only half the story, observation and innovation

              <p>It takes something to make the connection from the weather, soil

              <p>All things being equal, you put two equally hard working farmer

              <p>Actually, I think this is really part of the story of our
              species. That's how we progressed from hairy cavemen to modern
              life. Natural selection worked on other species' physical traits,
              but on our species, the mental one. That's how we, a hairless,
              rather weak biped could subjugate most of nature and colonize every
              corner of this planet. We don't have claws or fangs, we are not big
              enough to escape natural depredation, we as a species succeeded by
              our brains, not our physique.</p>

              <p>Natural selection is a long term series of randomised trials, over time,
               such randomised trials may reveal patterns of suitable traits that help survival of

              <p>true, power is perhaps, the only currency, but have you considered that process of getting into power ? what does it take, really, all things being equal ?</p>
              <p>true, if you perch yourself  on the ivory tower and think, you'll realize not everyone can afford to sit on the ivory tower, someone's got to sweat and do all the mule and grunt work.</p>
              <p>but would you want to do it ? .... or would you want your children to do it ?</p>
              <p>There are no "wrong" choices in life, that's what free will is all about. But our choices in life, like it or not, are limited to a certain extent by our innate cognitive ability. A person may chose to pursue his passion and chose to be, say, a social worker, a teacher or a biologist in africa, instead of say, a banker or a technoprenuer, you can spurn material rewards for something else, a higher calling, that is your choice.</p>
              <p>But this choice may not exist for people on the left side of the bell curve. To put it simply, it takes a certain something to be a highly paid banker, say, with the immense complexity of the modern banking system and all the pricing functions and mathematical models I've seen my friends work on. It's not something everyone can chose to be, you must have what it takes.</p>
              <p>Sad but true, this is the reality of life. And these are certainly very very provocative and uncomfortable thoughts. I'm only typing all these out here because I'm confident of the maturity of you chaps here. These are also likely dangerous thoughts, in the wrong sort of minds.</p>

              <p>of course, life is certainly more complex than that. There's genetic 
              mutation, there are sleeper genes that trigger certain desirable traits 
              or anomalies in people. The list goes on. What I'm saying is, while we 
              haven't worked out the exact mechanics of it, genetic inheritance is a 
              fact, whether it's for physical traits, or mental ones.</p>
              <p>A farmer 
              who wants some super cows, or a dog breeder who wants, the famous 
              example would be the tailess boxer, would cross breed the traits he 
              wants and after a while, he'll get em, that he has to cull off a certain
               percentage of calfs or pupsies with the wrong characteristics only 
              slightly obscure the fact that genetic inheritance is a fact. Yes, life 
              is a gamble, the most unlikely hand may win, or a sure bet may flop, but
               there are good odds and there are bad odds.</p>
              <p>eugenics as a policy would never happen, period. in anycase, 
              that's not the road I'm talking about, the road's a very personal one. 
              Of course, one may say, that takes away free choice, which is one of the
               basis of the human condition, no ?  But another of my point is many 
              people already make such a choice out of their own free will, 
              unconsiously, no ? Don't many ladies draw up a prereq list of desirable 
              traits in a boyfriend ? <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Of course, there are the exceptions, and the unlikeliest people would get together. But that's why they are exceptional ?</p>
              <p>From
               a macro perspective, such exceptions is good for the species, as it 
              introduces genetic variations across the pool that otherwise wouldn't 
              happen, It also makes for social dynamics, a healthy non-stagnant 
              society. But then, which parent wouldn't wish their offsprings to turn 
              out very smart ? And why is that so ? Is it because parents are aware 
              deep down, that intellectual ability is a key driver of later success ? 
              An indication of innate potential ?</p>
              <p>For sure, such a topic stinks
               very much of snobbery and elitism (ironically, one of the things I 
              forced myself to recognize early in life, is that I'm actually not very 
              smart, perhaps that's why I have an avid fascination with this area), 
              not to mention all the grossly politically incorrect connotations it 
              conjures up. That's why, for most people, our inbuilt egalitarian 
              instincts rejects this line of thought immediately.</p>
              <p>But I think we must be 
              cognizant of all the drive factors in the socio-economic cycles of a 
              society, if we were to effectively address such inequalities. This is 
              but just another facet of the problem, however disturbing it is to think
               about.</p>
