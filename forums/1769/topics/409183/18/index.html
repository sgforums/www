              <p>well thing is, NS doesn't stop after 2.5 years for a large group
              of people, reservist is part of national service commitment too
              mate.</p>
              <p>Just as we don't have a choice whether to serve or not, the
              people who have combat reservist duties, have to keep fit and pass
              IPPT every year, are sacrificing more than those who just serve
              their full time service and fark off, eh ?</p>
              <p>If you can think that men who've served at all should get more
              benifits than men, (and women), who didn't, why wouldn't you think
              it's fair for those whose NS commitment goes on for at least
              another decade beyond ORD ? Yes, 2.5 years is a big sacrifice ....
              but there are chaps who have to make even BIGGER sacrifices ON TOP
              of their own 2.5 years too, eh.</p>
              <p>As for reservist, you can always call up ns.sg and badger them

              <p>I'm not saying don't give anything to the reservist portion. I'm saying that if 3K is all for the 2.5/ 2 years and the reservist period is 2 times the compensation at 6 k, something is very wrong.</p>
              <p>Not sure about your perspective, but I see the 2.5 years of solid service as a bigger sacrifice than the reservist stint. </p>
              <p>Actually I also don't agree that "commanders" should get more but that's another problem.</p>

              <p>I'm not saying don't give anything to the reservist portion. I'm
              saying that if 3K is all for the 2.5/ 2 years and the reservist
              period is 2 times the compensation at 6 k, something is very
              wrong.</p>
              <p>Not sure about your perspective, but I see the 2.5 years of
              solid service as a bigger sacrifice than the reservist
              stint. </p>
              <p>Actually I also don't agree that "commanders" should get more

              <p>well, but you agree that people who have to bear reservist duties should get more eh .....</p>
              <p>I'm not really sure if I agree that "commanders" should get more either ... but then again, OCS or sispec is no cake walk either. Their reservist cycles and ICT lengths are also longer, typically by 2-3 days at least. It's not all honour and glory you know.</p>
              <p>I suppose if we want to differentiate to such an extent then it would be quite fair for combat side chaps and service side chaps to get different rates too. True, everyone serves the same length of time, but a chap who sits in an aircon orpid from 8-5, goes home everyday, and could go for night classes to upgrade himself spends his 2 years very differently from a chap in the infantry, say, who spends his weekdays running around in the jungle and sleeping in the mud and rain and burning multiple weekends pulling guard and going through live fire exercises. And if you factor in the fact that the former just serves his time, and burns his uniform and leaves the military behind forever, while the latter is looking at annual IPPTs, RTs and ICTs for at least 10 years ........</p>

              <p>The OCS and sispec and such might be tougher, but the length of time wasted is the same. And hey, at least they get to exercise some leadership and people management skills that might be useful for later + they already earn more in ns. </p>
              <p>I think the main thrust for this "compensation" is for the opportunities lost and time wasted, not the efforts put in. If you want to compensate for effort, do it at the allowance end where you can differentiate based on vocation, rank, and such.</p>
