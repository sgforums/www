              <p>oh oh.. something came up when sis's friends visited on saturday
              evening...</p>
              <p>it's about primary schools....</p>
              <p>something very disturbing is happening in schools...</p>
              <p>teaching is now outsourced??</p>
              <p>her children are now told that they have to pay $120 per subject
              per month for some vendor to come and teach them their lessons
              during school hours... the teachers of the class sit behind the
              class and supervise everything... if the children don't want to pay
              the $120 per subject, they are to "stay at home"</p>
              <p>the cost is in addition to the actual school fees</p>
              <p>the actual teachers only do the "remedial classes" and that is
              only 3 weeks (or maybe days) before exams...</p>
              <p>for those who think this is a private school, it is not.. it's a
              neighbourhood school...</p>
              <p>then her children's form teacher keeps being "on MC" almost
              every Monday and Friday... she's a "parent volunteer" so she gets
              roped in to become some kind of free "relief teacher" to look after
              the children.. especially when there is swimming PE...</p>
              <p>the mom subsequently got "blacklisted" as a volunteer when she
              complained about this as she said that a teacher has to be present
              during the swimming PE in case there are any accidents and children
              get hurt..</p>
              <p>also, seems like the school staff is threatening the students
              not to report stuff.. heck! the school staff is also threatening
              her not to report or complain about things in the school too...</p>
              <p>but what shocked me was the "outsourcing" of teaching...
              WTF???</p>

              <p>Nevermind that. Today's ST features one RP student whose mother was singlehandedly raising him and 2 siblings on $500 a month. Now he's getting an extra $90 a month through an aid scheme.</p>
