              <p>well, the way I see it ged, it's like those scientists who say
                  global warming and climate change is nothing to worry about, cos we
                  have not determined whether there's a real link between human
                  activities and climate change yet, so it's okay to go on burning
                  hydro carbons, it's okay to keep stripping forests.</p>
              <p>I've been pretty stoked by this topic every since I picked up a
                  copy of the bell curve yonks ago (yeah, more political
                  incorrectness !)</p>
              <p>I still think what I've suggested is something instuitive. Like
                  the puppy example I gave over in night owls last night. You want
                  certain physical traits in a puppy, floppy ears, bushy tail etc,
                  you get together a pair with these traits and breed them. the
                  resulting pupsies, at least some of them, would exhibit the traits
                  you want eh ? So why not humans ? And if physical traits can be
                  inherited, why not mental ability ?</p>
              <p>I was quite disturbed when I read the bell curve of course, but
                  that book and related publications I followed up with threw up a
                  lot of uncomfortable correlations between socio-economic
                  circumstances and cognitive abilities. Between teenage pregnancies,
                  substance abuse, delinquency, family dysfunction, welfare
                  dependency and cognitive ability. Oh I'm sure sociologist can come
                  up with lots of other reasons, poverty cycle, pure bad luck etc
                  etc. But I think the correlation is a fact, an uncomfortable one,
                  but one that's got to be taken into account.</p>
              <p>True, offspring cognitive ability is probably a function of a
                  lot of other more complex factors than just pure genetics alone,
                  but I think we'd be deluding ourselves if we pretend genetics is a
                  determinant in all other physical traits except mental ability.
                  It's definitely part of the equation, the only real question should
                  be just, by how much, eh ?</p>
              <p>I think if we're to get down from the ivory tower and not talk
                  about breeding for the species and colonizing the stars etc, each
                  of us has a duty to pass on the best genes we could to our intended
                  offsprings, to give them the best headstart in life. Cos like is or
                  not, the processor one is born with, is the one one is stuck with,
                  for life. Not pretty, not handsome, nevermind, surgery can fix, not
                  smart ? well, no one's invented a smart pill yet eh.</p>
              <p>Sure, people like to talk about the latter day's hard work being
                  more important, but let's not kid ourselves, an overclocked 486
                  would never compare to the latest i7 core from intel, eh ? The
                  potential is innate. A chap gifted with an i7 can choose to be lazy
                  and not go to school etc, but we mustn't confuse that with the lack
                  of innate potential eh ?</p>
              <p>And I think this line of thought is getting more and more
                  important nowadays. Modern life is incresingly demanding, mentally.
                  The IQ required to function in modern society has been inching ever
                  upwards. Computers, hps, traffic systems, transport systems, our
                  work tools, are all getting more and more complex as we move into
                  an information based age. Our ability to thrive and prosper in this
                  environment increasingly depend on our ability to process and react
                  to information. Our IQ, in other words. People on the left side of
                  the bell curve would be left further and further behind in this new
                  world.</p>

              <p>One very important factor in the success of these individuals is motivation - and no one knows how that can be passed on or nurtured. An intelligent person may not necessarily be more motivated than the next person, and so his potential never gets discovered.
