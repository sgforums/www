              <p>Okay.... I've run into some serious problems....</p>
              <p>As you guys know, FS and I can't get a loan for a house because of our lack of income taxes... So we came up with a plan: her mom would buy a resale flat, we would live in the flat until graduation, then either buy over the flat from her mom or get another one once either of us got a job.</p>
              <p>That plan was working well, and we already got a flat in Pasir Ris. The owner was going to file the official papers on 1st September, which would be the 5-year anniversary of her flat...</p>
              <p>Of course, that was until the new housing measures were put into place. The problem is, her mom already owns private property and cannot buy any HDB flats. We were just two days shy of filing the official papers for buying that Pasir Ris flat! </p>
              <p>Now suddenly, we can't buy that flat anymore (her mom already has private property), and we can't buy <em>any</em> flat for that matter.....!!! </p>
              <p>*hyperventilating*</p>
              <p>Oh, and HDB turned down our appeals!</p>
