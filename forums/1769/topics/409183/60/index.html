              <p>I also submitted a full 1000-word formal letter of protest to
              one of the bank branch's managers.</p>
              <p>The bank manager has just called me and he promised me, on his
              honour, that a full investigation would be carried out. I told him
              that reneging on that promise would lead to me closing down my
              accounts and parking my money with their competitors. A full airing
              of this whole fiasco in the media would then follow.</p>
              <p>It sucks that I'm doing all this over one stupid chequebook. But
              they forced my hand.</p>
