              <p>No. 1 was justified, but No. 2 is really minor. You could've said, 'You may address me as *** in future, and I would prefer it that way.'</p>
              <p>I was also confused as a freshman as to how to address my lecturers. They told me it's normal to address them by their first names in an art environment. But it's probably not the same in the science, maths and engineering departments.</p>

              <p>I actually don't mind my students calling me by name without a 'Mr' in front. Some of them call me 'Sir', and I find that weird, but at least it sounds respectful. But 'tutor' just doesn't sound right.</p>
              <p>More to the point, I was amused at how the fella thinks that he can email me just before 12 midnight for a 10 am consultation the next morning. Basket.... he thinks I can just suka-suka clear my schedule at such short notice ah? </p>

              <p>if he thinks you can be contactable by email at all times, then he's better be contactable by email at all times...</p>
              <p>that being said, i can be contactable by my gmail at all times because of my Android phone which asked me for my gmail.. and actually buzzes me when i get an email through there</p>

              <p>Well, I did tell them to just call me by my name in my first lesson.</p>
              <p>I still find it weird that the fella called me 'tutor'. It's just like how you do not address a professor who's teaching you as 'lecturer'. You call him 'Prof Tan', for instance, or 'Sir', if you forget his name.</p>
              <p>But I guess I should've gone a little easy on the kid. </p>
