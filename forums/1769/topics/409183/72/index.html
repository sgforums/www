              <p>well, it is true enough that the planet, or rather, our species are breeding ourselves out of our planet.</p>
              <p>But then, you excusing yourself from the gene pool is not going to stop other from breeding ... infact, your place in the gene pool might just be filled up by people who would not, or do not have the cognitive capacity to think and reason that way ....</p>
              <p>all the pity isn't it ? ..... I think we'll be more farked that way ....</p>
              <p>if people are going to breed anyways .... then I think it's the duty of the smarter ones to breed more, whether it's for the country, for the species, or for the planet. ..... if it comes down to us humans having to colonize the stars, we'd be needing a lot of rocket scientists, literally ..... then elevating the gene pool becomes more important ..... we can't have someone with the cognitive horse power of a lawn mower building spaceships after all, eh ?</p>
