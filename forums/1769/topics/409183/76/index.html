              <p>One very important factor in the success of these individuals is
              motivation - and no one knows how that can be passed on or
              nurtured. An intelligent person may not necessarily be more
              motivated than the next person, and so his potential never gets
              discovered. It's one thing to have smart people, and other to make
              them contribute effectively.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>oh I don't dispute that. I also don't dispute the fact that being smart does not automatically means one will "succeed" later in life.</p>
              <p>I'm also not talking about whether a person is "good", or "nice". That's another issue altogether.</p>
              <p>What I'm talking about is innate potential. A super motivated (overclocked) chap with a plodding 486 processor would only be able to "achieve" so much, a less motivated person with an inborn i7 core could get away with a lot less effort, to "achieve" the same, all things being equal. The latter's innate potential surpasses that of the former, all things being equal, if they put in an equal amount of effort, who would "achieve more", say, academically ? This is a fact of life, sad, but true. We shouldn't pretend otherwise. A smart person can chose to be lazy and be bunched together by the system with the people with lesser cognitive abilities but the innate potential is still there.True, there are a lot of unschool ah beng towkays out there, but make no mistake, none of these towkays are fools.</p>
              <p>True, we say, people are gifted in other areas, some in music, the arts, etc, but I suspect that these are but another facet of intelligence, I've observed that a lot of musically inclined kids are also good at maths. I can certainly attest to this, having to learn the piano when I was younger, I sucked at the piano, and I sucked at maths too. It's mentally demanding to be able to keep up with the score and tinkle on the keyboard at the same time. I wouldn't put it below linear algebra.</p>
              <p>The "all things being equal" is important, because "success" (if we define success very narrowly as socio-economic well-being), depends on many external environmental factors too, then of course, there's pure luck, or destiny, and of course, free will.</p>
              <p>This has been a pretty interesting ramble guys. ^ ^ Maybe we should keep it till the potluck or PM or we may end up hijacking this thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15"></p>

              <p>Hmm.<span> </span> I can appreciate your
              enthusiasm, and at one level I would lean that way as
              well.<span> </span> However, there are a few factors that
              temper said enthusiasm.</p>
              <p>First, let's take a look at cases that defy the concept
              of eugenics.<span> </span> JFK Junior was a failure as a law
              student and a fashion dilettante before mistaking his plane for a
              submarine.<span> </span> The Hiltons have rightfully washed
              their hands of Paris, and Dubya - well, need I say more? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Let's look at the flip side.<span> </span> Hermann
              Einstein sold beds.<span> </span> Alexander Fleming, a
              farmer’s son.<span> </span> Anatoly Karpov, son of a factory
              worker.<span> </span> And those are just the famous
              ones.<span> </span> The people I work with have a mean
              education level of a Master’s, and all of them come from ordinary
              backgrounds.</p>
              <p>On one end of the scale, the argument against eugenics
              is, “just because you can doesn’t mean you
              should”.<span> </span> On the other end of the scale is, “how
              scary can this get?”.<span> </span> We’ve been here
              before.<span> </span> Berlin 1933-1945 is probably the example
              that comes to most people’s minds –Neitzsche said Uberman and
              Hitler turned it into the Untermenschen.<span> </span> Mind
              you, the Krauts aren’t the only guilty ones; for more than 50 years
              the Americans made a policy of sterilising non-ideal
              citizens.<span> </span> It’s not just that eugenics has been
              proven time and time again to not work – the idea is plain
              dangerous.</p>
              <p>The flip-side of socio-economic status aspect of the
              Bell curve highlights the “nurture” aspect of
              intelligence.<span> </span> Put this together with the fact
              that physiologically, higher cognitive ability is associated with
              the density of connections between neurons, which in turn are
              influenced with the amount of stimulation that the brain is exposed
              to, and a much more convincing influence on intelligence is how
              intellectually stimulating the environment is, especially in early
              childhood, and hell, nutrition may have something to do with it as
              well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bottom line is that on philosophical, logical and
              physiological grounds, there’s a case against eugenics.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>well mate, I'll concede happily on the philosophical grounds, and physiology is your balliwick of course, but really, wouldn't you agree with me, as I've put it, that if genetics is at work with all other physical traits, wouldn't genetic inheritance be at work for mental ability as well ?</p>
              <p>True, there are lots of other external factors at work, a pregnant woman may chose to drink and give her child infant alcohol syndrome and mental retardation, they may be exposed to pollutants, their environment may lack environmental stimuli, lack of nutrition, the education system.</p>
              <p>But the keywords are, of course, all things being equal ? I think the biggest question should not be whether genetic inheritance is at work, but how big a role genes has, in determining a person's innate mental ability eh ?</p>
              <p>I would love to pick your brains about this, since this really is your balliwick, let's take it to PM eh, I have a feeling such a discussion makes some uncomfortable, whether we plead the ivory tower or not.</p>

              <p>dude.. have you ever thought that your eating inhuman amounts of meat causes problems to your "plumbing" so much so that you have a horrific disposition of sharing everything with us?</p>
              <p>maybe you should do the logical thing for the first time in your life and eat a balanced diet...</p>
              <p>actually, thinking about it, eating so much meat is going to cause your tadpoles to be horrifically damaged... considering the sheer amount of antibiotics and steroids they use for "factory farmed animals" these days</p>
