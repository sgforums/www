I have a gut feeling its cos I went with another friend to JB yesterday (but did not plan to go with her) but... since last week I have already told her, if there's anywhere she wanna go, let me know, its her birthday I'm free to go out with her but she say she doesn't want to take leave, meet for dinner is enough. THen suddenly, after I told her I went to JB yesterday, she told me to call off the dinner for today. Even after I told her all of us looking forward to celebrate her birthday with her, and that another friend made reservations liao, she was very adamant.</p>
