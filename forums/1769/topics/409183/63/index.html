              <p>Interesting situation:</p>
              <p>I added this atas coffee house in my FB upon recommendation by a friend who said the coffee is really good. They serve gourmet coffee.</p>
              <p>Yesterday I saw their status update: "Tip $1 for 2 lattes! Might as well just walk to the counter to tell us our coffee sucks! We run a decent biz here!"</p>

              <p>"so cheapskate!!"<br>"These people think they at KOPITIAM drink kopi see issit?"<br>"They abuse your quality!"</p>
              <p>Now, I have never been there, don't know how much they sell their coffee for, and how exactly atas their environment is like - but bitching about a tip in a group made up of customers/ potential customers is really.. -facepalms-</p>
              <p>So I added my comment</p>

              <p>Maybe cos all those who visit are the atas people who enjoy tipping lor... the best part is from all the customers who jump on the wagon criticising the $2 tip as cheapskate. $2 not money meh! $2 also somebody's hard earned money what!</p>
              <p>I find tipping such a mental strain. Just charge it into the total bill lah.. i am a simple person.</p>

              <p>that's why countries that do not have this practice don't have service charge. </p>
              <p>but its an unspoken rule in those countries that you have to tip around 15 to 20 percent of your bill, otherwise the waiters end up making less than the minimum wage.</p>
              <p>the big joke is that 'service charge' in singapore goes right into the pockets of the owner, and none is given to the staff.</p>
