              <p>What kind of plays?</p>
              <p>I've been to a few but they tend to be larger productions like Boeing Boeing for example....others would be considered musicals like Sing to the Dawn and a few others (can't remember the titles)</p>

              <p>i was thinking of the below for example..</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Presented by SRT Mainstage<br>Fort Canning Park<br>From 7 May 2009</p>
              <p>Starring (in alphabetical order)<br>Adrian Pang, Jason Chan, Michael Corbidge, Wendy Kweh and Julie Wee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Love, laughter, conspiracy and drama.</p>
              <p>'Shakespeare in the Park’ returns this May with a sumptuous take on one of the greatest comedies of all time.<br><br>Bring a picnic basket and blanket and lie under the stars as the park comes to life like you have never seen before.<br><br>In 2007, over 20,000 people came to SRT’s landmark production of A<em> Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> at Fort Canning Park. This year’s <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> promises to be twice as much fun.<br><br>Whether you want to enjoy a wonderful romantic comedy, be part of a historic event, or just have a picnic, this will be a spectacular evening for young and old.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p><em>
              </em></p><p><em>Much Ado about Nothing</em></p><em>
              is of one of Shakespeare's best known, light-hearted comedies. The play follows the obstacle filled courtships of two romances - Hero and Claudio, and Benedick and Beatrice. The brilliance of the main plot witnesses Hero and Claudio falling in love at first sight; but as with any immediate attraction, they have a lot to learn about each other. This is accompanied with the humorous bickering of Beatrice and Benedick in their "merry war" of the sexes. </em><p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The quintessential romantic comedy is layered with witty and hilarious character interaction between the two couples, as well as a streak of darkness from Don John who conspires against Hero and Claudio’s wedding. In the end though, does it all turn out to be "much ado about nothing"?</p>
              <p>Directed by <strong>Edward Dick</strong><br>Directed the hugely successful tour of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> for Shakespeare's Globe as well as <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> for the Sydney Theatre Company. He also directed <em>Twelfth Night</em> for Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre.<br></p>

              <p><span class="body1">A Spy for a Spy<br>A Night of mystery, mayhem and a license to Murder <br><br>Do you always win at ‘Cluedo’? If so then you will love ‘A Spy for a Spy’ - the first murder mystery dinner theatre event to be staged in the intimate setting of the 150 seat Black Box Theatre at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Saturday the 21st of March 2009. This fun event combines an evening at the theatre with a 4 course buffet menu of western fare as you witness the murder and mayhem of Spy for a Spy. Picking up clues along the way, you also stand the chance to win a prize for correctly guessing the identity of the murderer from amongst a cast of sinister suspects.<br><br>The evening commences with guests invited to enjoy a welcome drink as they gather to mingle with the Spy for a Spy characters. The best-dressed couple wearing 1920’s costumes (optional) will win a great prize! Food is then served as the professional and talented cast from ‘Masquerade’ tells this intriguing tale of murder and betrayal. The lights go down, a murder is committed and a thrilling night of sleuthing begins.<br><br>The plot<br><br>It is 1929, Europe and all is unwell. Famous scientist, Hubert Von Finkenstein plays a dangerous game, having offered sensational results of his top secrets to the highest bidder. Residing in the British Embassy in Geneva, he is the target of spies, like the formidable Elsa Poppin – who will stop nothing to secure his research for their paymasters among the rival powers.<br><br>Dumkopf, is man of many parts (not all his own!): As Von Fink’s faithful assistance, his duties include serving as a ‘guinea pig’ to Von Fink’s pioneering experiments in genetics and replacement surgery.<br><br>Tonight is the reception for the new ambassador, Sir Hugh Carlton yet Bunty Farquhar, the recently widowed wife of the former ambassador and Piers Proudfoot , the ambitious Vice-Consul, seem oddly nervous. As the lights go off and someone falls down dead, a murder will be committed!<br><br>Be the super sleuth to uncover who has done the dirty deed to win handsome prizes.<br><br>Tickets include a fabulous 4-course western buffet dinner, a welcome drink (soft drinks or sparkling wine), clue packs and show! Do we need to say more?<br></span></p>

              <p>i've been to one of those "dinner &amp; mystery" ones..</p>
              <p>enjoyed the play.. the "food" was crap tho' <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>but i can't for the life of me remember what it was..</p>
              <p>i've seen Midsummer Night's Dream on 2 occasions.. one was in Melbourne in the park.. it was good.. you brought a picnic, it was night, the place was turned into one part human world, the other the faerie world.. there was audience interaction too.. we sat on the blanket, ate some cold chicken and drank some wine while watching the play..</p>
              <p>the other time was in Singapore when an experimental lot came.. Industrial meets Shakespeare... 3 sets of scaffoldings and ropes were all the plots.. the actors were more acrobats than actors but they delivered their lines perfectly while going up and down the scaffoldings and ropes... amazing..</p>
              <p>let's see in the future if there are plays.. i won't mind catching them if my schedule from work permits</p>
