              <p>that's not the point, the point is that we are being asked to foot the cost of social security policies and more to the point, we are being asked to contributed to an ever widening liquidity pool from which only one in two of us would ever benefit, and in a very limited way too ..... the goverment has always been dismissive about "egalitarian" ideals ..... that's why we have the CPF ... you earn more, you have more money to enjoy when you retire .... but of course, with CPF, you get your money back after a certain age ... I can only guess at the utility of a huge pool of money from which half of the participants can only contributes towards, but is unlikely to ever enjoy any of it (get what i'm trying to say ? )... when you join the pool ... what you put in ceases to become yours ... when you die, that's it ... the money doesn't go back to your descendants .... ....</p>

              <p>Fantastic point! </p>
              <p>I think they are getting "feedback" and advice from the financial advisors who help to invest the CPF monies to generate profit, which translates into more income and more wealth for Singapore, Inc.  Witholding the timely payout of CPF to the people, they hold on to the fund, hoping to use the money to generate even more money, for who, I don't know, but obviously, not for you and for me. </p>
              <p>This sounds really preposterous!  At first, the CPF was started to help people save for their post-retirement years, pay for their HDB flats, and pay for healthcare.  By denying retirees good and timely access to their accounts, HOW are they going to retire comfortably, having put their faith in the scheme right from the get-go?  Wait... they didn't have to put their faith in the scheme in the first place, there was simply no choice! </p>

              <p>I think two things NEED to happen :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#1 : Singaporeans need to take care of their own finances, and take total responsibility for their financial decisions and the resultant outcome, be it good or bad.  Which means, to stop kpkb'ing and trying to pass the buck to the govt when bad things happen.  It was your decision, deal with the consequences.  It is our responsibility to embark on the necessary groundwork to become financially saavy enough to safeguard OUR savings and OUR investments.</p>
              <p>Thing is, you listen to the way lots of Singaporeans talk - they sound like the whole world owes them a living.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  No need to conduct whatever surveys or studies, just step into any kopitiam in the heartlands, or even the kopitiams in the shopping malls, and just listen in to the conversation that goes on around you.  A lot of kpkb'ing, a lot of times from people who don't really have a rat's ass what they are talking about.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">   It can be entertaining and amusing, but really sad.  What do they say about empty vessels and making noises? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#2 : The Government needs to just let go and stop acting like some appointed guardian by force.  Allow the citizens to make our own decisions.  Place the options on the table, and then WE choose, not shove the policies down our throats!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There will be those who are well-informed enough to take care of their own retirement funds, and those who aren't.  Key thing is, to cater to all and asunder by allowing choices.</p>

              <p>that's not the point, the point is that we are being asked to
              foot the cost of social security policies and more to the point, we
              are being asked to contributed to an ever widening liquidity pool
              from which only one in two of us would ever benefit, and in a very
              limited way too ..... the goverment has always been dismissive
              about "egalitarian" ideals ..... that's why we have the CPF ... you
              earn more, you have more money to enjoy when you retire .... but of
              course, with CPF, you get your money back after a certain age ... I
              can only guess at the utility of a huge pool of money from which
              half of the participants can only contributes towards, but is
              unlikely to ever enjoy any of it (get what i'm trying to say ? )...
              when you join the pool ... what you put in ceases to become yours
              ... when you die, that's it ... <strong>the money doesn't go back to your
              descendants .... ....</strong></p>

              <p>Lots of good points raised there, Fatum, but I'm concentrating on your last sentence...</p>
              <p>Increasingly so, there are Singaporeans like me who are single.  It's time for the govt to realise that there will be Singaporeans who reach retirement age WITH NO DESCENDANTS.  We may choose to have OUR money at OUR disposal then, and to enjoy in our retirement years, before we grow frail, sickly and immobile or stroke out and die.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Since we have no descendants to plan for, has it occured to them that we'd like to spend our twilight years in comfort, and to travel and fulfill whatever dreams we have that we weren't able to pursue when we were busy working, before we step over into the afterlife? </p>
              <p>LET US CHOOSE WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR MONEY, for goodness' sakes!!</p>

              <p>I concur with you, Rhonda. I feel slighted by a system that treats me
              as if I can't manage my money, even if its intentions to help those who
              can't are noble, and even if there are people who are really that immature.</p>
              <p>Full-time work is still another 3 years away for me, but I don't feel easy at all when even the sensible folks among us are disagreeing vehemently with it.</p>
