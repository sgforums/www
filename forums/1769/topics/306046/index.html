              <p><strong>Fancy a 'lifelong income scam'?<br>Loh Chee Kong</strong></p>
              <p><br>WHAT was floated as a risk-pooling annuity — which families will not get back if members fail to live beyond 85 years — could now turn out to be a refundable "lifelong income scheme" that starts dishing out monthly payments to members from the age of 80.<br>.<br>The reasons? Singaporeans do not want their money to fall into others' hands, and they do not believe they will live until 85.<br>.<br>Even the proposal's original title, "National Longevity Insurance Scheme", has gone out the window, to be replaced by what will now be known as the "National Lifelong Income Scheme" — and subject to the Government's green light, it will be managed by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board.<br>.<br>Professor Lim Pin, who chairs the committee tasked to craft the nuts and bolts of the plan, said: "The title, 'longevity insurance", does not give a positive connotation of longevity, right? If you die early, you'll lose out. Now, we've thought out a new name … Who doesn't want a lifelong income?"<br>.<br>He was speaking to journalists on Wednesday, in offering a sneak peek into his committee's recommendations submitted to the Government. The full recommendations will be unveiled on Feb 12, just ahead of Budget Day.<br>.<br>After more than four months of formal feedback gathering from some 600 people — on an emotive policy the Government acknowledges is a tough-sell to the masses — Prof Lim said two main issues stuck out.<br>.<br>One is the scepticism that one in two Singaporeans would live beyond 85, the hard statistics notwithstanding. Prof Lim said lowering the starting point for payouts to a "compromise" age of 80 would make it "easier" for people to accept the scheme.<br>.<br>He also noted, experts have also found "no robust data" to support the perception that the rich live longer and thus, should pay higher premiums.<br>.<br>Currently, CPF members can depend on payouts from their Minimum Sum until they reach 85. But should the Government accept the suggestion to allow annuity payouts from age 80, Singaporeans hitting 55 could choose the age at which they actually want to start receiving the monthly annuity payments, said Prof Lim.<br>.<br>Those already above 55 when the change kicks in would be allowed to opt in, but at a higher premium.<br>.<br>The second issue involved calls for refunds to be paid to the next-of-kin, should members die before reaching 85. "Refundability was a very important point," said Prof Lim, attributing this to the "Asian culture that you have to leave something for your family".<br>.<br>Without going into details, Prof Lim gave the assurance that families could get back the capital sum in the event of an early death. And should the member choose to forego the refund option, they could get a larger monthly payout.<br>.<br>Currently, some insurers offer refunds in their annuity schemes. For example, an NTUC Income customer can choose a "capital protected annuity" where the balance of the capital sum, minus monthly payments, is refunded to the next-of-kin should he die early. Only the interest earned is then left behind in the pool.<br>.<br>For the national scheme to provide a full refund, former chief executive of NTUC Income Tan Kin Lian estimated that the cost "will increase by 30 to 50 per cent".<br>.<br>Nominated MP Kalyani Mehta said it would be "reassuring" to Singaporeans for CPF to run the scheme, and "lowering the age to 80 would give people a better chance of enjoying the payouts".<br>.<br>But Society of Financial Services Professionals president Leong Sze Hian felt the recommended tweaks to the annuities plan did not address his basic worry: Whether the national scheme, given the more attractive annuity products on the market that the better-off can afford, would end up serving "a pool of poor people".<br>.<br>Pointing out how previous CPF plans, such as the Dependant and Home protection schemes, ended up being privatised or as poor cousins of financial products on the market, Mr Leong suggested the Government directly aid this group, who "already don't have much money in their CPF account in the first place".<br>.<br>Associate Professor Mehta concurred that she could "see the lower middle-income group struggling to get involved" and "how they can be facilitated to be part of the annuity plan is the biggest challenge ahead".<br>.<br>Inflation is another worry, said Mr Tan: "Many people consider the payout of $300 to be inadequate for today's cost of living. In 30 years' time, this sum will be so much smaller to serve the needs of the elderly at that time."<br>.<br>Still, Prof Lim had little doubt the public would be receptive. "Initially, there was unhappiness: the Government taking my money to do something else, things like that … all sorts of wild talk. Now we are saying we are ensuring you a lifelong income — that's a very big undertaking."</p>
