              <p>for this thing to be self sustaining, the inputs have to be larger than the outputs, of course ... that is to say .... other than the one or two octogenarians among us, this scheme is a loosing proposition ...  I may be insinuating something here, but just think of the utility of such a massive and ever growing pool of liquidity for the powers that be ! .... and based on the powers-that-be's track record on other massive funds, like the goverment investment funds and the monetary reserves, I'd say, there'll never be a time when the fund is "safe and self sustaining" ....</p>
              <p>this is the crux of the opposition to this scheme ..... and also, why should we be forcibily asked to take part in such a scheme, to be told how to spend our money ? ... this liquidity can be a big crimp on our life style, on our life choices ... that amount of money we put in could have been invested into a retirement business, a franchise for example ... to be invested in a child's education, an off spring's business venture, to buy a property overseas in a cheaper place, with lower cost of living .... etc etc ....</p>
              <p>this is totally ridiculous, we talk of moving away from the nanny state .. now we're being told where to put our money and what to do with it ... even the money that we earn is not all ours any more .....</p>
              <p>I really hope my constituency won't be a walk over again .... I am looking forward to exercising my political rights ...</p>
