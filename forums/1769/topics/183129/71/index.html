We were supposed to have spent last Xmas there but something came up and our tickets were put on hold. Hubby's granny is eager to have us back for a couple of weeks. We were originally going to up in August but we will be moving into navy housing early Aug.<br><br>I love the warm weather. Wonder how you can tahan the cold.

Funny now but so damn annoying when it was happening.<br><br>Last April, my mum visited us one last time in Japan. My sister's sister in law decided to tag along. Big mistake. This 40+ woman had a very pampered childhood and she hates the sun. Alamak, that time was cherry blossom season, we were all out enjoying the blossoms and the nice weather. Our friend buak'ed so much cream on her already white face, I swear she looked as white as a geisha. While we were enjoying the sights, there she was hurrying and scurrying to find a shaded area. When we were strolling, she would be running from shaded spot to shaded spot to shaded spot. What was interesting at first got irritating.<br></div>

Now I use sunblock on my face. In the summer I use an spf 50, in the winter spf 25. I do use sunblock on exposed arms and legs in the summer but this was a recent thing, started when I was in Japan. Before that we were in Hawaii and I was blissfully unaware.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I made the mistake of telling her that in Japan, many items have UV protection. Once she bought the UV brolly, she was married to it. When I told her my hat had UV protection, she commandeered it. When I told her that some clothes had it too, she wanted to buy but didn't. Only because she didn't bring alot of cash, thinking that she could use her credit card for everything. She had visited the touristy parts of Japan before and used her cc for everything. She couldn't do that in the part where I lived. Imagine, a rich woman with not enough money to buy stuff on holiday.  Agony!</div>

So chum! So now, we only use Banana Boat or Coppertone. My son and hubby are the fairer ones. But when both kids were young, they had the pale ang mo colouring. So cute to see *sigh* I was scrapping their baby pages yesterday and all the memories came flooding back. *sigh*</div>

There are some older ladies in my neighbourhood and I've seen them wearing that visor just walking on the street. They even have those long gloves that extend all the way up near the shoulder and wear that while driving.<br><br>You've *never* watched Star Wars?!?!? Well, hubby and I must be the only ones who've never watched Seinfeld so I guess we're in the same boat, almost?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

From August 05 when our stuff got packed in Japan to like a couple of weeks ago. Just no mood to scrap. Then suddenly, boom! I've done 5 pages already.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
