            <div class='col-md body'>I've been pretty interested in this topic recently, especially since I've always been a Morning Lark until my shift duties for the past few years kinda messed up my circadian rhythm and lately, I've found myself to be very much a Night Owl.

Three a.m., four a.m., five a.m.  You know you have to be up and alert for work by nine a.m., but you're still wide awake.  If this happens only occasionally, you could be suffering from temporary insomnia. But, if you toss and turn night after night and then, when morning comes, you're ready to sleep like a baby, you may be suffering from a sleep disorder called delayed sleep phase syndrome.<br><br>Symptoms of <span style="color: green;">delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) </span>include the <span style="color: dark blue;">inability to fall asleep at night and excessive daytime sleepiness</span>.  If this problem continues over a three or four-month period, DSPS is probably the cause.<br><br>People suffering from DSPS are sometimes called "night owls." They <span style="color: dark blue;">function best late at night and feel drowsy and lethargic during the day.  The circadian rhythm is in a complete reversal to what is considered normal.</span><br><br>Even when retiring at an hour that feels comfortable to them (in the early hours of the morning) they may still experience sleep onset insomnia and lie awake for thirty minutes or more before they can drop off to sleep.<br><br>Delayed sleep phase syndrome often begins in adolescence and may start as early as infancy.  The onset, however, seldom occurs after the age of thirty.<br><br>Delayed sleep phase syndrome is a very real disorder.  It is not caused by deliberate behavior, and it isn't easy to cope with.<br><br>Sleeping pills have little or no effect in combating the inability to fall asleep.  Neither does meditation.  Melatonin or other natural sleep inducers have been successful in a few cases. Daytime naps also help, but napping is not feasible if you are trying to hold down a job.<br><br>Chronotherapy, which involves the systematic delaying of bedtime by three hour increments, is sometimes helpful, but this method has not proven successful for all sufferers of DSPS.  Some have been unable to stick to this schedule.  Others habitually  return to their former sleep pattern."<br><br>In another section in the same website, About.com, more info on DSPS was found :<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Symptoms of DSPS</span><br><br>Delayed sleep phase syndrome often begins in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms must be present for at least a month before a diagnosis of delayed sleep phase syndrome can be made. Symptoms of DSPS include:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  sleep-onset insomnia (an inability to fall asleep until the early<br>morning)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  sleep deprivation<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  depression.<br><br>People with DSPS consider themselves "night owls." They tend to go to bed at the same time every night, and they function perfectly well if they're allowed to snooze until they spontaneously awaken. People with DSPS require normal amounts of rest, and sleep quality is generally normal.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DSPS and Depression</span><br><br>Approximately half of all people with DSPS are also diagnosed with depression or other mental disorders. The reason for this is unclear, although the high levels of stress and sleep deprivation associated with the condition are thought to increase the likelihood of depression.<br><br></div>

By sticking people in isolation chambers, scientists discovered that most people's internal clocks run a bit longer Â— about a half-hour on average Â— than the sun's 24-hour cycle. That's why, for most people, it's easier to stay up later and compensate by sleeping in than to force yourself to sleep early and wake early, explains Dr. Eliza Sutton, an acting assistant professor of medicine at the University of Washington. Morning larks are those rarer birds whose body clock is shorter than 24 hours, so they wake up raring to go.<br><br>"Our body clocks are genetic and hardwired so chances are you've been one way or the other for most of your life, with some exceptions Â— adolescence and old age. A combination of developmental and cultural factors keep many teens awake until the wee hours of the morning, about the time many grandparents start stirring awake.<br><br>"A body-clock mismatch also can be hard on lovebirds. If she wakes up on New York time but his clock is set on Pacific, she'll view him as lazy, and he'll grow bored spending evenings alone."<br><br>Wah...

It could be the result of trying to sleep in a hotel room, struggling with arthritis or dealing with a death in the family. The sleeplessness may vary from an occasional bout to a chronic problem, doctors say.<br><br>Sleep researchers are still trying to tease out all the reasons for insomnia, but one thing they do know is people's sleep-wake patterns change as they age. For teens and people in their 20s, the peak time of alertness is right before bedtime, and they often have difficulty falling asleep, Walsh says.<br><br>That bedtime alertness is reduced as people age, so they often fall asleep easily, but they may have trouble maintaining sleep, he says. One reason is that middle-aged and older people may be more sensitive to things like pain, discomfort, noise, the urge to visit the bathroom.<br><br>Another reason may be changes in the drive to stay asleep, he says. Throughout the day, people build up a need for sleep. When they snooze for a few hours at night, they pay off some of the sleep debt, and their drive to stay asleep diminishes, Walsh says."<br><br>A few of the causes of insomnia suggested in this article includes :<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Anxiety<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Conditioned Mental Arousal<br>"When some people wake up, instead of going right back to sleep, they may quickly become anxious because they're not sleeping and worry that they'll feel terrible the following day".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Depression<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Alcohol Consumption<br>"Alcohol may have a sedative effect for the first few hours of sleep, but it metabolizes quickly, causing "a rebound alerting effect that contributes to lighter, fragmented sleep or total wakefulness in the second part of the night".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Medical Problems<br>eg. arthritis, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, etc.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Menopause / Hot Flashes<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome<br>"Some people have a persistent tendency to go to bed several hours earlier and wake up several hours earlier than is typical.

Lack of sleep has a bad effect on the "appetite control" hormone leptin, researchers say.<br><br>Leptin (search) is a widely studied hormone, thought to be the secret to obesity. Produced by fat cells, our leptin levels tell the brain when the body does or doesn't need more food.<br><br>Sleep deprivation plays an important role in regulating our leptin levels and in controlling appetite, explains senior researcher Eve van Cauter, PhD, a diabetes researcher with the University of Chicago. Her study appears in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism this month.<br><br>A few earlier studies have investigated the effects of sleep deprivation (search) on leptin levels, since sleep regulates hormones and other body processes. During sleep, leptin levels normally rise. But leptin levels are also markedly dependent on sleep duration, she says.<br><br>According to the researchers, sleep deprivation results in a triggering of hormones of the nervous system, which can lower leptin levels. These low levels of leptin have been associated with obesity. Other hormones that control metabolism are also triggered by sleep deprivation and may affect leptin levels."<br><br>Wah... so, judging by the info in this article, the modern-day Confucious should say, 'If man sleep much, man won't eat much!'<br><br>Sleep, ah!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Flier, MD, with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, in his editorial in Annals in Internal Medicine.<br><br>The Â“simple goalsÂ” to get a better nightÂ’s sleep and more exercise Â“may well become a part of our future approach to combating obesity,Â” writes Flier.<br><br>Just last month, another study came to similar conclusions Â— that chronic sleep loss triggers hormones that can lower the Â“appetite controlÂ” hormone leptin. Lower levels of leptin are associated with obesity. ItÂ’s what researchers call the Â“yin yangÂ” of appetite control. The hormone ghrelin is produced in the stomach and triggers hunger. Leptin is produced by fat cells and signals satiety, telling the brain when we have eaten enough.<br><br>Researchers also show an association between sleep duration and BMI. Those getting three hours of sleep had a 5% increase in body weight. Â“ThatÂ’s not an enormous amount, but the effect might be underestimated,Â” says Mignot. Â“Still, itÂ’s something we can do something about. It may be the reason why dieting has been so disappointing for so many people.Â”<br><br>In the second study, 12 healthy males in their 20s were studied to see how sleep loss affected both leptin and ghrelin levels. The young men got only four hours of sleep for two nights, then two nights of 10 hours in bed (average of 9 hours of sleep). Hormone levels were measured before, during, and after the sleep periods. They also completed questionnaires to assess their hunger and desire for different foods.<br><br>After a night of four hours of sleep, sleep restriction resulted in a 24 percent increase in hunger and a 23 percent increase in appetite, reports study co-researcher Esra Tasali, MD, a sleep specialist at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Â“If allowed to increase their food intake, they would likely eat an extra 550 calories a day,Â” Tasali tells WebMD, whose study appears in Annals of Internal Medicine.<br><br>As the sleepy guys got hungry, their food choices also changed. High calorie, high-carb foods were most appealing Â— sweets, and salty and starchy foods Â— after two nights of little sleep. Fruit, vegetables, and dairy products were at the low end of the craving scale."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> Wah...
