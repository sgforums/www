I've heard of a real case whereby the kid kept skipping school and the mom kept calling and pestering the teacher and even admin staff to call the kid to "counsel" and make the kid get back to school.<br><br>My gf who are teachers always seem very busy even during the school hols with ECAs and whatever new projects/ initiative....so I'm not sure. I guess you really gotta love the job to do it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I know people who are very happy being teachers even though they know that they will never be promoted because of the way they do things. to them, making a difference in the children counts for more than career advancement.<br><br>however, those that really piss their principals off will be doomed.</div>
