            <div class='col-md body'>Here is the article<br><br>Look at the difference between the stuff said by those want the sites preserved and the stuff said by URA.<br><br><strong>Singapore</strong><br>Call to preserve 1912 'crescent' house<br>Tan Hui Yee<br>606 words<br>3 January 2007<br>Straits Times<br>English<br>(c) 2007 Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br><br>Developer has no plans for Amber Road site but it's not on heritage list<br><br>A GROUP of heritage property lovers are trying to save a bungalow designed by the architect of Raffles Hotel that could be facing demolition after it was bought recently by a developer.<br><br>The neo-Renaissance style bungalow on Amber Road was designed by Regent Alfred John Bidwell in 1912.<br><br>The two-storey property, which stood on the seafront before land reclamation began, has an unusual crescent shape to let in as much fresh air as possible. It is currently surrounded by many private housing projects.<br><br>A new developer, AG Capital, bought the bungalow last year. The company told The Straits Times 'no corporate decision has been adopted' on future plans for the site.<br><br>The company is free to tear it down though, as the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has no plans to add it to its list of more than 6,000 buildings that have to be retained because of their historical heritage value.<br><br><strong>The URA told The Straits Times it adopted a 'pragmatic' approach to conservation. It said: 'It is done on a highly selective basis to retain the unique character and identity of an area.<br><br>'We have adopted a 'win-win' approach to strike a balance in allowing owners to realise the economic potential of their properties and ensuring the identity and character of our historic past are retained.'</strong><br><br>However, a group of about 20 people, who call themselves the Historic Architecture Rescue Plan, feel this bungalow deserves preservation. On Christmas Eve, the group distributed fliers about the bungalow to residents in the Mountbatten area.<br><br>One member, Mr Terrence Hong, 26, unemployed, suggested the building be dismantled and relocated rather than demolished.<br><br>Destroying buildings like this would 'contribute to the sense of impermanence and unrootedness in Singapore', he said.<br><br>Another member, 72-year-old retired administrator Helen Khoo, said: 'Modern buildings are okay in themselves. But when we have too many, we start everything on a clean slate and rub off all the happy memories.'<br><br>The group is trying to get the authorities to conserve at least 12 other buildings.<br><br>They include private buildings like the National Aerated Water Company building in Serangoon Road, the Shaw Brothers film studio in Jalan Ampas, off Balestier Road, as well as state properties like a two-storey manor in Gilstead Road that used to be home to Leslie Charteris, author of the mystery books that inspired the television series, The Saint.<br><br>The conservation group tries to raise awareness of heritage properties by giving their owners or tenants information on their historical value. They recently approached Gracefields Kindergarten, which rents the house in Gilstead Road.<br><br>The imposing 1920s building, which used to house the Spastic Children's Association, was painted a cheery mint green when the kindergarten took up the tenancy in August.<br><br>Its principal, Ms Joyce Teo, 50, said that since then, at least eight people have walked in to express admiration for the building.<br><br>'I stand in awe. Every day that I stand here, I am grateful for this place,' she said. 'It's so majestic.'<br><br>tanhy@sph.com.sg</div>
