            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;Brian came home from the pub late one Friday evening stinko drunk, as he<br>&gt;often did, and crept into bed beside his wife who was already asleep. He<br>&gt;gave a peck on the cheek and fell asleep. When he awoke he found a<br>&gt;strange man standing at the end of his bed wearing a long flowing white<br>&gt;robe.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Who the hell are you?" demanded Brian, "and what are you doing in my<br>&gt;bedroom?".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The mysterious Man answered "This isn't your bedroom and I'm St Peter".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Brian was stunned "You mean I'm dead!!! That can't be, I have so much to<br>&gt;live for, I haven't said goodbye to my family.... you've got to send me<br>&gt;back straight away".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;St Peter replied "Yes you can be reincarnated but there is a catch. We<br>&gt;can only send you back as a dog or a hen."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Brian was devastated, but knowing there was a farm not far from<br>&gt;his<br>&gt;house, he asked to be sent back as a hen. A flash of light later he was<br>&gt;covered in feathers and clucking around pecking the ground. "This ain't<br>&gt;so bad" he thought until he felt this strange feeling welling up inside<br>&gt;him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The farmyard rooster strolled over and said "So you're the new hen, how<br>&gt;are you enjoying your first day here?" "It's not so bad" replies Brian,<br>&gt;"but I have this strange feeling inside like I'm about to explode".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"You're ovulating" explained the rooster, "don't tell me you've never<br>&gt;laid an egg before".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Never" replies Brian<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Well just relax and let it happen"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And so he did and after a few uncomfortable seconds later, an egg pops<br>&gt;out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him and<br>&gt;his emotions got the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the<br>&gt;first time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When he<br>&gt;laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming<br>&gt;and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that<br>&gt;ever happened to him... ever!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The joy kept coming and as he was just about to lay his third egg he<br>&gt;felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife<br>&gt;shouting "Brian, wake up you drunken bas*ard, you're sh*tting the bed"</div>
