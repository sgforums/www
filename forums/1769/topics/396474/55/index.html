              <p>There was a lorry in the lane next to us travelling slowly... the FS wanted to overtake it from the right, but it kept swaying left and right.....</p>
              <p>Luckily we reached a bend in the bridge when centrifugal force would make that lorry go further to the right.... the FS quickly tapped the horn and zoomed past the lorry.</p>
