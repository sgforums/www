              <p>yesterday afternoon at pasir ris area, I saw this bike in the

              bus)...</p>
              <p>then the bike decides to swing to the right lane (lane 2), the
              car on the right lane of bike got worried and thus sway a bit more
              to the right, thus getting into the lane 1 and buang the car on the
              right (which is in the correct lane).</p>
              <p>the fast moving cars behind all jam break... to avoid collision
              with this idiot..</p>
              <p>the bike bor chap, sway left and right.. cos when the others jam
              break, not his problem i presumed..</p>
              <p>all 3 lanes become slow moving traffic and all follow behind

              <p>i am not a driver who never ride before and complain bikers are farkers</p>

              <p>you should see my office.. KNN people just cross, red or not, expecting cars to stop for them... worse, when everyone is waiting for the traffic lights, there'll be one asshole who will walk without looking, causing cars to have to e-brake for them... worse, the asshole will look as if the driver is in the wrong, give the driver a dirty look and continue to cross...</p>
              <p>that's when EVERYONE crosses, even if it's a red man!!</p>
              <p>i'm surprised no one has died at that crossing yet...</p>
              <p>to make matters worse, the drivers have to swing in from the 2nd lane because of the stupid red line on the road... and trying to avoid the bloody cyclists who think they're invulnerable and ride without looking around them...</p>
              <p>and if it's in the afternoon, there'll be this bunch of asshole taxi-drivers clogging up the left lane, causing congestion and blocking the view of the assholes who anyhow cross the bloody road...</p>
              <p>i will go suggest that we install a CCTV just in case people die there from traffic accidents</p>
