              <p>but ... surely .... dunno how to take the MRT ......</p>
              <p>one would expect them to teach MRT riding at chao yang special school ......</p>
              <p>not knowing how to take the MRT ... it's something you'd expect from someone intellectually subnormal ... &gt;.&lt;</p>

              <p>During my combat medic course, there was one trainee in my platoon who would whine incessantly about going outfield.... never mind that he was a service medic and all he had to do was to watch from the sidelines while the rest of us combat medics went chiong-ing...</p>
              <p>Build basha, whine. Eat combat rations, whine. Wear SBO, whine. Sleep in basha, whine. We all mocked him to high heaven, and with good reason.... even for the combat medics, that was a sibeh slack outfield..... I had gone for far more physical outdoor camps back in secondary school.</p>
              <p>Oh, and the poor sod told us a really dumb story..... on his first day of BMT, he and his mother clutched each other tightly until just before the parents had to leave... upon which they both cried uncontrollably.....</p>
              <p>.... because they thought that National Service means not seeing or hearing from your family at all for the next 2 1/2 years. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>i'm not kidding...</p>
              <p>the rest of us guys quickly took apart the damned bolt carrier assembly, used soap, green scouring wool, steel wool and whatever we could find to clean up the rust and other crap...</p>
              <p>then we basically covered everything in oil for him...</p>
