              <p>this is to the idiot drivers who think that bikes shouldn't lane split</p>
              <p>French motorcycle riders had their day in the news this weekend. 
              Organized by the <span class="tt">FFMC<span class="tooltip"><span class="middle">Federation Francaise des Motards en Colere - Angry French
               Biker Association, an association of bikers fighting for the rights of 
              motorcycle riders</span></span></span>, a call 
              went out to all bikers to ride in protest parades in some 40 cities 
              throughout France. The main protest reasons are that the government is 
              planning to make illegal to split lanes (<em>currently it's tolerated</em>),
               but also for better and safer road infrastructure for motorcycles, 
              reduced taxes on security accessories (<em>like helmets</em>), etc. <br> <br> Many cities within striking distance of Paris had a local assembly
               point, followed by a ride-out to Paris, where they joined the main 
              protest.</p>
              <p><img src="http://photos.imageevent.com/motorbiker/newspics3/Motorcycle-Protest-France-201003-3.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367"></p>
              <p>The bikers were told to ride 100% legally, in other words, everyone 
              stays in their own lane, respecting the security distance between 
              vehicles.</p>
              <p><img src="http://photos.imageevent.com/motorbiker/newspics3/Motorcycle-Protest-France-201003-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="358"></p>
              <p>This of course meant that the all traffic suddenly was slowed down on 
              one of Paris main arteries, since having 10,000 bikers on a ring-road, 
              riding like cars, meant that traffic was saturated. <br> <br> This 
              exercise was to point out to the government that if motorcycles are not 
              allowed to split lanes legally, traffic will come to a standstill in any
               city in France. <br> <br> Afterwards, a large number of bikes went and 
              blocked a metro station, since public transport is not a viable solution
               to the congested traffic problems. <br> <br> The other cities in France
               were not spared the wrath of the French bikers:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Lille 3,000, </li>
              <li>Bordeaux 2,000, </li>
              <li>Nantes 1,000, </li>
              <li>Orleans 550, </li>
              <li>Royan 1,000, </li>
              <li>Toulouse 1,200, </li>
              <li>Clermont-Ferrand
               1,500</li>
              </ul>
              <p>and many more cities, 40 in total. <br> <br> Despite 
              what you may think, car drivers support our movement. They know it's in 
              their own interest, and during the protest, many cars applauded the 
              protest!</p>

              <p><strong>Song Fish Head with Spicy Fermented Bean Sauce</strong><br>They steamed it first before pouring the sauce over.<br>It was beautifully steamed.

              <p><strong>Asparagus</strong><br>Stir Fried with chilli. Very yummy but I think most places do their vegs well</p>
              <p><strong>Kong Bak Pau</strong><br>The belly was melt in the mouth tender and enough fats. Could do with more sauce though</p>
              <p><strong>Centuary Egg with sliced Ginger</strong><br>I love the centuary egg. No weird ammonia smell or taste at all. Very lovely</p>
              <p><strong>Pig Trotter Bee Hoon</strong><br>This one is not from the can. It's nice but I dunno is it coz I'm not feeling well also that I found it pretty bland. Could use a little more salt</p>

              <p>yesterday afternoon at pasir ris area, I saw this bike in the spilt lanes, swaying left and right...at his own lesiure..</p>
              <p>when this bike suddenly swing into left lane (lane 3), poor bus must jam break (the car behind bus near knocked into the bus)...</p>
              <p>then the bike decides to swing to the right lane (lane 2), the car on the right lane of bike got worried and thus sway a bit more to the right, thus getting into the lane 1 and buang the car on the right (which is in the correct lane).</p>
              <p>the fast moving cars behind all jam break... to avoid collision with this idiot..</p>
              <p>the bike bor chap, sway left and right.. cos when the others jam break, not his problem i presumed..</p>
              <p>all 3 lanes become slow moving traffic and all follow behind (far away) from the swaying bike...</p>
              <p>I was watching in amusement, tempted to tape down the incident and plate number and send to TP..<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
