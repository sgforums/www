Super thick and gloopy.  It's heavy so it doesn't sink into the skin immediately, but works wonders for cracks and rough hard patches.  It's glycerin based, one of the ingredients mentioned in the first article.</div></blockquote>Their ultra sheer sunscreen was also very good.<br><br>Tried it at friend's place at Seattle where he provides for his live in guest.  My face was oil free and felt kinda powdery for at least 4 hours after use.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Am not a huge believer of moisturisers until I was in USA.<br><br>It wasnt so bad when I was in Oz land though.  Maybe because I didnt spent enough time there. and Maybe its Autumn Winter time then.<br><br>I dont use as much moisturisers because I have combination to Oily Skin, which in Singapore, doesnt really need moisturisers and somehow, it just make me feel oilier.  Frankly, the humidity is what makes the moisturisers goes onto the skin and make it felt uncomfortable.<br><br>But in USA. After a shower, and one time when I was sort of too free and playing with the babies moisturisers then I realise how dry my skin had become.<br><br>The moisturisers was even quickly dryed out by the wind and weather after 1 hour and I had to reapply those lotions.<br><br>previously, I only apply lotions i like the smell....J&amp;J Nite lotion or their milk lotion range.<br><br>Now.....I swear by the creams.  They are thicker and still smell as heavenly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Favourites:<br><br>1) J&amp;J Bedtime Oil (50ml carry in bag, cos they are great waterproofing for rainy days.  And they work triple duties for me cos I ride and tour.  Body moisturiser, hair &amp; as parfum)<br><br>2) J&amp;J Bedtime Cream (Smells good and relaxing, Thick also)<br><br>3) J&amp;J Milk Lotion (Great for massages, Smells the best!)<br><br>4) Bodyshop Vanilla Vanilla (Got a whole range plus spares on that range of smells.  Lotion not as absorbing though, kinda oily)<br><br>5) Marks &amp; Spensers Water Lilly (got the whole range for layering the fragrance)<br></div>
