Time now is 8.35pm in OC California.<br><br>Why dont we have Vaseline in a tube in SG? Its so much easier to carry around!<br><br>I gave up on lotions &amp; creams for skins.

You could do an online search for facial moisturisers. Even with my slightly greasy skin, I have to use a moisturiser. I use a cheapie one made by Phisoderm and have no complaints. HTHs.</div>

No matter how tempting, don't take a too-hot shower. Opt for a warm one instead. When towelling dry, dab, don't rub. Then apply body lotion to slightly damp skin for better absorption. I use Aveeno. No greasy feeling after application. No complaints so far. For really dry winter skin, try any product with Shea Butter.<br><br>I still have the same problems with dry hands. Only because I have to cook and do chores. Again, Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy formula works like a charm. It's actually a jelly form of petroleum jelly and really heals cracked skin on fingers and heels. Just apply before you go to bed every night. Problem will be solved in a couple of days.
