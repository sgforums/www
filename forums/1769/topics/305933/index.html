              <p>I just shared the following account in the Jive Pad, but in case a few of you missed realising that I actually dreamt of you guys, here goes :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At about 8am this morning, some idiot blasted their radio loudly
                                      for about half an hour.  I think it was some bloke who parked
                                      his car along the street with his radio's volume on high. 
                                      Bloody irritating and inconsiderate!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png">  Thank God he stopped and allowed me to slip into
                                      bed and hide under my doona to keep warm, hearing the rain go
                                      pitter-patter outside...</p>
              <p>But I had a strange, strange dream during that short time! 
                                      I dreamt we had a Club 30 Tour to some country!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  I couldn't recall the country's name, but I
                                      remember seeing Bear, elindra, av, KB, lau, si gina and kopi's
                                      faces! <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/omg.png" alt="omg.png"> Thing was, I've never met LF, Fatum and VK, wouldn't
                                      know how they look like, and yet, they were there too!! 
                                      <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/omg.png" alt="omg.png"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, our hotel was about 8-10 storeys tall and somehow, we
                                      gathered at the rooftop to chill out a lot!  We could see
                                      dirty old buildings with character to our left, a bustling city
                                      street with new buildings to our back, a lovely residential area to
                                      our right with lovely streets and bungalows, and right in front of
                                      us, across the major expressway, was the sea!  It wasn't just
                                      any sea but a sea of lovely blue and what was striking was, there
                                      were a few luxury condominium buildings built right out in the
                                      middle of the water!!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  I was completely mesmerised by one of the blocks,
                                      which had light greenish-blue tinted glass all around the building,
                                      and the concrete bits of the building was painted white.  We
                                      could look right into the apartments, and I could see lt-green
                                      lacquered kitchen cabinets along one wall of the apartments facing
                                      us, and all the apartments had sparkling, shiny white marble
                                      floors! </p>
              <p>We had dragged our luggage and walked along the roads to our
                                      hotel, and the first thing we did was to run up to the rooftop,
                                      yakking all the way, bringing our cameras along.  I kept
                                      taking shots of that condominium building out in the sea.  And
                                      then I suggested we walk over there.</p>
              <p>The walkways out to those blocks were well-paved and surrounded
                                      by the sea.  We walked along, chatting loudly as we often do
                                      in our outings!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> 
                                      I think KB and a few of you tried to engage me in friendly chat but
                                      I was too awed by that lovely block to respond!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>
              <p>When we reached there, a little boy suddenly ran out of the
                                      entryway, with his nanny, a young girl in her early 20's rushed out
                                      after him.  She had food stains all over her black tee and a
                                      bit on her face.  She smiled apologetically and explained that
                                      she's the nanny, and ran after the boy.</p>
              <p>Bear then yelled out something like it's time to return to the
                                      hotel and Kopi and Fatum agreed, so reluctantly, I walked back
                                      too.  The tide had risen then and covered much of the
                                      red-brick walkway so it felt like we were all "walking on
                                      water"!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  It was very pretty... the walkway had
                                      concrete flower boxes with lovely abundant blooms overflowing from
                                      them, and the sea was just a pretty colour... We stopped now and
                                      then to take photos. </p>
              <p>We arrived back at the rooftop of the hotel and someone asked
                                      about dinner so we were discussing where to go for dinner.  I
                                      walked out to the edge to stare out at sea and at the block again
                                      when I looked down and realised there was a flood!!  The
                                      waters were rising!!  There was an expressway bridge in front
                                      of the hotel, and the cars that were going down into the adjoining
                                      roads were almost completely submerged!  I yelled out and all
                                      of you came over and we just stood there and looked at the
                                      floodwaters rising... rising... and took photos and discussed
                                      "emergency" dinner plans now that we had to stay in the
                                      hotel. </p>
              <p>And then... I woke up!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>So much water in my dreams!  Glass and water... I go check
                                      it up in the dream dictionary!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>OH!!  I forgot to add one important bit!  As we
                                      watched the floodwaters rise, I looked out to the blocks out at
                                      sea, and saw the seawater slowly rising... rising...  At
                                      first, the flood reached the first 3 floors of the condo blocks,
                                      but then, it slowly submerged the blocks!!!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  But somehow, we knew that the blocks were equipped
                                      with safety, watertight features, so everyone in the building was
                                      safe!  Phew!!!</p>
              <p>But all of us couldn't move and didn't say a word as we watched
                                      the blocks go under.  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OK, got the following interpretation from <a rel="nofollow" href="www.dreammoods.com">www.dreammoods.com</a>!</p>
              <p><strong><span>Sea</span></strong> <span><br> To see the sea in your dream, represents your unconscious and your
                                      transition between your unconscious and conscious. It also often
                                      represents your emotions. The dream may also be a pun on your
                                      understanding and perception of a situation. "I see" or perhaps
                                      there is something you need to "see" more clearly. Alternatively,
                                      the dream may indicate a need to reassure yourself or offer
                                      reassurance to someone.ï¿½</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span>Flood</span></strong> <span><br></span> <strong><span>To see a gentle flood, indicates that your worries
                                      over a certain matter will be soon be swept away.
                                       </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span>Glass</span></strong> <span><br> To see glass in your dream, symbolizes passivity or protection. You
                                      may be putting up an invisible barrier around you in order to
                                      protect yourself in a situation or relationship.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span>Road</span></strong> <span><br> To see a road in your dream, indicates your sense of direction and
                                      pursuit of your goals. </span> <span>To see a smooth road
                                      bordered by green trees and flowers, denotes a steady progress and
                                      steady climb up the social ladder.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span>Bricks</span></strong> <span><br> To see a brick in your dream, represents your individual ideas and
                                      thoughts. Experience and/or heartbreak may have hardened
                                      you.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span>Plants</span></strong> <span><br> To see plants in your dream, indicates fertility, spiritual
                                      development, growth or the potential for growth. Alternatively, the
                                      appearance of plants in your dreams reflects your caring and loving
                                      nature.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span>Camera</span></strong> <span><br> To see a camera in your dream, signifies your desires to cling on
                                      and/or live in the past. Alternatively, it may represent you need
                                      to focus on a particular situation. Perhaps you need to get a
                                      clearer picture or idea.</span></p>
              <p>But... but... I saw more than one camera leh!  You know how
                                      Club 30 has shutterbugs! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmm... think that overall, it's a 'good' dream!  <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I've been having dreams every night since July 2007.  They used to be scary nightmares, but lately, the dreams are more of the amusing sort.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  Phew!  At least I no longer have to do action stunts and be like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or be some martial arts Xiao Long Nu in my dreams anymore!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>My dreams are extremely vivid.  And they are all in full-colour too!  Apparently, some folks dream only in black-and-white.  My dreams, fortunately, screens on a colour plasma TV!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
