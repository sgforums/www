              <div class="blizzquoteheader"><span>Quote from: <strong>Ghostcrawler (<a style="color: white;" href="http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13275172587-upcoming-hhunter-changes.html">Source</a>)</strong></span></div>
              <div class="blizzquote">Hunters of all specs, and particularly Beastmaster, are doing too much damage in PvE.<br><br>We
              tested this a lot internally in beta and knew hunters were high but we
              hoped other classes would be able to catch up in a way they have as yet
              been unable to do. We want to be careful not to hurt hunter dps too
              much in PvP, so we’re taking most of the damage out of Steady Shot and
              Volley. Beastmaster hunters are in addition losing some of their pet
              dps. We still want BMs to have the best pets, but pet dps numbers are a
              little high at the moment. We are also still concerned about hunter
              survivability in PvP and taking the opportunity to jazz up Deterrence
              into something that looks and plays a little more interesting.<br><br>These
              are not all of the changes we are working on for hunters, but those
              changes we feel are ready for testing. We hope to get these changes up
              on the PTR so players will have a chance to test them out and respond
              before they go live.<br><br>
              <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">
              <li>Steady Shot – now only gains 10% of attack power as damage (down from 20%).</li>
              <li>Volley
              – reduced the damage by about 30% for all ranks. Note that AE damage
              from many classes is very high right now and we are looking at all of
              them. Volley in particular had reached the point where some hunters
              were using it to the exclusion of most other attacks.</li>
              <li>Readiness – no longer affects the cooldown of Bestial Wrath.</li>
              <li>Deterrence
              – has been completely overhauled. It now allows you to deflect 100% of
              incoming melee or spell damage for 5 seconds, but prevents you from
              attacking while active. You still must be facing the attacker to
              deflect the damage (this is a limitation we are trying and might end up
              removing). 60 sec cooldown.</li>
              <li>Kill Shot – cooldown reduced to 15 sec (from 35 sec).</li>
              <li>Kindrid Spirits – now only grants 3/6/9/12/15% pet damage.</li>
              <li>Serpent’s Swiftness – now only grants 2/4/6/8/10% bonus attack speed to pet.</li>
              <li>All hunter pet abilities with a cooldown longer than 30 sec have been moved off the global cooldown.</li>
              <li>Growl— threat generation increased by 20% (same for <img src="http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif" border="0" alt=""> <span style="color: #9482ca;">Voidwalker Torment</span>).</li>
              <li>Call of the Wild – now benefits only the hunter and his or her pet.</li>
              <li>Rake and Scorpid Poison – slightly nerfed to bring them into line with other pet abilities.</li>
              <li>Spirit Strike – reduced the period on the dot so it will work better with Longevity.</li>
              <li>Improved
              Tracking – now benefits damage to all included creature types as long
              as you are tracking one of them. You don’t have to swap around what you
              are tracking as much.</li>
              <li>Aspect of the Wild – now raid-wide.</li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="blizzquote"><br>[...]<br><br>I
              did say these are not all the hunter changes we're working on. Some we
              haven't quite worked out yet and others (one exciting one in particular
              concerning ammo) won't be ready until Ulduar or so.<br><br>We think MM
              was too high and BM was way too high. Survival is probably a little
              low. We are looking at buffing Survival, possibly through Explosive
              Shot, but we haven't finalized that yet.<br><br>The Deterrence change is defintely something we'll need to see in action on the PTR.<br><br>I
              don't want to do a disservice to all the good PvP feedback by
              attempting to boil it down too much. However, in general a lot of
              hunters were concerned about being able to do damage as much as they
              were concerned about being able to survive damage. We don't expect the
              Deterrence change to solve the former problem obviously. We're still
              working on that one, but we wanted to go ahead and announce what
              changes we have now so that you guys can be chewing on them.<br><br>Nerfing
              classes is never fun. It means that our initial tests and estimates
              didn't play out in the real world, which is a failing on our part, not
              anything the players did wrong. While buffing is a lot more fun, we
              think we'd get to crazy land too quickly by trying to make current BM
              dps the new benchmark. That would mean touching virtually every other
              class and spec as well as many encounters. While it might produce more
              positive PR in the short-term, it's a ton more work in the long-term
              that we would rather spend on new content or other problem areas.<br><br>Also,
              the sky is not falling. We're posting here so we can get feedback.
              Threats of rerolling or that sort of melodrama aren't really giving us
              any information we need. I can understand while you might want to vent
              a little bit, but posts with nothing but QQ aren't helpful.</div>

              <p>LOL i never finish occulus in Heroic mode cos of the last boss we did with 1 red 2 green 2 bronze .. The whelping came out too fast and time stop CD is too long to cope with the enrage and whelpings. U took wat dragon?</p>
              <p>Anyway tare go download recount @ wow.curse.com, it's a good way to improve yourself by looking at the chart and taking note why u do so much and why u did much lesser.</p>
              <p>Sigh, hunter is going down the drain liao =| last night i totally no mood to play WoW LFG for H CoT for 30 mins no ppl reply i go sleep liao LOL</p>

              <p>I think I will go Arcane till I see the raids coz Frostfire is fun but if like Moo say all the fights have to move a lot, I don't see how I'm going to DPS as Frostfire &gt;.&lt;</p>

              <p>You are closing the gap la. I think last time you also 3 lvls higher than me but our DPS diff is very wide. Now at least it's closer :)</p>
