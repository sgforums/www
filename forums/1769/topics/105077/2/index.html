Have you tried speaking to him about this?  Sometimes, they don't see what's happening and just need a gentle tap on the shoulder and very specific info about what you're feeling and what you need.  I think it's time to tell him very seriously that it's time to sit down and do some serious talking.<br><br>Hope it turns out well, subzero_baby!</div>
