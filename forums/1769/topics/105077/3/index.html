I don't think counselling would help. The last time i went to see a doctor for depression... he started calling me crazy woman... that hurts...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  though it happened quite some time back, i still feel uncomfortable about it.<br><br>we don't quarrel at all... calls are made mainly to "report" eg" i'm home.. going to work blah blah blah..." We don't live together even though we had ROMed...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm appalled that the doctor was so unprofessional, subzero.  Don't give up... approach another doctor.  You really do need to talk this issue out because it's not something you should have to live with - it already seems to make you extremely miserable and this is just the beginning!<br><br>I think you really need to get him to sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk first.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">   Could be that he's so busy trying to earn money that he didn't even realise what's happening.  I know some guys who are so traditional in their thinking that once they get married, they feel this tremendous burden to live up to their head of the household responsibility that they start feeling stressed out trying to be a good breadwinner and kinda forget what the relationship was about in the first place.  Talk, and soon too!  Good luck!</div>
