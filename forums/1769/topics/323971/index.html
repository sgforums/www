              <p>I went to a hi-tea buffet at a hotel this afternoon, I was early so I saw the lunch crowd as well as the lunch buffet spread. There were many types of raw sushi, prawns, oysters etc at the spread.</p>
              <p>Guess what happened when lunch ended and hi-tea starts? They top up the sushi and the raw seafood.</p>
              <p>Guess what happened when hi-tea ended and dinner starts? They top up the sushi and the raw seafood again.</p>
              <p>I concluded that some of the sushi &amp; raw seafood have been sitting on the crushed ice at the spread from breakfast, lunch, hi-tea, dinner and maybe event supper! I hope they finnally dispose of them after supper otherwise, I hate to imagin that they will rest at the refrigeration and pop out at breakfast again for the next day's buffet.</p>
              <p>I will certainly think twice about having the raw sushi and seafood at buffets again.  </p>

              <p>i'm not sure wat u trying to say... u prefer them NOT to top up?</p>
              <p>if the sashimi (i think tat's wat u mean by raw sushi) and seafood sits thr from morn to nite, there'll be no need to top up... plus how did u track which one has been sitting thr if the tray gets top up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>unless u want them to catch and slaughter the food right in ur face, all those sashimi and seafood did come from a freezer...</p>

              <p><br>on the consolation, they may be fresh seafood, just cut and lay on the tray..:)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sashimi supposed to be consumed within 2 hours after it's been sliced (from the fish).  they may be the newly replenished ones maybe just cut from the fish (which is properly kept for freshness).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>unless they put the sashimi food there for more 4 hours..and no staff disposing them nor do anything the food,  then it is kindda dangerous cos it will be contaiminated by the air (people breathing in/out vapor) and bateria will grow..not fit to be eaten liao...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe next time we go to a real sashimi eating place :)  that will be fun seeing sifu slicing and making sushi in front of the customers :)</p>

              <p>i think TS is mentioning the raw stuff are being recycled again when they are not consumed..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dun think so lah... singapore very strict on these.  kana checked and the restaurant will land in hot soup liao...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if not confident about the raw stuff, go for the rest..</p>
              <p>as i said lor, sashimi is best when u see the sushi chef prepare the food in front of you..:)  and they are yummy...i had the salmon belly sashimi which the chef specially made for me.ooooooo heavens...</p>

              <p>yes, i meant they just "top up" the stale raw stuff with new ones (not sure if they are fresher ones though), so those raw stuff that have been resting at the table for hours were not replaced nor removed from the buffet table. They just continue to sit there from lunch to hi-tea to dinner time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway this may be a singular item, maybe other hotels don't do the same. Nonetheless, I am for sure not doing anymore sashimi buffet, better off going to proper japanese restaurant.</p>

              <p><br>All the buffets I go, the raw stuff is finished at the blink of the eye</p>

              <p>well most of the raw fish such as salmon and tuna they came in frozen. You are not getting anything that is jumping. Yellow fin came in vacum sealed there is a possibilities that the fish is out for a while depending on handling. If fish turn bad so at the time of sushi chief cutting the fish they will know. But so long as they don;t served overnight i think it is alright.</p>
