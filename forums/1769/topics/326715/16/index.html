              <p><br>what's their regulation on approval time? for eg, some capital market deals, the securities regulators say they'll grant approvals within 14/28 biz days - the catch being, upon them receiving complete information. so even if you sent in an application and they have queries, the 14/28 day clock doesn't start ticking until you have responded to their queries and that they have no further queries/comments. but generally we haven't had much trouble with the securities regualtors. in fact with their queries, they have met the deadline.</p>

              <p>it isn't about the time-off and all that.. i'll get it.. but there is a law somewhere that says people cannot work more than 7 days in a row without a rest day...</p>
              <p>anyway, i'm working 13 days in a row already..</p>
              <p>this is what put me in hospital the last time.. working long hours during the weekdays and manning roadshow booths during the weekends..</p>
              <p>went to have it out with the boss.. said 19 days in a row.. she looked pretty stunned.. because like i said, she had no clue..</p>
              <p>she looked at her calendar planner which is a mess, and started to "plan" and realised how screwed up her promises to people were.. so i told her outright, i'll do the things here.. he (the other guy) has to physically oversee his project on thursday and friday from 7am to about 8pm on both days.. just that the next week, he still has to do the same, so 23 and 24 Aug, he'll pengsan... let him rest..</p>
              <p>she went "uhh.. yah.." then proceeded to tell us whatever the heck i just told her and was very pleased with herself..</p>
              <p>sometimes i wonder how the hell she got where she is.. it sure as heck isn't her ability to think straight</p>
