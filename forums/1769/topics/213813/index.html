            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly I've to say that I decided to post it under Club 30 instead of AA because I'm not exactly in agony, and I find that the people in Club 30 are more mature.<br><br>So the situation is like this. I'm 19, she's 20. We have our fair share of quarrels, but we do manage to make up after our conflicts each time. Sometimes things do get bad, but both of us compromise and try to make things work out, and I appreciate the bond that we have.<br><br>While having a heart to heart talk one night, she mentioned that although I'm always physically there for her, she feels that I'm not emotionally there. "If it's there, it's there. If it isn't, it just isn't", as quoted.<br><br>Been pondering over this since then. I've been trying to listen more instead of talking in hope that I'll be able to understand the unspoken things. Although everyone's emotional needs are different, how do I address this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>You should ask her, how to be there for her emotionally. What do you need to do to be emotionally there.  Because different people view it differently. Her expectation seems to quite high and that you are fulfilling all her emotional needs?<br><br>Is listening to her enough? Or do you need to get hysterical with her when she is feeling it, or you need to be as sad as she is when she is sad. If you need to "connect" to that level, my view is that being her BF is going to be tough. Because she too need to recognise that you are a separate individual. You can empathize but you are not her.  You cannot be her because you will lose yourself.<br><br>Certain things and certain events and certain emotions, one single person cannot cover it all. Meaning that, sometimes I know I feel something, but I do not always expect support from my husband. I might approach my girl friends. Other times, I just want to bounce ideas off people, I ask my guy friends. Other times, its family and siblings, etc. She need to be able to identify that.<br><br>Anyways, you both are young and exploring. Don't get all hung up over it. Perhaps you can explain to her why you are not her, but you will be a pillar of strength for her... beside that, if she feels upset, unhappy, she should tell you and not let you mind read. when she is happy and joyful, she should also share with you and not let you guess.<br><br>Anyways, I also believe age has nothing to do with maturity. And maturity has nothing to do with advicing. And advicing is just someone's views, it might not be the right stuff for your situation. So you must exercise some thought about this as well. Don't love blindly, don't blindly follow, don't make blind assumptions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the valuable advice misty. Actually she never made any demands or asked for me to be there for her emotionally. But as her boyfriend, I just feel that if I can't be there for her, then what exactly can I do for her?<br><br>I know that I'm not her, and I can never be her. That's one reason why I'll not be able to totally understand her, but still I hope to be able to know how she feels. Not totally, but at least have an understanding.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You realised something : you cannot be her.<br>She has yet to realise this: You cannot be her.<br>Has she adjusted her expectation?<br><br>Put it this way, If I had brain cancer, I suffer. My husband is healthy and strong. He might feel sad and miserable for me. But he will never understand the pain I have to go through. If I ask to be put to death, would he be able to understand my pain and my thought process to arrive at this conclusion. Propably not. I can speak with him, he can be there for me, but he cannot understand 100% my situation. He might cry and he might laugh. But I will also never understand 100% what he feels about my decision and how is he managing it.<br>But what have we arrived at is the acceptance that we are different and feel differently for the same thing. We can and always try to be there for each other but that's about all we can do for each other - to support each other through the hard times. What more can a person ask?</div>
