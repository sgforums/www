              <p>He.  He is making huge promises on the podium.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Probably trying to recover from the huge blow the Clintons suffered when the Kennedy's backed Obama yesterday. </p>
              <p>Hillary should just do a "Vote for one, get one free" campaign, since her husband seems to be constantly in the thick of action as well!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>And therein lies the beauty of Singapore.  Compared to most other developed nations, Singaporeans enjoy a high standard of living with relatively low inflation rates, and education is so highly subsidised, it's astounding.  A lot of other things like our healthcare system, public transport system, is world-class. </p>
              <p>Sadly, Singaporeans in general, do not appreciate how good they have had it in life.  I, for one, never appreciated it until I came over.  Since then, I even have Aussies coming up to me asking why I even bothered to migrate to Australia because they think that Singapore is a brilliant country.  Why, one Aussie even told me that Singapore's healthcare system is Gold Standard and she called Australia's "3rd world".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>People are to blame for loading themselves with debt. If you've lived here before you'll see what I mean. It's just not in their culture to save. I don't mean to generalise but the majority of the people here spend like there's no tomorrow. To add to the problem, there are countless credit card solitications that come through the mail, offering more money the the already strapped. Many are desperate and bite. Aside from that, there are also payday loan places everywhere. Offering to lend money at very very high interest rates.</p>

              <p>i just got a text message a few weeks ago.. it was a scheduled follow-up look at my back injury by NUH...</p>
              <p>the appointment was postponed so many times i forgot about it..</p>
              <p>the appointment date was somewhen in June 2005..</p>
              <p>i remember going to the A&amp;E in NUH in Sep 2006.. A&amp;E doctor screaming into the phone.. the orthopaedic specialist would not come see me.. the A&amp;E doctor apologised to me...</p>
              <p>thankfully, the "2nd tier" public hospitals like AH saw me... that was after a lot of shaking down the various contacts and getting a name and circumventing appointment lists.. that a person with a slipped disc could then go see a doctor.. something the A&amp;E doctors termed "severe pain"..</p>
              <p>i'd say some of the public hospitals are world-class.. some of our public hospitals are world-crass..</p>
              <p>btw.. i'm looking into laser surgery of the spine.. supposedly they do the surgery as a day-surgery thing, and me as the patient will be able to walk away in the evening.. and if the doctors clear it, be well enough to go back to work the next day..</p>
