              <p>Well, there have been cases where nurses are convicted for euthanising patients.  But these are the exceptions rather than the rule.  One has to be of unsound mind to do such a thing in the first place.  Most of us, we just watch, feel really heart-broken, sometimes I choke back tears as I hand over report about the patient, and we just keep on taking care of the patient the best we can until they get discharged to a nursing home where they live out the rest of their days in silent torture...</p>
              <p>Speaking of nurses euthanising patients is just like talking about policemen going postal and randomly shooting the innocent.  I mean, how many of such cases do you get in a decade?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>It's easy to say now, when death is like soooo many decades away.  I've seen elderly people so petrified of death that they become morbidly obsessed with their fears and they hang on to life so desperately that they stress out their families, their doctors and their nurses as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>I have become so tormented nursing a few such patients long-term that I actually pray for them and ask for a quick, painless and peaceful passing over into death for them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png">  It's hard to watch when you've been taking care of them so long, and they keep looking at you and whimpering, and you wipe off their tears, and you can't help but cry with them behind closed curtains. </p>
              <p>I remember my senior nurses and I used to finish our tasks, sit behind the nurses' counter in the ICU and talk about how pitiful some of the patients are.</p>

              <p>Well, I gotta agree with Bear's assertion that euthanasia is standing on a pretty slippery slope.</p>
              <p>It's entirely possible for it to be misused by the government and by individuals to further their own agenda.... the government may legislate it as a means of weeding out what they may consider as 'undesirables', while individuals may use it as a means to top themselves.</p>
              <p>The T4 Euthanasia program used by the Nazis prior to the Holocaust shows just how far it can go.</p>
              <p>My own late grandfather suffered from a stroke several years ago, and was a vegetable for the last two years of his life. I remember spending time by his bedside, wondering just how terrible it would be to be a prisoner in my own mind, unable to fend for myself.</p>
              <p>But nah..... I just can't bring myself to support euthanasia even if I were to leave out my own religious obligations out of it.</p>

              <p>True.  My life is mine to live... and your life is yours to live...</p>
              <p>There was an Aussie doctor who was actively fighting for Euthanasia because he suffered from a debilitating disease affecting the nerves where eventually, he'll become so paralysed, he won't even be able to breathe without a ventilator breathing for him.  He documented his journey to some country in Europe, where he opted for Euthanasia, and was subsequently put down. </p>
              <p>Would you like to keep your loved one alive if he/she becomes a vegetable and everytime you visit him/her, they will look at you with tears in their eyes and whimper and shout and yell and scream in pain and sheer agony?</p>
