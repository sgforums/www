              <p>Reading what you wrote, I can't help but think of the different responses I've seen from families so far regarding the death of the elderly. </p>
              <p>I like what most families do here - the elderly actually save for their own funeral packages, and they make their wishes known to their children.  I remember one family who told me that their dying Nanna wanted a simple cremation and instead of wreaths, she wanted the money to be donated to her favourite charity. </p>
              <p>An elderly patient and I were chatting once and we both hoped that Australia will pass the voluntary euthanasia act during our lifetimes so we can make choices.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Personally I would like voluntary euthanasia to be passed. If Australia keeps yakking about human rights this human rights that, then wouldn't it make sense to allow voluntary euthanasia? Given that it would give us more choices?</p>

              vegetable. Quite a few reports indicate that vegetables are
              actually aware of their surroundings. And those that do recover
              stated that they do know what is going on.....it's just they can't

              <p>Imagine this - you cannot move even a finger.  You can't even turn in bed and when you feel uncomfortable, you can only whimper.  And none of the nurses nor your family know what you want, because you can't talk, can't point.  You get your nutrition via a feeding tube inserted in one of your nostrils.  When you itch, you cannot scratch.  When your mouth feels awful and dry, you cannot ask for water, and no water can be given to you either, because you have been certified by the Speech Therapist as being unable to have anything by mouth. Slowly, your joints stiffen and contract.  They hurt, but when you yell out in pain, nobody knows what you want.  You cry out in sheer frustration but the nurses, doctors, and your loved ones can only stand by your bedside and look at you, totally stumped.  You hear your loved ones crying and discussing about you in  hushed tones, but you can't comfort them.  You can never feel comfortable - your nurses turn you facing left, you cry; facing right, you cry; flat on your back, you also cry; because you ache all over and no position can be comfortable.  Your urine drains through a tube that puts you at risk for infection.  When you need to poo, you poo onto a diaper that will be changed by your nurse during the rounds.  You do not have your personal nurse, and sometimes, you may have to wait 2 hours or more before your nurse returns and realises that you have poo'd so in the meantime, you lie there waiting...  And because you're not moving at all, you develop pressure sores all over...</p>
              <p>In my years of nursing, I have seen too many patients in this cruel and extremely sad state of existence.  I will never wish this on anyone I know, not even on my enemies.  When it's time for my loved ones to go, I hope they will never have to be subject to this.</p>

              <p>WHAT is the point in prolonging the life of the elderly who can't talk, can't move, can't feed themselves, can't clean themselves, etc etc etc?  Medical science has advanced so much so that we CAN keep people alive beyond the 'expiry date', but is it viable? </p>
              <p>Sometimes, when I tend to these patients, I cannot look them in the eye because I feel like crying.  They are in sheer agony, but they are "locked in" and cannot find rest nor respite.  They may be surrounded by their loved ones, but they suffer all alone. </p>
              <p>When it is time to die, just let people die gracefully.  Don't pump me up with drugs and do CPR on me, only to revive me and take care of me as a human vegetable, living and breathing, but otherwise totally useless, helpless, and suffering.  Don't let me see my visitors come and see me, trying to mask their shock at how I have degenerated, and then as the days pass by, fewer and fewer visitors turn up, until slowly, nobody turns up at all. </p>
              <p>I've seen families tortured to the end of their tether, and then being saddled with huge medical bills that will surely take them years to pay, on top of their current mortgages and etc.  The patient, in the meantime, lies in bed, unable to do anything except blink...</p>
