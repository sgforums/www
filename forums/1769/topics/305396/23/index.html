              <p> </p>
              <p>It's a brand new day!  Good morning, all! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At about 8am this morning, some idiot blasted their radio loudly for about half an hour.  I think it was some bloke who parked his car along the street with his radio's volume on high.  Bloody irritating and inconsiderate!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png">  Thank God he stopped and allowed me to slip into bed and hide under my doona to keep warm, hearing the rain go pitter-patter outside...</p>
              <p>But I had a strange, strange dream during that short time!  I dreamt we had a Club 30 Tour to some country!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  I couldn't recall the country's name, but I remember seeing Bear, elindra, av, KB, lau, si gina and kopi's faces! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/omg.png" alt="omg.png"> Thing was, I've never met LF, Fatum and VK, wouldn't know how they look like, and yet, they were there too!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/omg.png" alt="omg.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, our hotel was about 8-10 storeys tall and somehow, we gathered at the rooftop to chill out a lot!  We could see dirty old buildings with character to our left, a bustling city street with new buildings to our back, a lovely residential area to our right with lovely streets and bungalows, and right in front of us, across the major expressway, was the sea!  It wasn't just any sea but a sea of lovely blue and what was striking was, there were a few luxury condominium buildings built right out in the middle of the water!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  I was completely mesmerised by one of the blocks, which had light greenish-blue tinted glass all around the building, and the concrete bits of the building was painted white.  We could look right into the apartments, and I could see lt-green lacquered kitchen cabinets along one wall of the apartments facing us, and all the apartments had sparkling, shiny white marble floors! </p>
              <p>We had dragged our luggage and walked along the roads to our hotel, and the first thing we did was to run up to the rooftop, yakking all the way, bringing our cameras along.  I kept taking shots of that condominium building out in the sea.  And then I suggested we walk over there.</p>
              <p>The walkways out to those blocks were well-paved and surrounded by the sea.  We walked along, chatting loudly as we often do in our outings!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I think KB and a few of you tried to engage me in friendly chat but I was too awed by that lovely block to respond!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>
              <p>When we reached there, a little boy suddenly ran out of the entryway, with his nanny, a young girl in her early 20's rushed out after him.  She had food stains all over her black tee and a bit on her face.  She smiled apologetically and explained that she's the nanny, and ran after the boy.</p>
              <p>Bear then yelled out something like it's time to return to the hotel and Kopi and Fatum agreed, so reluctantly, I walked back too.  The tide had risen then and covered much of the red-brick walkway so it felt like we were all "walking on water"!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  It was very pretty... the walkway had concrete flower boxes with lovely abundant blooms overflowing from them, and the sea was just a pretty colour... We stopped now and then to take photos. </p>
              <p>We arrived back at the rooftop of the hotel and someone asked about dinner so we were discussing where to go for dinner.  I walked out to the edge to stare out at sea and at the block again when I looked down and realised there was a flood!!  The waters were rising!!  There was an expressway bridge in front of the hotel, and the cars that were going down into the adjoining roads were almost completely submerged!  I yelled out and all of you came over and we just stood there and looked at the floodwaters rising... rising... and took photos and discussed "emergency" dinner plans now that we had to stay in the hotel. </p>
              <p>And then... I woke up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>So much water in my dreams!  Glass and water... I go check it up in the dream dictionary!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>OH!!  I forgot to add one important bit!  As we watched the floodwaters rise, I looked out to the blocks out at sea, and saw the seawater slowly rising... rising...  At first, the flood reached the first 3 floors of the condo blocks, but then, it slowly submerged the blocks!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  But somehow, we knew that the blocks were equipped with safety, watertight features, so everyone in the building was safe!  Phew!!!</p>
              <p>But all of us couldn't move and didn't say a word as we watched the blocks go under.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OK, got the following interpretation from<a href="/forums/1769/topics/www.dreammoods.com"> www.dreammoods.com</a>!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Sea </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>   To see the sea in your dream, represents your unconscious and your
              transition between your unconscious and conscious. It also often
              represents your emotions. The dream may also be a pun on your
              understanding and perception of a situation. "I see" or perhaps there
              is something you need to "see" more clearly. Alternatively, the dream
              may indicate a need to reassure yourself or offer reassurance to
              someone.ï¿½</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Flood </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>  </span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;">To see a gentle flood, indicates that your worries over a certain matter will be soon be swept away.  </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Glass </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>   To see glass in your dream, symbolizes passivity or protection. You may
              be putting up an invisible barrier around you in order to protect
              yourself in a situation or relationship. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Road </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>   To see a road in your dream, indicates your sense of direction and
              pursuit of your goals.   </span> <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;">To see a smooth road bordered by green trees and flowers, denotes a steady progress and steady climb up the social ladder.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Bricks </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>   To see a brick in your dream, represents your individual ideas and thoughts. Experience and/or heartbreak may have hardened you.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Plants </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>   To see plants in your dream, indicates fertility, spiritual
              development, growth or the potential for growth. Alternatively, the
              appearance of plants in your dreams reflects your caring and loving
              nature.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: medium;">Camera </span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0066cc; font-size: small;"><br>   To see a camera in your dream, signifies your desires to cling on
              and/or live in the past. Alternatively, it may represent you need to
              focus on a particular situation. Perhaps you need to get a clearer
              picture or idea.</span></p>
              <p>But... but... I saw more than one camera leh!  You know how Club 30 has shutterbugs! </p>
