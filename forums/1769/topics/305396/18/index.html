              <p>i just got a text message a few weeks ago.. it was a scheduled
              follow-up look at my back injury by NUH...</p>
              <p>the appointment was postponed so many times i forgot about
              it..</p>
              <p>the appointment date was somewhen in June 2005..</p>
              <p>i remember going to the A&amp;E in NUH in Sep 2006.. A&amp;E
              doctor screaming into the phone.. the orthopaedic specialist would
              not come see me.. the A&amp;E doctor apologised to me...</p>
              <p>thankfully, the "2nd tier" public hospitals like AH saw me...
              that was after a lot of shaking down the various contacts and
              getting a name and circumventing appointment lists.. that a person
              with a slipped disc could then go see a doctor.. something the
              A&amp;E doctors termed "severe pain"..</p>
              <p>i'd say some of the public hospitals are world-class.. some of
              our public hospitals are world-crass..</p>
              <p>btw.. i'm looking into laser surgery of the spine.. supposedly
              they do the surgery as a day-surgery thing, and me as the patient
              will be able to walk away in the evening.. and if the doctors clear
              it, be well enough to go back to work the next day..</p>

              <p>Well, at one stage, I adopted a tortoise with the head in its shell attitude - I didn't really save because I refused to think of the bad consequences if I don't.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png">  I simply refused to confront certain issues, preferring to be utterly foolish and 'pretend' certain looming issues didn't exist.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  Don't know why I did that, but I did.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/sorry.png" alt="sorry.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Things are different for me now.  Since coming over, my thinking has been transformed.  I now save, and have made plans to ensure my financial stability.  It's going to take years to build, but I'm determined. </p>

              <p>IF I move to the US, it is because in terms of Nursing, their advancements are considered #1.  I want to go there to hone my clinical skills and get higher qualifications.  I want to train and be certified competent to perform certain procedures, which currently, can only be done in the US where RN's are concerned.</p>
              <p>I'm not moving there because I think the system is 'better'.  I do not think it is, as a matter of fact.  But it serves my goals, and that's my motivation.</p>
              <p>Whoever told you that Singapore's healthcare turns away the man-in-the-street.  Bear in mind that worldwide, healthcare resources are always stretched to the max.  It is NOT a problem unique only to Singapore.  Hospital beds will forever be short, doctors and nurses will forever be in shortage as well.  It is a fallacy to think that there will be a 'perfect' health system because it will cost a huge bomb to actually bring that into fruition and reality.</p>
              <p><br>When I worked in SGH, we admitted many beggars and homeless people in need of medical care and who obviously, will never be able to pay for a toothpick, but we took them in, and gave them care, equivalent to a paying patient.</p>
              <p>You have to remember that in ALL hospitals worldwide, there is a priority system.  It starts in the A&amp;E / ER.  We do not give up hospital beds to admit patients who are lower on the priority list, and that is a system that is applied worldwide.  Simple economics.  Hospitals only have a certain no. of beds and hospitals are segregated into acute care / rehab / respite / nursing home, etc.  An acute care hospital like SGH is never going to take in patients who are complaining of 'frivolous' matters, simply because the bed will be given to someone else who is in a more emergent need for the bed.</p>

              <p>I won't deny that our education is of good quality and is highly subsidised....</p>
              <p>But what I don't understand at all is why we would want to extend the subsidies to foreign students.</p>
              <p>It really, really pisses me off that these so called 'Foreign Talents' are only paying a few hundred dollars more than what I've been paying in NUS. It really gets my goat that some of these FTs may be more than able to afford high-class education here, while some promising local students don't get a chance at higher education because they can't afford it. I've personally seen some cases of the latter in real life.</p>
              <p>And really, some of these 'Foreign Talents' seem to be here just to make the numbers... some of them are really below average performance in class and are in fact struggling just to not get superannuated.</p>
              <p>So really, it's like..... I pay my taxes for these fellas to compete with me in terms of education and a career.... I risk my life to defend them while doing reservist.... and some of them can't even make the grade?!?!</p>

              <p><br>Bear, my sales tax is 7.75%. If I were to drive 10 mins to the mall, it's 8.25%. Within a 20 mile radius the sales tax fluctuates. Some places are incorporated, others unincorporated.</p>
              <p>If you're talking about the tax we pay every year, it's horrible. There is state tax and federal tax to pay. You have to be pretty savvy about the tax laws which are quite complicated, to be sure that you're getting every deduction coming to you.</p>

              <p>I won't deny that our education is of good quality and is highly
              subsidised....</p>
              <p>But what I don't understand at all is why we would want to
              extend the subsidies to foreign students.</p>
              <p>It really, really pisses me off that these so called 'Foreign
              Talents' are only paying a few hundred dollars more than what I've
              been paying in NUS. It really gets my goat that some of these FTs
              may be more than able to afford high-class education here, while
              some promising local students don't get a chance at higher
              education because they can't afford it. I've personally seen some
              cases of the latter in real life.</p>
              <p>And really, some of these 'Foreign Talents' seem to be here just
              to make the numbers... some of them are really below average
              performance in class and are in fact struggling just to not get
              superannuated.</p>
              <p>So really, it's like..... I pay my taxes for these fellas to
              compete with me in terms of education and a career.... I risk my
              life to defend them while doing reservist.... and some of them
              can't even make the grade?!?!</p>

              <p>When I arrived here, and saw how things are, and spoke to lots of foreigners who migrated here like myself, some of whom have travelled to Singapore or have lived and worked there for years, I felt sad. </p>
              <p>Sad that our country is not perfect, but has a lot of things going for it.  But sadly, it goes mostly unappreciated.  In a few aspects, Singapore really ranks up there with the big guns.  The only drawback is, we're too small.  We are not populous enough to pack a real punch and get ourselves heard on the international arena.  It's a sad waste. </p>
              <p>We deserve to be known worldwide.  To do that, sacrifices have to be made.  Unfortunately, we do not have natural resources like land.  But we will fast lose our competitive advantage if we don't do something that will help secure our future. </p>
              <p>More than you realise, we NEED the foreign talent.  We are not numerous enough to survive into the future. </p>
              <p>On a micro level, we resent how over-crowded Singapore has become.  We resent the presence of FT's.  And a few other grouses which have been voiced out loud and clear.</p>
              <p>On a macro level, we actually need them to survive.  Look at what's happening to all prominent big cities in the world - which city does not import FT? </p>

              <p>I'm right now so frustrated at work that I draaaaag myself to work too.  I even vented in the Night Owls Chatterboxes, but nobody listened...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/cry.png" alt="cry.png">  Anyways...</p>
              <p>To have the type of immaculate and perfect healthcare system you want, be prepared to pay through your nose.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Not sure if you realise it, but healthcare in Singapore is VERY cheap, in comparison with other developed countries.  The same stuff in Australia cost astronomically more, and don't even think about UK and the US or other European countries!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>I realise your case wasn't treated as well as you would have liked it.  Indeed it would be tough to please everyone.  It doesn't matter how severe one's problem is, the fact that it happens to ME makes it THE most important thing in the world, regardless. </p>
              <p>If we could only follow a doctor / nurse for a week as they go about their duties, we'll realise the severity of the shortage and the shortfalls in resources.  However, it doesn't matter because as long as the person who's sick or injured is ME, all rational thought goes out the window because we will have our own immediate needs to think of.  Reasonable enough.</p>
              <p>I'm saying that it's hard to debate this issue because there is the objective, macro view, and the subjective but not to say invalid, micro view.  If you measure Singapore's healthcare system by how it has met YOUR needs, it might have failed you miserably.  But if you measure it in terms of speediness of response to emergencies, fatality rates, success rate of major operations, etc. stuff that the WHO and the JCI (Joint Commissions International) probably adopts to rank a country's healthcare system, then yes, we are up there.</p>

                  talents..</p>
              <p>and throwing away the "chaff" of our citizenry in order to find
                  that local talent is criminal..</p>
              <p>let me give you an example.. last week, my neighbours we so
                  stressed out they came to my mom who is helping coach their Pr.3
                  child in English.. Pr.3 math.. they had a bunch of questions which
                  only Math geniuses who are capable of multi-dimensional thought and
                  calculation can hope to do...</p>
              <p>only, they gave it to a whole class of a few hundred Pr.3
                  children...</p>
              <p>lots of parents who don't know about Math like my neighbours
                  were wringing their hands in worry and despair.. worse, the stress
                  on the children was tremendous..</p>
              <p>they were looking for the next Carl Gauss.. geniuses which
                  happen maybe one in a generation.. if you are lucky...</p>
              <p>we do not need to be No.1.. if we lose our souls, our humanity
                  and our dignity to be "the best", are we really that good?</p>
              <p>Vanuatu is still "backward and primitive" yet the people there
                  are happiest in the world.. while we are stressed out and unhappy,
                  yet No.1 in everything material.. who got the raw deal?</p>

              <p>Well, if we want to remain tops and be competitive, that has to be done.</p>
              <p>If we want to slowly recede into the murky backwaters and become another Vanuatu, then we'll have to get rid of all our forward-moving policies, and watch Singapore slip into nothingness, into total oblivion.  Will that bring us 'happiness'?  More likely than not, it will create massive unemployment, budgetary imbalance, subsidies we are already enjoying will all be removed, etc etc.  Far-reaching consequences! </p>
              <p>I'm not an authority on FT's.  I'm just sharing my little humble sentiment on an issue from a perspective of maintaining international competitiveness.  You should know I'm not into the Rat Race at all, that's why I'm over here, and not back home!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I'm in the Slack Capital of the world!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>What I'm saying, is out of pride as a Singaporean, and a desire and little glimmer of hope, that Singapore will one day be recognised for the things that ARE good.  Do not interpret that as Carte Blanche for the silly programs that are being carried out.</p>

              <p>To have the type of immaculate and perfect healthcare system you want, be prepared to pay through your nose.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Not sure if you realise it, but healthcare in Singapore is VERY cheap, in comparison with other developed countries.  The same stuff in Australia cost astronomically more, and don't even think about UK and the US or other European countries!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>I realise your case wasn't treated as well as you would have liked it.  Indeed it would be tough to please everyone.  It doesn't matter how severe one's problem is, the fact that it happens to ME makes it THE most important thing in the world, regardless. </p>
              <p>If we could only follow a doctor / nurse for a week as they go about their duties, we'll realise the severity of the shortage and the shortfalls in resources.  However, it doesn't matter because as long as the person who's sick or injured is ME, all rational thought goes out the window because we will have our own immediate needs to think of.  Reasonable enough.</p>
              <p>I'm saying that it's hard to debate this issue because there is the objective, macro view, and the subjective but not to say invalid, micro view.  If you measure Singapore's healthcare system by how it has met YOUR needs, it might have failed you miserably.  But if you measure it in terms of speediness of response to emergencies, fatality rates, success rate of major operations, etc. stuff that the WHO and the JCI (Joint Commissions International) probably adopts to rank a country's healthcare system, then yes, we are up there.</p>

              <p>it isn't about perfect.. it's a simple thing about getting enough headcount to provide the basics to everyone... and have a slight buffer in case there are emergencies like epidemics and maybe a plane crash or something..</p>
              <p>as i see it, on a normal day, healthcare is stretched over its limits as it is..</p>
              <p>if an MRT train derails, the hospitals would probably be unable to cope..</p>

              <p>Yeah.... personally I don't disagree that we do need some foreign talents owing to our small manpower base.</p>
              <p>But what I do object to is freely inviting every single Tom, Dick and Harry who claims to be a foreign talent with wide open arms - and at the expense of the locals.</p>
              <p>Like I said, some of these FT students can barely make the grade.... I can soundly thrash quite a few of them on a good day, and no one ever calls me a 'local talent'.</p>
              <p>All I'm asking for is for their subsidies and benefits to commensurate with their performance..... say, a minimum of 2nd Class (lower) point average for every semester. If they don't get it for two subsequent semesters, cut their subsidies.</p>
              <p>And seriously, if they're really talented and hardworking, 2nd Lower is not a difficult standard to achieve. If they can't even achieve that, then I say that they're eating up our precious resources and that they're no better than deadwood to us.</p>
              <p>I'm sounding pretty harsh here.... but really, I get really riled up when I think about having to bear a $25K tuition loan all by myself while some so-called foreign talents who can more than afford it are eating up our resources with nothing to show for it....</p>
