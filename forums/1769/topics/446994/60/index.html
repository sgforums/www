              <p>Frankly, I have no issue with having a COI on the whole. You need to find out what went wrong in order to implement solutions to solve them. For example, if the COI learns that the train drivers do not have emergency SOPs, then they will force SMRT to make all drivers be trained in emergency drills.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, SMRT is run by morons, so you need to find out what the morons did wrong and force them to fix the problems from there.</p>

              <p>Frankly, I have no issue with having a COI on the whole. You

              Pinky, sometimes when you have a horrible team that runs the place, they'll never get things right. 
              
              Now is simply get outsider to pin point, Malu them to improve. 
              
              Also now we know Saw's mgmt on a clearer picture. 
              
              Need me to say I took a bendy bus ytd, guess what? The articulator is vibrating and making noises badly whenever the bus turns or there's uneven road level. Vibration means something is really wrong.

              <p>The problem is, this is SMRT. We know it is run by morons. So we need smart people to come and teach the morons what to do.</p>
              <p>After all, we all know how short-sighted Saw Phaik Hwa was, what with her insisting that passengers can board the train if they want to. If we leave all the problem-solving to SMRT, they will have a greater incentive to want to ignore the elephant in the room. With a third party involved, they will be forced to confront the problems head-on whether they like it or not.</p>
              <p>Even if they aren't short-sighted, some problems can be more clearly seen by other eyes. Even seasoned experts can be prone to missing errors that other people can see.</p>
              <p>Which was exactly the case when I got pummelled by three professors yesterday when I presented to them a mathematical model for my research work. I was working on my model for weeks, and they only saw it for one hour.</p>
              <p>Yet they managed to see the problems which I couldn't, and now I'm working on refining my work as a result.</p>
