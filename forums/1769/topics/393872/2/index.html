              <p>Ok.... this was on an NUS shuttle bus.... but public transport nonetheless.....</p>
              <p>I was in a near-empty bus when some doofus boarded it.</p>
              <p>Instead of sitting down, he chose to stand and hold on to the overhead handholds. Then when the bus was moving, he would 'swing' like Tarzan while holding on to the handhold and make a 'WOOOOAAAAHHHH!' sound.</p>
              <p>Kaoz. They really need to beef up the NUS admission standards to keep nimrods out.</p>

              <p>A couple of weeks ago over here, a homeless black man and a black woman boarded our bus. They'd been arguing very loudly at the bus stop over $2 and the argument carried on in the bus for 15 minutes... every other sentence from both sides contained 'muthafucker' or 'muthafuckin''...</p>
              <p>Somewhere in that 15 minutes this guy who looked like Bill Crosby boarded the bus. He saw what was going on, and asked aloud, "Am I on the right bus?!"</p>
              <p>That made everyone laugh and this young guy yelled, "This is the bus of freedom!"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>And tonight there were free shuttle bus services from the St Patrick's block party to anywhere in the county. On my bus the other passengers were a bunch of friends. And the loudest one asked his friends things like, "If a woman told you, 'Buy me a drink,' what would you say?" "Would you push her off a cliff or hold her head underwater to drown her?" "But she's only had one drink, how would you make her drunk?" etc</p></div>

              <p>I think I met that man on the bus before, he was sprewing profanities to no one in particular then suddenly he turn to the Indian guy sitting beside him and scold him with profanities like blaming him for something.</p>
              <p>When the Indian guy got up to alight, that madman even slap him on the back. Luckily the Indian guy didn't retatilate and just walk off, and the madman alight at Bedok.</p>
