              <p>There's this old man near Hougang CC who stands at the bus-stop with a whistle.</p>

              <p>Maybe that guy has tourettes syndrome or something?<br><br>Local public transport I think the most perverse thing I had witnessed was standing next to a teenage couple in a very crowded train where the girl was whispering very loudly about *cough* her lack of underwear and the boy's reaction to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taking the greyhound in US alone to Vegas, I remember the very uncomfortable experience of having a terrible stomachache enroute... and not being able to go to the coach toilet cos a wino was drunk across the door, and not daring to go at the toilet stops cos scared the bus will leave without me. Wa, I tahan for HOURS until Reno. *cold sweat*</p>
              <p>During the same journey, the coach stopped in the middle of the desert (and middle of the night) and the driver stopped the bus and came to this guy sitting a couple of rows in front  and threaten to kick him off for disturbing the guy next to him. Wonder how he was disturbing him cos err I didnt hear anything leh.</p>

His parents had warned him to quieten down or he will be caned when reached home.
