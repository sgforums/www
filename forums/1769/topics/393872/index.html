              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I'll start with what I saw yesterday at the MRT:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">There was a middle-aged man who had his ezlink card in his shirt pocket. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Instead of taking his card out to tap the scanner, he bowed ninety degrees from his waist to bring his shirt pocket to the card scanner on the faregate. <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>as posted few days ago, on the escalator in orchard MRT station, there's a cheena lady infront of me dropped her ezlink card... So she actually bend down to pick it up when we're near the end(top) of the escalator... There was quite alot of ppl so I couldn't move away and knocked into her, however she tried to shove me away and due to my weight, I really lost my balance and fell backwards...</p>
              <p>Thank god there was a whole line of ppl behind me and the escalator so they pushed back and the cheena lady fell forward... Made a scene but no one bothered abt her...</p>

              <p>I think what she did wrong was that she shoved back.....</p>
              <p>She gotta understand that people knocking into her is still quite understandable..... as much as she needs to pick up her card, stopping dead in her tracks would lead to everyone behind her knocking into her. In the end, everyone has to be more understanding with regards to this.</p>
              <p>However, her shoving back is absolutely unacceptable, especially more so at the top of a crowded upwards-riding escalator. The domino effect can be very dangerous.</p>

              <p>The moment I sat on her, she struggled to stand up.</p>
              <p>So I tell her in chinese: "Want a seat? You can have it. But if you take MY seat, I'll sit on you like I'm doing now."</p>
              <p>She proceeds to yell a bit more, some people laugh.</p>
              <p>Then I stand up and ask her in a very hostile way: "Are you gonna get up now or do you want me to sit on you all the way to Dhoby Ghaut?"</p>
              <p>She gets up and I get the seat.</p>

              <p>She gotta understand that people knocking into her is still
              quite understandable..... as much as she needs to pick up her card,
              stopping dead in her tracks would lead to everyone behind her
              knocking into her. In the end, everyone has to be more
              understanding with regards to this.</p>
              <p>However, her shoving back is absolutely unacceptable, especially
              more so at the top of a crowded upwards-riding escalator. The
