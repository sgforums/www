            <div class='col-md body'>Tonight is a very peaceful, quiet and still night.  Everyone seems to be holed up in their cozy apartments, turning in for the night.  It truly is unusually quiet here, even the usual folks who stay up late to chat with me have gone to bed early or didn't log on at all.<br><br>I relish the occasional solitude, it's refreshing for the soul.  It's a time for retrospection, for making plans, for thinking of loved ones, for daydreaming.  As I stand at my kitchen window and look out at the world, nothing stirs.  Everything is enveloped in a deep, deep sleep.<br><br>I can't help thinking about the what was, what is, and what is to come's.  Of course, I've had my share of good times and bad, I bear battle scars and wounds but I'm proud of them all.  I think I've fought the fight well thus far.<br><br>There is an aching loneliness welling up deep within me.  My close friends have either migrated, or are busy with their careers and partners and/or families and this year, I found myself in a situation of sudden aloneness, especially when my close buddy of 19 years, Sydney Librarian, left with her husband for Sydney.  Suddenly, I had no one to talk to about my day's progress, no one to listen to me and egg me on, encourage me, help me work out my frustrations, wait patiently with me as the tides of moodiness ebb and flow.<br><br>I've sat at the upper deck of the bunk bed in one of the bedrooms, drawing my knees up to my chest and hugging them tight, looking out the window, and felt how ironic it was that something as empty as loneliness could actually fill you up so completely.<br><br>It was easy to be despondent, easy to sink into depression, easy to be lulled into the lie that nobody cared but deep inside, I could not deny that I had an innate passion for life.  I love the little things in life, the stop-and-smell-the-roses moments, and I hold as my mantra - "Be passionate, with no holds barred, and live life to the fullest".<br><br>I guess that's why I still trod on, putting on a brave front despite and in spite of the challenges and trials of life that I now face alone.  And that is why, despite getting wounded time and time again in love, I choose not to be consumed by bitterness but to always keep that little bud of faith and hope alive within my heart.  Call me naive, call me innocent, but I do not want to be anything else but true.  I do not know when I'll meet him but I do not want to deny him of my love and passion to the fullest and my unguarded trust when we finally meet, just because others, who once held their hands out to me, broke their promises.<br><br>I will continue to stick my head out and bear the blows that might befall.  For I cannot live without passion and it is so much an integral part of me.  I have no foresight on how much longer I shall have to walk the journey of life alone, but one thing I do know, and that is in every little corner you turn, there's always hope, there's always love.  And those are what I shall cling on to, as I take the next step, alone but still courageous.<br><br></div>

But your prints are a disorganized stream of<br><br>zigzags, starts, stops, turnarounds, circles, departures and returns.<br><br>For much of the way it seems to go like this. But gradually, your<br><br>footprints come more in line with the Lord's, soon paralleling His<br><br>consistently. You and Jesus are walking as true friends.<br><br>This seems perfect, but then an interesting thing happens: your<br><br>footprints that once etched the sand next to the Master's are now walking<br><br>precisely in His steps. Inside His larger footprints is the small<br><br>'sandprint', safely enclosed. You and Jesus are becoming one.<br><br>This goes on for many miles. But gradually you notice another<br><br>change. The footprint inside the larger footprint seems to grow larger.<br><br>Eventually it disappears altogether. There is only one set of footprints.<br><br>They have become one.<br><br>Again, this goes on for a long time. But then something awful<br><br>happens. The second set of footprints is back. And this time it seems<br><br>even worse. Zigzags all over the place. Stops. Starts. Deep gashes in the<br><br>sand. A veritable mess of prints.<br><br>You're amazed and shocked. But this is the end of your dream. Now<br><br>you speak. 'Lord, I understand the first scene with the zigzags and fits<br><br>and starts and so on. I was a new Christian, just learning. But You<br><br>walked on through the storm and helped me learn to walk with you.'<br><br>'That is correct.'<br><br>'Yes, and when the smaller footprints were inside of Yours, I was<br><br>actually learning to walk in Your steps. I followed You very closely.'<br><br>'Very good. You have understood everything so far.'<br><br>'Then the smaller footprints grew and eventually filled in with<br><br>Yours. I suppose that I was actually growing so much that I was becoming<br><br>like you in every way.'<br><br>'Precisely.'<br><br>'But this is my question. Lord.. Was there a regression or<br><br>something? The footprints went back to two, and this time it was worse<br><br>than the first.'<br><br>The Lord smiles, then laughs. 'You didn't know?' He says. 'That<br><br>was when we danced'."<br><br></div>

But your prints are a disorganized stream of<br><br>zigzags, starts, stops, turnarounds, circles, departures and returns.<br><br>For much of the way it seems to go like this. But gradually, your<br><br>footprints come more in line with the Lord's, soon paralleling His<br><br>consistently. You and Jesus are walking as true friends.<br><br>This seems perfect, but then an interesting thing happens: your<br><br>footprints that once etched the sand next to the Master's are now walking<br><br>precisely in His steps. Inside His larger footprints is the small<br><br>'sandprint', safely enclosed. You and Jesus are becoming one.<br><br>This goes on for many miles. But gradually you notice another<br><br>change. The footprint inside the larger footprint seems to grow larger.<br><br>Eventually it disappears altogether. There is only one set of footprints.<br><br>They have become one.<br><br>Again, this goes on for a long time. But then something awful<br><br>happens. The second set of footprints is back. And this time it seems<br><br>even worse. Zigzags all over the place. Stops. Starts. Deep gashes in the<br><br>sand. A veritable mess of prints.<br><br>You're amazed and shocked. But this is the end of your dream. Now<br><br>you speak. 'Lord, I understand the first scene with the zigzags and fits<br><br>and starts and so on. I was a new Christian, just learning. But You<br><br>walked on through the storm and helped me learn to walk with you.'<br><br>'That is correct.'<br><br>'Yes, and when the smaller footprints were inside of Yours, I was<br><br>actually learning to walk in Your steps. I followed You very closely.'<br><br>'Very good. You have understood everything so far.'<br><br>'Then the smaller footprints grew and eventually filled in with<br><br>Yours. I suppose that I was actually growing so much that I was becoming<br><br>like you in every way.'<br><br>'Precisely.'<br><br>'But this is my question. Lord.. Was there a regression or<br><br>something? The footprints went back to two, and this time it was worse<br><br>than the first.'<br><br>The Lord smiles, then laughs. 'You didn't know?' He says. 'That<br><br>was when we danced'."<br><br></div></blockquote>That's a refreshing read from the usual Footprints poem! I like that! Thanks for sharing it with us kops.</div>
