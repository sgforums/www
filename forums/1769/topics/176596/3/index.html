Helps when u ordering for the person or recommending something or even cooking lol<br><br>The other advantage naturally is you can order different dishes and try each others. LOL theres only so many salads or pasta dishes lol and you try eating at chinese restaurant with a non meat eater, so much pain working out what dishes have vegegables when only ordering for 2.</div>

Remembering that everybodies circumstances are all different. From what i understand from reading this sad touching story is that these couple fall below what we may consider as the poverty line. And they seem happy. Not all guys are as expressive either thru cultural upbringing or just personality. I have a friend whom had told me that his dad would get upset to the point of yelling at him if he helps his mom and sister clear the table.<br><br>As long as there is love and mutual respect, with no abuse of any kind. We are not one to judge or call anyone cheapskates.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this couple is in Singapore ba... I dont think they really earn so little that must share one packet of rice ba.. but the girl often say she got small appetite doesn't matter. (She is not VERY skinny, just normal size)In this particular situation though, I think the guy is just self centred. He does spend on the things HE like - CDs and stuff. I am sure he can afford a better meal for her ONCE a freakin' year.<br><br>But in a situation where both parties are broke and poor, I guess sharing food can fill the tummy and the heart.<br><br>And yes, hehehe.. I guess the guys splurging does create some atmosphere (and help the economy too!)<br><br>But its more fun to get flowers during times when not EVERYONE seem to be holding a buncha flowers. ANd it is more fun to get a gift, when there is no occasion at all.</div>
