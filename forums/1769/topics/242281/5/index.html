I was seasick throughout the entire 4 hour ordeal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> They had the ceremony on the top deck (open air). Then it started raining so they had to pull the tarp over the top which made the air so stuffy. That was bad bad bad. Then the boat started to rock. BAD BAD BAD. At this point I just wanted to run below deck for relief. As soon as they said their "I do's" and kissed, zoom! I ran down to the lower deck where they had the buffet laid out. All I wanted was a seat and to rest my head on the table. All was well until the ceremoniously removed all the lids to the buffet spread and filled the air with smells from the buffet. That did it, I ran for the loo and *brrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaakkkkkkkk!* I didn't get any relief after spilling my guts out. I just couldn't wait for the bloody boat to get back to the WTC where I was the first one off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Never again.</div>
