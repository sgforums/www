Or do you want it to be at the church?<br><br>We didn't get married in the church as there were several reasons:<br>- need to organise transport to take me from home to church, church to reception (extra cost)<br><br>- extra cost to have it at church<br><br>- Most people have the church wedding at 2pm and reception at 6pm so what are the guests going to do in between??  Too troublesome.<br><br>So we ended up having our wedding ceremony and reception at the same place.  Fortunately in Oz, many reception places have their own chapel for people to use.  My pastor was very kind to come out to officiate our wedding (FOC).   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote></div>

Prolonged stress like that will really wear you out.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>1)  do you have a favourite style or neckline, or one that you know will really flatter you?  Or eliminate the styles that you CANNOT do?  It's a good start.<br><br>2)  no worries sooner or later you will find one !<br><br>3)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  for the sake of your sanity, try not to compare!  I think the bridal studios have good MUA too, so many clients can't be wrong.  Go to your bridal studio's thread on sgbrides.com, read the reviews of the MUAs by the other girls , choose the best rated, then firmly tell your studio you want to work with her.   The studio can accomodate it.<br><br>4) Aahh... this one is abit LL.  Have you tried giving the pastor a major guilt trip ?  I would if I were you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>5)  2 kg very good wad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Slow &amp; steady wins the race<br><br>6)  Haha it happens <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Nehmind try to save on other things<br><br>7)  Err, no.

Even with that size, it's hard enough to get to know the people, not to mention the pastoral team.  We know them but they don't know you.<br><br>However, I don't think our church has any restriction of which day of the week to do wedding.  As long as they are available and you're a member of the church, they are happy to do it for free (including doing the premarital counselling).<br><br>I chose that particular pastor to officiate our wedding because I had dealt with him in the past before when I was helping out with the monthly holy communion preparation.  It was fortunate that he was available for our wedding day.  He did a very fantastic job and many of our non-Christian friends came up to tell us later how much they enjoyed the service.<br><br>Anyway, I am sure everything will fall into places for you.  Perhaps, you might have to approach another church to get the pastor there to officiate your wedding.  Keep praying about it and let God guide you what He wants you to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I actually bought it on lay-by, put some deposit and I had 3 months to pay it off.  I could pay it off in one go but since I didn't need the dress yet, might as well let them keep the dress for me while I can free up some cash.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Also, for Western culture, you're not supposed to show your "hubby-to-be" your wedding dress until the actual wedding day!!</div>
