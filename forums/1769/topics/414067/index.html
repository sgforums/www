              <p>"A woman has been given a full refund after being forced to squeeze into her plane seat next to an obese woman.</p>
              <p>Janet
               Ogilvie boarded a flight from Halifax to Ottawa in Canada last month 
              when she found the overweight woman sitting in the window seat and about
               half of Ms Ogilvie's aisle seat, the Ottawa Citizen has reported.</p>
              <p>"She
               figures the woman's spine was where the middle armrest comes down when 
              in use. The woman also needed a belt extender to be able to buckle up," 
              according to the media report.</p>
              <p>"The plane was full, flight 
              attendants told her. So Ogilvie . . . wedged herself into the 10 inches 
              (25cm) that remained of her seat.</p>
              <p>"The one-hour 45-minute flight 
              to Ottawa was brutally uncomfortable, though Ogilvie didn't say anything
               to the woman for fear of embarrassing her. Ogilvie's right hip became 
              her rear end."</p>
              <p>Ms Ogilvie said she was "pressed up tight against her for the whole flight".</p>
              <p>Ms Ogilvie later complained to Porter Airlines, but received "a tepid apology at best".</p>
              <p>"She was told politely she could forget about a refund," the Ottawa Citizen said.</p>
              <p>"Giving
               a second seat at no cost to people with disabilities is what Air 
              Canada, including its regional carrier, Air Canada Jazz, and WestJet are
               already required to do by the Canadian Transport Agency.</p>
              <p>"The 
              three airlines must give disabled passengers - including those who need a
               companion to travel with or are declared by their doctors to be too 
              large to fit in a single seat - two seats for the price of one on all 
              domestic flights."</p>
              <p>The one-person, one-fare policy was introduced 
              in 2008 after a joint complaint to the agency from three people 
              involving the two major airlines, the Ottawa Citizen said.</p>
              <p>"According
               to an email sent Monday to Ogilvie from Robert Deluce, Porter's 
              president and chief executive, the airline is following the same policy 
              to some degree," according to the media report.</p>
              <p>"Writes Deluce to 
              Ogilvie: 'Porter, will . . . if given sufficient notice and medical 
              confirmation, offer obese passengers a second seat gratis in an effort 
              to mitigate a situation as the one experienced by you. Regrettably, 
              however, not only was your flight at capacity, but also the passenger 
              seated in 9A did not alert us to (her) condition prior to flight time. 
              As your safety was considered not at risk, we proceeded as scheduled.'</p>
              "Deluce's
               explanation is misleading. While the airlines actually affected by the 
              CTA order will supply a second seat for free to an obese passenger who 
              has a doctor's certification, carriers can refuse to accommodate those 
              who just show up at the airport without giving prior notice."</div>

              <p>I guess it's not so funny if you're the one being squeezed out of your seat.  It happened to me once on a flight back to SG.  I had the window seat and the lady spilled over into my seat and leg space.  For the next six hours or so, I was imprisoned in my tiny little corner and I felt so claustrophobic, I wanted to scream.</p>

              <p><br>All commercial aircraft, at least in the US, use standard weights for passengers and baggage. These weights vary among airlines, but I recall a friend who flies for Delta (ex Northwest) telling me that the references used in weight and balance calculations for a 757 are 180 lbs. per passenger in summer and 185 lbs. in winter, with bags figured in at 25 lbs. per passenger for domestic flights and 35 lbs. for international flights. I would imagine that one or two morbidly obese passengers wouldn't skew the average much, but an entire planeload of fatties might be a different story.</p>
              <p>Aircraft also have to be loaded to maintain a center of gravity within a certain range, lest the plane be difficult to fly or outright uncontrollable. That's the reason flight attendants occasionally reseat passengers on lightly loaded planes prior to takeoff.</p>
