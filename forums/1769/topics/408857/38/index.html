              <p>I'm a dummy when it comes to DSLRs, having used compacts for
              most of my life. But the mirrorless SLDs look attractive to me as a
              bridge to SLRs, and the low-light photos appear to be better
              too.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I can see how the GF1's low light performance would be a leap ahead of that of point-and-shoots, but ultimately the Four Thirds sensor isn't great at low light and I expect that it would only be a matter of time before you were dissatisfied with its low-light performance.</p>
              <p>If you're looking to jump to DSLRs, I'd recommend just getting one instead of going via an SLD.  Keep in mind that the lenses and other bits of kit wouldn't be compatible unless you stayed with Olumpus DSLR bodies, and to be frank they're good but not great.</p>
              <p>All in all, speaking from experience, incremental improvements come with the risk of ending up being more expensive if you go whole hog.  I went from this:</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/Gedanken/400D_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>to this:</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/Gedanken/50D_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>to this:</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/Gedanken/5D_s.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533"></p>
              <p>and finally to this:</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/Gedanken/1DS3_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>If I'd gone straight for the 5D from the get-go, I'd have saved a good couple of grand.  If you figure you're going to get a DSLR, bite the bullet and go straight for it - you'll do yourself a favour.</p>
