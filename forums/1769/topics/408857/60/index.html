              <p>cos my father was a child of the 40s .....</p>
              <p>he was a young man when Singapore was born, a chinese high student when the commies were in there, and he went through all the trials and tribulations that Singapore went through  in her birth pangs and her youth .....</p>
              <p>That's why my father, regardless of all the COEs, GSTs, high housing prices etc etc, still remain a staunch MIW supporter. He started out at JVI when jurong and tuas was still a swamp, and witness the transformation, and he knows things could have been a lot worse. Oh, he'll bitch and rant like a typical Singaporean for sure, and he's never forgiven old lee for closing nantah ..... but he's cognizant of what the lees has done for Singapore, so, weighing things out he's still an unwavering supporter.</p>
              <p>He called me up at 1am last night from China over this.</p>

              <p>actually I'll sort of accept it as natural (though regrettable) if they did feel happy if their enemy or hated person died. But in this case, the deceased wasn't even responsible for their problems. Apparently they just have this unreasonable and towering resentment that needs any kind of outlet.</p>
