              <p><img src="http://www.cnmedbook.com/bookpic/2005112913561912398.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>TCM says that the root reason for sickness to occur is not the disease itself but to the body yin yang and the 5 elements inbalance and the body resistance of that person also known as the positive Qi(æ­£æ°”). The cause of the sickness is because of the negative Qi(é‚ªæ°”) in the body.  So there is this saying &lt;æ­£èƒ½å¾¡é‚ªï¼Œæ­£æ°”å†…å­˜, é‚ªä¸�å�¯å¹²&gt;The positive Qi is able to defend the negative Qi, so if the positive Qi is strong, then the negative Qi will not grow and one will not fall sick. However if the body is weak, then the negative Qi will grow and one will fall sick.</p>
              <p>External sickness are transmitted thru the meridians, brusies and thru the Triple Burners. Internal sickness are transmitted thru the meridian and accupoint to the internal organs.There when Yin and Yang is inbalance, is the root cause of the sickness.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ä¸­åŒ»è¯Šæ–­å­¦ - TheTCM Diagnosis Doctrine</span></strong></p>
              <p>The method of TCM diagnosis is the 4 basic steps (<strong>å››è¯Š -  æœ›ï¼Œé—»ï¼Œé—®ï¼Œåˆ‡</strong>). This is translated to be <strong>WATCH, SMELL, ASK</strong> and <strong>PULSE. </strong>Using these 4 basic steps, one is able to draw a conclusion for the purpose of diagnosis.</p>
              <p> 1) WATCH (<strong>æœ›</strong>) - This is to lookout for the colour, shape and characteristic of the external organs for a diagnosis. For example, by looking at the tip of the tongue, if the tip of the tongue have black spots, one is able to diagnose that the patient may have a heart block.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/2343/pic1ohy.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>2) SMELL (<strong>é—»</strong>) - This is to look out for foul smell in the organs, such as the smell of the phlegm, fluid or from the mouth.</p>
              <p>3) ASK (<strong>é—®</strong>) - By asking the patient questions, one is able to diagnose from the symptom or by listening to the patient talks.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/2673/picvr.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>4) PULSE (<strong>åˆ‡</strong>) - Although here is translated as pulse, there is more to it, such as feeling the patient stomach, skin etc, but the most common of it all is to feel the pulse of the patient.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">è¾¨è¯�- Analysis and Differentiating Pathological Conditions</span></p>
              <p>There are several method of Analysis and Differentiating the Syndrome :</p>
              <p>1) è„�è…‘è¾¨è¯� - Organs Analysis - According to the TCM theory, disorders in organs may be due to organs themselves, or it may result by a broken relationship between the organs. Therefore, the health of the organs is identified according to their unique physiological functions. Problems arising in the five "yin" or "zang" organs tend to be more serious.</p>
              <p>2) å…­ç»�è¾¨è¯� - 6 Meridians Analysis - According to the eight principles theory, diseases in the yang meridians belong to the exterior and are more often seen as heat and excess(<em>shi</em>) syndromes. Diseases in the yin meridians belong to the interior and are more often seen cold and deficiency(<em>xu</em>) syndromes. When there are changes in any of these six meridians, symptoms associated with the malfunctioning of the connected organs or other interrelated meridians will appear. The six-meridian method is regarded as an incomplete method for identifying all organs or meridians diseases; because, this method mainly focuses on cold-induced diseases (<strong class="etitle02">shanghan</strong>). Although syndromes of the six meridians differ, they are interrelated due to a constant changing process.</p>
              <p> 3) æ°”è¡€è¾¨è¯� - 4 Stages  - The four stages: defense(<em>wei</em>), vital energy(<em>qi</em>), nutrient (<em>ying</em>) and blood(<em>xue</em>). These are the four body strata used to explain the location and severity of pathological changes, and form the basis of clinical treatment. This method not only characterizes the four types of febrile disease syndromes, but it is also a reflection of the four grades of severity of febrile diseases during their development.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/1401/pic2uts.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>4) å…«çº²è¾¨è¯� - Eight Principles Analysis - The concept of this method is that signs and symptoms of a disease or illness can be generalized according to the eight principles. For instance, the location or severity of the disease may be termed as interior or exterior; the nature of the disease may be divided into cold or heat syndromes; and the condition of the disease may belong to either the excess(å®ž<em>shi</em>) or deficiency(è™šx<em>u</em>) syndromes. The interior, cold and deficiency syndromes are categorized as yin; the exterior, heat and excessive syndromes are categorized as yang. As a whole, yin and yang is a compendium of the other six principles. Although these four pairs of categories have different characteristics, the patterns <em>sometimes interact. </em></p>

              <p>To gather a bunch of herbs together cannot be call a formula (æœ‰è�¯æ— æ–¹) if the principle is not adhered, therefore the choice of herbs is important. These herbs are usually grouped in 4 category namely &lt;å�›ï¼Œè‡£ï¼Œä½�ï¼Œä½¿&gt; the monarch, the minister, the assistant and the guide.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Monarch</strong> :- the ingredient that exerts the major and leading effects in a formula. Generally, monarch drugs should constitute the largest proportion of a formula; a competent formula usually only contains one to two principal herbs so that the therapeutic effects can be focused.</li>
              <li><strong>Minister</strong> :- Also known as the associate ingredient usually refers to two different functions. One is to support the monarch drug to exert major actions on the body, and the second is to improve and treat the accompanying symptoms or coexisting disharmony pattern. In comparison with the monarch drug, the minister drug usually has a weaker action.</li>
              <li><strong>Assistant</strong> :- The ingredients can play one of the following three roles in a formula. One is to reinforce the effects of the monarch or minister drug or to treat the less important coexisting patterns. The second role is to eliminate the toxicity of the monarch and minister ingredients, or modulate their harsh properties, and the third is to provide paradoxical assistance.</li>
              <li><strong>Guide</strong> :- These have two different functions. One is to force the actions of the formula on the target meridian or area of the body; and the second is to harmonise and integrate the effects on the other drugs.</li>

              <p>å‰‚åž‹- (Formulae) refers to the prescriptions, be it for the purpose of drinks concotion, pills, powdered medication or paste and the quantity of each herb in the formula. Gone will be the day when you cannot make out what those "bean sprouts" wording that was scribbled on the piece of paper by the TCM physicians with the development of computers, but nevertheless, we will try to make out what those prescription meants especially the measurement.</p>

              <p>The metric system of measurement is fast replacing these measurement and gone will be the days when you stood at the counter watching the TCM pharmacist going through the prescriptions with the little danching playing with the little weight.</p>

              <p>So, you may ask, does TCM really have any relation to the Purple Star Astrology. Well, we have some case studies  of how The Purple Star Astrology and the Yin Yang and 5 Elements relationship to that Health Palace.</p>
              <p> It may be interesting to show the case studies but I'm pretty sure many will not be able to grasp it so, that will be it for now.</p>
