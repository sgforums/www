              <p>Thanks! This is interesting reading~ I met a friend recently who shared with me her experience:</p>
              <p>She was suffering from chronic backpain and went to the doctor who gave her all the MRI or Xray and the conclusion was she had a slip disc at her lower back. Despite the injections and pain killers and all, she still had a very severe pain but they didn't take her seriously - claiming that it was depression and even making comments like "you don't LOOK like you are in that much pain"</p>
              <p>Eventually when they discharged her, she went to a TCM physician. The TCM physician checked her and told her she had another slip disc near her brain stem and it is extremely serious and in the end, actually called the ambulance for her to send her straight to the hospital. Then THIS TIME they did another xray or something for her upper back - then they found the 2nd slip disc...</p>
              <p>so scary leh...</p>

              <p>In the Tao of TCM, Man and Nature are opposing each other yet they are ONE. Man live by the Nature and yet Nature's condition is the Man's surviving condition. Supposing the weather (nature) changes gradually, Man's body condition will change accordingly too. But if the change is too drastic, and Man's body condition is unable to adjust itself accordingly too quickly, then the balance is broken, Man's body will fall sick.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ç²¾æ°”å­¦è¯´ - The Life Force Doctrine</span></strong></p>
              <p>I have googled for a translation to the above and it is being translated as "refine air doctrine". However I find this translation lack volume. Anyway I prefer to call it Life force. There are 5 parts to this topic namely æ°” (Qi)ï¼Œè¡€(Blood)ï¼Œæ´¥æ¶²(fluid)ï¼Œç²¾(growth)ï¼Œç¥ž(force).</p>
              <p><img src="http://a1.att.hudong.com/00/26/16300000092150124716267310827.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="294"></p>
              <ol>
              <li>æ°” - Qi is necessary for the support of life and activities in the human body. Qi is derive from body force+glucose+air (ç²¾æ°”+æ°´è°·ç²¾å¾®+æ¸…æ°”). Qi can be classified into (body temperature)å�«æ°”ï¼Œ(force in the blood)è�¥æ°”ï¼Œ(energy in the organs)è„�è…‘ä¹‹æ°”ï¼Œ(energy from the meridians)ç»�ç»œä¹‹æ°” and (energy at the accupoint)å®—æ°”. It puropse is to change the chemical in the body (eg. converting food to protein), body self defence, controls (eg passing urine), activate activites and regulate body temperature. </li>
              <li>è¡€- Blood is the fluids that flows in the blood veins and is also necessary for the support of life and activities in the human body. Blood is derive from energy in the blood+gulcose+air (è�¥æ°”+æ°´è°·ç²¾å¾®+æ¸…æ°”). Its purpose is to carry vitamins to all parts of the body. </li>
              <li>æ´¥æ¶²- This is the total fluid in the body. æ´¥ is the thin layer of light fluid (eg sweat) in the body, usually on the surface of the skin to rejuvinate the skin and muscle. æ¶² is the layer of heavy fluid flowing along the bone joints. It helps to lubricate the joints. </li>
              <li>ç²¾ - is the energy that creates birth (eg. sperms) for the purpose of pro-creation and blood. </li>
              <li>ç¥ž- here, it doesn't refer to GOD but rather the external appearance of the person, such as attention, feeling and consciousness.</li>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>The internal organs doctrine is the research of the organisation of the organs, the understanding of the function of each organ, the sickness related to the organ and the inter-relation of the organs. This is the core study of TCM and the basis of the TCM diagnosis. The internal organs can be classified into the following 3 catageories,5 major organs (äº”è„�)ï¼Œ6 hollow organs (å…­è…‘)ï¼Œ 6 special class hollow organs (å¥‡æ�’ä¹‹è…‘)ã€‚</p>
              <p>1) <strong>äº”è„�</strong>- The 5 major organs consist of the å¿ƒ-HEART, è‚�-LIVER, è„¾-SPLEEN, è‚º-LUNG and è‚¾-KIDNEY. These organs have the ability to transform and keep the life force necessary for the function of the body. This is also the root to the cause of all illness in the other organs as well. The failure of any of these organs can lead to death.</p>
              <p>2) <strong>å…­è…‘</strong>- The six hollow organs consist of the èƒ†-GALL, èƒƒ-STOMACH, å¤§è‚ -LARGE INTESTINE, å°�è‚ -SMALL INTESTINE, è†€èƒ±-BLADDER and the ä¸‰ç„¦-THREE BURNERS. The function of these organs is to digest, transport the nutrients and to clear the toxic waste in the body.</p>
              <p>3)  <strong>å¥‡æ�’ä¹‹è…‘</strong> - The 6 special class hollow organs consist of the è„‘-BRAIN, é«“-MARROW, éª¨-BONE, è„‰-MERIDIANS,  å¥³å­�èƒž-FEMALE CELL - THE UTERUS. These organs are usually hollow in the middle and collect the Yin energy (é˜´ç²¾). Because they are hollow, they resemble the <strong>è…‘</strong> yet their nature is to keep the energy, resembling the <strong>è„�</strong>, thus classfied under the special class.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This chart shows the characteristic of the 5 major organs with the 5 hollow organs.</span></p>
              <p>1) <strong>Heart (å¿ƒ)-</strong> The element of the heart is FIRE (ç�«), therefore the representative colour is RED. The purpose of the heart is transporting of the blood thru the veins to all parts of the body. It is also incharge of the person outlook as well as the sweating function. The inducing resusciation or "open and close" (å¼€çª�) organ is thru the tongue. This means that by looking at the tongue, you can tell the condition of the heart. The representative taste of the heart is bitter. The link between the è„� and the è…‘ is the heart (å¿ƒ) and the small intestine (å°�è‚ ). This means that before the heart gets ill, the small intestine may show the first sign of illness. So, in order to treat the illness in the small intestine, you have to take care of the root cause the heart too. </p>
              <p>2) <strong>Lung (è‚º)-</strong> The element of the lung is METAL (é‡‘) , therefore the representative colour is WHITE. The purpose of the lung is for breathing, sweat glands to regulate the body temperature and transportation of water/sweat.  The inducing resusciation or "open and close" (å¼€çª�) organ is thru the nose. Therefore patients with lung problem can be seen with running nose etc. The representative taste of the lung is "fishy". The link between the è„� and the è…‘ is the lung (è‚º) and the large intestine (å¤§è‚ ). This means that before the lung gets ill, the large intestine may show the first sign of illness. So, in order to treat the illness in the large intestine, you have to take care of the root cause the lungs too. </p>
              <p>3) <strong>Spleen (è„¾)-</strong> The element of the spleen is EARTH (åœŸ), thefore the representative colour is YELLOW. The purpose of the spleen is for transportation, energising the Qi and blood forming. The inducing resusciation or "open and close" (å¼€çª�) organ is thru the mouth. Therefore patients with spleen problem can be seen with a smelling mouth etc. The representative taste of the spleen is sweet bitter. The link between the è„� and the è…‘ is the spleen (è„¾) and the stomach (èƒƒ). This means that before the spleen gets ill, the stomach may show the first sign of illness. So, in order to treat the illness in the stomach, you have to take care of the root cause the spleen too. </p>
              <p>4) <strong>Liver (è‚�)-</strong> The element of the liver is WOOD (æœ¨), thefore the representative colour is GREEN. The purpose of the liver is for storage of blood, veins and fulid. The inducing resusciation or "open and close" (å¼€çª�) organ is thru the eyes. Therefore patients with liver problem can be seen with a yellowish eyes etc. The representative taste of the liver is sour bitter. The link between the è„� and the è…‘ is the liver (è‚�) and the gall (èƒ†). This means that before the liver gets ill, the gall may show the first sign of illness. So, in order to treat the illness in the gall, you have to take care of the root cause the liver too. </p>
              <p>5) <strong>Kidney (è‚¾)-</strong> The element of the liver is WATER (æ°´), thefore the representative colour is BLACK. The purpose of the kidney is for storage of energy, filteration of fluid and bone function. The inducing resusciation or "open and close" (å¼€çª�) organ is thru the bladder. Therefore patients with kidney problem can be seen with a urinal problem etc. The representative taste of the kidney is salty. The link between the è„� and the è…‘ is the kidney (è‚¾) and the bladder (è†€èƒ±). This means that before the kidney gets ill, the bladder/urine may show the first sign of illness. So, in order to treat the illness in the bladder, you have to take care of the root cause the kidney too.</p>

              <p>The 6 hollow organs (å…­è…‘) are as follows:</p>
              <p>1) Small intestine (å°�è‚ ) - The function of the small intestine is to extract nuitrents to the various part of the body.</p>
              <p>2) Large intestine (å¤§è‚ ) - The function of the large intestine is to absorb water and to get rid of the waste matter by passing it as "motions"</p>
              <p>3) Stomach (èƒƒ)- The function of the stomach is to collect the food for processing before passing it to the small intestine</p>
              <p>4) Gall (èƒ†) - The function of the gall is to excreate gall juice for the purpose of food processing.</p>
              <p>5) Bladder (è†€èƒ±) - The function of the bladder is to collect the urine and to get rid of the urine.</p>
              <p>6) The Triple Burners (ä¸‰ç„¦) - the Triple burners deserves an explaination becasue the triple burners is not an organ,  but for the division of of the human body part that the organs sits in. The Triple Burners can be divided into 3 parts, the Upper Burner (ä¸Šç„¦), The Middle Burner (ä¸­ç„¦)  and the Lower Burner (ä¸‹ç„¦) where the various organs sit. </p>

              <p><br>There has been an increased interest in natural and organic herbal supplements in the west and over here too. However, most are sold in the form of MLM here. Anyway, it is good that you have found yourself something that is suitable for you.</p>

              <p>This may not be totally true, otherwise the HSA would not have banned certain of the herbs. However the TCM may have adopt the ä»¥æ¯’æ”»æ¯’ form of treatment which is a practice since ancient time. Further more, TCM does not use only one extract in it concotion as there are bound to have other form of herbs to neutralise each other.</p>

              <p>ç»�ç»œå­¦ refers to the study of the human meridian physiological functions, pathological changes and the relationship between theory and viscera. ç»�è„‰ is meridian and ç»œè„‰ is the accupoint as a whole. Although meridian and accupoint are two different entities, they are interconnected to form the criss-cross network for the purpose of communication between the organs, bones, veins and etc.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">å��äºŒç»�ç»œ - The Twelve Meridians</span></p>
              <p><span class="etext">The twelve meridians are named according to their corresponding organs, limb positions and  yin and yang properties. They include three arm yin meridians (lung, pericardium, heart), three arm yang meridians (large intestine, triple burner, small intestine), three leg yang meridians (stomach, gall bladder, bladder), and three leg yin meridians (spleen, liver, kidney). The triple burner and the pericardium do not refer to anatomical structures. They are functional units in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It should also be noted, the organs mentioned here have a much broader meaning in TCM then what is typically thought of their functions in western medicine. Since the twelve meridians make up the majority of the Meridian System, they are known as the regular or principal channels.</span> </p>

              <p>The twelve meridians follow specific time schedules and pathways. The<em> Huang Di Nei Jing (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine)</em> says, " The three yins of the arm go from the organs to the hands. The three yangs of the arm go from the hands to the head. The three yangs of the legs go from the head to the feet. The three yins of the legs go from the feet to the abdomen." Qi is continuously circulating through the meridians in a daily cycle. At certain times, both qi and blood have maximum flow in particular meridians which are outlined below</p>
              <p><img src="http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/3658/picdz.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span class="etext">As shown in the above chart, qi is more prevalent in different meridians at different times. For example, from 3am to 5am, meridian qi mainly flows through the Lung Meridian and enters the Large Intestine Meridian at 5am-7am, and then the Stomach Meridian from 7am-9am. In this way, the meridian cycle is continuous as the qi flows through the body. </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ç»�ç»œçš„ä½œç”¨- Application of the Meridians</strong></span></p>
              <p>Sickness is spread thru the Meridian and the transformation of the sickness is thru this media as well. Sickness in the internal organs is all thru the meridian.</p>
              <p>Application of diagnosis and treatment can also be administer to the meridians using accupunture and moxibustion.</p>
