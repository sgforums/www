              <p>As part of my learning in ç´«å¾®æ–—æ•° (Zi Wei Dou Shu) or the Purple Star Astrology, we have to go thru a short course in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Basic taught in Chinese. Therefore I wishes to share with you the little TCM knowledge I have learn during the course by translating it into English. This may be pretty dry as it can become very theorical but I will try to make it livelier by adding some stories as I go along.</p>
              <p>For all who knows, in ç´«å¾®æ–—æ•° (Zi Wei Dou Shu) chart, there is one palace known as the ç–¾åŽ„å®« (Ji Er Gong) or the Health Palace. However there are 2 elements in this Palace, namely ç–¾ (Ji) as in ç–¾ç—… (Illiness) and åŽ„ (Er) as in åŽ„è¿� (Misfortune). Thus the reason for the short TCM course. I will not dwell in the ç´«å¾®æ–—æ•° (Zi Wei Dou Shu) or the Purple Star Astrology here but only the TCM element.</p>

              <p>There can be many form of medicine around but the 2 most orthodox school of medicine would be Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Both school has it strength and weakness.</p>
              <p>For example, the strength of the Western Medicine lies in the "external school". Today, the Western Medicine is famous for its surgery and its "fast pace" medication to treatment with modern technologies, equipment and pharmical plant. Mediciation is in the form of pills, tablets and ready to drink liquid medicine without the need for the patient to process them before consumption. However it is often said that western medicine does not cure the source of the problem. æ²»é•–ä¸�æ²»æœ¬(zhi biao bu zhi ben).</p>
              <p>There are 2 things in the TCM that baffered even the western medicine scientists. One is the Qi ç²¾æ°”å­¦(Life) and the other is the Xue ç»�ç»œå­¦(acupoint). Today western medicine are studying in-depth into the secret of Xue and Acupunture. However TCM are often shunned by others because of the hassel of preparing the medicine and the "slowness" of the cure. But many failed to understand the concept of TCM being "going into the root cause". ç—…ä»Žæ½œä¸­åŒ»(Bing chong chien zhong yi)</p>

              <p>Ok, here's the 1st story before I go to bed.</p>
              <p>Once, there was an emperor in China who invited a TCM physician to help him to cure his sickness. This physician was well know for his skill in TCM and his ability to cure even the dying èµ·æ­»å›žç”Ÿ(Qi si hui sheng). After curing the emperor, the emperor asked the physician who taught him the skill in TCM. The physician replied that it was his father who taught him the skill.</p>
              <p>Then the emperor asked if he was the only one taught by his father, he replied that his father taught him and his 2 elder brothers the skill. The emperor than asked why he was so famous while his brothers were virtually unknown and whether his father taught him the secret but not to his brothers.</p>
              <p>To which he replied that the father taught them the same thing and that the best among them was his elder brother followed by his second brother. He was the worst among them. The emperor was puzzled and asked why his brothers were unknown if they were indeed better than him.</p>
              <p>He told the emperor that his elder brother could diagnose the illness before it arise by just feeling the pulse therefore was able to prevent the illness from arising by medication. So no one fall sick under his care.</p>
              <p>His second brother able to cure the illness with medication when the it arises thus he too was able to cure all his patients under his care. Only those who had not met his brothers and had his illness full blown and almost dying that comes to him for treatment. Thus he was famous because of that.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: Prevention is better than cure.</p>

              <p>Thanks! This is interesting reading~ I met a friend recently who shared with me her experience:</p>
              <p>She was suffering from chronic backpain and went to the doctor who gave her all the MRI or Xray and the conclusion was she had a slip disc at her lower back. Despite the injections and pain killers and all, she still had a very severe pain but they didn't take her seriously - claiming that it was depression and even making comments like "you don't LOOK like you are in that much pain"</p>
              <p>Eventually when they discharged her, she went to a TCM physician. The TCM physician checked her and told her she had another slip disc near her brain stem and it is extremely serious and in the end, actually called the ambulance for her to send her straight to the hospital. Then THIS TIME they did another xray or something for her upper back - then they found the 2nd slip disc...</p>
              <p>so scary leh...</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A little history about TCM</span></strong></p>
              <p>TCM may have started before man was able to write. However on record, two well-known legends at the time were those of the Yellow Emperor whose name was Huang Di, and the Fire Emperor who was bestowed the title Shennong . Shennong has numerous meanings in Chinese such as "divine farmer", the "heavenly husbandman", and a more modern interpretation as a distinguished doctor. It is unclear whether these emperors actually existed but some historians date their existence back to 2500 to 2700BC.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.vitamin-resource.com/chinese/images/shen-nong-177x300.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Both of these important figures are the attributed author's of two well-known books that have contributed significantly to Traditional Chinese Medicine. These are the <em>Huang Di Nei Jing(The Yellow Emperor's Medicine Classic)</em> and the <em>Shennong Bencaojing (Classic of Herbal Medicine)</em>. In actuality these books were written much later in history. It was common in ancient time's for the Chinese authors to assign authorship of books to the great teachers or important persons who influenced them.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Basic Principle of Yin Yang Theory and the Five Elements Theory in TCM</span></strong></p>
              <p>The basic principle of TCM lies with é˜´é˜³ Yin Yang Theory and the äº”è¡Œ Five Elements Theory. These theories form the core teaching of the Tao. The internal organs of the human should be considered as a whole and not an individual entities. Even as a whole, it can be divided into Yin and Yang. The Yin and Yang in the body balance and counter-balance each other to be in harmony. Thus that person can become healthy.</p>
              <p><img src="http://z.about.com/d/taoism/1/0/0/-/-/-/yinYang.gif" alt="" width="466" height="466"></p>
              <p>The human internal organs can be classified in è„� organs and è…‘ "hollow organs" each with a Yin or Yang class forming a matter call æ°”  Qi and è¡€ Blood. &lt;é˜´é˜³æ¶ˆé•¿ã€‰ï¼Œ&lt;è¡€æ°”ç”ŸåŒ–&gt; When the Yin Yang are in harmony, the Qi and the Blood  balance thus that person will be healthy. &lt;é˜´é˜³å¤±è°ƒï¼Œæ°”è¡€ä¸�å’Œï¼Œç™¾ç—…ä¹ƒå�˜åŒ–è€Œç”Ÿ&gt; However when the Yin Yang are inbalance, the Qi and Blood are not in harmony, illlness will grow.</p>
