Exercise have to be fun or I really won't be moltivated. The reason why I like blading is because it is fun and I don't do it competitively. Then again, I need company I enjoy with to be with me before I'm willing to exercise if not I'll feel really stupid and bored doing something and loose all interest and rather go home to nua in bed or in front of the pc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
