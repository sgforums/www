              <p>I quote the article:</p>
              <p><em>At one point, Ms Ong mumbled something about changing Syariah law,
              but when asked to clarify by a reporter, she took it back and said:</em></p>
              <p><em> 'What I want to say is that we are working for all women, whether you are Muslim, Buddhist, Christian...'</em></p>
              <p>My diagnosis? A Freudian slip, followed by a sudden realization that she shouldn't have said that out loud.</p>
              <p>Never mind about the subsequent damage control.... The very fact that they could even think about it is really, really, disturbing....</p>
