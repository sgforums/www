We went to Cairns for our honeymoon and one of the activities we did was to join a fishing/crabbing tour.  We ended up bringing home 2 large mudcrabs but unfortunately due to limited size of pot/pan and ingredients we had at the apartment we were staying, it didn't turn out as good as we expected it to be.   But it was fun doing the fishing/crabbing.  We spotted a few crocodiles too.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

We ordered 2 ice chocolate but they mistakenly gave us 2 ice coffee.  We ended up having both ice chocolate and ice coffee for only the price of the ice chocolate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On the other hand, I also had some bad experience in a dumpling restaurant in Glen Waverley (Victoria).  We ordered a chicken dumpling which was supposed to have 10 serves on the plate.  When it came, we didn't count it but only after my hubby and I had one each we realised we only had 6 left on the plate.  So we told the waitress about it.  They told us they gave us the seafood dumpling instead of the chicken and they asked (in English) if we wanted to have another 2 dumplings.  We said yes (since they offered).<br><br>As soon as they turned away, the waitress had a discussion (in Chinese which I could understand) with her colleagues and they decided not to give us the 2 dumplings but they never came to tell us about it.  My hubby and I finished our food and we just waited for the 2 dumplings they promised to give us (though I already knew they were not planning to give us after hearing their conversation, I just wanted to see how long it took them to come and tell us).  Anyway, after 15 min of waiting, we decided to leave and we went to the counter to ask for our bill as well as questioning about the 2 dumplings we were promised (just a matter of principle).  We really didn't mind if they didn't give us the 2 dumplings but they should come and tell us about that instead of just let us wait.<br><br>Ok, this is what pissed me off.  When we asked the person behind the counter about the 2 dumplings, instead of apologising, she started accusing us for cheating (indirectly anyway).  She said: "How do I know how many dumplings you guys had eaten??"  I tell you, I have never feel so insulted in my life before.  The dumplings are not very expensive, only $6.50 so why do you think we want to cheat???!!!  I was really furious so I just gave her a piece of my mind, paid the bill and told her that I would never set foot at that restaurant again.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

What I hate about when going to some department stores in Singapore, instead of asking you if they can help you, they just keep on following you everywhere you go.  Pretty annoying.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  That's one thing I like about here in Oz, they will only ask you when you enter the store and when you say you're just browsing, they will leave you alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
