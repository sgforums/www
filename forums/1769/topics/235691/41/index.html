Best to make the shell the night before and let it cool in the oven overnight.  Put that in the fridge in the morning and just fill it with whipped cream before you want to serve.<br><br>We were whipping the cream with the beater (one that you just let it do the work type) last night, before everyone turned up.  My hubby and I were preparing something else at that time and forgot to check the cream and it ended up turning into butter.  So my hubby had to go out and get another bottle of thickened cream.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>So if you do make one, please do not make the same mistake.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   Also, you need to separate the egg white properly.  Any egg yolk in it will not work.  When I was making the pav on Friday night, I had to make it twice.  There had to be some yolk in the mixture and it didn't work so I had to throw it out and make another one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

It has been claimed that the dam would increase siltation and would eventually render the flood-control capability of the dam moot. Heck, it has been claimed that it would clog up the upstream river port of Chongqing.<br><br>There are many other controversial issues regarding the dam - the forced resettlement of the people living along the river, the cost of the dam, security issues, environmental concerns, loss of historical sites... you name it.</div>
