I respect him for daring to chase his dreams and walk the unconventional path others don't dare tread. Maybe the worlds best musician we will never know is the small-time pianist who is an insurance agent by day and plays in some small pub in clarke quay by night, because so many years ago he decided to do what everyone else was doing and go back home to serve NS.<br><br>Melvyn Tan did something I respect immensely. He broke out of the traditional Singapore mould of "don't be stupid, u can't make a living out of/become world famous in sports/music/culture/arts" He is my hero, not because he is a musician, but because he did what I only wish more people have the guts to do. He showed those of us who wish to pursue our dreams that there IS hope that just because u have the ill fortune of being born in singapore, it doesn't mean you have to kill your dreams, that u're doomed to a life of nothingness, of unfulfillment. He showed us that it is still possible to dream, to pursue your dream, and to make it ultimately, even tho being born a singaporean is a handicap like having both your hands tied behind your back in a prizefight.<br><br>Above all, he wanted to return to singapore, because although he has been a brith citizen for so many years, he still feels indebted to a homeland which has done nothing but offer obstacles to his dreams since day one, to help nuture the arts and culture society in singapore, knowing full well that, however small a chance, he might still end up in jail. But he didn't say, "no i'll just be smart and not go home at all" he took that chance. Greater still, he took that chance that singaporeans were willing to be helped in the way he offers. And in reutrn, what do we do? We show him hostility. we show him how petty we are that he didn't get "punished enough". We show him how small minded we are. That is absolutely horrible, and uncultured. Its not like the courts didn't make a judgement. A man of the arts, almost 50. What do u want? Send him to jail? send him to DB? make him serve NS? Even if many of u have served, why can't u be gracious? Not everyone has to conform to your norm, not everyone has to live life the way u live it. Baying for his blood, hurling insults at a man like him for doing what he did, as tho he was the most horrible of serial-rapist-killers, THATs what is nekulturny.</div>

If not we will be speaking bahasa malayu everywhere and pay bribe money, and worse naled ear squats in prison.<br><br>The real meaning of NS must never be lost.  The $3000 fine has indicated the gov has lost the reason why they have NS the first place.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AF2005:</div><div class="quote_body">[quote]Originally posted by HENG@:<br>[b]<br>Melvyn Tan did something I respect immensely. He broke out of the traditional Singapore mould of "don't be stupid, u can't make a living out of/become world famous in sports/music/culture/arts" He is my hero, not because he is a musician, but because he did what I only wish more people have the guts to do. He showed those of us who wish to pursue our dreams that there IS hope that just because u have the ill fortune of being born in singapore, it doesn't mean you have to kill your dreams, that u're doomed to a life of nothingness, of unfulfillment. He showed us that it is still possible to dream, to pursue your dream, and to make it ultimately, even tho being born a singaporean is a handicap like having both your hands tied behind your back in a prizefight.<br>quote]<br><br>he come back for what.  who invited him back and negotaite deal with him to come back and fine $3000.  Even 60 yrs old also can go prison.  What he did is a national crime? NS is vital to defence and security of us.  If not we will be speaking bahasa malayu everywhere and pay bribe money, and worse naled ear squats in prison.<br><br>The real meaning of NS must never be lost.  The $3000 fine has indicated the gov has lost the reason why they have NS the first place.  CAn the panist fingers defend us against militants and enemies.<br><br>NSmen full tme and reservists all races everyday are providing security and defence and rescue and support and saving lives and protecting citizens alongside regulars.  SAF, police scdf.  worse some lost their lives in the line of duty.<br><br>Now this panist guy can claim he still belongs here with fine and his panist skill can defend singapore against terrorists and enemies.<br><br>Being born a singaporean is never a handicapped. It is a privilege.   Just look at our neighbouring countries.  With our asian color, how many have the chance to be born in western country with dole and benefits.  This dream is in many asians born in asian.<br><br>I can clearly say, the gov has lost its meaning of national service and now offenders status and value to country image outweighs the crime commited.<br><br>Rich Parents now can say, $3000 fine is nothing, they will all take the same route.   MM LKY believes in integrity, honesty and deliverance in building this nation is meaningless in today's gov of handling affairs.<br><br>The meaning of Serving NS has now become equivalent to malaysia 3 mnths NS, because the gov treat NS defaulters as tidak apa, small matter.<br><br>Want to hunt and fight terrorists and militants using who, Now pay $3000 and get off NS?   who will be left?<br><br></div></blockquote>so i guess what u and many others here feel is that only military defence is important. nevermind the arts and the cultures, even tho those are the most basic things that defines us as HUMANS. ok then.<br><br>being born a singaporean is no handicap? Bull Sh|t. its everybit a handicap if u are an individual. U're deluded in thinking u're privileged. U're in essence no more than a resource for the ruling class, important resource, but disposable. A cash cow, and maybe not even. If u're a singaporean, try for a career in sports, especially sports frowned on by the govt like motorsports. or try to make a career in the arts, be a painter or a classical musician or any number of careers the govt don't deem to be  "profitable" to them. See how far u get. Then u come and tell me being born singaporean is a "privilege"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I, more than anyone else here probably, have more reasons to dislike Melvyn Tan for getting away with it lightly. Much more reasons than any one individual should have. Yet I do not begrudge him. Why? I dunno. Maybe the question many of u should really be asking deep down is WHY so many of u "kan bu kai".<br><br>Last I recall, nobody is saying all guys should not serve NS. Nobody said he did not break a law. He broke a law, he got punished by the law, all this is fact. We're saying in his case, it is quite understandable, even if its not right, but these sort of grey area topics can never be fully clear cut can it? In any case, he's gotten enough stick from the public. So why not let it go, let it rest?<br><br>The question should be, why so many of u "kan bu kai?"</div>
