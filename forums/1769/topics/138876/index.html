But until now the taste for sweet things has remained elusive.<br><br>Chemical clue<br><br>Being able to identify sweet things probably played a crucial role in our evolution. It enabled our ancestors to distinguish between bitter food sources, such as deadly plants, and sugary food, which is rich in energy.<br><br>There is now considerable commercial interest in developing new sweeteners, and scientists have been searching for the mechanisms underlying sweet taste.<br><br>Two teams of researchers in the United States may have succeeded. They think they have tracked down a gene which functions as a sweet taste receptor.<br><br>The work was based on studies of two strains of lab mice. One strain liked drinking water laced with sugar or saccharin while the other preferred plain water.<br><br>Genetic database<br><br>After locating a gene in mice that seems to give the rodents a sweet tooth, the scientists then searched a database for similar genetic sequences in humans.<br><br><strong>It appears that a tiny change to a gene determines whether mice, and possibly people, have a preference for sweet things. </strong><br><br>"It seems fitting that the presence or absence of a sugar chain on a sweet taste receptor should determine sensitivity and preference for sweetness in life," Robert Margolskee and colleagues write in the journal Nature Genetics.<br><br>"Such information would be particularly useful for the identification of novel sweeteners of intense potency," they add.<br><br>A similar study, carried out by a team at Harvard Medical School, Boston, US, is reported in the journal Nature Neuroscience.<br></span></span></div>

Men, on the other hand, indulge their stomachs more often when they are happy. </strong><br><br>The complete findings are published in the March issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders.<br><br>Food craving is defined as a strong urge to eat a certain food or type of food. It has been mainly studied in women and in clinical settings where it has been shown to be common in obese or overweight individuals and in people with eating disorders, explained lead author Lionel Lafay of INSERM in Villejuif, France.<br><br>``We aimed at studying this phenomenon in a (community-based) normal-weight population. This investigation is part of general research on weight preoccupations,'' Lafay told Reuters Health.<br><br>In the study, the investigators gathered information about the food cravings and eating habits of 538 women and 506 men. The study participants kept diaries of eating habits and filled out questionnaires that also assessed their emotional and physical characteristics.<br><br>``Subjects were considered to be cravers if they experienced a strong urge to eat specific foods at least once a week during the 6 months (prior to being surveyed).'' They were specifically ''asked about their mood and hunger at the times they indulged in their cravings,'' the authors explain.<br><br><strong>``We observed twice as much food craving in women (28%) than in men (13%),''</strong> Lafay told Reuters Health. ``Though food craving episodes were not associated with weight status, they were strongly related to weight concern,'' he added.<br><br><strong>``Subjects, particularly women, who craved were more frequently on diets or reported restricting their diet, had unstable weight, felt more frequently too heavy and wanted more frequently to lose weight,'' he said. </strong><br><br>Lafay noted that ``another interesting finding was that mood was related to food cravings but in a different way according to gender. A majority of female cravers experienced a more (depressed) mood state during the day, and a negative mood--such as annoyance, boredom, and depression--preceded the craving episodes. In contrast, men more commonly indulged in food craving in association with a feeling of happiness.''<br><br>What biological factors may be at play to cause women to crave food more than men do?<br><br>``The gender difference observed could be due to a higher degree of weight concern in women. Social pressure for thinness--more pronounced in women--may (cause them to) more frequently restrict their diet and to follow a diet to lose weight. As these practices are associated with food cravings, they could be one explanation,'' Lafay said.<br><br>Another possible explanation could be that women experience a different relationship between food and mood. However, the relationships between food and mood are very complex, as is their underlying biological and psychological determination, Lafay noted.<br><br>For example, Lafay said, food craving does not appear to be a simple product of the need for calories and energy.<br><br><strong>The simple act of depriving oneself of food can explain for food craving in some cases, but ``in our study, food craving was related to a 'desire' and not to a 'need' for a majority of subjects, which confirms the important rule of psychological factors,'' Lafay pointed out.<br><br>``Furthermore, subjects who reported being hungry craved more frequently for salted foods whereas others subjects reported craving for sweet foods,'' he said. </strong><br><br>SOURCE: International Journal of Eating Disorders 2001;29:195-204.<br>Article from :<a href="http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/sweet_or_salty.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://preventdisease.com/news/articles/sweet_or_salty.shtml</a><br></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And this, from a Dr Art Mollen :<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #473C8B;"><br>Why Do We Crave Sweet Or Salty Foods?<br><br>So, you've had a sweet tooth or can't get enough salt. Well, the chances are you get plenty of salt, sugar and fat in your diet. But why do you crave it so much?<br><br>A recent report in Arthritis Today suggests that you're craving chips, pretzels, and olives or ice cream simply because your body is used to it. Salt is an acquired taste, so simply try to wean yourself off by gradually cutting back. And if you're bloated, salt makes you drink more water to flush the excess from your cells. So, instead of eating chips, unsalted popcorn might be a better choice. And if you're craving fat in cookies, french fries, pizza, and ice cream, you've either been yo-yo dieting or you are feeling sad or stressed. So, get to the root of your emotions before reaching for that slice of pizza. <strong>If it's sugar that you're craving like candy, soda or anything sweet, then you're blood sugar level could be low.</strong> Eat little meals throughout the day and don't skip meals. Also don't eat too many artificial sweeteners, which may raise insulin levels creating sweet cravings. More than likely you're feeling stressed, so start eating apples and oranges. At the end of the day, you can outsmart your cravings by being prepared with low calorie snacks and drinking plenty of water.<br><br></span></span></div>
