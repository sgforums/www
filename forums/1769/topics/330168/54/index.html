              <p>I had a carp once that grew to be large and fat although when I got him, he was just a small fry.  One day, I came home from school to notice that he had reddish wounds on his sides.  Didn't know why until when I did my homework in front of the tank, I saw him suddenly go berserk and just make some kinda mad dash in the tank, slamming himself against the walls of the tank like that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>I think that might be what your Gulper had been doing.  I think maybe the tank is a tad too small for them and they are ambitious fish who need more stimulation in their environment or something... and they went postal, thus sustaining internal injuries. </p>
              <p>I think you need to consult a Fish Psychiatrist.</p>

              <p>I had a carp once that grew to be large and fat although when I got him, he was just a small fry.  One day, I came home from school to notice that he had reddish wounds on his sides.  Didn't know why until when I did my homework in front of the tank, I saw him suddenly go berserk and just make some kinda mad dash in the tank, slamming himself against the walls of the tank like that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>I think that might be what your Gulper had been doing.  I think maybe the tank is a tad too small for them and they are ambitious fish who need more stimulation in their environment or something... and they went postal, thus sustaining internal injuries. </p>
              <p>I think you need to consult a Fish Psychiatrist.</p>
