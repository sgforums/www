              <p>One thing I hate about PRC is that they take the local area as their own. Somemore they have the sheer amout to out-number sinkies 3-1. You should see how the CC basketball operates now. Ah tiong one side, sinkies the other. Best part... they are sore losers...</p>

              <p>That reminds me of a conversation I heard on the bus the other week. That was exactly what was said by the guy sitting behind me to his female colleague. He claimed the mayors are popularly elected, and even though the lady pointed out that it gets abused to pieces by bribery and corruption, he still called it "beautiful" because "the system is in place". It sounds like utter tripe even before I try to verify it.</p>
