              <p>does ur friend have a habit of using... left feet on the brake and right foot on the accelerator for auto car? I heard tt some people have this habit, (normally we rotate thr right foot either/or accelerator and brake) but its quite dangerous cos... when we respond in times of urgency.. most of the time we use our master foot.. and WHAM it goes to the location it most often 'sits'</p>
              <p>Thank goodness you are buckled up.. hope you are alright.. sometimes the whiplash can be paaaainful</p>

              <p>aiyooo.. sigh.. are u and ur friends the 'young and restless' group? pulling the handbrake when he press the accelerator.. wouldnt that just make you skid? I thought that's what people do when they wanna leave tyre marks on the road :O</p>
              <p>Have you seen the doctor yet??</p>

              <p><br>The car actually wasn't going that fast. A pull on the handbrake by then will reduce the damage a little. It wouldn't have stopped the accident from happening anyway.</p>
              <p>But I was alarmed when the rpm kept going up.</p>
              <p>And no.....I don't drive like that! It wastes fuel and kills the brake-pads. I don't usually allow my engine rpm to go above 2.5k for gears 1-4.</p>
              <p>I was hoping I won't have anything on my hands that night when I stepped into that car and tmd it really happened.</p>
