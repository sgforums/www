              <p><em>A 42-year-old martial arts instructor is charged with raping his 13-year-old student. (AFP File Photo)</em></p>
              <p>He was 42 and she, only 13. Yet, they declared themselves “<em>lao gong</em>” and “<em>lao po</em>” (Chinese for husband and wife).</p>
              <p>The martial arts instructor, who is a father of two, and his student alleged had a sexual relationship when she was 13.</p>
              <p>They even went to a temple and “solemnised” their “marriage”, said the prosecution in their opening statement<em>.</em></p>
              <p>The man is standing trial for three charges of statutory rape and four charges of sexual exploitation, reported <em>The New Paper.</em></p>
              <p>He is unable to be named as the identity of the girl, who is now a Secondary Five student, has to be protected.</p>
              <p>The court understood that they met when she joined her school’s 
              martial arts club in 2007, when she was in Secondary One. He was then 
              the instructor of the club.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Chua Ying-Hong told the court that the girl 
              and some of her team mates visited his house on February 20, 2007, the 
              third day of the Chinese New Year.</p>
              <p>They left a few hours later and headed to a nearby shopping centre, 
              where the girl realised that her appointment had been cancelled and she 
              contacted the man to tell him.</p>
              <p>He then offered to keep her company and drove to pick her up in a car
               and went for a drive. Along the way, they stopped for a smoke and had a
               chat before having dinner back in his flat.</p>
              <p>Later at night, he text message the girl to ask her to be his girlfriend, and she agreed.</p>
              <p>In March 2007, the couple drove to Turnhouse Road, near Changi, and proceeded to have sex in his car.</p>
              <p>The court was also told that in the following month, they had sex in his car on two separate occasions.</p>
              <p>on May 4, 2007, four months after they got to know each other, the 
              man took the girl to a temple in Yishun where they prayed and 
              “solemnised” their “marriage” to each other.</p>
              <p>By that time, the relationship had caught the attention of the 
              school’s principal after she received a call from a relative of one of 
              the man’s students stating that the instructor and the girl were having 
              an “unhealthy relationship” which was “more than that of a master and 
              disciple”.</p>
              <p>The principal then asked the teacher-in-charge of the club and the 
              school’s discipline mistress to investigate further. However their 
              efforts were in vain as the students did not reveal anything out of the 
              ordinary.</p>
              <p>While all this was going on, rumours were spreading in school about the couple’s relationship.</p>
              <p>The teacher-in-charge testified that the man had called her to 
              clarify that nothing was going on between him and the girl. She also 
              said that the man’s wife had contacted her to ask if there was anything 
              going on.</p>
              <p>“She said, ‘I’m begging you, please tell me because this has happened before.”</p>
              <p>“I told her the truth at that time, there was no evidence to suggest anything,” the teacher-in-charge said.</p>
              <p>However, in May, a student approached the teacher to tell her that the instructor was “going steady” with the girl.</p>
              <p>Another trainee also revealed to the teacher that the man had once 
              instructed her to lie to his wife that there was a training session on a
               particular day, reported <em>TNP.</em></p>
              <p>At the same time, the caller who tipped off the principal contacted 
              her again to say that the man and the girl were having a relationship.</p>
              <p>The discipline mistress testified in court that when she confronted 
              the girl about the issue on May 10, 2007, she appeared to be “quite 
              evasive”.</p>
              <p>Sensing that the girl was lying, she then asked for her mobile phone 
              and checked her text inbox where she found “intimate messages” sent from
               a “lao gong’, whose number matched that of the instructor.</p>
              <p>The discipline mistress also found a photograph of the couple, together with a long romantic poem.</p>
              <p>The girl even mentioned on her blog that she liked the instructor.</p>
              <p>The discipline mistress also discovered that the girl had been to the man’s house on several occasions for dinner.</p>
              <p>She said, “(The man) would drive the students home after dinner.</p>
              <p>“The second last person to be dropped off would usually be (a male trainee) and the last person would normally be the girl.”</p>
              <p>After all this was revealed, the man was summoned to the principal’s office and notified that his services would be terminated.</p>
              <p>He was also asked to cease all contact with the girl and the other students.</p>
              <p>The girl was sent for counselling, where she revealed her sexual 
              relationship with the man, which included holding hands, kissing and 
              sex.</p>
              <p>“She mentioned that they always had sex in his car,” the counsellor told the court.</p>
              <p>The man’s wife also confronted the girl after she had found out about their affair.</p>
              <p>The girl’s mother lodged a police report after being informed of the situation. The man was then arrested on May 16.</p>
              <p>“She was very uncomfortable (while speaking to the police)… There 
              were many things they (the police) asked her, and she did not understand
               many of the terms,” said the counsellor, who was asked by the girl to 
              accompany her to the police station to make the report, and again when 
              her statement was taken.</p>
              <p>In the defence’s opening statement, Mr Martin Decruz argued that they
               did not have sex against the girl’s will, and that the girl had 
              suffered no trauma.</p>
              <p>He added that he had evidence to prove that the man had alibis on Feb
               28, 2007, one of the days he was accused to have committed indecent 
              acts with the girl, wrote <em>TNP. </em>The man is now out on bail.</p>
              <p>If convicted of statutory rape, he can be jailed for up to 20 years 
              and caned. If conducted of sexual exploitation, he can be jailed two 
              years and fined S$5,000.</p>
