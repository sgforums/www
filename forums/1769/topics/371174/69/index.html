              <p>Yeah, well, I explained the situation nicely, saying that after the initial meeting was called off, I dived back into my work and couldn't really stay in front of my laptop..... which was true, since I decided to go to the workshop to do some stuff.....</p>
              <p>I also offered to meet the prof in his office at any time of his choosing today or tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Thing is, this is the prof in charge of the module that I'm helping to tutor, and the meeting was about tutoring responsibilities..... hope he's got the sense to not shoot my prof a bad email or something....</p>

              <p>I actually missed a couple of meetings due to similar circumstances recently. I was on MC for 2 days and the prick calling for the meeting just assumed and no reply meant ok. I came back to work to find that I missed them and a nasty email asking me why. If that idiot had bothered even calling my office someone would have told him I was sick. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Basket, I already knew of the meeting one week beforehand, and yesterday I made sure to keep my schedule from 3.30 to 5 clear..... and as the other tutors would attest, I <em>did</em> show up at the correct venue and at the correct time....</p>
              <p>I can't stick in front of my laptop all the time leh..... when the meeting was called off, I figured that the best thing I could do was to make full use of the time freed up....</p>
