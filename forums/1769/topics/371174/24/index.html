              <p>I have a touch of sore throat too which I think it's caused by the dry air in the plane</p>

              <p>Well nothing really happening.</p>
              <p>It was totally rushed in Sydney</p>
              <p>When I arrived in Sydney, went to the hotel, put my stuff</p>
              <p>Headed to Sydney Aquarium, then hopped over to the Wildlife Centre besides it<br>Meet up with Chris's friend for dinner. Had Korean food (LOL) It was really good though. They had Ox Tongue and intestines but I didn't eat that because the both of them didn't eat them :( (damn!!! I need to eat that in September)</p>
              <p>After dinner we walked down to the Opera House so that I can say I've been there. HAHA</p>
              <p>Next day, Nak brought us to Blue Mountains (Sunday). really beautiful place. Almost dislocated my shoulder while walking down the Great Stairway as me being accident prone didn't realize a step had corroded away and missed a step and I grabbed onto the handrail but the force was great and hurt my arm :( Dinner was at this place called Big John's. Chef cooked for George Bush Jr before. Chris had ribs which was the good choice. Ribs were good. I had steak. The teak was an inch thick. Very juicy and tender but they overdid it for me :( I find it hard to eat steak that is medium well :( Didn't finish it. I ordered Medium rare. Maybe they figured I was Asian and don't eat my steak bloody. Next time I'll order it Bleu!!!!! </p>
              <p>Monday - woke up with a super painful arm (couldn't even move it till Chris put a hot pack on it) Went aquarium viewing and then it was off to the airport.  Oh ya we had Yam Cha for lunch. LOL</p>

              <p>Well nothing really happening.</p>
              <p>It was totally rushed in Sydney</p>
              <p>When I arrived in Sydney, went to the hotel, put my stuff</p>
              <p>Headed to Sydney Aquarium, then hopped over to the Wildlife
              Centre besides it<br> Meet up with Chris's friend for dinner. Had Korean food (LOL) It
              was really good though. They had Ox Tongue and intestines but I
              didn't eat that because the both of them didn't eat them :(
              (damn!!! I need to eat that in September)</p>
              <p>After dinner we walked down to the Opera House so that I can say
              I've been there. HAHA</p>
              <p>Next day, Nak brought us to Blue Mountains (Sunday). really
              beautiful place. Almost dislocated my shoulder while walking down
              the Great Stairway as me being accident prone didn't realize a
              step had corroded away and missed a step and I grabbed onto
              the handrail but the force was great and hurt my arm :( Dinner
              was at this place called Big John's. Chef cooked for George
              Bush Jr before. Chris had ribs which was the good choice.
              Ribs were good. I had steak. The teak was an inch thick. Very
              juicy and tender but they overdid it for me :( I find it hard to
              eat steak that is medium well :( Didn't finish it. I ordered Medium
              rare. Maybe they figured I was Asian and don't eat my
              steak bloody. Next time I'll order it Bleu!!!!! </p>
              <p>Monday - woke up with a super painful arm (couldn't even move it
              till Chris put a hot pack on it) Went aquarium viewing
              and then it was off to the airport.  Oh ya we had Yam Cha for
              lunch. LOL</p>
