              <p>Talk about drunkards...yesterday I was out at Clarke Quay, and took NR6 home.</p>
              <p>I got the worst driver I had in my entire life and it would have been a joke if it hadn't been funny.</p>
              <p>On the 3 lane roads, he took up the left 2 lanes for himself, straddling the dotted line all the time. Presumbly bcos he sucked at driving a bus from what I observed and was trying hard to avoid hitting the kerb.</p>
              <p>He couldn't keep in any lane for more than 5 seconds. And his steering was governed by sharp wrist-action, which saw the bus going from 3rd to 1st lane in 0.5 seconds. And this occured too often for comfort...bascially he couldn't steer straight.</p>
              <p>I say he sucked at driving because, when it was time to stop at junctions, if there's a car next to him if he stopped, he would stop a distance behind, and...proceed to crawl into the space while steering left right left right....wtf! Approaching bus-bays was the same thing!</p>
              <p>And to make matters worse, he was definitely gonna fall asleep....at a junction, he stopped at a red-light. After 5 seconds, he inexplicably attempted to move off while the light was still red. Fortunately he woke up in time before something happened and did an e brake.</p>
              <p>And nearing my stop....I pressed the bell, and fully expecting him to pass my stop despite that, I stood up, made as much movement in the background, walking up and down the aisle, and wtf, he really almost missed my stop. I had my finger on the bus-stopping button because I knew this would happen and he did a e brake and I almost became a casualty.</p>
              <p>Ok, end of post-sleeping rant.</p>
