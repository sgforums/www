              <p>i don't know wtf is wrong with the bosses.. i am willing to bet that the No.1 would rather receive an email asking "can we hold the meeting here?" and reply with a simple "Yes" or "No" and then we go do the rest of the work than put everything down in the fricken email when we've not even begun to prepare, much less confirm, the details yet...</p>
