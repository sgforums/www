I did try to be positive and tell myself that it's a learning experience, and I did learn quite a few things here, but the people here are mostly pretty nasty and sarcastic and I don't fit in.

This has not been a once of case.<br><br>So the medical profession is probably trying to be careful. And you know that Australia doesnt always recognise the qualifications of outside countries... especially asian ones.</div>
