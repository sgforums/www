I did try to be positive and tell myself that it's a learning experience, and I did learn quite a few things here, but the people here are mostly pretty nasty and sarcastic and I don't fit in.  I do have a few new friends - and one of them almost made me cry when she said that she wanted to yell at the others to ''SHUT UP!!  Leave her alone!!'' when she overheard them b!tching about me.  So touched that she stood up for me!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   I told her not to though, cause I'm strong enough to take the wolves coming after me, but I don't want her to be chased down by the same wolves because of me.<br><br>I really really almost cried when she said, ''Y'know, I think you're very brave and I admire your courage for standing up to them and going into their midst to work with them despite seeing how nasty they are to you, and how they've ganged up against you.''   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Nursing here is like that.

Of course, on paper, it sounds good - job rotation, exposure to different areas, skills picked up, yada-yada...<br><br>BUT, they've forgotten the human factors like our individual career plans, our interest areas, and most importantly, our friends.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>When you've worked in an area long enough, people start to accept you, you forge friendships, you know the system well.   I miss my old colleagues.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Most importantly, I'm at the stage where I'm waiting to make my exit.  I DO NOT relish new challenges now.  I did try to be positive and tell myself that it's a learning experience, and I did learn quite a few things here, but the people here are mostly pretty nasty and sarcastic and I don't fit in.  I do have a few new friends - and one of them almost made me cry when she said that she wanted to yell at the others to ''SHUT UP!!  Leave her alone!!'' when she overheard them b!tching about me.  So touched that she stood up for me!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   I told her not to though, cause I'm strong enough to take the wolves coming after me, but I don't want her to be chased down by the same wolves because of me.<br><br>I really really almost cried when she said, ''Y'know, I think you're very brave and I admire your courage for standing up to them and going into their midst to work with them despite seeing how nasty they are to you, and how they've ganged up against you.''   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Nursing here is like that.  Each time you enter a new work area, they'll tekan you and sabo you, throwing insults endlessly at you and all that, until they're convinced you can work and / or they've grown to accept you over time.<br><br>Nasty.  We weren't ever so brutal to newcomers in my old corporate jobs.  In fact, we welcomed newcomers and only kept our distance AFTER some misdeed was committed... welcomed unless proven suspicious / unworthy... not the other way round - attacked unless proven worthy.<br><br>Sorry I haven't been online much lately... been trying to seek that little sliver of sunshine slicing through the dark clouds.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>Well, certain jobs are like this... The worst is such ppl that in the workplace bully the newcomers, I believe they should be made to change job and treated in the same manner <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
