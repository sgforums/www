              <p><br>That sucks royally. You conservatively overestimate and dutifully pay your income taxes through the year, only to be denied the refund of your overpayment because the state has mismanaged their budget to the point of insolvency.</p>
              <p>So, does the notice indicate a timeframe for issuing tax refunds?</p>

              <p>Funny you should say that. We are thinking that maybe we should get out of Dodge. We have been toying with that idea for a couple of years now. The hubster will look into refreshing his request and I've just sent our realtor friend in Hawaii a feeler. Watch this space....</p>
              <p>In the meantime, California is $15 billion in debt. The state has just confirmed that many state workers will be on mandatory furlough. The Dept of Motor Vehicles will close every first and last Fridays, until July 2010 to save the state $1.8 billion. Programs for the disabled will be severely cut back. Most current state construction will stop.</p>
