              <p>Thanks 7-11.  I hope that your wife gets better soon too.  I do feel for her.  I had the same problem with the steroid.  It was all good when i was taking it but everytime I started to adjust the dose, it all flared up again.  It took me a while to be able to get off the steroid tablets. </p>
              <p>Has your wife tried UV therapy?  It helped me to get off the steroid tablets.  I stopped the UV therapy for a few months now but whenever I get a chance I will stand in the sun for about 10min just to get my natural UV.</p>
              <p>The itch is tormenting!</p>

              <p>Thanks 7-11.  I hope that your wife gets better soon too.  I do feel for her.  I had the same problem with the steroid.  It was all good when i was taking it but everytime I started to adjust the dose, it all flared up again.  It took me a while to be able to get off the steroid tablets. </p>
              <p>Has your wife tried UV therapy?  It helped me to get off the steroid tablets.  I stopped the UV therapy for a few months now but whenever I get a chance I will stand in the sun for about 10min just to get my natural UV.</p>
              <p>The itch is tormenting!</p>

              <p>7-11...  I really do feel for her as this is me when the rash is bad like now....  it is weeping at the moment too.  I try not to scratch it but it's hard to control.  What cream is your wife using?  If she's using steroid cream, just make sure she's only using it sparingly as it thins the skin.</p>
