Before me, there were a few customers queuing on the left side so I had to follow them.<br><br>"I waited almost 15 minutes for my turn before a gentleman and this woman suddenly came out of nowhere and cut the queue and ordered her food. I saw the gentleman in front of me talking to her something and I asked him where the queue was actually, and he said 'we are just following the queue earlier with those customers who have already bought their noodles'."<br><br>The man then walked away, said 'Helpless Me'.<br><br>"As my son wanted to eat fishball noodles I had no choice but to wait for that woman to order her food. She didn't even bother to check and just ordered her food without queuing.<br><br>"There was an uncle behind this woman as well and I asked him to let me order first as I had waited a long time and my son was left alone.The old uncle said to me no wonder he saw the gentleman in front of me walk off angrily.<br><br>"This mad woman thought that I was talking about her and shouted very loudly at me from her table that she didn't cut queue. Everyone in the Kopitiam started to turn and look in her direction.<br><br>"She began to scold me loudly "prostitute, ***** and hurled some vulgarities towards me.<br><br>"Later, her partner joined in and scolded me. Both of them continued to scold me fiercely and loudly.<br><br>"I was angry and retorted that she was the rude one who cut queue in the first place.<br><br>"They continued to scold me and attack me verbally, so for fear of our safety I decided to take their pictures for evidence.<br><br>"When she saw me taking her picture, she came forward and wanted to snatch my hand phone. <br><br>"I was holding my hand phone very tightly so she couldn't snatch it away and then she pushed me down from the chair forcefully. <br><br>"As my elbow landed on the ground first so I had abrasions and was a bit bruised on my elbow.<br><br>"Although there were many diners at that time, none of them come over to help us.<br><br>"Everyone in the Kopitiam witnessed her bullying me and started scolding her.<br><br>"A gentleman and his family witnessed the whole incident and called the police. He came to me and said he was willing to be my witness.<br><br>"A kind lady by the name of Ms Cecilia also stayed back to assist me and help me to take care of my son as she was afraid that the mad woman will attack both of us again.She asked one of the staff who works at Kopitiam why they didn't help but let this mad woman bully a mother and a young child just like that.<br><br>"The noodles stall seller also came and said sorry to me. She said she knew we were the one who was in the queue first.<br><br>"While waiting for the police's arrival, these two assailants just fled and no one stopped them.<br><br>" I want to thank the two kind souls who stayed and assisted me although some of them would rather not to get involved.<br><br>"I am just wondering if the woman used a weapon to attack me, will anyone come to assist a helpless woman like me?
