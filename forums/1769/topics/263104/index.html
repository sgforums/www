However, if you want to change the term of the loan (assuming eligible), it would involve another set of procedures - need to check with HDB.<br><br>(2) I think you can buy new condo without informing hdb, bec it's your private matter. Many ppl who already owns a hdb flat subsequently went on to buy a condo.   (I believe the restriction is for the case whereby you already owned a condo and subsequently want to buy a hdb flat - then you may not be allowed to buy the hdb flat).<br><br>If you happen to know someone who is a property agent, you can ask them as I'm sure they're familiar.

(We know its actually craps from the gahment now lah.  But HDB was then created for the low income folks instead of them living in squatter condition kampungs.)<br><br>So if you can afford a condo, you wont need subsidies.  But if that condo/landed property purchase was for investments, then they will close the eye. Provided you got inform them.<br><br>There was a article from HDB some many years ago, that did mentioned about folks who broke the rule by not seeking approval for that extra purchase of the condo/landed property as well as not living in them, and the HDB threatened eviction by confiscating the HDB flat or owners are allowed 6 months to sell off the HDB flat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure about HDB flats.....but I think they it should be the same as private properties where sale is concerned?  If thats the case, then you can't just put a name in or pull a name out (its not like a company where you can insert and remove shareholders as you wish).<br><br>Legally, for a property, its a sale.  That means.....<br><br>The whole group of you sell the flat.....and the whole group of you (except yourself) buy the flat again.  Lawyers must be involved...and they will want to see cash being transferred (just a dud cheque will do).  Stamp fees will apply, etc.  I believe the total process is 3 months (at least thats the case for private properties).<br><br>You can own a HDB flat and condo at the same time....as long as you live in the HDB flat and not the condo.  But realise that you ahve to declare to the government and bank that your condo is an investment (which can sometimes mean higher than normal bank loan interest rates, higher taxes, have to declare rental in your annual income, etc etc).<br><br></div>
