He was probably just being himself and meant no harm but yet, this lady came in with all the expectations heaped on him and he just didn't know what was expected of him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Guys like that probably never had that many relationships in the first place so they're not so erm... 'polished' and suave.<br><br>Maybe she should have told him straight out, 'It would have made me feel so warm and fuzzy inside if you had at least volunteered to wash my car as well because that would show that you were thinking of me too!'.  Clue him in on what would have made her day.  I'm sure he'd be more than happy to oblige because well, if he liked her, he would have done anything to make her happy.<br><br>Ah well, being 'gentlemanly' is not an inborn trait... sometimes, the lady has to take the initiative to point the special guy in her life the 'gentlemanly' way to melt her heart and seal his position in her life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

X-men, just wondering about that last sentence of yours.<br><br>If that keeps happening, maybe, it's time to sit up and take note.  Could it be that you're going for the wrong girls?  If you want to attract a certain type of girl, you'd have to see if you're the type of guy that she'd be looking for too.<br><br>Sometimes, we think that a certain type of person would suit us but we might be mistaken and thus end up barking up the wrong tree for ages, all the while, passing by the trees that could be easily climbed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Maybe, those girls you were disinterested in would have made a good match for you but because there were no spectacular feelings and all that, it didn't feel like love and attraction?
