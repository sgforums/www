I've got plenty of friends who became parents at a late age, and they're a helluva lot more energetic as parents than some of the deadbeat late-teens/early-twenties parents I've had the misfortune to work with as a welfare worker.<br><br>Second, those relatives had better wake up and smell the coffee.  If you're slaving away at someone's behest, you're buggered financially regardless of your age.  Again, the late-age parents I know are financially independent enough to make a bucket putting in 35 hours of work a week, with the rest of the time to spend with their kids.<br><br>Whatever those relatives motivations for concern are, they're misguided.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not the marrying sort, there are also many compelling factors for me to be against marriage. Additionally, I think for me to have any kids is very difficult, I suppose, indirectly due to my state of health.<br><br>I don't favour marriage and see it a shackle and a ball. I see so many problems being with a person 24x7 and worse is the in-laws for which I always felt that, in-laws, no matter how your other half thinks is endearing. In laws are one of the causes of many a break up and sometimes, I guess out of protecting their offsprings, they do get nasty with "outsiders". I understand that my lack of contribution of the family tree will not be view favourable and I will expect that painful label of barren woman. I do not know if some parent might get a bit over the edge and attempt to intervene so as to get a grandchild. But imagine that your husband's siblings are all surrounded by many kids, and we are still poor and childless. Instead of relatives telling you to get married during CNY, they would be telling you to divorce that barren woman and get a better one who can bear many kids. People's words always hurt. People's tongues are swords.<br><br>I look at the examples of married life around me and I observed none that influence me to ever wanting to be a part of this concept. I much rather keep at status quo. My own parents are arranged marriage in rtheir mid 20s. It was more out of duty they stayed together and perhaps to them its love. As the years grow, they grew apart and just hung around because they only have each other. My sister is in late 30s and she is single and happy, living alone. I suppose she might be dating men now but I think there is really no hurry as she is comfortable with life. I have wish to be able to feel that freedom and happiness she has and that she does not have to commit but just live for herself. My brother in his hurry married a materialistic women from taiwan and in a blink of an eye, divorced and penniless. Now they are fighting child custody and whatever money she can scrapped from my brother (who she bankrupt) and parents (my dad is a hawker and he recycles trash as a side line). My poor parents who had been paying out of their noses for this son is still paying in their old age and yet my brother has never woke up to his failures and faults.  For me, I didn't really enjoy childhood and cannot bear to bring one to suffer. I remeber my parent's fights. I remembered being bullied by my much older siblings mentally and physically. I remembered relative's hash words that I was too fat and ugly to ever have anyone love me. I remember no one ever being there for me.  Its not to say that I will also have these things happen to me but in my nearest experience, there is just so much unhappiness, suffering and pain for everyone in married life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's precisely it.  It's never-ending.<br><br>Some people who live a certain lifestyle think theirs is the right and only way to go.  And they'll impose their lifestyle on others who are different, the singles, the childless, etc.<br><br>Doesn't help that the government, thru policies and campaigns has somewhat dictated the way people ought to live - marriage before moving out, have kids, extended families, etc.  So people who have done so (not passing judgement here on whether that's right or wrong) subconsciously feel justified in telling people to follow the same path.
