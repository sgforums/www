            <div class='col-md body'>when women hold off from marrying, we call it independence. when men hold off from marrying, we call it fear of commitment, my dear mom commented on my defacto status. I am not married because my partner gives good headaches! the most frequently expressed complaint women have about men is that men don't listen. the most frequently expressed complaint men have about women is that women are always trying to change them. Men are obsessed with cleveage, women are obsessed with shoes. if a man makes a stupid mistake, the other men say"what a fool that man is'if a woman makes a stupid mistake, the men say'what fools women are.' what women want: to be loved, listened to, desired, respected needed and trusted. what men want: tickets to the FA cup. Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast. Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Dogs are a man's best friend. now you know which sex is smarter. Men are like fires, they go out if unattended. A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the begining of a new argument. My light hearted observation of the differences between the sexes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Men and women are different and whilst they can try to meet on middle ground, they still have to acknowledge that they are still essentially, very different in their perspectives, needs and characteristics.<br><br>I guess the best solution is not to expect your husband to take over the duties of your female buddies.  After marriage, continue to keep your own friends.  You can grow close to your husband but I doubt if he'd like you to yak-yak-yak about shopping, sales, cosmetics, fashion, yada-yada after a hard day's work.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Go out with your girl buddies to have that kinda yak-fest and you'll all be destressed.  Try and talk about stuff like that to your husband and I guess he'll tune you out and if you pause long enough to take a breath, you might realise that he's gone very quiet!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ('Sleeping' with his eyes open?  hehehe!  Most men with yakky wives with tempers like poodles DO get to master that, plus looking interested when they really aren't, and learning how to listen to key words so when questioned by wife if they were listening, what was the last thing they said, they're able to repeat it!  hahahahaha!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )<br><br>I've noticed that the mistakes most ladies make, would be to assume that once they get married, they'll have to do EVERYTHING together.  Don't know about you but that thought scares the hell outta me.  EVERYTHING??!!!  Noooooo!!!  I wanna hang around my favourite counters in the dept stores without having a man with thinly-guised impatience hovering about me, spoiling my fun!  I wanna spend AGES in bookstores, just browsing, and if he isn't happy about it, then 'Dah-ling, meet you half an hour later at Coffee Bean!  Ta-ta!'.  I wanna take half an hour deciding if I should buy this brand shampoo or that brand conditioner and not have my husband nag and breath down my neck that 'A shampoo is a shampoo is a shampoo!!'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  So, some things are best done, without your spouse around.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sure, there are 'couple-things' that are really awesome to do together!  And being married always fulfills the innate  human need, that 'urge to merge' and become united in partnership with one, the knowledge and assurance that you love him and care deeply for him and he loves you and cares deeply for you back.  There is something sweet about being accountable, about having to think about someone else other than yourself... but there are also times when you just have to go about your own lives and come together at the end of the day, all the richer in bliss because you have a wide circle of pals too.<br><br>I guess it's important to find someone who shares the same need for space that you do, and who has the same level of closeness and separate activity time that you do too.  That way, less of a tussle and fight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Now, where's my guy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
