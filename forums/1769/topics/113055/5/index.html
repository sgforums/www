            <div class='col-md body'>Out of the 10 reasons you cited, No. 10 is the only one I identify with.  I love my freedom and would resent it if someone were to come into my life and impose restrictions on me.  It would be like trying to bridle a wild horse... painful for both.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>For that same reason, I wouldn't want to shackle someone either.  I'd rather he just be himself so the trick is to be with someone with whom you already share a lot of important values in common already so even if through the years, both change drastically, the things that really matter, ie. commitment, family values, etc, stay the same.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   The man / woman you marry today might change two / five / ten years down the road.  When that occurs, the thing that will continue to bond you together would be love and commitment.<br><br>I wouldn't want to lose my identity in a marriage.  I want it to be an equal partnership otherwise, I'll be hit with my Runaway Mare Syndrome and start running the hell away!  hahaha!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Has anyone realised that sometimes, those of us in our 30's aren't married because we were devotedly in a relationship that didn't work out in the end?<br>During my recent night duty, I yakked with a few colleagues who were in their late 20's / early 30's and who were still single too and one thing became glaringly obvious.<br><br>Let's say you had a partner when you were 24.  You spend time getting to know him, say you take 1-2 years and then you get serious, add another 1 year or so... you're already 27-28.  Say both of you decided to get married, save and plan for another year, you're 29.  At the last minute, things didn't work out and you break off, you're 29/30.  You are so devastated, you quietly mourn the breakup for say, 1-3 years, voila, you're in your early 30's, en route to your mid-30's.<br><br>The above is just an example, a scenario, but it's something that kept cropping up in my conversations with singles my age.  It's not that we're undesirable... we have all tried in earnest but somehow or other, things just didn't work out.<br><br>Don't underestimate the power of cynicism and the fear of having your heart broken again too.  And also, don't forget that different folks take different periods of time to heal and feel ready to move on again.  It's worse when folks don't acknowledge their heartbreak and pretend nothing happened... I've seen too many men do that to their own detriment.<br><br>It gets harder as you grow older.  It's easier to fall in love in your 20's.  In your 30's, after the heartbreaks, you tend to be more guarded, critical, reserved and analytical.  I wish I had the foresight to bail out of the bad relationships I was in when I was in my mid to late 20's but oh well, there were lessons I had to learn from the experiences.<br><br>As to why I'm still single, ah, I prefer it that way for now.  Sure, I have wishes and yearnings, and sometimes, my mind and heart get messed up - I'm only human... but I'm 'on the move' and 'in transit' and soon, I'll have my dream become reality.  I've sacrificed a lot the past six years just to achieve my dream and I'm not going to jeopardise it at this critical stage.  (It feels soooo good to have my close pals pat me on the back and declare, 'I admire your tenacity and strength of character!  It will all come to fruition soon!'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>Most importantly, I haven't met anyone who truly rocks my world.  Ah, but who cares... I'm having fun being a bachelorette!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, what are the odds that you folks hang out?  Maybe the Bear with Subargal or Dragg with Rhonda?  And the list goes on.  I think we have enough names to pair up?  If there are fireworks, great, if not, at least you can put a name to a face?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But seriously, even married at either 20s, 30s or 40s does not guarantee a "happily ever after" relationship.<br><br>Sometimes I think, if I am alone again, can I accommodate a "new" being into my life.  I mean at 45, I am quite set in my ways, the style I do things and my thoughts and principles, blah, blah.....  It's like having to re-learn to live with another "style of management".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am having a wonderful time with my husband now.  We had 4 years of courtship and married for 21 years.  But these 25 years were not all rosy.  Some years we were at each other's necks.  Some years he loved me and some years he doesn't.  Some years I love him and some years I don't.  But through it all, we were committed to our vows.  We went through different phases/changes and I thank our Good Lord above that the metamorphosis didn't cause too much damage.<br><br>We grew together....through the good and the bad.  Our mindset are like entwined and we think alike most of the time.  We lead separate lives but yet is one.  It took a lot of "grinding" to arrive at what we are today.  In fact, this is the best time of my life with my husband.  Even courtship can't come close.  To this, I am very grateful and feel very blessed.  I can only savour what is today for I do not know what the future beholds.  One thing I do know is if we had not been committed, our marriage would have ended when I was in my 30s.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Patsy Cline did sing "stand by your man" (and this dude says the other way around is also very important).. that is what being a couple is all about isn't it?<br><br>to be strong when he wavers, and to accept the support when you do...<br><br>and as for hanging out.. i try my best to get everyone to hang out together with my Pub Nights (okay okay.. i like the pub too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>drag your hubby to come along if you can.. next one is this saturday weekend <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, if a couple fall in love means they love each other at the first place ...after few years they quarrel over some silly things..why? nobody knows why...but if you trully believe in that you love him/her at the begining why not to hold on to it and nver give up on each other???<br><br>do you know that most quarrels are because of misunderstanding...that's why we have people fighting and killing each other because of hatred...why hatred began? coz misunderstanding due to failed communication...each of us have diffferent frequency of reception of brain wave...meaning u must adjust the way you think of and judge of that particular person to broadcast your message to him/her...<br><br>for example myself....i felt my gf starting to lost interest on me...why? i dont know why..but i believe the way i think is wrong...i should believe and hold onto this train...if bad things really happen to me ,again ,then it wasnt me who being such a loser...at least i had love her trully...just that she never think so...<br><br>mind can kill <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Our weekends typically involve movie nights, home karaoke (cheap lah), some gatherings with fellow s'poreans.  Now that summer is approaching, lately have been busy with the yards.  I'll try out my "technical skills" to see if I can post some pix of my home grown tulips and the front lawn.  Hubby did a fabulous job there.  The backyard is still taking form.  No pix yet but I did planted some cayenne chillies and a cherry tomatoes tree.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But yes, you hit it right at the nail about we still have "it" for each other even during the "down" periods.   It's like a journey walking on the pebble stones path and coming out "healthy".  "Foot reflexology" ah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
