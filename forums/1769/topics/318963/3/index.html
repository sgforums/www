              <p>Ha!  I think she didn't realise that during the SARS period,</p>
              <p>- nurses stopped wearing our uniforms out of the hospital grounds because whenever we boarded public transport in our uniform, passengers would avoid us and give us a wide berth;</p>
              <p>- people who turned up to visit their relatives and who were refused entry because they were not the officially appointed visitors started to hurl abuse at nursing staff when they called up to complain;</p>
              <p>- quite a lot of relatives called up the wards very frequently to ask about their stable relatives, and made sarcastic remarks like you guys should be answering the phones quicker because you hardly have work to do, the wards are emptier, there are no visitors, etc. not realising that it takes time to do all that handwashing and skipping in and out of disposable suits and all;</p>
              <p>- there was a fear of uncertainty, a fear of death; and</p>
              <p>- a few unfortunate docs and nurses damaged the epithelial layer of their hands with excessive handwashing using medical / surgical-grade liquid soap;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone thinks about the "I want to be a hero" bit, but conveniently forgets all the other not-so-desirable attributes.</p>

              <p>Actually, I wanna mention this - year in, year out, the Ministry of Health seems to spend quite a fair bit of funds during Nurses' Day to put up newspaper supplements and create hype over Nursing. </p>
              <p>You know why?</p>
              <p>Because Singapore's ability to retain both local and foreign nurses is terrible!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I've ever asked someone really senior before, if they've ever thought about investing money into improving working conditions so that staff will stay on, which means that you're getting the maximum returns for your investment in staff training and education, because it DOES cost a fair bit to train a graduate nurse up to scratch.  If you can manage to retain trained staff, and better still, attain staff loyalty and improve staff motivation, then you won't have to spend so much time, money and other resources investing in recruitment exercises, training new nurses to replace the ones who have left, etc! </p>
              <p>Does this make sense?  Because somehow, it didn't seem to make cow sense to those people.  Maybe, if I had moo'd, they might have understood me better!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>She finds out what she likes, pursues it, does what she like now. She's not wasting any time at all.... In fact, I feel happy for her although I don't know her at all.</p>

              <p>People who criticised me for entering Nursing now have to eat
              humble pie.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Salary-wise, I'm now on par, if not
              doing even better than them. </p>
              <p>If you have a dream, you must decide to put your mind to
              it.  There will be obstacles along the way and sometimes,
              situations will be heart-wrenching.  However, persevere on,
              and keep your dearest friends close to you because they will be the
              ones who will help to keep you sane during your struggles.  I
              have two precious souls in Club 30 whom I'm deeply indebted to for
              being my strong support during moments so desolate and dark, all
              seemed hopeless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Somedays, I remember the terrible times I faced, lying on my
              mattress, looking out the window at the vast sky, mesmerised by the
              soft tinkles of my dreamcatcher windchime, tears slowly drying on
              my face, heart aching so badly, I thought I would just perish...
              and I realise how far I've come.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>kudos to you!  lol was supposed to make this post but i went to talk on phone for an hour + <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><br></p>
              <p>those who criticised you right.... actually you dont have to say anything to them back.... your achievements and all can be seen.. they have eyes to see. And that will shut them up. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>I dont know how far am i now to my dreams, i know it's still very far, and i received a lot of negative comments bout what i intend to do.... in SG's context it's hard or close to non-existent i know, but i think eventually i'd get there.... someday. Let's see. I'm waiting for the day to come to prove them wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Actually, I wanna mention this - year in, year out, the Ministry of Health seems to spend quite a fair bit of funds during Nurses' Day to put up newspaper supplements and create hype over Nursing.</p>
              <p>You know why?</p>
              <p>Because Singapore's ability to retain both local and foreign nurses is terrible!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I've ever asked someone really senior before, if they've ever thought about investing money into improving working conditions so that staff will stay on, which means that you're getting the maximum returns for your investment in staff training and education, because it DOES cost a fair bit to train a graduate nurse up to scratch.  If you can manage to retain trained staff, and better still, attain staff loyalty and improve staff motivation, then you won't have to spend so much time, money and other resources investing in recruitment exercises, training new nurses to replace the ones who have left, etc!</p>
              <p>Does this make sense?  Because somehow, it didn't seem to make cow sense to those people.  Maybe, if I had moo'd, they might have understood me better!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>actually i know why lar. At that time, NUS nursing is not offered yet. So she has no motivation to study. Only after she went through 1 year of diploma studies in nursing, then nus nursing is offered.</p>
              <p>If i am not wrong, NUS nursing is only set up in 2006 or so. So she ended up taking a diploma in nursing.
