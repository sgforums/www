              <p>The cult leader of Club 30 is a Nurse!  Hehe!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I think we should just let the girl lead her life and make her own choices.  Singaporeans are quick to criticise and condemn others who don't take the 'typical' route, but it's really all up to the individual how he/she charts his/her course in life.  Afterall, she will be the one to reap the fruits or bear the consequences.</p>
              <p>I never thought I'd be a nurse!  Never, ever!  And yet, after working seven years in the corporate sector, I gave up a well-salaried position, discarded the prestige, cut up my corporate Gold Card, and ventered into Nursing. </p>
              <p>It wasn't easy.  I suffered a pay cut of more than 65%.  I had to move out of my rented two-bedroom HDB apartment into a rented bedroom.  I had to give up my three cats for adoption as a result of that.  I packed up a lot of my stuff to be hastily given away and I cried buckets for weeks over my losses and drastic change in circumstances. </p>
              <p>And then, in Nursing School, I realised that a lot in my cohort entered Nursing because their results were so awful, they had no other course that would accept them!  Ack! </p>
              <p>I had to face Nursing Managers, Nursing Officers and colleagues who were pretty ruffian in their behaviour and their management style was kinda commando-style.  I nicknamed these people "Empress Dowagers" because of their obsolete, 1960's  management style.  It was mostly Management by Instilling Fear and Enforcing Absolute Power, a real stark contrast to the open, empowerment concept I was familiar with through my years of working for and with Americans in the various MNC's I was with.</p>
              <p>The few years I had to work in the local hospital was sheer hell.  Looking back, I do not know what kept me going on to complete not just my bond period, but another extra year on top of that.  However, by the end of that period, I think a few of you know that I sunk into deep depression.  *shivers...</p>
              <p>Anyways, that's all history.  And the new chapter in my life is looking real good!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  I've achieved my long-held dream of migrating out of Singapore, and am now working in a ward of my choice, receiving the all-rounded training I wanted all along, and embarking on the first of two courses that will make me a fully-qualified ICU Nurse.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  </p>
              <p>People who criticised me for entering Nursing now have to eat humble pie.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Salary-wise, I'm now on par, if not doing even better than them. </p>
              <p>If you have a dream, you must decide to put your mind to it.  There will be obstacles along the way and sometimes, situations will be heart-wrenching.  However, persevere on, and keep your dearest friends close to you because they will be the ones who will help to keep you sane during your struggles.  I have two precious souls in Club 30 whom I'm deeply indebted to for being my strong support during moments so desolate and dark, all seemed hopeless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Somedays, I remember the terrible times I faced, lying on my mattress, looking out the window at the vast sky, mesmerised by the soft tinkles of my dreamcatcher windchime, tears slowly drying on my face, heart aching so badly, I thought I would just perish... and I realise how far I've come.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>I wish this girl all the best in her endeavours!  It will be a journey of many challenges, but the skills gained will be priceless.  And yes, embrace true geographic mobility with Nursing.  And stand tall... because you WILL be saving countless lives in this profession.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>i guess its only in times like these, when we are at a loss, at crossroads, or in deep shit, that we truly search deep into our souls to find out what is it that we really seek.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes, life can get too comfortable that we dont look beyond our comfort zone. just get a decent degree then find a decent job would suffice for many.</p>
              <p>when shit happens, sa life changing events, one is stuck in a moment and cant find a way, that the answer dawn upon us. i find that those going through tough times will be more resolute and have more chance of success when they make up their mind on a certain matter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i can empathize with the girl, for i have chose a path less travelled. =)</p>

              <p>Don't worry, motoway.  There are people who don't even realise their true calling until much later in life.  I know of people here in Australia who are pretty indecisive and clueless and they don't really know what they really like until when they are 'old'.</p>
              <p>Thing is, in Singapore, life is pretty regimented and if you try to be different, you become glaringly different.  You just need to be courageous enough. </p>
              <p>Just explore any open avenues and keep an open mind.  Hopefully, you'll find your passion real soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png">  It helps to start by asking yourself where your aptitude lies.  I considered teaching or nursing, because English and Biology were my strong subjects and I had a deep interest in both.  From there, it was easy to work out which was the more viable option. </p>
              <p>So, what are you good at?</p>

              <p>I know that over here, geriatric care is a huge thing.  Actually, it is so all over the world.  Nursing homes and retirement villages are always short of staff.  You don't need to be a nurse, you can just be an orderly, which means, you are kinda like a caregiver, you help the elderly with their daily needs, eg. showering, feeding, etc. and you are like a companion to them, but you aren't allowed to administer medication. </p>
              <p>However, not everyone can stomach doing these things day in and day out.  I, for one, will foam at the mouth, throw a fit thrashing wildly on the floor, and drop dead!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I'm an ICU Nurse through and through.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>You'll never find yourself out of a job if you enter this area of aged care.  Afterall, everyone grows old!</p>
