              <p>Well, Singapore nurses who intend to migrate to the States might want to consider sitting for the mandatory NCLEX-RN licencing exam soon after graduation.  Otherwise, you'd have to revise the entire syllabus all over again just to sit for the exam.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Well, I don't care much for rationalising about this issue.  I just voted with my feet, and so have many other Singaporean nurses and foreign nurses who used to work in Singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I listed things that can be improved on simply because you were curious, not that I had any faith whatsoever that any of the points I raised would ever be considered nor come to fruition.  I seriously doubt that things will improve much for nurses in Singapore, and seriously, it is no longer my problem too because I am happy working here. </p>
              <p>It's not just wages that's a bugbear with Singapore nurses and if you look through my list, salary is just one of several factors. </p>

              curious, not that I had any faith whatsoever that any of the points
              I raised would ever be considered nor come to fruition.  I
              seriously doubt that things will improve much for nurses in
              Singapore, and seriously, it is no longer my problem too because I
              am happy working here. </p>
              <p>It's not just wages that's a bugbear with Singapore nurses and
              if you look through my list, salary is just one of several
              factors. </p>

              <p>Well, I do agree with you life as a "Missy" is damn sh!t. I was talking to my friend's wife, and the agony of occupation hazzard starts in the hospital. Spine injuries, loose knees pelvic pain etc.... Sad isn't it?</p>
              <p>I guess it is difficult to balance the whole picture. I am not questioning your points, as I do believe that changes must be made to maintain a healthy workforce. Just like some IT coys, major overhaul happened to keep the talents.</p>
              <p>My point now? Doubt things will move or change until the day we become a much better welfare state, not just for nursing, but for many other fields.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I hope the girl who left 'A' levels for nursing, happiness.</p>

              <p>You know, I've been thinking about this statement of yours about welfare states being the reason why nurses and doctors are well-paid.</p>
              <p>It's not true.  I don't even work in the public sector, and yet, working conditions are better than back in SG. </p>
              <p>I think it's more an issue of employees' rights in the workplace, as well as a matter of a powerful union fighting for better working conditions. </p>
              <p>Equally important is the fact that patients will not be allowed to mistreat the nurses.</p>

              <p>Hey all,</p>
              <p>          This is a pretty interesting discussion going down here! Nurses in Australia are highly respected and I, too respect nurses judging by their dedication and passion for their jobs. My university nurse has her own office and she's the one who actually administers all the injections.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In today's society, nurses are given much more responsibilities and roles in the medical profession. There has been some revision in the nursing degree's cirriculum and there might be even a 4 year nursing degree in the near future whereby highly-specialised nurses take on some of the doctor roles in rural areas( I read about this in my textbook, "The Australian Health Care System") Apparently, the state of New South Wales have gone through a series of pilot programs under the general rubric of 'nurse practitioner'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe Singapore should also give the same amount of respect and acknowledgement for our local nurses.</p>

              <p>Sadly, back in SG, the nursing role, whilst no longer viewed as the 'handmaiden' role, is still not as challenged as the nursing role here in Australia and in the US. </p>
              <p>I was told by a fireman here that he was extremely impressed by the MICA Paramedics here because they are the first respondents and they are actually 'like doctors'. </p>
              <p>I've seen some really professional and specialised nurses at work here and I'm very impressed.  And yes, because of the shortage of doctors in rural Australia, and because the nearest acute medical facility is often a distance away for these rural communities, Nurse Practitioners will be empowered to act like GP's because in emergencies, time is of the essence. </p>
              <p>I think Singapore is pushing for their nurses to take on greater roles but without the requisite community support and acknowledgement, and without the requisite remuneration and resources, it will be slow to take off.  We do have Nurse Practitioners now in Singapore but their roles are still diminished compared to their  counterparts in other developed nations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And, as for cadavars, these days, with what were once 'scary' scenes popping up all over the TV and internet, I think a lot of people are now desensitised to images that once upon a time were considered 'gross' and censored out of public view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Really, WHAT is sacred these days?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
