Their mentality is something like, "I've had a bad day at work being ordered around by the bosses and the customers... now it's my turn to get what I want!" and the poor service staff really suffers from their rudeness and attitude?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And yes, on more than a few occasions, I've overheard people saying that!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>It happens... people cannot manage their stress well.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
