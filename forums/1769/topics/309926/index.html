                       <strong>The must-have bag of the season costs a fiver from a supermarket,
                                      and hits the shelves on Wednesday. Is it a fashion statement or for
                                      those taking a green stance - and does it matter?</strong> </span></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">This season sustainable is the new black. Eco-friendly
                                      used to be a byword for dull and worthy, but now it's officially
                                      fashionable, darling. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">The product spearheading the trend is a bag made from
                                      unbleached cotton, which cost £5 at selected Sainsbury's stores and
                                      sold out within an hour of going on sale on Wednesday morning. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">It might not sound A-list, but the bag emblazoned with
                                      "I am not a plastic bag" has been designed by the "queen of bagland"
                                      Anya Hindmarch. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">The aim is simple, to encourage people not to use
                                      plastic carrier bags. The bag has been produced in partnership with We
                                      Are What We Do, a non-profit campaign group that has set out to change
                                      the world in small steps. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">The bag's must-have credentials were firmly secured when
                                      it was chosen as the goodie-bag for guests at the 2007 Vanity Fair
                                      Oscar night party. Only 20,000 are going on sale - each of the branches
                                      stocking it is restricted to just 30 bags and customers can buy only
                                      one each. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="color: #000080; font-size: normal;">People queued for hours when a few of the bags were sold
                                      at Hindmarch's London boutique last month, and they have been changing
                                      hands for up to £200 on eBay. The simple bag has become a symbol of
                                      ethical intent - and a very fashionable one at that. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">Ethical intent </span></strong></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:normal;"><strong>Brits use an estimated 10bn plastic carrier bags each year. But is this bag more of a fashion statement than a green one?</strong> </span></p>

                      <strong> It's made of cotton but in China, perhaps not the most environmental
                                      choice given that it has to be shipped thousands of miles to the UK.
                                      And it's cheap for a Hindmarch bag - hers typically sell for up to
                                      £1,000 - but it's a lot more than the 10p charged for "bags for life"
                                      available at most supermarkets. </strong></span></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">But it doesn't matter why people buy it, says one
                                      marketing expert. What's important is the huge amounts of publicity the
                                      bag generates. On that score, the bag has been the charity's most
                                      successful endeavour to date. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">"So what if people buy it because it's a fashion
                                      statement," says Chris Arnold, creative partner at ethical marketing
                                      company Feel. "If the person who uses the bag is shallow and driven by
                                      fashion, it still helps the planet because they haven't used a plastic
                                      one. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">"We have to accept that we live in a wealthy,
                                      consumer-based society and work with it. It's easy to pick apart any
                                      ethical campaign, but if it helps make ethical values more fashionable,
                                      then that's great." </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="color: #000080;">An ethical bag for keen consumers? This is something of
                                      an oxymoron, given that shopping in itself draws heavily on the
                                      planet's resources.</span> </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">Consciousness raising </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">Ms Hindmarch knows first-hand the power fashion has, and
                                      is prepared to use it. "As a luxury fashion brand we are in a position
                                      where we can influence," she says. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size: normal;"><strong>The bag was never designed to save the planet
                                      single-handedly - the purpose was to cast a spotlight on an important
                                      issue, says a spokesman for We Are What We Do.</strong> </span></p>

                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">Some aspects of the project may not be ideal, such as
                                      producing the bag in China, but no one is making a profit and the bags
                                      were made in a factory "deemed ethical" by the charity. The project was
                                      also carbon-offset. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">"If this bag plants an idea in people's heads that will
                                      make them think before automatically reaching for a plastic one then
                                      it's a success," he says. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">It's win-win for everyone involved, says brand expert
                                      Jonathan Gabay. "The very smart thing about this bag is that it's
                                      getting an important environmental message across to a mass market. </span></strong></p>
                      <p><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">"The consumer looks good and so do all the companies
                                      involved. The bag sends out a message that the consumer is intelligent
                                      for buying it and the companies for producing it." </span></strong></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size: normal;"><strong>By making the bag exclusive, Ms Hindmarch is not damaging her own upmarket brand, he adds.</strong> </span></p>

                      supermarket the online pre-order will be delayed. Originally the
                      official US launch date for online pre-orders was 7th of May but this
                      is going to be delayed due to the overwhelming reaction and response to
                      the bags. They strongly advise you to register on the Anya Hindmarch
                      website so they can keep you updated on when the bags will be
                      available. The in-store launch remains on the 20th June in all 4 Anya
                      Hindmarch stores as well as Fred Segal Flair and Ron Herman in LA.</p>
              <p>As with all successful ventures, there will be naysayers and Anya
                      Hindmarch has received recent pieces of press in the UK criticising her
                      for having the bags made in China. As we have received enquiries about
                      this we decided to speak to Anya directly to set the record straight.</p>
              <p>From Anya:<br> <strong>“Our aim with this project has been to use our influence to
                      make it fashionable not to use plastic bags. ‘I’m Not A Plastic Bag’
                      was designed to be a stylish, practical, reusable bag that would raise
                      awareness of this issue and spark debate. We feel that we have achieved
                      this aim beyond our wildest dreams.</strong> <strong> For more information about where the bags was made etc, please see our <a href="http://anyahindmarch.com/">website</a>.</strong></p>

              <p>Check out the US edition of I'm not a Plastic Bag with
                      navy blue writing! I like it even better than the European version,
                      which sold out within 2 hours in London with lines around the block
                      from 6am! I am so incredibly inspired by Anya's dedication to change
                      the world, one cotton bag at a time. Please join us in supporting her

              <p>Message from <strong>Anya Hindmarch</strong> to Bag Snob readers:</p>
              <p><strong>"When I was first approached with this idea, it gave me the
                      chills. It seemed so important. The thing that struck me was that when
                      I started working at 18 years old in the late Eighties, I remember
                      drinking double espressos and smoking Marlboro lights and working all
                      day and night. I remember the cool young girls I started employing
                      arriving with their yoga mats and pomegranate seeds and their plants on
                      their desk for oxygen and me thinking it was all a bit ‘knit your own
                      yoghurt’. But of course the reality is that now we all realise the
                      importance of looking after your health, what you eat and what you do.
                      It was these cool, fashionable influences that helped it become trendy."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“The bag project all started two years ago when a man called
                      David Robinson approached me. David - who is a very good man – runs a
                      global social change network called We Are What We Do. They are a
                      fantastic movement who try to inspire people to use their everyday
                      actions to change the world. He is very much of the belief that if
                      everyone makes a small change and does their bit it can actually amount
                      to making a big difference.I just loved the simplicity of that and I
                      agree with it. The first thing that they did was publish a book, which
                      was done in a really upbeat, unworthy way, called ‘How to Change the
                      World for a Fiver,’ and it was very popular - organizations really
                      embraced it and gave it out to their employees. It started with fifty
                      actions that anyone could do to help - things like ‘smile at old people
                      because they know lots of good stuff’ and ‘turn off the water when
                      you’re brushing your teeth.’But the first action was ‘decline plastic
                      bags whenever possible.’ We Are What We Do came to see us because they
                      were very keen to take the success of the book into a project.I was
                      enamored with the idea because I do believe there is so much wasted
                      packaging - although I’m far from perfect myself. <br> But secondly I thought they were really good people and it was a really
                      exciting project to try and highlight - it’s such an easy thing to do.
                      We designed the bag as it’s big and easy and great for groceries, but
                      will probably be used as a school bag or a gym bag. I use mine everyday
                      as a tote bag bringing stuff from home.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“There’s a lot to be said for plastic for sure, but on a
                      recent shopping trip I refused nine plastic bags as I could put things
                      directly into my cotton one - and that’s amazing.If it makes people
                      rethink their behaviour and perhaps makes the supermarkets rethink
                      their solutions then it’s achieved something as far as I’m concerned."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“What’s really exciting is the reaction from people. “I’ve
                      literally had letters from models, film stars, politicians and even
                      Prince Charles yesterday, all saying ‘fantastic, well done, we all
                      support it and we’re right behind it."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“I’m not the greenest person around, I drive a diesel car (I
                      have five children) but the point is that ‘we are what we do’ and if we
                      all do a little thing then we’ll solve the damage, we’ll stop making it
                      worse. And it really doesn’t take you long to rethink the way you
                      behave."</strong></p>

              <p>I actually DO miss a lot of the things I've put in storage back home.  I've even dreamt of some of the items two or three times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I miss ALL of my cookbooks, MOST of my CD's, and a few of my DVD's.  And I also miss a few of my softtoys and ALL of my Sylvanian Families dollhouses and figurines.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p>Some items have priceless sentimental value... or are you unable to grasp that concept?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>I can already tell you the things you were going to say, stuff including :</p>
              <p>- "Love people, use things";</p>
              <p>- With the money you pay for storage,  you could have bought the same things many times over;</p>
              <p>- You should have given your things away and started your new life unburdened;</p>
              <p>- There is nothing you can't find in Melbourne, especially books; etc etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whilst not exactly in the same words, it would be more-or-less along the same lines.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Am I not right, cobba?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
