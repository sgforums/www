            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">av98m is right. I think we should be aware...</span><br><br>======================<br><strong><span class="large">Food for thought: The ethics of eating meat</span></strong><br>The Straits Times<br>June 17, 2006<br><br>By Peter Singer<br><br>GLOBAL meat consumption is predicted to double by 2020. Yet in Europe and North America, there is growing concern about the ethics of the way meat and eggs are produced. The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called 'white' - actually pale pink - veal, newborn calves are separated from their mothers, deliberately made anaemic, denied roughage and kept in stalls so narrow they cannot walk or turn around.<br><br>In Europe, mad cow disease shocked many people, not only because it shattered beef's image as a safe and healthy food, but also because they learnt that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep. People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter - complete with chicken droppings - and slaughterhouse waste.<br><br>Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from limited to the small percentage of people who are vegetarians or even vegans - eating no animal products at all. Despite strong ethical arguments for vegetarianism, it is not yet a mainstream position. More common is the view that we are justified in eating meat, as long as the animals have a decent life before they are killed.<br><br>The problem, as Jim Mason and I describe in our book, The Way We Eat, is that industrial agriculture denies animals even a minimally decent life. Tens of billions of chickens produced today never go outdoors. They are bred to have voracious appetites and gain weight fast, then reared in sheds that can hold more than 20,000 birds. The level of ammonia in the air from their accumulated droppings stings the eye and hurts the lungs. Slaughtered at only 45 days old, their immature bones can hardly bear the weight of their bodies. Some collapse and soon die, their fate irrelevant to the economics of the enterprise as a whole.<br><br>Conditions are even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage, she would be unable to stretch her wings. But there are usually at least four hens per cage, and often more.<br><br>In such crowded conditions, the more dominant, aggressive birds are likely to peck to death the weaker hens in the cage. To prevent this, producers sear off all birds' beaks with a hot blade. A hen's beak is full of nerve tissue - it is, after all, her principal means of relating to her environment - but no anesthetic or analgesic is used to relieve the pain.<br><br>Pigs may be the most intelligent and sensitive of the animals we commonly eat.<br><br>When foraging in a rural village, they can exercise that intelligence and explore their varied environment. Before they give birth, sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest in which to nurse their litter.<br><br>But in today's factory farms, pregnant sows are kept in crates so narrow they cannot turn around or even walk more than a step forward or backward. They lie on bare concrete. The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible, so she can be made pregnant again, but they never leave the shed until they are taken to slaughter.<br><br>Defenders of these production methods argue that they are a regrettable but necessary response to a growing population's demand for food.<br><br>On the contrary, when we confine animals in factory farms, we have to grow food for them. They burn up most of that food's energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm, so we end up with a small fraction - usually no more than one-third and sometimes as little as one-10th - of the food value we feed them. By contrast, cows grazing on pasture eat food we cannot digest, which means they add to the amount of food available to us.<br><br>It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they become more prosperous, are copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs. If this continues, the result will be animal suffering on an even greater scale, as well as more environmental damage and a rise in heart disease and cancers of the digestive system. It will also be grossly inefficient.<br><br>As consumers, we have the power - and moral obligation - to refuse to support farming methods that are cruel to animals and bad for us.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The writer is professor of bioethics at Princeton University.</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by av98m:</div><div class="quote_body">Heck, I'd eat it if it was offered to me.<br><br>The way I see it, just the act of eating meat(any kind) these days means you are participating in an act of cruelty to another living thing.

I will largely ignore the somewhat compelling issue of our right to enslave millions of animals to a putrid existence and spend only a little time on the tremendous burden our meat based diet places on the environment. Both of these issues are handled well in many books, perhaps most notably Diet for a New America by John Robbins whose life is an interesting story unto itself.  Most people would be amazed when confronted with the phenomenal environmental cost of meat based diets. For example, about one half of our harvested acreage goes to feed livestock but for every 16 pounds of this grain we get only one pound back as meat. However, that 16 pounds of grain has 21 times more calories and eight times more protein than a pound of hamburger. Actually during WWI Denmark was cut off from all supplies and were forced to deal with the possibility of great food shortages. In response they opted to stop feeding the grain to their cattle and instead use it to feed the people. Sort of a mass vege experiment with about 3million subjects. During the one year of these tight restrictions the mortality rate from disease was by far the lowest in recorded history with over a 34% drop. Evidence abounds that longer healthier lives are had by vegetarians worldwide. Furthermore, the toll on our precious drinking water is tremendous with one pound of steak requiring 2,500 gallons of water meaning that just 10 pounds of steak is more than my entire household use of water for one full year. This ignores the staggering levels of pollution from both meat and dairy propagation that result in highly inefficient use of our resources.</span><br><br>Jarrod Jablonski - President, Global Underwater Explorers</div>
