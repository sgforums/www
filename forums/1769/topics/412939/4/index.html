              <p>Tamago! Tamago! (Eggs for sale!) When you hear these shouts, you know you are at this famous Iozan, the sulphur mountain.These yellow sulphurous vents can be viewed at close proximity if you can stand the heat and the choking smoke ozzing out from the vents.</p>

              <p>At $1.60 each, these hard boiled eggs are pretty expensive but we bought 2 of these eggs from the old ladies. Although these brownish green sickly looking hard boiled egg yolk vowed to be different from the rest, they really tasted the same to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>Caption : Lake Mashu (æ‘©å‘¨æ¹–) - Akan National Park</strong></p>
              <p>Lake Mashu is a caldera lake with no inlet and outlet. It is one of the clearest lake in the world and the deepest in Japan. Lake Mashu was originally named as Mashin-ko (Lake of Devils) by the Ainu because in summer, the surface of the lake is obscured by fog giving it a mysterious reputation.</p>

              <p><strong>Caption : Japanese loch-ness ? </strong></p>
              <p>Local believed that if you can see the surface of the lake, you will have bad luck so instead they have linked it to Mount Mashu known as mountain of gods and Lake Mashu, the lake of gods.</p>

              <p>Akan-ko is famous for its marimo (Caldophora aegagropila), a round ball of algae which is both biologically interesting and very very kawaii (cute). It can take as long as 200 years for them to grow as big as a baseball. Our visit to Lake Akan was because of the fuzzy ball Lady SevenEleven was interested in.</p>

              <p><strong>Caption : Lake Akan in the morning</strong></p>
              <p>Only growing in a few place in the world, marimo became endangered. After being designated a national treasure, everyone in Japan wanted one. The building of power plant did not help the plight of these green fuzzballs.</p>

              <p>Finally the Ainu came to its rescue by starting the Marimo Matsuri festival, the return of the marimo to Lake Akan in mid October. Although Lady SevenEleven would wanted one, I did not encourage her to buy one.</p>

              <p><span><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-0">The Ainu look upon the little horned owl as a demon who really desires to harm mankind, and they naturally consider him to be a bird of evil omen.</span> He is also said to be able to tell a good man from a bad one at sight. When caught, the people say that he will not look at a person if that person be of a bad disposition, but will keep his eyes merely closed, just peering through the slits between the lids. This act is called <em>ainu eshpa, </em>i.e., "man-ignoring." If the person before whom the bird is brought be of a good character, he will stare at him open-eyed. This act is called <em>ainu oro wande, </em>i.e., "searching out the man".......so beware <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></span></p>

              <p>Kushiro is the paradise for bird watching, the famous Tancho or the Japanese Red crowned crane during the winter. Unfortunately there was to be no sight of these crane dancing on the snow covered land for us. Nevertheless, "Kiroy was here!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>

              <p>During our drive here, for the first time the GPS didn't seems to "work". It directed us to drive into the forest for a good 25 minutes where the roads were forest path, up the mountain and loose rocks. For that 25 minutes, wild thought when through us. (but we didn't mentioned to each other). If the vehicle were to break down, we will be right in the middle of the forest. I could sense that uneasiness in Mrs SevenEleven but I decided to give the GPS the trust. I only got lectured when we came out of the forest. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>While driving to Kushiro Royal Inn, we saw from a distance a gigantic statue of Guan Yin. We decided to go there for a look but didn't know which road to turn. So we stopped at a convenience store to ask for direction. The staff seems surprised but did gave us the direction. I was surprised by their reaction until I got to the destination. We have drove into a very quite and serene cemetry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I lived in the era where parents would shout at their kids; "stop watching Bee Kee Mao on TV" and Mickey was but a matchstick ink blot black and white cartoon character. Disneyland was every childhood dreams but a very distant dream to many. So, in the name of fulfilling Lady SevenEleven's dream, I too get to fulfil mine today <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">.</p>

              <p>There is this "one day" iternary to Mt Fuji circulating around. Don't believe them unless you mean a touch and go type. We spent 1/2 a day walking round only 1/2 of Lake Kawaguchi until Lady SevenEleven complained about all the walking. Although relaxing, there was simply too big an area to cover. So we decided to rent a car to go round the next day. </p>

              <p>How can I not go up Mt. Fuji? My ego won't let me off. So we decided to drive up to Mt. Fuji 5th station, the starting point of a climb up Mt. Fuji for many. Like all other typical Japanese going up the sacred Fuji-san, we decided to pay homage at the Asama shinto shrine before going up too. Asama Shrine centered around the worship of volcanos, in particular to Mt. Fuji.</p>

              <p>The cloud simply won't go away, so we could neither see Mt. Fuji clearly from afar nor could we see the summit of Mt. Fuji so near it. Leaving Mrs SevenEleven and Lady SevenEleven shopping at the 5th station, I attempt to climb abit higher. I could only attempt to the 6th station and more but with them waiting down at the 5th station, I could not go far but to turn back.</p>

Spiritualists say that the trees themselves are filled with a malevolent energy, accumulated from centuries of suicides. They don't want you to go back out.</span></strong></p>

A dense, dark forest bordering Mt. Fuji, Aokigahara is infamous throughout Japan as a popular spot for those taking their final journey.In 2002, 78 bodies were found within it, replacing the previous record of 73 in 1998. By May of 2006, at least 16 new suicides had already been found. More than a few of them were even carrying copies of Tsurumui's book. No one knows how many bodies go undiscovered.</p>
              <p>Here's what I found on the internet. "NOT FOR THE WEAK HEARTED!!!"</p>

              <p>Finally!!! I got leaves for 2 days to myself.  Instead of spending time shopping in Tokyo, I took my backpack and went off to Hakone alone. Hakone is a mountainous area to the west of Tokyo and is reputated for a 1 day tour for the busy. I chose to do that in 2 days. ALONE!!! Not that they are a baggage but I often like to spend time alone.Hakone boasted for its 7 different mode of transport, the red colour leaves in autumn and an opportunity to see Mt Fuji yet again. </p>

              <p>One of the most popular poster of Mt Fuji should be this Torri in Lake Ashino with the snow capped Mt Fuji in its background. Unfortunately after 4 days, the evasive Mt Fuji still refuse to show herself. The famous Mt. Fuji's reflection on its waters is well-known as "Sakasa Fuji (upside-down Fuji)" which continues to mesmerize a countless number of tourists and photographers never materlise for me.</p>

              <p>I was introduced to this little temple near our hostel by the lady in-charged of the hostel if I was looking for peace and quiteness. So I headed straight for this temple first thing in the morning. There was this beautiful garden with water features and a hill with lot of these stone Jizo.</p>

              <p><strong>Caption : Jizo Bodhisattva</strong></p>
              <p>Jizo Bodhisattva is a much beloved figure in Japan, Korea, and China, who is just becoming increasingly well known. Jizo is a special protector of children, travelers, and women. Jizo is also known to help those who are working with a life problem or physical affliction, these bodhisattva who plunges fearlessly into any place or situation to help those in need. For anyone who has lost a child, Jizo is a powerful image of hope and solace. Jizo's qualities include unflagging optimism, fearlessness, and gentleness.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/1299/p1020802.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Others believed that these Jizo are those unborn child that had passed on without a name to them, thus without a tomb. I had realised by now that beside almost every Buddhist temple is a cemetry. These Jizo with the overgrown grasses beside the cemetry and sometime with knitted hat can also look spooky too.</p>

They are called "Mitsuishi," or three rocks, and are the symbolic features of Cape Manazuru.</p>

              <p>This shrine is a little spooky when the sky turned dark. Furthermore, this station becomes very quiet in the night when there is no passenger at the station. I decided to stop at this station at night because I wanted to show Lady SevenEleven the picture of this station at night.</p>

              <p>I have always being interested in the Japanese Zen school of meditation, the ZaZen thus the trip here, the No. 1 Zen temple. Once you step into the Kenchoji Temple, the immediate difference between here and the Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shinto Shrine, is the serene and peaceful surrounding. It is less crowded (maybe because of the enterance fee <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) and the garden are very neat and orderly. This temple is a protected site because the whole temple are constructed from timberwood.</p>

              <p>A little history of this Kenchoji Temple. Kenchoji is the number one of Kamakura's five great Zen temples. The oldest Zen temple in Kamakura, Kenchoji was founded by the ruling regent Hojo Tokiyori in the year 1253 during the Kencho Era after which it was named. Its first head priest was Rankei Doryu, a Zen priest from China. Although considerably smaller than during its heydays, Kenchoji still consists of a large number of temple buildings and subtemples, and stretches from the entrance gate at the bottom of the valley far into the forested hills behind.</p>

              <p><strong>Caption : A Zen garden designed by Zen Master Muso Kokushi</strong></p>
              <p>One of the outstanding theme of a Zen temple would be its garden. These garden gardens can be extremely abstract and represent (miniature) landscapes also called "mind-scapes". This Buddhist preferred way to express cosmic beauty in worldly environments is inextricable from Zen Buddhism.</p>
