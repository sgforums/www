              <p> <strong>Caption : Ainu Village (çˆ±å¥´æ—�éƒ¨è�½) - Shiraoi - Noboribetsu</strong></p>
              <p>A little history lesson on Hakkaido! The Ainu, is believed to be the indigenous people of Hokkaido. When they first settled in Hokkaido, they called it Ainu Moshiri: meaning "human world". They were known to have very little contact with the outside world until the Edo period (1600-1868) when the Matsumae clan established a foothold in the South West region of Hokkaido (Hakodate).</p>

              <p><strong>Caption : Poroto Kotan meaning "Village by a large Lake" is where the Ainu Village culture museum is located</strong></p>
              <p>By the time the Meiji restoration began in 1868, the Ainu culture were under attacked. Many Ainu customs such as tattoos on women and wearing of earrings by men were prohibited. Mainland Japanese migrated northward and by the end of the Meiji period, the Ainu had become a de-facto second class citizens. By the 1998, signification protection of the Ainu were written into law and the Ainu had won recognisation as an important part of the Japanese cultural heritage.</p>

              <p>Lady SevenEleven wanted to know more about the history and culture of the Ainu tribes, that was why the trip to the Ainu Village and Culture Museum. Over there, we were treated to songs and dances of the Ainu people. I read from someone blogs that when some Singaporean tourists were invited to participate and sing for the the audience, guess what they sang?

              <p><strong>Caption : Furano (å¯Œè‰¯é‡Žï¼‰Furano Youth Hostel, a wooden house completely built by the owner</strong></p>
              <p>We had intended to visit Shikotsu-ko or Lake Shikotsu which was the sister lake to Toya-ko. However I decided to forgo this place as the programme for the day was a 4 hours trek to Monbetsu-dake and I have found some reservation with Mrs SevenEleven. There is still Asahi-dake at Daisetsuzan National Park which I didn't want them to miss if they got to exhausted by the trek. So by an unanimious vote, we gave up visiting Shikotsu-ko for Furano.</p>

              <p>Furano also humourously known as Heso-no-machi or "Bellybutton town" because of its famous bellybutton festival. It is a dance featuring the bellybutton being painted with colourful faces. However the town is more well known for its lavendar flowers and the Furano rockmelons. Unfortunately, the time to see lavendar is up to July so we missed that too.</p>

              <p>The advantages of staying in æ°‘å®¿ (min shu) is that you get to eat what they eat as our stay includes 2 meals. Since this hostel was among the hills with her own farmland, the vegetables were taken directly from the farm and very organic. Staying in æ°‘å®¿, we have to abide by their rules, such as the schedule for breakfast and dinner. However the owners were kind and friendly and will always give a little more convenience and leeway to a foreign guest. We could also get to mix with the guests, sharing our adventures or getting informations and helps on the next destinations.</p>

              <p>We were wondering why there were so many smokes across the farms and found out the next day while driving past the farm, that the farmers were burning the dried up crops as fertilisers for their next planting.</p>

              <p>At Farm Tomita, we didn't get to see any lavendar as there are all on sapling in the glasshouse. Farm Tomita is also a laboratory where the harvested lavendars were made in various products such as lavender essence, lavender potpurri and even lavendar flavoured ice-cream too!</p>

              <p>Biei (ç¾Žç‘›), is only about 28 km from Furano and Biei Potato-no-Oka Youth Hostel was my 2nd choice hostel (slightly more expensive than Furano Youth Hostel) in Furano. However much is heard of this hostel that we decided to drive there to see for ourselves. The youth hostel is located among the potato farm and is pretty remote but offers the quiet and peaceful countryside lifestyle. I would definitely love to put up this place too.</p>

              <p>Although we could head straight to Daisetsuzan National Park (å¤§é›ªå±±å›½ç«‹å…¬å›­) from Biei, we decided to give ourselves a day break (from the extra day spared from Shikotsu-ko) before heading on to Asahi-dake, the 2,290 metres high mountain. Asahikawa (æ—­å·�) is usually the transit point to Wakkanai to the north, Beii and Furano to the South and Daisetsuzan National Park to the Southeast because of the convenience of its domestic airport.</p>

One of the most popular advertisment from the zoo is the circular concave glass viewing panel where you get to see the penguin enlarged and and really closed-up.</p>

              <p>A morning stop at a public park before Daisetsuzan National Park. This park was so quiet we thought it was a private owned garden. All the public toilets that we stopped for, no matter how remote the place was, were always spick and span. One of the reasons was the ability to let their people feels ownership to their land.</p>

              <p>We soon arrived at the Daisetsuzan Shirakaba-So Youth Hostel at the foot of Mt Asahidake. This picture was taken from the observation post at the top of the hostel. Many would opted for a stay away from the mountain but we chose here instead, to be closed to nature. The room rate were even more expensive (for a youth hostel) than Dai-ichi takimoto kan in Noboribetsu but we loved their cooking, the personal service and an outdoor onsen too!</p>

              <p>By this time, we had come across so many "Beware of Bears" warning signs that it was already imprinted in Mrs SevenEleven and Lady SevenEleven mind. So when they saw the warning sign here again, they were dead adamant and bought themselves a $12 BEAR BELLS! I only laughed it off but it did make a nice souvenier.</p>

              <p>Asahi-dake is an active volcano that may erupt anytime. The valley was created when Asahi-dake erupted and the lava flows out forming this valley some 600 years ago. </p>

              <p>This would have been a perfect picture of Asahi-date with its mirror reflection on the lake, but unfortunately the clouds refused to give the permission for that perfect picture. Upon completion of this 5th viewing platform, it's time to ring the bell to graduate from the circuit and returned to the ropeway station.</p>

              <p><strong>Caption : A rough start to the summit - Asahi-dake</strong></p>
              <p>5th viewing platform was their last circuit but was my start to the attempt for the summit. Although the guide had advised against attempting the summit as I was not dressed in treking gears, my ego did not stop me from the attempt. I promised myself that I will not attempt to the summit but to see how far I can go.</p>

              <p>After some struggle and hard work,I was at about 1950 metres and guess who I met? Yes, Japan's Defence Force soldiers descending from the mountain.  We had a short exchange of words and I was told they were trekking from the Daisetsuzan Grand Transverse and was ending their exercise soon. They too advised me against going up as there seems to be a storm cooking up.</p>

              <p>With only a pair of jeans, I'll defenceless against the snow on the mountain. I was only 1.6 km or 1 hour 30 minutes away from the summit but had to turn back.</p>

              <p>45 minutes drive away from Daisetsuzan Shirakaba-So Youth Hostel is this place more popularly known as Tenninkyo Onsen. It is popular among the Japanese and onsen lovers for the outdoor onsen with beautiful scenery. The majestic vertical rocks canyon along the river look awesome.</p>

              <p>Near the entrance of the footpath stood this little shinto shrine. I have a special feeling for these little shrine as compared to the larger shrine such as the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. These little hut on the quiet hill with trees surrounding it and steps leading to it gives me a feeling of peace and security knowing these "little guardian god" is watching over you and the mountain. </p>

              <p>Hagoroma is a femenine waterfall. Lady SevenEleven gave me a lesson on differentiating the difference between the male and female waterfall. Tenninkyo waterfall is a 270m gentle flowing waterfall leading to the Chubetsu River.</p>

              <p><strong>Caption : Chubetsu River - Teninkyo Gorge</strong></p>
              <p>Tenninkyo waterfall was discovered during the Meiji period 34th year and declared a scenic spot in year 1918. It is a husband and wife waterfall, as such there is yet another Shikishima-no-taki, a masculine waterfall some 1 hour 30 minutes away on foot from Hagoromo-no-taki. But due to time constraint and the path being blocked by landslide, we were unable to witness the majestic Shikishima waterfall.</p>
