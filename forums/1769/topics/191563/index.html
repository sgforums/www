            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not a person that gets angry very easily but... just now got REALLY SO ANGRY until I could feel myself shaking.<br><br>What happened was my friend made a joke about 'complaining' to someone's boss basically. It was obviously a joke, relations between my friend and tt person were not so strained until it becomes a real threat.<br><br>But that person simply overreacted and started saying that she hates people like this.. and what got me really pissed.. was she said "I can SLAP people like this"<br><br>I dont know why but moment I heard this threat of physical violence I started. Then she repeated what she said again and I blew my top. i confronted her and told her she is too much to say something like this and she just kept repeating it. Other friends stepped in and I walked out to stop the matter from escalating.<br><br>Really cannot stand it when people make threats. I hate it. I hate anyone who thinks they can threaten me and get away with it. Although this time it didnt happen to me, and friends say its just out of control speech cos of anger i really dont think anger is an excuse to threaten people, especially with physical violence.<br><br>So angry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

I had a boss that very smart one.. if YOU make the mistake than YOU will be frequently used to scold YOU. but if he made the mistake.. he will suddenly start using reported objective speech "A mistake had been made"... then no attribute to anyone..... then we know its HIM lah.
