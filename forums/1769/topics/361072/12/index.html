              <p>No surprise there. Soon enough, these people who make stupid decisions for the public, will suffer themselves. Have you seen the roads? It's becoming Thailand, except less organized. Seriously, less organized. I've seen better drivers in the packed highways of Bangkok, and cars are moving smoothly, even though it's packed.</p>

              <p>No surprise there. Soon enough, these people who make stupid decisions for the public, will suffer themselves. Have you seen the roads? It's becoming Thailand, except less organized. Seriously, less organized. I've seen better drivers in the packed highways of Bangkok, and cars are moving smoothly, even though it's packed.</p>
