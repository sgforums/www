              <p>Looks like the motorbike kena run over and dragged by a lorry......its bumper was hanging by a screw.</p>
              <p>But then again, seriously some bikers are asking for it. There was a cuckoo who did a illegal U-turn right in front of a 60km/h SBS buses which zham brake to no avail. There was an almighty bang and the rider flew off and was knocked unconscious. The bike went under the bus.....so in a way, maybe it was fortunate the guy was knocked off the bike, instead of holding onto his bike and risk going under the tyres.</p>

              <p><br> In my NS days, a junior was killed in a motorbike
              accident....apparently he had hit a lorry which was turning out
              into the road, at around 80km/h and the story went that his friends
              rushed to the scene (he had only just left them a moment ago when
              they heard a bang), only to find half his head sheared off by the
              edge of the lorry.</p>

              <p>i give you more drama</p>
              <p>my classmate (who was riding) hit the road divider, flew to the opposite road, hit the taxi travelling there, flew over the taxi and got smashed by a heavy truck behind it.</p>
              <p>my previous workplace? every 2 years 1 death, car wrap round the tree, head hit the washing machine... etc etc</p>
              <p>once 2009 passes it will be over 2 years.</p>
              <p>i'm not a undertaker / policeman / hospital worker but that is quite a fair bit of deaths to see for another vocation.</p>
              <p>road accidents / deaths? seen enough to not even feel affected.</p>

              <p>I cannot mentioned who or who yet.</p>
              <p>But I've seen empty pretty single mooncake boxes at someone's home.</p>
              <p>Boxes probably collected from last year or previous years.</p>
              <p>Then hor.....I see the same boxes with mooncakes just recently from the same people.</p>
              <p>Strongly suspect that the mooncakes was purchased in malaysia.  Bring back to Singapore, repackaged into the pretty boxes and given away to friends, clients and whatever.</p>
              <p>I merely just bought a box of mooncake in malaysia in its own packaging and give to people.  Rm12.90 for a mooncake with ginseng and green bean filling.</p>
