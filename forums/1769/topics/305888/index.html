              <p>I am getting more and more excited!  My very first niece is due to be born in late March and I'm heading back to Singapore and will touchdown on 1 April.  I'm thinking of buying a few unique baby gifts from Australia but am not sure if the stuff I'm looking at are actually available back home.  I want to travel light and don't exactly want to lug stuff around if the same brand is available in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Sooo... I'm appealing to the moms and dads here, or to those who have recently been out scouting for gifts for the babies of friends / relatives to please give me their honest opinion about the next few selected gifts on my list.  I'm not necessarily buying ALL of them, but it's a bit hard to make up my mind!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">    </p>

              <p>I would forgo all else but the swing. That swing is a lifesaver for mothers everywhere. Babies just love the comforting sensation. JMHO.</p>
              <p>Soothers are a personal preference. Many people don't believe in using them. My own daughter was so dependent on this crutch, it affected her bite and pronounciation.</p>
              <p>Bibs are a great idea. My two kids always had one on them. My collection back then was quite fierce. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Oh  yeah!  That page with the soothers is so colourful!  I had to laugh too cause one of the soothers looked like a UFO, another two were so boldly coloured that it'll look kinda amusing on the baby's face when in use, and some are so cute, you just want to keep them for display!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>In my time, just PIAK!  Nah!!  One boring, solid-coloured pacifier.  Don't talk about the colour... even the shape of the teat also very unimaginative!  Look at the variety these days!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Machiam got stylo-mylo teats, techno saavy teats, calm and peaceable teats or bold and vibrant teats!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And with the silicone teats, I wonder if baby doesn't wonder how come mummy's texture not as good?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The stroller is nice, but I had three. (Back when there were no three in one combos.) The first one was a heavy duty one, good for taking baby out on long walks while I got my exercise. This is great for when baby is young and cannot sit up just yet.The next one was a fixed umbrella stroller. Fixed meaning, fixed back rest, no adjustable settings. Very light, very easy to fold/unfold, great for heading down to the shops for a quick errand. Remember to buy a netted basket to attach to the back of this stroller so your sis-in-law can free both hands up to push the stroller. These sell for as little at S$10, great for when baby is a little older and able to sit up. The third one is a nice blend of the above two. Light enough to maneuvre while shopping, has a 3-position (or more) adjustable back so baby can sit up (on the upright position) and see the world or sleep (3-position). Chicco (Italian brand) makes a really durable one. Pai seh to tell you that I still have mine stash in Mum's house in Sg. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> This Chicco one I had also had an adjustable shade to protect baby's tender skin. Chiccos aren't cheap though but they last a heck of a long time.</p>
              <p>What I found most useful was a plastic sheet (Toys R Us) which you can drape over the entire stroller on wet days. Baby stays dry and can see the world at the same time.</p>
              <p>As for the baby swing, get one that has a long battery life, with many features like adjustable speeds, etc.</p>
              <p>You might also want to think about getting a bouncer. This is great for young babies who can't sit up yet. It allows them to see the world. My kids loved it.Get the one with the mesh fabric. Not only is it cooler for baby and breathable, but when baby spits up, it's easier to clean.</p>
              <p> And one more thing, if your sis-in-law decides to go the pacifier route, get a pacifier tether. Head for Robinsons, they have a nice range of stuff. The tether is great for making sure the pacifier doesn't land on the dirty floor when baby spits it out. Don't get the one that uses a safety pin to attach to baby's shirt. Get the clip variety.</p>

              <p>I think I'll get the stroller, don't care if they are already buying one, because you will need more than one, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">     I kinda like the swings too... think they can bounce in it, if I'm not wrong. </p>
