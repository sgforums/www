While it's nice that they don't shed, I don't enjoy spending on grooming. Here you have to tip so the grooming bill can come to $60, depending on the base price. Since I'm still new to this neighbourhood, I'm still shopping around for a reasonably priced groomer.<br><br>The little dogs tend to be yappy. Kimo (younger of the two) tends to bark at anything and everything. Sometimes I just want to yank out his vocal cords. Such a high pitched bark, hurts the ears! Good thing I have nice neighbour who are not home most of the day and when they are, are very tolerant. I tend to shush the dogs anyway. I don't have grass in my small patio and my two are used to going on the grass so several times a day we each have to take them outside to poop and pee. Gets tiring man.</div>
