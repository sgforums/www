We only had 3 months which really was only a month planning for us coz I had a biz trip and was busy<br>Heck I flew back like a day before my wedding  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>But everything was indoors for mine so it's ok<br>Only sad thing was my best friend didn't come for my wedding coz she was seriously ill <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div></blockquote>I don't know how you could do that in 3 months.  I supposed we chose to do the wedding formally.  Also in Oz, the reception venue got booked fairly quickly so you need to book it at least a year in advance especially you want it on weekend and the Spring season.<br><br>Anyway, the reception venue is the first thing we booked and then the car.  I didn't have any maid of honour (or bridesmaid) but only a flower girl so 1 car is enough to transport me, my parents and my niece (flower girl) to the reception venue.  That save some money.  We picked a Rolls Royce because I wanted to spoil my parents with the experience of being in a Rolls Royce.<br><br>After we got the 2 things out of the way, it left us plenty of time to do the rest like the guest lists, wedding dress, cakes, invitation cards (I did it myself), order of service (I did it myself), etc....<br><br>Then we bought a house about 4 months before the wedding and that was the most stressful time as we decided to do some renovations (got someone to do it ofcourse) and I only managed to move into the house 2 weeks before the wedding and my family arrived a week before the wedding.  Phew....  so it's not a good idea to renovate your house before the wedding!!!  Can be very stressful!!!<br></div>
