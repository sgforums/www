              <p>How old are you???  I don't think you are even 30 yet, right?????  Please stop worrying so much, my friend! Not going to do you any good.</p>
              <p>What business are you running at the moment?  You might be right about stepping back a little bit from what you're doing and reassess what would work for you.  While I understand it's not easy being an employee, we sometimes have to be realistic about it.  It might be worth working for a few more years for people to collect all the ideas, experiences etc before we start running our own business.</p>
              <p>Also, try not to put too much pressure on yourself about what you can do for your parents.  Your parents love you regardless.  I think you will hurt them more if they see you are stressed and unhappy.</p>
              <p>Look after yourself, my friend!!!!</p>

              <p>Hunnymousey is right... sometimes, you do have to work as an employee for a few years before stepping out on your own.  Well, at least that's the path that most successful entrepreneurs have taken. </p>
              <p>And, Fatum, you do seem to be stressing yourself out too much.  You want to achieve so many things by a certain age, reminding me of how I used to think too.  But I've since learnt that you can have the best-laid plans in the world, but all the planning you do doesn't take into account the foul balls that life throws at us sometimes. </p>
              <p>Things seldom happen uneventfully and we just have to learn to endure.  You might plan the best route to take to reach your destination, but along the way, there might be shortcuts that do not appear on the mapped route that you can choose to take, but there might also be massive traffic jams that are unexpected.  It's sometimes not feasible to slap a time limit on certain events, simply because there will be too many variables encountered along the way.  </p>
              <p>It's tough but keep reminding yourself that it's the journey that really matters.</p>

              <p>trying to keep to a strict schedule sleeping and if possible, avoid working very late only trying compensating the sleep in the day. I have alway find solace in meditation and try reading a book "How to stop worrying and start living". It helps me in a certain way . It doesn't solve your work problems but gives you a better perspective in your problems.</p>

              <p>The thing is, he will never be the same again.  He is suffering from a really serious condition that is adversely affecting the brain.  Even if he 'recovers', he will definitely have mental deficits that will affect him very badly.  He might even lose the ability to move about on his own.  In the worst case scenario, he'll be a complete 'vegetable'.</p>
