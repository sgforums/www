              <p>You summed it up well.  And it's true... sadly, there's no
              other way for Singapore.  The minute the costs of conducting
              business here go up, watch how fast the regional HQ's will uproot
              themselves from here and move elsewhere. </p>
              <p>I know everyone's talking about China and India but consider
              Korea.  I see more and more Koreans coming over here to study
              / work and quite a few of them are getting good at their grasp of
              the English language.  Once they have a sizeable young working
              population who is Westernised and fluent in English, they will
              become a force to be reckoned with.  Labour costs and
              infrastructural costs are low there (biangz... cheapest broadband
              in the world, I think!), and they are innovative and constantly
              upgrading and using 'the latest' gadgets, and they are populous
              plus their work culture is quite like the Japanese, work till they
              almost drop dead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>
              <p>You heard it here first... Korea will rise in stature in the
              years to come.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I've made a few Korean friends over here, and they are nothing like what the dramas depict, and not quite what the Lonely Planet guidebooks tell you to expect either. </p>
              <p>I think they know that they are on foreign soil, so they have learnt to adapt to the culture here in order to live in harmony with everyone else. </p>
              <p>These people, if they do return to their homeground, will bring their newfound behaviour and perspectives back with them.  And if you have a young populace who's into Western trends like Singapore is, who's to say that their culture will not change?</p>
              <p>Even traditional homogeneous Japan has changed somewhat due to its  young warming up to Western ideas and lifestyles. </p>

              <p>I use the word FT interchangeably, cos the goverment seems to use it interchangeably too .... of course, there's a world of difference between the two ....</p>
              <p>once upon a time, we'd have thai workers to build our homes, and banglas to sweep our streets, we still do, but compare the social impact these two groups have on our society ... other than a few drunken fights at golden mile, and a few molest cases from the banglas, the impact on our society is minimal ...</p>
              <p>on the other hand ... when we start importing other countries' "peasants", we are radically altering our social landscape .... in much bigger countries like oz, canada, the US etc, they have a heartland belt which serves as repositories of their society's cultures and values .... the bush in oz, the prairies in canada, the midwest in the US ..... in Singapore, the newcomers go straight into the heartlands .... bringing with them values not always compatible with ours ....</p>
              <p>as for "FTs" .... it's as what I've written in the post about our birth incentives ...</p>

              <p>My plan is the exact opposite of yours!  Live and work here and save / invest as much as I can and then when I'm ready to retire, hopefully can amass enough wealth to live comfortably back home and travel frequently back to Melbourne when I kena too pissed with Singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Not that drama that is over the top la</p>
              <p>But some scenes are really funny lor I always think what the actor or actress is thinking while acting out the scene.</p>
              <p>It's usually relaxing. I tend to buy the  less serious titles. The serious titles are extremely intense and storywise I think better than Hollywood.</p>
