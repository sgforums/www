              <p>Agreed. I did ask the question on birth control when I was taking classes in history( or some other subjects cant remember haha) and my teacher did not have a clear answer to my question. When u have too much ppl in the population, government will try to control birth rates ( e.g developing countries like india and china) by introducing laws and educate the public. But when they find that the number of working class is not able to support the economy, the government will change their policy and encourage to increase more birth rates....Look at our country and u will understand what I mean( compare the 80s and now). And sometimes, there is so much the government can do.....</p>
