            <div class='col-md body'>I was just wondering ... You know how important it is to almost all of us that our significant other share the same values, moral standards, interests, etc?  Needless to say, there could be differences in other areas but I guess when it comes to the crunch, things like those mentioned above are very important and perhaps, not to be compromised.<br><br>However, how important is it to be compatible in other areas like Sociability (ie. Introversion vs Extroversion), how athletic and active one is, whether one likes to stay home or languish outdoors... factors like these.<br><br>Is it possible, for instance, for a social butterfly and a very active person to actually fall for and love a quiet introvert who loves to stay home and doesn't like to exercise much?  Do you think relationships with such differences will work in the long run?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It really depends. Sometimes opposites attract and other times you rather flock with the same bird.<br><br>However, I think the key is sharing the same values, moral standards, goals and most importantly how money is spent. Interests can differ. They make life more interesting anyway when you try each other hobbies/interests.<br><br>Respect each other for being the unique individual they are is important too. I mean that was why you fell in love with him/her right so why try to change them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> (unless it's vices like chain smoking, drinking like a whale &amp; gambling the house away)</div>

Almost unsociable <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>We do do things together and shared common values in most things.
