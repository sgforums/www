You know how important it is to almost all of us that our significant other share the same values, moral standards, interests, etc?  Needless to say, there could be differences in other areas but I guess when it comes to the crunch, things like those mentioned above are very important and perhaps, not to be compromised.<br><br>However, how important is it to be compatible in other areas like Sociability (ie. Introversion vs Extroversion), how athletic and active one is, whether one likes to stay home or languish outdoors... factors like these.<br><br>Is it possible, for instance, for a social butterfly and a very active person to actually fall for and love a quiet introvert who loves to stay home and doesn't like to exercise much?  Do you think relationships with such differences will work in the long run?  </div></blockquote>People are funny. I'm sure if you were to take a survey on the streets you'll find that there are many interesting couple combinations.</div>
