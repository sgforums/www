              <p>Yup!  That's the problem!!  Too much fabric at the waist and tummy, making one look much larger in that area than one really is!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  As if I don't look big enough already!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p><br>Hahah    it's difficult for maternity pants to be comfy 100% over 9 months because our bodies change all the time, what can be worn back then cannot be worn later.  The only solution is to wear fully elasticised pants LOL   I have a pair of shorts and long pants that work, they are both of cotton-spandex, fully stretchable and loose fitting.</p>

              straight to the guys section to look for the parka. the store lady
              says the cha-bors parka over the other side (i felt better).
              Then i ask the question, "got my size?"  She paused a while
              and she went : "huh...oh...oohh....hmm...how about these (pointing
              at the $209 really nice guys parka), they are suitable for u...i

              <p>Lets see...</p>
              <p>I've 6 pairs of jeans; namely 2 Levi's, 1 CK, 1 Zara, 1 J brand and 1 Cheap Monday <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> My latest addition being J Brand and Cheap Monday which are cult brands, and yes, I'm in love with cult brands out of sudden <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>For now, I'm going to boycott Levi's jeans; Levi's somehow doesn't fit us asians too well. And besides! Everyone's wearing it! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Try going to the Victoria Markets. The Last time we were there, we also went to Bridge street, there are two shops there that have pretty decent leather jackets for reasonable money. One is at the start of the street and one at the end.</p>
