              <p>Well, when I was a pre-teen, she used to say it wasn't. 
                  Funny you asked, think you must have an inkling as to how my mom
                  was like and how my childhood was like, as a direct result of her
                  idiosyncracies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>However, when I became a teen, she herself started wearing
                  pants, so it became 'alright', although I loved to wear skirts and
                  never really wore pants till much later. </p>
              <p>I'm glad I now live far away from her - even at this distance,
                  whenever I call her, she still tries to impose her ideas on
                  me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>don't parents always try to impose their ideas and views? Mine still try and I have been living away from them for the last 14 years. How about that?</p>
              <p>Maybe pants are "allright" because they seem more formal? Skirts (barring the mini) are considered formal "proper" attire for people in your mum's generation.</p>

              <p>you should really go to the victoria markets and try and score yourself a leather jacket now... really you should have bought in summer as that is when prices are cheapest. My wife bought a really nice one from there a couple of years ago and only paid $99 for a calfskin jacket, very soft genuine leather.  For trench coats try ebay, some bargains there and if you are brave enough, ebay america have lots of stuff as they would be coming out of winter now.</p>

              <p>Thing is, in Summer, the shops I went to were all displaying Summer stuff.  It's alright though... K-Mart and Target have their sales quite frequently.  The 'famous' warehouse sales in the shops along Bridge Road no longer exist.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Within the short space of a year, I've seen so many changes to the stretch.  There used to be really fantastic discounts but now, it no longer seems to be the case anymore.  Ain't that sad?</p>

              <p>Well, it's true, sadly.  You can still get bargains, but good bargains much harder to come by, compared to say, a year ago, when REAL bargains could be had.  I realised this when last Winter, I thought I'd go grab a few more winter jackets at good prices because that was what I did during my first Winter here.  But I realised that there weren't as many bargains compared to my first Winter here.  Sad, isn't it? </p>
              <p>During a recent 'Sale' in a shop, I got myself a nice handbag for just A$39.  I think that was after a 35% discount.  Sounds great, right?  Except for the fact that the bag, back in SG, would probably only have cost me S$35, at the most.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Yes, it was a sale, but the bag was not really worth that much, even after the discount.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  So, that's what's happening here.  You get sales, but even the after-sales prices don't really justify what you're getting for that price.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as for Target's upcoming sale, I might have to give that a miss simply because I have to panic-save for my trip back home!  I'm so ill-prepared this time round, it ain't funny!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p><br>You have the same problem as I do <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>
              <p>My new pair of jeans I have this problem</p>
              <p>I got it altered and it fits at the waist, BUT, my jeans have too much cloth in front of the tummy and it is obviously ill-fitting.</p>
              <p>I'll stick to my pants and capris and khakis &gt;&lt;</p>
