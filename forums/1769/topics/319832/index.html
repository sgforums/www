              <p>I finally decided to get myself a printer, esp since I have started my course.  I've long eyed the Epson RX690, as the reviews I've read seem to recommend this product.</p>
              <p>I carefully scrutinised the Epson Shop Online website, and came
              across products categorised under "Factory Seconds" and I read the
              following :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em> From time to time some units are returned to us for the following
              reasons :- Slight <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cosmetic damage</span> to the unit. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The unit was refused
              delivery</span>. The unit is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no longer a current model</span>. Or the unit was "Dead
              on Arrival" and subsequently has been r<span style="text-decoration: underline;">epaired and fully tested back to
              manufacturer's specifications</span>.</em></p>
              <p><em>These
              units are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">substantially unused, except for checking and quality
              verification by Epson's own service department to ensure they perform
              properly</span>. A new set of ink cartridges have been installed in the unit
              for testing purposes, should the ink levels in a cartridge be below
              75%, then an additional new cartridge will be included in the box.</em></p>
              <p><em>Due to the fantastic price reductions offered on Factory Seconds, stock
              volumes move quickly and Factory Second products are only offered on a
              "while stocks last" basis. The standard Epson product warranty for
              Factory Second products is reduced to six (6) months from Epson's
              invoice date.</em></p>
              <p><em>Epson's normal terms and conditions of sale apply to Factory Seconds orders.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, considering that a factory second costs AUD184.30 as opposed to its usual price of AUD349.00, it's a whopping 47% discount!</p>
              <p>I'm just wondering, would you purchase a Factory Second?</p>

              <p>You don't get to choose.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>I actually placed an order on Saturday, received delivery today about an hour and a half ago.  I was happily opening up the box and following the instructions in the StartUp leaflet and then, when I pressed the Power button to turn it on, it said, Printer Error, please turn it off and restart again.</p>
              <p>Which I did, again and again...</p>
              <p>So I finally called up the Service line, satisfied that it wasn't something bimbo-tic like me having forgotten to remove some tape or press some button or something...</p>
              <p>I think it was something about the robotic way the Aussie bloke answered my call, cause I ended up becoming extremely irritated.  I know he tried to be 'officially polite', but he did say things that were kinda... condescending... you know, this undercurrent of "not another silly Asian" thing. </p>
              <p>AAAaaaarrrrgggghhhhh!!!</p>
              <p>Anyways, I did get a surprise call back from a very sweet female staff who offered to ship a replacement printer tomorrow and have someone pick up the faulty one back.  She had a really sweet manner in the way she handled the call and I thanked her more than once.  I could've purred for her!  Hehehe! </p>
              <p>I'm going to write to Epson to compliment her because she did a great job. </p>
              <p>But hmm...I think I'd better wait till I actually get the delivery because quite a few Aussie service people will smile make you lots of sweet promises but then you realise a few days later... all empty promises only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Actually, my Singaporean friend who's just arrived here said the same thing about the customer service people here - they typically sweetly offer to rectify things for you "tomorrow" but you'll end up calling them again and again for quite a few "tomorrow"s until maybe fifteen tomorrows later, you FINALLY get things done.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I did think about the reduced warranty too.  But heck, with new printers, it's a 12-month warranty.  With factory seconds, it's a 6-month warranty, but at almost half price.  I told myself, if it worked beyond six months, fantastic!  But if it kaputs by then, oh well, consider it "printer rental" at AUD38 a month, and then go get another spanking new one!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
