Not about to give up my pension plans and so-called free medicals.  But looking for "winter" homes ley.  Want to escape winter so must find alternate location.<br><br>The "snow birds" (usually seniors) used to "migrate" to Florida but with hurricanes and high crime rate, they throttled to Phoenix, Arizona.  Got a relative there but it is so hot there.  Each time I see him, he more "chow tar" (burnt).<br><br>While Vancouver has mild winter, but it rained ALOT!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Hi Littlestream,<br><br>I have close friends (mostly Japanese) who are living in Thailand now, some retired, some still working.  Mostly in the Bangkok area or its outskirts.  Haven't heard a squeak of regret from any of them.  None of them have officially migrated - and I think they don't intend to (no added benefits in doing so).<br><br>As for me, I've always liked Southeast Asia because of the informal culture (most of it anyway).  I mean I could wear a business suit....or I could wear flip-flops and shorts and sit with one leg up while I eat and no one would even look twice.  Not that I've done it before, but you get what I mean.<br><br>Ever considered any other place in Thailand?  Phuket is a nice place....the eastern seaboard (eg. Pattaya) too.  Facilities at these places can't be that bad since there are quite a few foreigners around.<br><br>(On the other hand, don't expect first-class service too.....remember how they reacted after the tsunami?).<br><br>I also have a recently retired relative who is living in Johor now.  Bought a HUGE semi-detached house for the price of a 5-room HDB flat here.  Security might be a little problem there if he's unlucky....but he's the kind who never has cash.  All the things he has are like old 29" TV, old sofa, scratched up tables, etc.  He says "if they can be bothered to carry them, let them have it".<br><br>I also have another relative (near retirement age) who has just bought an apartment in Bangkok.  Downtown, S$100k only.  He lives between Singapore, Bangkok and London (due to business).<br><br>Actually, I wonder how crucial it is to be really close to a good hospital.  I have a close friend who is Dutch, 65 years old now, living in Jakarta.  He's rich, full of medical problems (heart, eyes, legs, back) and usually flies to Singapore or USA for his medical treatments.  In fact, he was just in Singapore a few days ago for an eye operation.  I'm not sure of the reason, but he's never seeked medical help in Indonesia for his more serious ailments.  Overall, he's still living well.<br><br>Hey, do you by any chance need a male maid for your "winter house"?  I could maintain the house for you in the other 3 warmer seasons....and I don't demand very much.<br><br></div>

Rhonda, heard from a lot of nurses here that nurses are in demand everywhere! almost all of the nurses here are from overseas as well.... ditto for US.... but then, work here doesnt mean migration... mayb just trying out different life?<br><br>whatever will b in the future then will c lor.... no matter where u r.... home is where the heart is....</strong><br><br>I agreed immigration is complicated as it is with or without money. The purpose is not just for your own reasons but  think for your future and your own children's future..<br><br>I helped a couple married in Spore then they both moved to Australia. Later after so many year passed, wi 2 beautiful kids  The couple always returned &lt; every yearly&gt;and called upon me &lt; one is a nurse &gt; and their report is great &lt; abot Australia, their new 13 years old home in Melbourne&gt;&gt; but nowadays Australia wants a different kind of people who can profit their economy and help pay for their veterans' old age pension.. however, my friends <span style="font-style: italic;"> it is not likely they will get anything when their time is up for retirement..Think abot it too</span>!</div>
