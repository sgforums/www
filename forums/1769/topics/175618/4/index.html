            <div class='col-md body'>Am I the only one who thinks of migrating to Thailand?  Think about it....<br><br>- S$12 massage budget per week, and thats 2 solid hours per week.  Yah ok, its not exactly a spa, but I usually close my eyes when being massaged anyway, so it makes no difference to me how the surroundings are.<br><br>- Great people who are not too uptight, are polite and warm (well, most of them anyway).  Great "Mai Pen Lai" laid-back, forgiving attitude.  Great informal culture.<br><br>- Great food at affordable prices.  Tom Yum Soup S$3.  Green Curry Chicken S$2~2.50.  Banana Crepe S$0.50~0.80.  Kai Tawt fried chicken thigh S$0.80.  Kai Yang roast chicken thigh S$0.80.  Packet of sticky rice S$0.20.  Katsudon at an aircon restaurant S$3~4.  Great buffets too!  Sizzler salad buffet S$4-6 (over here its S$16).<br><br>- Great beaches with great topless girls from the around the world (for those who prefer guys, great topless hunks from around the world).<br><br>- Great cost of living (many average Thais live on S$100 per month, including food for the family, utility bills, etc).  <strong>You'll never be a slave to your job again!</strong><br><br>- Great clothes at reasonable prices.  T-shirt S$3.  Jeans less than S$20.  Sandals S$10.  Underwear S$1.50.  Socks S$1.<br><br>- Great nightlife.  Oooooh, pole dancing, balloon shooting, etc.  While they had all that, we were still debating childishly here whether to legalise bar-top dancing or not.  Great sandwiches too - for eating or otherwise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>- Great, great sports (this was the main draw for me when I initially visited Thailand - its about 90 trips later now).<br><br>- Good mix between the old-fashioned (countryside) and modern (downtown huge, shiny malls).<br><br>- Can modify your car any way you want.  Can even lengthen it, raise it, etc!<br><br>- Traffic fines are affordable + no demerit point system.  Tolls and parking are very reasonable.  Vehicle insurance and road tax are so, so, so affordable.<br><br>- Freedom of speech and expression!  But laws are not that strict, so people tend to behave and not abuse their freedom too much (to avoid getting whacked).<br><br>- Big domestic market.  Good for technical salespeople like myself - can bluff your way through easier than here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>- Airport tax much lower than Changi (greatly appreciated by frequent travellers like me).<br><br>- Don't need to leave the country for holidays.  Can drive all over Tahiland (cultures, lifetyles, food, languages/dialects, etc are different in different parts of the country).  Petrol is about 60% of the petrol prices here.  Great countryside too!  Like the floating riverside restaurants at Kachanaburi.<br><br>- A bottle of Thai whiskey (30-40%, 35 cl) can be less than S$4.<br><br>- Cheap to fly back to Singapore on budget airlines, if/when you need to.  Cheap to fly to KL once in a while for shopping too.  Or you can go by land/boat to Vientienne for a break.  Soon, there will be a highway from Bangkok to Vietnam....and I heard they're planning one to China too.<br><br>- Great medical facilities/services (for retirement).  Doctors are polite, don't mind answering questions, take their time to explain things to you whilst not making you feel like you're being a bother for asking.<br><br>- No NS.<br><br>- No CPF.<br><br>- No ERP.<br><br>- No COE.<br><br>- Can download MP3 from the internet for free.<br><br>- Even their great fruits are on "auto mode" and don't require picking in the real sense (ie. durians).<br><br>Um.....to summarise it all, great for a cheapo food-loving burnt-out corporate cheekopek like me.  Sigh....still waiting for my company to post me to Thailand.  Was to be last year, but didn't happen....yet.<br><br></div>
