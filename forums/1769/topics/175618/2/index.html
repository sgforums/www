Convinced that marriage would interfere with her ability to follow her calling to nursing, Nightingale continued to reject his proposal.<br><br>When in Rome in 1847, recovering from a mental breakdown precipitated by a continuing crisis of her relationship with Milnes, Nightingale met Sidney Herbert, a brilliant politician who had been Secretary at War (1845 Â– 1846), a position he would hold again (1852 Â– 1854) during the Crimean War. Herbert was already married but he and Nightingale were immediately attracted to each other and they became life-long close friends. Herbert was instrumental in facilitating Nightingale's pioneering work in Crimea and in the field of nursing, and Nightingale became a key advisor to Herbert in his political career.<br><br>Sources <br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> Did she really forgo her chasity for an older man?
