            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think to oversimplify porn as simply portrayal of sex act between two or more parties can be very dangerous considering the capacity of human beings to be creative within that limit.<br><br>The standard argument for porn is that it often sets 'standard' expectations about what men and women should do during sex. And in standard generic porn, a woman is almost always portrayed in a certain way, to enjoy certain things. And if a woman DOESN'T enjoy it, while it seems she's a bit weird, or frigid or is 'ultra conservative'. Or even, if a woman doesn't behave in a certain way during sex, she's not enjoying it enough. Same thing with men, are they supposed to give pleasure only if they are THIS well endowed?<br><br>Most of us would claim intellectually we know the difference between porn and reality - it's just fantasy! But the problem doesn't lie with you and me, who occasionally surf porn sites or watch a couple of adult videos to spice up the sex life. Sure, we get it even when it is not legalised~ but what does legalisation mean?<br><br>But legalising porn means as a society you accept it as part of your life and culture. That every adult above a certain age have the right to have access to porn, whether or not they are socially, sexually or intellectually mature enough or not. What about adult industries? Would you accept that too? Since it is already semi-constitutionalised anyway - why are we still keeping it as a legal taboo?<br><br>I am not against legalising of porn but I think there's a danger where people are calling for it stating WHY we should legalise it without thinking through the implications and difficulties of HOW to legalise it.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Another thing - I find it hard to reconcile watching porn with the aspects of gentlemanly behaviour. I don't know what you ladies think of porn, but I see it as degrading to women. To me it seems that porn is all about letting the guy have all the fun and seeing the female body as nothing more than a living sex toy for his own pleasure.<br><br>For every female who says that porn 'liberates' them, there will be others who say that porn degrades them.<br><br>So who am I supposed to listen to? Most of the female friends I know of aren't that open-minded, and they detest porn. They see me as the kind of guy who won't take advantage of them, who'll open the door for them, and who'll offer to carry their heavy belongings for them. They sure as heck would be disappointed with me if they were to discover me watching porn.<br><br>Besides, as for the argument that porn helps to satisfy lust, there's also the added risk that it will in fact help to create it. I'm sure all of you have heard of cases where a bunch of teenage boys get turned on by some contraband porn and decide to act out their fantasies for real on some unsuspecting girl. Also, remember the rape/murder of the British tourist in Thailand a couple of weeks ago? The criminals were a couple of local fishermen who got a turn on from watching porn and decide to satiate their raging hormones by raping an unsuspecting tourist.<br><br>We all know the rest of the story - the tourist ends up raped and killed.<br><br>Bottom line - as much as legalising porn can have benefits, you can't deny the drawbacks, either. As for me, I'm going to have to listen to what my female friends say - I've known them for years, and there's no way do I want to lose their respect over something which can wait till marriage.</div>

I don't know what you ladies think of porn, but I see it as degrading to women. To me it seems that porn is all about letting the guy have all the fun and seeing the female body as nothing more than a living sex toy for his own pleasure.<br><br>For every female who says that porn 'liberates' them, there will be others who say that porn degrades them.<br><br>So who am I supposed to listen to? Most of the female friends I know of aren't that open-minded, and they detest porn. They see me as the kind of guy who won't take advantage of them, who'll open the door for them, and who'll offer to carry their heavy belongings for them. They sure as heck would be disappointed with me if they were to discover me watching porn.<br><br>Besides, as for the argument that porn helps to satisfy lust, there's also the added risk that it will in fact help to create it. I'm sure all of you have heard of cases where a bunch of teenage boys get turned on by some contraband porn and decide to act out their fantasies for real on some unsuspecting girl. Also, remember the rape/murder of the British tourist in Thailand a couple of weeks ago? The criminals were a couple of local fishermen who got a turn on from watching porn and decide to satiate their raging hormones by raping an unsuspecting tourist.<br><br>We all know the rest of the story - the tourist ends up raped and killed.<br><br>Bottom line - as much as legalising porn can have benefits, you can't deny the drawbacks, either. As for me, I'm going to have to listen to what my female friends say - I've known them for years, and there's no way do I want to lose their respect over something which can wait till marriage.</div></blockquote>With respect to your sensitivity and degree of gentlemeness... there is no link between watching porn and being a complete dick with no respect to woman. While i agree with you that porn is made for a bloke and in them flicks woman are used as objects, porn will not make u suddenly turn into a rapist. I will bet you that these guys never had any respect for women prior to watching the porn. They are using it as an excuse for the crime.<br><br>Porn wil not induce mental illness leading to rape, child molestation or general disrespect for women. If you argue it to be true, then you need to ban all violent movies too.<br></div>

Why, to some folks, models clad in lingerie would be considered 'soft porn'!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   If that's the case, then there's soft porn all over Singapore already!
