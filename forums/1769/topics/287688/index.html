Think of Laura (Christopher Cross)<br>Though usually associated with General Hospital's Luke and Laura, the song is about a friend who died from a stray bullet.<br>Think of Laura but laugh don't cry.

Kyrie (Mr. Mister)<br>Band name comes from Mr. Misty, a drink sold by Dairy Queen.<br>Somewhere between the soul and soft machine is where I find myself again<br><br>30. I Just Called To Say I Love You (Stevie Wonder)<br>13th in the all-time list of best-selling singles in the UK; mocked by Jack Black in the film High Fidelity.<br>No first of spring. No song to sing. In fact here's just another ordinary day<br><br>29. Morning Train (Sheena Easton)<br>Known as "9 to 5" in England but changed in the U.S. to avoid confusion with Dolly Parton's song. Also the fight song of Manchester United fan club of Ohio.<br>All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly. I'm crazy mad for him, and he's crazy mad for me.<br><br>28. I Think We're Alone Now (Tiffany)<br>Cover of the Tommy James &amp; the Shondells song from 1967. Tiffany finished second in Star Search in 1985.<br>Children behave. That's what they say when we're together<br><br>27. California Girls (David Lee Roth)<br>Recorded in 1985, while DLR was still a member of Van Halen.<br>I dig a French bikini on Hawaii island. Dolls by a palm tree in the sand<br><br>26. Wild Boys (Duran Duran)<br>The last top 10 hit by the band in the 80s, released on the concert album Arena.<br>You got sirens for a welcome. There's bloodstain for your pain. And your telephone been ringing while you're dancing in the rain<br><br>25. The Final Countdown (Europe)<br>Song by the Swedish rock band was No. 1 in 26 countries.<br>We're leaving together, But still it's farewell And maybe well come back. To earth, who can tell?<br><br>24. Ebony and Ivory (Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder)<br>This song was named as the 10th worst song of all time by Blender magazine.<br>We all know that people are the same where ever we go<br><br>23. Mickey (Toni Basil)<br>A cover of a 1979 hit called "Kitty" by UK band Racey. Later parodied by Weird Al as "Ricky."<br>Oh Mickey what a pity you don't understand.

Can't Fight This Feeling (REO Speedwagon)<br>Second No. 1 hit for REO (after "Keep on Lovin' You).<br>And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight.

            <div class='col-md body'>20. Pacman Fever (Buckner &amp; Garcia)<br>A No. 8 hit in the U.S. back in 1982; the album it's on has a song about seven more different arcade games (Frogger, Centipede, Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Defender, Mouse Trap, Berzerk)<br>I'm gonna eat 'em all up, just as soon as they turn blue.<br><br>19. Walk the Dinosaur (Was Not Was)<br>The group's earlier work featured guest vocals by Mel Torme and Ozzy Osbourne; also known for the song "Out Come the Freaks."<br>That night we split a rattlesnake and danced beneath the stars.<br><br>18. Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band)<br>Best known for The Joker (and the "pompatus of love" ), he gave up recording in 1993. This song ought to be the reason why.<br>Keep me burnin' for your love, With the touch of a velvet glove<br><br>17. Puttin' on the Ritz (Taco)<br>Truly a one-hit wonder around the world, Taco Ockerse was born to Dutch parents in Jakarta and now is only still popular in Germany. Hasselhoff and Taco? What is it with the Germans?<br>Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super duper)<br><br>16. Dirty Laundry (Don Henley)<br>A song about lousy TV news was a Top 5 hit; Henley's next solo album is due out later this year. (Will it feature a tune about this lousy song?)<br>We got the bubble-headed-bleach-blonde who comes on at five<br><br>15. The Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades (Timbuk 3)<br>Husband/wife team of Pat and Barbara MacDonald; song featured on "My Best Friend is a Vampire."<br>Fifty thou a year buys a lot of beer<br><br>14. Who's Johnny (El DeBarge)<br>Best known as the theme song to the Steve Guttenberg masterpiece "Short Circuit."<br>Who's Johnny? she said. And smiled in her special way<br><br>13. Dancing on the Ceiling (Lionel Richie)<br>The last of Richie's top 10 work; video pays homage to Fred Astaire.<br>People were starting to climb the walls. Ooh, it looks like everybody is having a ball<br><br>12. Heartbeat (Don Johnson)<br>A popular European music group -- Don Johnson Big Band -- is named after him.<br>I can feel it in the rhythm of the heartbeat in the street.<br><br>11. We Built This City (Starship)<br>Though a No. 1 hit, it was named the worst song of all time by a variety of publications<br>Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight. Too many runaways eating up the night<br><br>10. Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves)<br>Band's reportedly was horrified that "Katrina" was the name of last year's killer hurricane.<br>Now everytime I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down<br><br>9. I Wanna Be a Cowboy (Boys Don't Cry)<br>A one-hit wonder by a British studio band, it topped out at No. 13 on the charts. One reader said "I was asked to turn off by a passenger in my car because it was so painful to listen to."<br>My name is Ted. And one day I'll be dead -- yo yo<br><br>8. Sunglasses at Night (Corey Hart)<br>Perhaps the most overplayed songs of the 80s (along with "Come On Eileen" and "Melt with You" ), it's not even Hart's highest charting song -- Never Surrender is; along with "The Future's So Bright..." that makes two songs in the top 20 about wearing sunglasses.<br>Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades, oh-no<br><br>7. Fish Heads (Barnes and Barnes)<br>Fictional brothers Art and Artie Barnes are really artists Robert Haimer and Bill Mumy, who played Will Robinson in the TV series "Lost in Space." Though the song was recorded in 1978, it was released on the 1980 album Voobaha; made popular on the Dr. Demento radio show and Saturday Night Live.<br>I took a fish head out to see a movie. Didn't have to pay to get it in<br><br>6. Don't Worry, Be Happy (Bobby McFerrin)<br>McFerrin creates his music using his vocal range of four octaves and by tapping on his chest to make the bass sounds; he also sang the theme song to the "Cosby Show."<br>In every life we have some trouble. When you worry you make it double<br><br>5. Everybody Wang Chung Tonight (Wang Chung)<br>Originally called Huang Chung (Chinese for "perfect pitch" ); the band also claims "Wang Chung" is a sound make by strumming a guitar; named 3rd worst song ever by Blender magazine and VH1.<br>Across the nation, around the world. Everybody have fun tonight<br><br>4. Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go (Wham!)<br>Song is based on a note left in George Michael's hotel room one night from band mate Andrew Ridgeley; popularity soared with the MTV showing the band wearing "Choose Life" t-shirts.<br>Jitterbug into my brain. Goes a bang bang bang till my feet do the same<br><br>3. Greatest Love of All (Whitney Houston)<br>Originally recorded by George Benson in 1977; one of several hit singles off her 1985 debut album; considering Houston's current state of life, the song's themes of self-preservation and dignity might seem ironic; mocked in "Coming to America" and "Say Anything."<br>No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity<br><br>2. Hip To Be Square (Huey Lewis and the News)<br>Band was composed of backup musicians for Elvis Costello and Van Morrison; several other band tunes -- "Heart of Rock and Roll" and "I Want A New Drug" -- barely missed inclusion on this list.<br>Don't tell me that I'm crazy. Don't tell me I'm nowhere. Take it from me. It's hip to be square.<br><br>1. We Are The World (USA For Africa)<br>It was the best of the 80s ... it was the worst of the 80s. Originally intended by Harry Belafonte to feature only black musicians; recorded same night as American Music Awards in 1985 to assure artists were available; eighth consecutive year that a Lionel Richie song reached No. 1. Sure, the song was for a good cause. But it wasn't even as good as "Feed The World" by the British artists, from which the idea was stolen. As one reader said, "We had to sing that at a school concert and it haunts me to this day."<br>It's true we'll make a better day. Just you and me<br><br>LAST,<strong>MICHAEL JACKSON&gt;PRINCE</strong><br><br>nuff said</div>
