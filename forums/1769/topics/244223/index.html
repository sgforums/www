            <div class='col-md body'>I just received an Easter e-mail from a close buddy, and there was this phrase in an attachment :<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Most people walk in and out of your life......but FRIENDS leave footprints in your heart.</span></strong><br><br>Coincidentally, my horoscope readings for the past few weeks as well as a tarot reading all harped on a similar theme - that this is the year I shall find out who are my true friends.  Not that I deeply believe in horoscopes and bide their predictions, I just find it a tad amusing that the same theme keeps recurring.<br><br>When I left Singapore, apprehension was one of the myriad of emotions I went through - I admit I was nervous at leaving my close friends, my family, and a familiar way of life behind.  I was entering unknown territory because I had not set foot in Australia before then.  I had only heard tons of stories related by friends, and that was it.<br><br>No one place in the world is perfect - you'll love some things, you'll dislike some things, and the crux of the matter is in how you achieve a balance between the good and the bad.<br><br>Contrary to what I thought, most folks here aren't that 'open'.  There were a few precious souls with that good sense of humour but I think within my first few months here, I realised that it would be hard for me to develop deep friendships here simply because my cryptic and at times weird sense of humour won't really be appreciated by all, especially not amongst those of the prim-and-proper British ancestry brigade, which, sadly, the majority of my colleagues belong to.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>I had a magical friendship with a patient and her husband a few months back.  They were of my age group, widely-travelled, very open to new ideas and experiences, and they had travelled to Singapore on several occasions and they loved the orderliness and cleanliness there.  Most importantly, we shared the same sense of dark humour.  On one occasion, after I cheered the patient up by cracking a dark joke, she told me, "You're very special!  Unfortunately, a lot of people here will not take these good jokes the right way cause they're too conservative."<br><br>Now and then, I meet gems like her and her husband and I have a ball of a time with them.  But the enduring lesson I've had to learn since coming here is that at the end of the day, we are all alone, left to our own devices, and a lot of people we call 'friends' will actually turn out to be people who will be involved in your life only for that short space of time before they alight at the next stop.<br><br>I admit I used to feel sorrowful, I used to not want to let go, because I've grown to like some of these friends and I wanted them to stay in my life for as long as possible.  However, lately, I've started to see things in a different light - I've learnt to let go.  I've learnt to be more independant, more stoic, and though it hurts blazes, I've learnt that more friendships are superficial, more than we care to admit sometimes.<br><br>Friendships evolve, as does everything else, as time progresses.  Even old friendships change, and sometimes, we realise that we no longer see eye-to-eye on essential issues, and that we no longer have the same interests nor the same social situations that used to bind our friendship together.  It can be a hard, bitter pill to swallow, but I've learnt that if we stop holding on desperately to things that just aren't meant to be, if we stop having expectations on certain friends by building up our own ability to be alone, we'll be more harmonious in our lives.<br><br>Last night, I laid in bed, deeply anguished over a 'friend' who had not bothered to reply to my sms' and phone calls, wondering what in the world went wrong.  Finally, I decided to let it go.  Friendship is a 2-way street and no-way Jose can it be built on the sincerity of just one party.  Let it go, watch it flit up to the silvery moon, and wait for other friends to descend upon this part of my life, bearing in mind that ...<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">Most people walk in and out of your life......but what precious few FRIENDS you have, they shall leave and continue to leave footprints in your heart, as they walk together with you in the journey of life.</span></strong><br></div>

Of course, some friends try really hard to be there, but it goes both ways ba, if they can't return a call or an sms, don't get too hurt and sad... just call them again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If your friends are any like me, I am superduper forgetful. Sometimes friends sms me when I am very busy, I read, forget to reply then completely forget abt the sms later. And I'm glad my friends dont give up on me because of my own inadequacies too.<br></div>
