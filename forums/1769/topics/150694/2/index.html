There isn't much to do in Perth's city centre, but you can try Freemantle (and Cicerello's famous greasy fish and chips), Wave Rock and Swan Valley's vineyards (you have to pay for a parking spot and tour at some of them). The latter 2 are out-of-the-way, so it depends on how willing you are to travel. I liked the slow pace of life in Murdoch, where I stayed with my relatives.</div>
