We like to drive around the neighbourhood oo-ing and ah-ing at all the beautiful outdoor decorations.<br><br>Some of our traditions include: buying each other an ornament ever year (we also buy ornaments from wherever we were stationed); sending friends and family home-made Christmas cookies: dressing up the house and heading up to Seattle to be with family.<br><br>Here are some photos of Christmasses past.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v518/makan_kaki/outdoordecorornamentstree04001.jpg"><br>A shot of Hubby's handiwork when we were living on the base in Japan.
