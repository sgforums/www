              <p>I didn't like McCain's stand on certain issues.  Can't remember what now but when watching the debates, Obama came across as the most 'approachable', a 'people person'.  You can't deny Obama has charisma and is a fantastic public speaker. </p>
              <p>McCain has very conservative views.  Plus, I think after Bush Jr, not many would want to support Republicans for now.  Too many things still in their collective memory.  Not until the Democrats screw up. </p>
              <p>Would you choose McCain as President?  Look at his HUGE mistake in selecting  his running mate!!  You want someone like that to be a President?!  I shudder to think of the mistakes he can make if he can't even choose a good running mate.  It was more like a huge comedy.</p>

              of the color of his skin, and not his ability as a president

              <p>i'm sorry but he didn't have a clue... at all..</p>
              <p>a posturing bum who was shown what he was when the financial meltdown happened.. "suspending his campaigning to solve the financial problems" when all he did was get in the way and make a jackass of himself...</p>
              <p>his being PoW doesn't cut any mustard with me... there are many others out there too... just coz he was one, doesn't do much in terms of his capabilities..</p>
              <p>and his choosing of a dumbass for a running mate just because she was a woman, showed his ham-fisted attempt to get the vote of the women..</p>
              <p>sorry... the GOP have showed themselves time and again for the bumbling money-grubbing corrupt big-business-owned machines they are...</p>
              <p>all that is moot tho'... not our president..</p>
              <p>most of all, with the Asses in power instead of the Pachyderms, there is more hope for peace which is in short supply now...</p>

              <p>Why are you so like some Prophet of Doom?  Give the man a chance!  He hasn't even gone through his inauguration yet!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  He may or most likely may not be able to fulfill his promises, given the economic climate right now, but he's the lesser of the evils.  Sorry but the Republicans have made a royal mess and have caused a few countries to hate America.  Obama, on the other hand, is so popular that when he won the elections, even the non-Americans in other countries celebrated.  Now, THAT is an achievement in itself.  And of course, after his inauguration, his report card lays wide open for marks to be given.</p>
