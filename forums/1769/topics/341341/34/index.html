              <p>ya lor .. i guess parents are like that .. they view that their "job" is only completed when their kids are grown up, got their education, career, husband/wife, and kids ...</p>
              <p>And they are worried that if you remain single .. who is going to take care of you when u grow old? at least you are there for your mum now .. but when she's no longer around, and you're at her age, then how?</p>
              <p>At least this is my mum's worry ... lol ..</p>

              <p><br>Its incredibly selfish to want to get married just because one is afraid that there's no one to take care of oneself when old. the responsibility goes both ways.</p>
              <p>but anyway my main beef right now is her barging in and yammering about my stuff taking up space in the house. ..........WHEN EVERYTHING IS IN MY FRIKKING ROOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
