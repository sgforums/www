              the US.<br> <br> But North Korean diplomats have said that Singapore is the “perfect place” because it’s “just like home.”<br><br>When pressed for reasons, North Korean Embassy spokesman Kim Dam Ill provided an entire list:<br> <br> 1.	Singapore and North Korea are both one party states.<br> <br> 2.	The people of Singapore and North Korea both revere their Great Leader – or else.<br> <br> 3.	In both Singapore and North Korea, the Great Leader’s son is now the Dear Leader.<br> <br> 4.	Both governments hold the same views on secrecy: the Government Investment Crap of Singapore refuses to reveal details about the assets it manages, while the North Korean government refuses to reveal details about its uranium enrichment programme.<br> <br> 5.

              <p><strong>LTA to Introduce Means Testing for ERP</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Sunday, July 20, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=30&amp;author=">Local News</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=30"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-localnews.gif" border="0" alt="Local News" align="right"></a><br><em>by Chee Ken Wing</em><br><br> In response to complaints that the ERP system unfairly penalizes
              motorists who have no choice but to commute to the CBD daily, the Lame
              Transport Authority (LTA) has announced that selected ERP gantries will
              adopt means testing instead.<br><br>From 1 August, 20 ERP gantries will
              be reconfigured to detect the annual income of motorists and charge
              fees that are commensurate with their income bracket. <br> <br> For example, a Minister earning $1.9 million annually will pay a
              per-entry fee of $190 during peak hours, while a taxi driver earning
              $30,000 a year will pay just $3.<br> <br> "We want to make sure that CEOs and political leaders bear a cost that
              is roughly equivalent to that of the typical man-on-the-street," BG
              (NS) Yum Mar Nee, Chief Executive, LTA, said to reporters.<br> <br> When queried about the sudden change in policy, especially since the
              revised ERP rates would now hurt the rich, secretary to the Minister of
              Transport Mr. Alexander Hampshire said, "Our Ministry and the LTA are
              situated comfortably outside the CBD area, and we want to encourage
              other government agencies to move out of prime land and into the
              heartlands."<br> <br> University undergraduate Ms. Whyte-Elle Fan, 18, was overjoyed that
              means testing would soon determine ERP rates. "Since I have an annual
              income of nothing, I can drive my Ferrari into the Bras Basah area at
              no cost," she squealed in joy.<br> <br> However, things are not as rosy for Ms. Fan's father. He is a permanent
              secretary at a government ministry, and has to pass through 2 ERP
              gantries to get to work. That's because there's a gantry outside their
              family condo in Bukit Timah and another outside his office in the CBD.
              Mr. Fan's one-way trip would now cost $80, or about $40 per gantry, if
              he commutes by car.<br> <br> Mrs. Kee Toh Loh, a housewife who is happy waiting 25-minutes for a
              feeder bus, had no sympathy for the highly-paid. She explained, "If
              these CEOs and rich uncles can't afford to pay the ERP, they should
              just take public transport."<br> <br> Indeed, SBS Transit and SMRT are in the final stages of planning a
              super premium bus service that would ferry highly-paid individuals from
              their plush bungalows in Bukit Timah to downtown areas such as Shenton
              Way.<br> <br> "You can't expect us multi-millionaires to stand side-by-side with an
              old auntie carrying empty aluminium cans on the bus, can you?" asked
              Ms. Lily Atas, a lawyer earning a six-figure salary.</p>
