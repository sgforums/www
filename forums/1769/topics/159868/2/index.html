He doesn't touch it cos I think he is horrified he might get lost under the piles of paper.<br><br>Once in a while he will nag la. Bobian.. then I need to do some 'plastic surgery' to the place... chortle to him proudly how I have "kept the bills in the file" or.. "put the recipes in the drawer" , " folded ALL the clothes..." and he will have to 'praise' me for my effort (miniscule but compared to regular still massive- also I choose the things HE doesn't like to do)... hurhurhur... so selective housework is better than regular housework. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know of a couple. its actually my gf's parents.. really very loving. been married for almost 20+ coming to 30 years already. They are having fun everyday, gf's father is still working while gf's mom is a full time housewife, retired recently due to some health problems. so now is full time housewife. gf's father will call he rmom once in a while from his work place to talk to her and whisper sweet nothings.. sometimes even sing her love songs from his work place. i ask my gf hw she knows, she says she can see it from the way she smile and will ask her mom why she smile and her mom will tell her..<br><br>gf's mom had to be admitted to hospital for surgery and her dad took leave to company her all the way from admission til one week after discharge to take care of all her needs. Cos usually after surgery very weak. then i visited her in hospital also, the father is really there all the time. every time i m there its both of them i see together.<br><br>during normal times, they are quite quirky.. sometimes they will suan each other.. the dad quite obstinate.. will get his hands to repair things even though they are beyond repair and will often miss or skip dinner just to get the job done.. then the mom will sometimes have to nag and nag to get him to the dinner table.. sometimes success sometimes cannot..<br><br>i think there are a lot more incidences of their romance but as i dun stay with them, these are just some of the things that i see or hear from my gf.. but so far, i have to admit they they are quite a role model.. growing old gracefully yet still lovingly together</div>
