            <div class='col-md body'>I admire my parents!<br><br>They've been married for about three decades or more now, and whilst they don't have PDA (Physical Displays of Affection) due to the generation they grew up in, they are very much in love.<br><br>They make up for each other's weakness.  Where one is weak, the other's strength makes up for it, and they don't make each other feel crippled because of their shortcomings.  They just accept each other, and very often, make light humour out of it.<br><br>They travel together a few times every year.  Dad goes around snapping photos, mom goes around posing, kinda like every woman's dream!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Then, they take shots together too, and though they literally look like ebony and ivory - mom's very fair whilst dad's very tanned, they're cute together.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>They have their own hobbies and interests, and they respect each other's 'territory' - mom has her hobby space at home and goes out shopping and dad NEVER questions her on her purchases, although surely, he KNOWS that she's got one bag too many, one pair of shoes too many, but he just keeps mom about it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Mom lets dad go out on his guy's night out, and doesn't bug him about it at all.  They enjoy their time together, and also respect their time apart.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Recently, it's so cute - mom even developed an interest in dad's interest - Karaoke!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Mom, who never sang in her life, suddenly decides to give it a go, because dad was so enthusiastic about it at home!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   She has even taken to joining him on his karaoke outings!  What's cuter is that aunt and uncle, and even a cousin or two and their boyfriends have joined in too!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Mom and dad have a good combination going on... they will surely grow old gracefully!  I sure hope that God will bless me with a husband who'll walk through thick and thin with me and paint a beautiful life portrait together, just like mom and dad.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few days ago, I saw a middle-aged Indian guy at a taxi stand.  Suddenly, he turned around and motioned to someone.  I turned and saw that he was motioning to a lady, presumably his wife.<br><br>She seemed to have sprained her ankle and was hobbling slowly and painfully across to him.  He looked impatient as he was nearing the end of the queue and she was still quite a distance away.<br><br>Instead of standing beside her, helping her walk, he went ahead of her to wait for a cab and then, looked so angry at her slow progress!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>If I were the lady, I would have walked away from him and taken my own cab to the nearest clinic, without him!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I love to see old folks walking on the streets very slowly and still holding hands.
