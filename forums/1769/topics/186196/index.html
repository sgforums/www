Injuries are revenged; crimes are avenged."<br>~ Samuel Johnson</span><br><br>Why are some people so hell bent on getting revenge?<br><br>I do admit... we are humans, and our sense and sensibility often clash in life, but there are some who will do just about anything to satisfy their need to see someone get back what is deemed deserving for a past action.<br><br>Is it just a need to sate our moral intuitions? Will it make us happier to see the person suffer in return?<br><br>In truth, if we do not express anger and moral outrage at evil, something is very wrong with us. To not feel anger at an injustice will make us saints by any means... and I know that most of us are incapable of reigning in our emotions. Most of the time, it takes all of my willpower to remind myself that "Two wrongs don't make a right"; but not carrying out the action does not diminish the fact that the thought IS there.<br><br>How far will you go?</div>

For example... in politics - there are some countries who retaliate in the name of justice. "We shall not let them trample all over us - let's go to war! They shall get what they deserve!" Isn't the basis of that simply wanting to exact vengeance? Is it actually possible, in reality - to distinguish between vengeance and retribution?<br><br>Seriously though... between our doubts and cynicisms - there are several ways that retribution can be deemed to be different from revenge / vengeance.<br><br>1. Revenge often has a "face". It usually rears its ugly head when there is a tangible action done - when we are able to see and feel the consequences of another's actions. Retribution (or karma), however, usually addresses an "objective" wrong.<br><br>2. Revenge has no limits. There is no telling how far a person will go to avenge himself. Retribution has both upper and lower limits. We do not punish equally... and who is to say that someone got what he deserved in deference to his actions?<br><br>3. Vengeance is subject to our own satisfaction. It delights in seeing someone hurt or come to harm to answer for his past misdeeds. Retribution leans more toward "for the greater good of all". It takes no pleasure in punishing to sate an inner need - it does so because it needs to have a detterent effect on the wrongdoer.<br><br>4. someone who partakes in revenge is doing so to "retaliate" against an injustice done, whereas retribution seeks impartial justice and demands fairness on all accounts. (depicted in a blindfolded Lady Justice)<br><br>Revenge is in all accounts - a short lived pleasure; but it does come as a 'closure' to perhaps a deep seated, long term simmering displeasure.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">ahh... i've ranted on too much...<br><br>thank you baby, for your wonderful insights and i do hope to be able to read more of them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>The pleasure's all mine... and <strong>thank you</strong> for taking the time to read, respond and broaden my views.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do we seek revenge? If a person seeks revenge, he will inflict upon someone what he felt was unjust and was previously inflicted upon him by that someone or fire with fire.<br><br>I remembered coming across an article by a psychiatrist who said that revenge is done because the distressed person feels that the object of his revenge was unsympathetic to his condition/situation. So if he had revenge, it is to make that person "see the error of his ways" or ultimately empathize with his situation so that he wont do it again.<br><br>But in reality is the person seeking revenge really seeking to right a wrong? Is the vengeance taken really = to the injustice suffered? Revenge is greatly emotion controlled and rarely listens to logic. Blinded by fury and vengeance, i wont consider whether what i am going to do will be equal in treatment or result... most likely i will add in extra damage or injury..<br><br>Revenge begets revenge. The cycle never ends. I am under the personal belief that whatever you do to others will come around, even if its not from the same person you did to.

            <div class='col-md body'>Like Gandi said " if an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth happen soon the whole world will be toothless and with black eyes"<br><br>The line between revenge and vengence is very thin. Both is done to right something that is wrong. But the extent of the punishment is different. Most ppl view both as making the person who did u wrong experience the same process that u have gone through. The true spirit of revenge is not this, its something greater.<br><br>The true spirit is not to harm someone to satisfy one emotion but to stop the person from repeating the same act on another. I believe that satisfying one emotional need will then cross the line to vengence. For example A hit B once. B hit back twice. Isn't telling A off and showing displeasure enough to prevent A from hitting B or someone else. Futhermore why is there the need to add another hit. When A start to reflect on his deed he will feel guilty and might even tell himself to treat B better next time if B have not hit A back. However if B hit back A will feel that hes sufficiently punish and might repeat the same mistake<br><br>Everyone has a conscious that will torment a person after he did something wrong. Revenge must be suffcient to make one repent but one must always remember to not cross the line and vent your anger.</div>

It would not reverse what had initially happened - and at the end of the day, it may take way too much personal sacrifices to plot and carry out the action in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>Everything looks good on paper (or screen) - but when it comes to life itself, very rarely are we able to be level headed and control our emotions. I guess what stops most of us from actually taking the reigns on vengeance - is simply the repercussions that would come along with it.</div>
