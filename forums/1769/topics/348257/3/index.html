              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>It's quite simple, really.  IRT is an alternative to
              Classical Test Theory which is how most tests are currently
              scored.  The problem with Classical Test Theory is that a
              person's ability level is determined by the difficulty of the
              questions he answers correctly, but the difficulty of the questions
              is conversely based upon how many people that get the answers
              right.  It's a vicious cycle that never gives you a real
              answer of either the person's level of ability or the item
              difficulty.  Also, classically-designed exams ask a whole lot
              of questions that are either too easy or too diffcult for
              examinees, and that's just a waste of time.</p>
              <p>Item Response Theory takes the data and generates a mathematical
              model that simultaneously estimates both ability levels and item
              difficulty, repeatedly changing the parameter estimates and
              comparing it to the data till you get a proper fit between the
              mathematical model and the data itself.  The result is a
              measure of the difficulty of each item in the exam, extrapolated to
              a model of the distribution of ability levels across the general
              population. </p>
              <p>The repetition part's always been a bugger, but with the amount
              of computing power that we have available now, it's become fairly
              easy.  The model above only takes into account two parameters,
              namely item difficulty and ability levels.  You can also throw
              in other parameters such as the probability of getting an answer
              correct purely by guessing.</p>
              <p>Anyway, put IRT together with Computerised Adaptive Testing and
              you have a examination system that only asks you the questions most
              appropriate to your ability level.  It starts with a
              mid-level-difficulty question, and if you get that right, the next
              item's difficulty goes up to the three-quarter mark, while it goes
              to the first-quarter mark if you get it wrong.  The difference
              between the level of the question asked and the level of the next
              question keeps halving until there's less than a 1-percentile
              difference.  The SAT and the US Military's ASVAB tests are
              based upon such a system.</p>
              <p>In my thesis, I ran simulations of an adaptive model on exam
              data and correlated it to the actual results, and found that in 20
              questions, I had a .97 correlation with the actual results that
              were based upon asking 100 questions, and with 25 questions, the
              correlation was .99.  The upshot of this is that exams can be
              significantly shortened, and with everybody being asked different
              questions, students stealing exam papers will not be a problem.</p>

              <p>I believe the NCLEX-RN exams in the US, a licencing exam that ALL RN's must undertake before being allowed to practice nursing in the US, uses the IRT.  The first few questions are pretty tough and if you get those wrong, you'll have to answer more questions that are simpler, however, if you get those right, you'll answer fewer, but more difficult questions. </p>
              <p>One more question though... if you get someone who's 'smarter' scoring 95%, and another person who had to answer more questions also scoring 95%, wouldn't that not be a very equitable 95%? </p>
              <p>I get the bit about the correlation being .99... but there's just this nagging thought in my head that a 'smart and quick' 95% just somehow isn't the same as a 'slow and steady' 95%.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Good observation.  If the answers bounce all over the place, it will result in a longer test.  Unfortunately, that's an issue of how the test items were designed, as well as how the intended content is structured.  If proper item reliability tests are conducted on the data before the IRT model is constructed, the problematic items should be discarded, but there's only so much you can do without having to rejig the content itself.</p>

              <p>Well, "smarter" doesn't quite fit into the picture.  In the purest sense, all we're testing is the person's ability to do some specific thing or handle some specific subject.  As an analogy, you get two people to stand at a line and throw basketballs into a hoop.  One person may be faster and more agile on the court, but all we're testing is how accurate their shooting is, not how well they play basketball overall.</p>

              <p>That becomes a question of how the assessor interprets the results of the test.  If one person takes 20 question to get to the 95th percontile while the other takes 50 questions, that's something the assessor can take into consideration.  Also, the test can be designed in such a way that if the results are bouncing all over the place, it'll stop after a certain number of questions and produce a result that effective states, "Requires closer examination - something's not quite right here".</p>

              <p>It's quite simple, really.  IRT is an alternative to Classical Test Theory which is how most tests are currently scored.  The problem with Classical Test Theory is that a person's ability level is determined by the difficulty of the questions he answers correctly, but the difficulty of the questions is conversely based upon how many people that get the answers right.  It's a vicious cycle that never gives you a real answer of either the person's level of ability or the item difficulty.  Also, classically-designed exams ask a whole lot of questions that are either too easy or too diffcult for examinees, and that's just a waste of time.</p>
              <p>Item Response Theory takes the data and generates a mathematical model that simultaneously estimates both ability levels and item difficulty, repeatedly changing the parameter estimates and comparing it to the data till you get a proper fit between the mathematical model and the data itself.  The result is a measure of the difficulty of each item in the exam, extrapolated to a model of the distribution of ability levels across the general population. </p>
              <p>The repetition part's always been a bugger, but with the amount of computing power that we have available now, it's become fairly easy.  The model above only takes into account two parameters, namely item difficulty and ability levels.  You can also throw in other parameters such as the probability of getting an answer correct purely by guessing.</p>
              <p>Anyway, put IRT together with Computerised Adaptive Testing and you have a examination system that only asks you the questions most appropriate to your ability level.  It starts with a mid-level-difficulty question, and if you get that right, the next item's difficulty goes up to the three-quarter mark, while it goes to the first-quarter mark if you get it wrong.  The difference between the level of the question asked and the level of the next question keeps halving until there's less than a 1-percentile difference.  The SAT and the US Military's ASVAB tests are based upon such a system.</p>
              <p>In my thesis, I ran simulations of an adaptive model on exam data and correlated it to the actual results, and found that in 20 questions, I had a .97 correlation with the actual results that were based upon asking 100 questions, and with 25 questions, the correlation was .99.  The upshot of this is that exams can be significantly shortened, and with everybody being asked different questions, students stealing exam papers will not be a problem.</p>
