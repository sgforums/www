              <p>Hmmm.. to be honest, I don't have any regrets to talk about or rather I try not to feel the regrets, since I believe we are where/what we are now is where/what we need to be.</p>
              <p>But I have to agree on the mother part though...hahah... I'm a mommy's boy, our relationship were okay, pretty "hierachical", I always have this feeling that my mom's breathing down my neck, even when I'm in my 30s. The liberation came only only when I finally decided to pack up and flew some 10 hrs from home, I want to be in charge of my life, make the mistakes and learn the lessons. Well, mom still nags at me for doing that, but hey, I'm in control now, as long as I don't call her, there's nothing much she can do. Yes, I still love her, and looking forward to the day when I'm done with my business and be back to her side to take care of her. I believe by that time, I'll be immuned to her overbearingness. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>So, yup, I have tripped a few times, and learnt my lessons, but still no regrets.</p>
              <p>Btw, some of the folks here, especially Missy will know where I am if I say I'm "across the ditch"...make a guess...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>i'm not sure what i'm suppose to regret about in life, i've made some horrible decisions but somehow things just kinda work out and the worst decisions tend to actually make things better in the end. i think i'm the type thats pretty content with life, not going to be happy but not going to be unhappy either.</p>
              <p>so i guess its only the things i do that hurt people i care about that have cause for regret.</p>

              <p>Mistakes, yes.  Regrets, not for a long time now.</p>
              <p>Just about 20 years ago I made it a point to either decide to go 100% into something or forget about it altogether.  Since then, if things haven't turned out as planned, I'm not too fussed because I know I made the best possible decision based upon the available information at the time.</p>
              <p>Regret, blame and guilt are just about the three most useless aspects of human function around.  I don't have time for any of them.</p>

              <p>regrets are a matter of perspective, and it is normally reserved for the small stuff.</p>
              <p>the fact is, even if you could turn back the clock and did what you thought you were supposed to do, the outcome may still not be the one you desired. so why fret over a decision taken otherwise?</p>

              <p>It's quite simple, really.  IRT is an alternative to Classical Test Theory which is how most tests are currently scored.  The problem with Classical Test Theory is that a person's ability level is determined by the difficulty of the questions he answers correctly, but the difficulty of the questions is conversely based upon how many people that get the answers right.  It's a vicious cycle that never gives you a real answer of either the person's level of ability or the item difficulty.  Also, classically-designed exams ask a whole lot of questions that are either too easy or too diffcult for examinees, and that's just a waste of time.</p>
              <p>Item Response Theory takes the data and generates a mathematical model that simultaneously estimates both ability levels and item difficulty, repeatedly changing the parameter estimates and comparing it to the data till you get a proper fit between the mathematical model and the data itself.  The result is a measure of the difficulty of each item in the exam, extrapolated to a model of the distribution of ability levels across the general population. </p>
              <p>The repetition part's always been a bugger, but with the amount of computing power that we have available now, it's become fairly easy.  The model above only takes into account two parameters, namely item difficulty and ability levels.  You can also throw in other parameters such as the probability of getting an answer correct purely by guessing.</p>
              <p>Anyway, put IRT together with Computerised Adaptive Testing and you have a examination system that only asks you the questions most appropriate to your ability level.  It starts with a mid-level-difficulty question, and if you get that right, the next item's difficulty goes up to the three-quarter mark, while it goes to the first-quarter mark if you get it wrong.  The difference between the level of the question asked and the level of the next question keeps halving until there's less than a 1-percentile difference.  The SAT and the US Military's ASVAB tests are based upon such a system.</p>
              <p>In my thesis, I ran simulations of an adaptive model on exam data and correlated it to the actual results, and found that in 20 questions, I had a .97 correlation with the actual results that were based upon asking 100 questions, and with 25 questions, the correlation was .99.  The upshot of this is that exams can be significantly shortened, and with everybody being asked different questions, students stealing exam papers will not be a problem.</p>

              <p>yupz precisely. and it'll be super thick too i imagine.</p>
              <p>but then again, how do you account for gaps in knowledge in terms of the person just happened to not know certain things at a certain lvl? like for example I could do advanced multi-variable partial differential equations, but couldn't do simple differentiate equations?</p>

              <p>That's where the parameter of getting less than 1 percentile difference comes in.  If there are gaps, the questions will keep going until a stable measure is reached.  That being the case, the examinee might get the first question wrong and be bumped into the lower half, but by virtue of getting more difficult questions correct move to the upper half later.</p>
              <p>Of course, the caveat here is that the actual content of the test needs to be carefully constructed in such a way that the items in fact measure a continuum of levels on a clearly-defined ability.</p>
