            <div class='col-md body'>Sexual compatibility is important, this I won't deny.  I would seriously reconsider marriage if sex life was non-existant.  But it's also up to us to improve the situation.  The right partner brings out the best in us, no?

And that NICE guys laughs last kinda thing. BUT have u ever considered that, girls they go for the bad n dangerous guys.. so that means they have inevertably become used goods. So when they grow more 'mature' seeking  'stability.. who are the suckers that get played into thier hands ? yes.. the NICE guys..  the NICE guys THINK they get the last laugh..but in fact they are the losers that recieves the rejected goods. so i dont know about u guys but i think the society is already corrupted. Nice guys exist in this world only to be used n abused.  Its like Losers..that determine the Winners.  So what i am trying to say is.. if u are a NICE guy out there.. damnit.. dun let no BAD boys take what rightfully belongs to you. Everyone can be bad.. just how bad can u become ? Look bad..or BORN bad..  well..thats my 0.02 cents worth. N i just wanna say this but.. BAD boys dun necessary give great sex..n nice good boys dun necessary give bad ass sex..  i think its bullocks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
