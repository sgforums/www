              <p>Y'know, in my course of work as a nurse, it astounds me how many people are walking around with borderline personality disorders, eg. Anxiety Attacks, Panic Disorders, Body Dysmorphic Disorders, Borderline Mania and Psychosis, etc that may be inherited, a result of drug abuse or ethanol abuse, or in Singapore's case, the sad result of living in a ratrace culture since young. </p>
              <p>These people are 'normal', but may snap at any minute.  They are like tightly-strung wires that may just snap at the tension one fine day without warning.</p>
              <p>Dealing with these people is incredibly incredibly stressful and exhausting.  Sometimes, my colleagues and I say, "Oh no... not yet another nut case!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>It's a way of dealing with the stress of the profession.  Kinda like some patients think that surgeons should not listen to music whilst operating, but when I did my attachment in the Operating Theatres, I realised how strenuous it was for the surgeons to keep that level of concentration for that many hours at a stretch and so, whatever turns them on! </p>
              <p>Confidentiality is still maintained because the people remain 'faceless'.  It used to bother me until I realised that hell, gossipping is a very natural part of life.  It's inevitable that we talk about one another.  That's part of what life is all about.  The daily grind is sometimes proferred a little lubricant in the way of pleasant diversions like gossips, analogies, anecdotes, etc, all of which involve some  unfortunate person or other.</p>
              <p>Someone out there is the subject of my jokes, just like I am the subject of someone else's jokes. </p>
              <p>I'm no longer sensitive to such issues.  I can imagine how certain patients / colleagues will talk about me.  *winces and squirms... but hell, it goes both ways!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Sometimes, I think, "Hell, they must think I'm a paranoid schizophrenic!", guffaw about it for a while, then move on to the next interesting thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>KB, I was mulling over what you said...</p>
              <p>I think a lot of situations, we find that people get into relationships because of boredom / fear of loneliness and they just really want someone to do thing and go places with.</p>
              <p>It's very interesting to sit back and analyze the various types of relationships that people embark on around us. </p>
              <p>I think the one uniting primary factor amongst it all is the fear of growing old alone.  That fear alone drives certain people to resort to seemingly really amusing and interesting choices and decisions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>To be honest ah, dealing with such people is really really strenuous.  At some point, you become so desperate to get away from them or for them to just bloody shut up that you start to get a bit scared about what you are actually capable of saying or doing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
