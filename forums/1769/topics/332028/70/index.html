              <p>OK, you  need to stop questioning why you're doing it, and start to focus on stopping yourself from eating more chocs and sweets!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> </p>
              <p>You'll go into a sugar crash soon.  It's a vicious cycle... you eat lots of sugar-laden food, you get a 'high' for a short while, then you suddenly get an energy crash.  You then eat more sugary items and get an energy rush and a perk-me-up, and then you crash again...</p>
              <p>It's all thanks to your body's insulin doing its job well.</p>

              <p>Does it matter?</p>
              <p>I used to get bothered by such things but not anymore because I've come to realise that sometimes, the doctors / psychologists who choose their profession because of monetary reasons are actually really good in their jobs, which in turn, benefits their patients and clients. </p>
              <p>I've met nurses who are motivated by money or flexibility but that doesn't mean that they perform worse than nurses who are in it for altruistic reasons. </p>
              <p>In an ideal world, people will do whatever their heart dictates.  But this world is far from ideal and as long as the job is done and done right, who's to judge the raison d'etre?</p>

              <p>i have an 'addictive' personality. as in &gt;.&lt; i get addicted to stuff very easily &gt;.&lt; which is why i've never dared to try anything like smoking (anything), and i don't drink either. and i don't play too much computer games etc.</p>
              <p>but then of course, there are still things im addicted to &gt;.&lt; strangely, i can actually survive without the computer/internet so long i have something else to do to occupy my time.</p>

              <p>Last week we were given an assignment to do on some tough chemical reactions. I spent much of the day last Saturday trying to figure it all out manually. In the end, I had to give up halfway through because it was so difficult to do and I was having a real huge migraine because of it.</p>
              <p>Then just yesterday, my lecturer sent us a revised version of the assignment. Apparently, he wants us to run computer simulations of the chemical reactions, NOT manual hand calculations!</p>
              <p>Bloody hell....to begin with, he didn't specify the part about running computer simulations! In the absence of such information, I always assume that everything is to be done manually! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>And now, after wasting one whole day on useless manual calculations, he doesn't want to give us a deadline extension! Basket! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>

              <p>but too much of that will be a turn-off too. haha. it's all about....balance. hahaha. &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>you can also talk about how you are great and wonderful and the best thing in the world. but you'd better seem as though you are joking about it too. hohoho~ and don't say it too often.</p>
              <p>and you'd better be convincing about the whole 'joking' thing. sometimes when some people try that, it's just so unnatural that it's just erm.......AWKWARD!</p>

              <p>but...but...it's the FIRST TIME i recall ever eating THIS MUCH

              <p>it's NEVER happened before. oddly enough. hahahhaa.</p>
              <p>good god. how the hell do you stop...???</p>
              <p>i wonder if this is how addicts feel. it's like i'm trying to
              force my arm to reach out for the chocs or something.
              ARGH....!!!!</p>
              <p>i have an 'addictive' personality. as in &gt;.&lt; i get
              addicted to stuff very easily &gt;.&lt; which is why i've never
              dared to try anything like smoking (anything), and i don't drink
              either. and i don't play too much computer games etc.</p>
              <p>but then of course, there are still things im addicted to
              &gt;.&lt; strangely, i can actually survive without the
              computer/internet so long i have something else to do to occupy my
              time.</p>

              <p>I don't know you (as your nick suggests <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) but already, I feel proud of you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>It's true that certain people tend to inherit a more 'addiction-prone' personality.  It's been proven that there is an area in the brain that predisposes one to addictions more easily than others.  And after discovering that in  yourself, you took steps to ensure you never fell into the trap.  I really applaud you for being so level-headed and responsible, esp since you live in a culture where it's all too easy to become one of the majority who do get addicted to 'bad' things.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"></p>

              <p>Yesterday, I watched an elderly female patient work herself up to a frenzied panic post-operatively.  She was working herself up into this state where she'd end up with muscle spasms and all that, so after gently trying to persuade her for some time, I got firm and told her to "Get a grip on yourself!!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  Then I told her that if she doesn't, she WILL go into muscle spasms that will require a ton of drugs to placate which will then predispose her to hallucinations and delirium.</p>
