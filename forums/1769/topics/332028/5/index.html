              <p>actually I only took to the part about having them do duties that are more productive. Not the part about extension.pretty against that, sorry for miscom.</p>
              <p>As I said we keep everything the same as present except that those jehovah witnesses have to do certain duties or work like admin or such. I doubt adding more work would make it more attractive or more susceptible to abuse than it is presently.</p>

              <p>actually I only took to the part about having them do duties
