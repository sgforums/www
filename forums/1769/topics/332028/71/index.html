              <p>I don't support a welfare state either.  I think of the money that could've have been spent building state infrastructure or other resources that are value-driven and can be enjoyed by the multitudes. </p>
              <p>I think of the single ladies who bear children from several different fathers just so they can make a living out of claiming child welfare from the govt and I feel sick to the pits of my stomach - they don't do a good job of parenting and their kids will grow up more messed up than they are and each generation just gets worse!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>A fren is now in chicago and he didnt tell me.  He told me he is going on November, not now.</p>
              <p>He went there to check out his office and warm his new office seat.</p>
              <p>And I remembered his story about his IBM Notebook.  apparently he clicked a link and accessed a porn webpage, but that webpage keeps popping up on his internet explorer whenever he starts the IE up.</p>
              <p>Since he cant remove it, from reformating that laptop and so on......he deleted away IE and used firefox to check internet.</p>
              <p>His collegues from his previous company did asked him....why isnt he using IE.  He heh heh heh kept quiet.</p>
