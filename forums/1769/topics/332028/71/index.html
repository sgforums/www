              <p>He went there to check out his office and warm his new office seat.</p>
              <p>And I remembered his story about his IBM Notebook.Â  apparently he clicked a link and accessed a porn webpage, but that webpage keeps popping up on his internet explorer whenever he starts the IE up.</p>
              <p>Since he cant remove it, from reformating that laptop and so on......he deleted away IE and used firefox to check internet.</p>
              <p>His collegues from his previous company did asked him....why isnt he using IE.Â  He heh heh heh kept quiet.</p>
