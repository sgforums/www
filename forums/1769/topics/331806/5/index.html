              <p><strong>Mirisavatiya Stupa</strong></p>
              <p>This stupa was also known as the pepper stupa because the king had eaten a pepper without first offering some of it to the sangha.</p>
              <p>There was an interesting story at this monastery. During a break, monks were fed and  certain novice was given a bowl of piping hot gruel. So hot was his bowl that he had to pass it from one hand to another. A novice nun saw his predicament and gave him a plate to hold the bowl in. The young novice simled, the nun blushed and gave a shy simle back. They exchanged a few words and parted company.</p>
              <p>Years later, the nun went to India on a pilgrimage and stayed in Bodh Gaya. One day, she heard that a monk had just arrived from Sri Lanka and went on to meet him. During the conversation, they remembered each other from the past. This led to friendship and then to love. They both disrobed and got married.</p>
              <p>The point of this charming story is that affection can be both strong and enduring.</p>

              <p><strong>Thuparama</strong></p>
              <p>This little elegant stupa was built to enshrine the Buddha's collar bone. The stupa are surrounded by octagonal pillars that once supported a dome that sheltered the stupa. Being such a revered stupa, it had received attention from wealthy patrons and kings. There are many stories related to this stupa.</p>
              <p>Once, there was 2 friends who decided to become monks. They were ordained in Thuparama. One remained there while the other decided to live in a "hard life" in a forest monastery. After some years, the forest monk decided to visit his friend in the city with the intention to invite his friend to the forest monastery.</p>
              <p>When he arrived, he was warmly welcome by his friend and was given a room. The forest monk expected his friends to bring him a drinks and food but that didn't happened. Then they went for their alms round and he expected some good food from the alms round but had only received a ladle of gruel. When they finished eating, he asked his friend if it was like this all the time. He was told it was so.</p>
              <p>"Why don't you come and live in the forest monastery with me?" the forest monk invited. The city monk agreed and was about to leave when the forest monk stopped him. "I need to collect my staff, my umbrella, my towel, my scandal, my oil and some other things before I leave. Don't you have anything to bring?"</p>
              <p>"You have only been here for only one day and you have accumulated so many thing?" the city monk asked. The forest monk felt ashamed but was happy for his friend. He bowed to his friend and said "For one like you, everywhere is forest. You should remain here instead."</p>

              <p><strong>Mahasaya and Mahinda Stupa</strong></p>
              <p>In the 2nd BC, Emperor Asoka of India sent his son Mahinda to Sri Lanka to spread Buddhism.</p>
              <p>It was said that King Devananpiyatissa who was on a hunting trip. He saw a deer and being a hunting trip, the king naturally took aim and shot at the deer. The deer however, evaded his arrow and took flight. The king being a good huntsman went after this deer, watching as over and over again the deer evaded every single one of his arrows. Arrows that would normally have flown true and found their target.</p>
              <div class="lt_pullquote">It so happened that in his pursuit of this deer Devanampiyatissa became separated from his entourage and it was at this time that he came upon a yellow-robed monk  seated beneath a tree. The king going forward reached the monk and inquired of him what he was doing alone under a tree. The monk instead of replying, asked the King three questions. These questions were put to the king by this monk in order that he might determine the intelligence level of the king before departing him the teaching.</div>
              <div class="lt_pullquote">His advice to the king was this</div>
              <div class="lt_pullquote">"Great King, refrain from killing the birds in the sky and the beast in the forest. All creatures have the right to roam the earth freely. You are only the adminstrator."</div>

              <p>Ok....so much of these heavy stuff. our subsequent days were more free and easy. Most of the time, we are under the scourching temperature of 34 degree C. Hot and humild, but Nuware offers a different climate. Being on the high mountain ranges at 2524m, it offers a temperature 12 to 17 degree C. Lands are fertile and flowers are big and bright. This is where all the famous Ceylon tea leaves come from.</p>
              <p>Nuware Eliya is sometime known as Little England of Ceylon as can be seen from the architectual designs and building in the city</p>

              <p>Today, we visited one of the many waterfall in Nuware Eliya. This one is known as the lover's leap as some lover's committed suicide here. This is one source of drinking water in Nuware Eliya and you will be suprised how protective the locals were of this drinking souce.</p>

              <p>A look at the upper reach of the waterfall and it's no more than 150m high. So I decided to climb up myself as the rest of them wanted to go shopping. A big mistake! It took me more than 2 and 1/2 hours to reach the upper reach and back with only a 10 mins stay on top.</p>

              <p>As I climbed up the mountain for the upper reach of the waterfall, I meet this family of barefooted locals (from 10years old to 82years old grandmother) gathering firewood from the mountain. They were very friendly and laughed at me when I told them that I wanted to go to the top. The grandma laughed and told me it would take them 5 hours to reached the source (top) of the waterfall.</p>
              <p>I told her that I just wanted to go to the upper reached and asked how difficult that would be? Without asking further, she directed her grandson to bring me up there.</p>

              <p>Soon, we were going up...up...up... the curvy trodden path. I had to stop, panting and grasping for air as the kind guide would frequently stop for me to catch up.</p>

              <p>Yeah, yeah....I know....I know...I have long sexy legs with very little leg hairs but this is the little PRICE I paid for showing disrespect for the mountain and for my big ego of "conquering" the mountain</p>

              <p>On our way down the mountain, our driver told us that the brake is failing and he had to use the handbrake to stop the vehicle. When the vehicle finally stopped, smoke came out and the tyre caught fire. We had to pour our drinking water to put out the fire.</p>

              <p>Just like now, we can assume that in the 18th century, the coastline is also a pretty <a id="thelink"></a>tension area. I have wanted to see the lighthouse but that area is out of bound to all civillians now.</p>
