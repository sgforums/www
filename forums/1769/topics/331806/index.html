              <p>Legends say that Mount Meru and the wind god Vayu were good friends. However, the Sage Narada approached Vayu and incited him to humble the mountain. Vayu blew with full force for one full year, but Meru was shielded by Garuda with his wings (he was flying high). However, after a year Garuda took respite for some time. Thus the apex of the mountain was broken and it fell into the sea and created the island of Sri Lanka.</p>

              <p>Pinnawela orphanage is situated northwest of the town Kegalla, halfways between the present capitol Colombo and the ancient royal residence Kandy in the hills of central Sri Lanka. It was established 1975 by the Sri Lanka Wildlife department. This 24 acres large elephant orphanage is a also breeding pace for elephants, twenty elephants were born since 1984, and it has the greatest herd of elephants in captivity in the world. The Pinnawala elephant orphanage is the Transit Home where these baby elephants once cared for are released to the wilds when they reach a certain age.</p>

              <p><strong>Kandy</strong></p>
              <p>The city of Kandy is located some 500m above sea level. Kandy is the last dynasty of the independent kingdom of Sri Lanka. Being the capital of the last dynasty, Kandy had become final resting place to the relic of the tooth of the Buddha which symbolises a 4th-century tradition that used to be linked to royalty since the protector of the relic was seen fit to rule the land. </p>

              <p><strong>Kandy - Temple of the Tooth</strong></p>
              <p>The original temple of the tooth is a 2 storey wooden structure sitting on beautifully carved stone column. Stone columns were being used because Sri Lanka is a very forested area and to prevent termites from destorying the foundation. The first storey is where the original relic is kept and the 2nd storey is a prayer hall</p>

              <p>A look of the tooth temple from the mountain top across the lake. Can you see the golden roof on the top of the building? It was a recent addition to the building and is made from gold and gold leaves. Instead of making it grand and beautiful, it really becomes an eye-sore and could be a disaster in the future should the new structure be unable to take its weight. </p>

              <p>Although this picture looks great, the centre of attraction is not this but the caves on the mountain top. Dambulla is a huge granite hummock surrounding the countryside. This place was inhabited by monks for at least 2000 years and was known in ancient time as Jambukola. The caves are beautifully painted dating to 18th century.</p>

              <p>This is an incredible movie that begins slowly. It leads you
                  along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama. Then, in
                  the second half, there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this
                  into a profound tale of global scope.<br>  Especially beginning with the second half, you will find this
                  movie an amazing experience.Excellent work! Though the war
                  sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such a work was never
                  attempted on Indian Screen...and also take note of the powerful
                  music throughout the film, its got an <strong><em>amazing
