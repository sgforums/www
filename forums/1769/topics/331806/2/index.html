              <p>4. coercing? I don't run a tour agency. this is not a political thread otherwise i would have post them in speakers corner</p>

              <p>aaah so nice to see this thread.. I went to Sri Lanka about 2 years ago .. and you know, It's original name is Serendip - it is the place that gave the word "serendipity' - fortunate accident.</p>
              <p>I think it is a lovely place too - one of the things I regret buying :P (I am not usually a very touristy shopper) was one of those moonstones they have at their door. It is only available in Kandy, and carved stone is just too heavy to lug around. I regret not ordering one to ship home though!!</p>
              <p>and if there were any corpses lying around randomly in Colombo - I didn't see them.</p>

              <p>This picture depict the mystical Lake Anotatta at the foot of Mount Meru in the Himalayas. According to the legend, the four sacred rivers of India flow out of this lake through the spout  in a form of a lion, a horse, an elephant and a bull. They circle the lake twenty four times before flowing into the plains. Around the lake is an Arcadian landscape with lotus pond, flowering trees, gods, dragons, lion, elephants and birds.</p>

              <p>The ancient historical record of Sri Lanka, describes King Kasyapa as the son of King Dhatusena. Kasyapa murdered his father by walling him alive and then usurping the throne which rightfully belonged to his brother Mogallana, Dhatusena's son by the true queen. Mogallana fled to India to escape being assassinated by Kasyapa but vowed revenge. In India he raised an army with the intention of returning and retaking the throne of Sri Lanka which was rightfully his.</p>
              <p>Knowing the inevitable return of Mogallana, Kasyapa is said to have built his palace on the summit of Sigiriya as a fortress and pleasure palace. Mogallana finally arrived and declared war. During the battle Kasyapa's armies abandoned him and he committed suicide by falling on his sword.</p>
              <p>Chronicles and lore say that the battle-elephant on which Kasyapa was mounted changed the course just to get to a better fighting position/place but the army misinterpreted it as the King fleeing. Thereafter the army abandoned the king altogether. Moggallana returned the capital to Anuradapura and turned Sigiriya into a monastery complex.</p>
