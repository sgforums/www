              <p>even if as individuals we don't waste food, there's still sooo much out there that's being wasted. certain countries have a lot of excess food that gets thrown away just because they can't get sold.</p>

              <p>which reminds me of another essay.</p>
              <p>you know all that 'preserve wildlife/wilderness/nature!!!' etc in (mainly) Asia and Africa??</p>
              <p>guess what? People (what we call: natives) used to LIVE in those lands with the animals etc. <br>much of the 'protected areas' USED to be hunting grounds for the colonizers.<br>because the 'developed world' 'progressed/modernized/etc', they killed off a lot of whatever 'nature' there was in their land. oh please, North America used to be what before the europeans went over.....<br>anywhoooo, the 'natives' hardly killed large animals such as lions etc because in the first place, they didn't have much use for them. if they had weapons that could deal with them in the first(er) place.<br>k. so anyway, 'they' chased these 'natives' away from the land and made them live elsewhere where they had to find other ways to stay alive. what do you need to keep yourself alive in the modern world? money. how do you get that? work. how do you find that? skillz of some sort. what kind of skillz do they have? way to get easy money??? poaching?! sure, since there's a market for that! <br>who gets blamed? crazy barbaric natives. (oh. thank goodness we moved them out otherwise MORE animals would've been killed! pfft)</p>
              <p>see the trend here.....??</p>

              <p>of course, 'we' always like to see 'ourselves' as 'better' more 'civilized', whatever.</p>
              <p>think about your grandparents' generation and your own. who had more kids. why.</p>
              <p>we need to solve problems by figuring out what the ROOT causes of these problems are. it's easy to see what the on-the-surface issues are.</p>
              <p>it's easy to say: let's not buy products made bby street kids. <br>ok. so maybe it will mean these kids no longer get to work. <br>but so what? will that make them go to school? i don't think so.<br>what will they then turn to? oh. maybe prostitution. <br>underground. less hard for people to find out. a fuckload shittier than when they had a factory job.</p>
              <p>with regards to the religious piety shown in the film (though in my post, i was not referring to that), guess how they 'got' their religion.</p>

              <p>how do we judge who is 'worse(or better) off'. when in shit, no matter how deep, it's still shit. if the knee-high shit is deposited from someone having bad curry induced diarrhoea, is that better than waist-high 'regular'(hehe) shit ? can 'we' as 'outsiders' see this shit?</p>
              <p>i also find that. for things like these. for a while, people will feel shitty and sorry and bad. but they will soon forget. there's also the argument that 'why make life miserable by remembering that such things exist all the time?'. this is where 'donations' and 'volunteer work' come in. the short-term 'pleasure' we get from 'helping'.</p>

              <p>you seem to be pessimistic about everything .... even the "short term pleasure we get from helping" (SIC) .....</p>
              <p>don't you think there can be goodness and happiness in this world ? .... even for these people ? .....</p>
              <p>at first I thought the sight of them praying and giving thanks before tucking into offal and refuse they've dug out from the rubbish tip cruelly ironic ... it's like a bad joke that someone brainwashed them with religion ....</p>
              <p>but then .... at least it gives them solace and succor .... and gives them the courage to face each day .... whether their god is listening or not, it really doesn't matter ....</p>
