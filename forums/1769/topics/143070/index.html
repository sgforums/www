            <div class='col-md body'>Call it the pre-7th month spooky tales sharing session.<br><br>Alright alright, I was kinda inspired by Incredible Tales story.<br><br>Eh Eh Eh. Seems like there alot of spooky tales surrounding hospitals *looks at Rhonda*<br><br>Anyhow, I shall share my not so spooky, spooky story.....Does that make sense to you guys? Anyway if I'm rambling, ask Rhonda why  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>My story took place in 1998, during my student exchange program in Poly in New Zealand....Yes....I had to go overseas for a spooky experience  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Basically we were in South New Zealand and please don't ask me for the town's name because I have a really awful memory with numbers and names and I can't remember.<br><br>Anyhow, we stayed in this century old hostel, which used to be a hospital back then. So we students checked in and there were like 5 peeps to a room. Ok so we walked into the room and I almost suffocated by what I call an over-whelming stench of disinfectant. I thought the house-keeping crew was over zealous with their cleaning so I didn't think too much about it. Just left the windows open before heading out for dinner.<br><br>However, when we came back later in the evening, I felt the smell was worst and I had this eerie feeling and that the hairs behind my neck were standing up. Being agnostic, I prayed to God for courage and protection. Well, I felt calm after that and figured it was my imagination playing tricks on me afterall we had been on the road all day and I was dead tired. After that I knocked out. I did wake up in the night because I felt so darn freaking cold and realised that the heater had gone off on it's own  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> . Thought I felt someone looking at me but I was too darn tired to care really. Just turned on the heater and knocked out till about 6am in the morning when we were awaken by frantic knocks on the door.<br><br>"Did you guys see anything last night?" Was the first question the friend who barged in asked. We said we slept through the whole thing and apparently, some kaypohs were reading through the guest book and found out that the room we were sleeping in used to be an operating theather and there were lots of sightings in the room, including one which was dated a month ago, with this guy seen walking through the wall  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It turned out that we were the only people who caught any sleep that night along with the lecturers as the rest were too scared to sleep as apparently, the fire escape door outside our room kept opening on it's own though it was bolted shut  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I got the chills when I thought about it back then but it's funny that when you're tired, you just don't give a damn? That's why I say, it's a spooky but not so spooky experience  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ok who's next to share  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm. in uk my bestie's a gal called kym. we stay in the uni halls, in blocks next to each other. one night we'd come back from clubbing with her galfriend. so we were chillin in kym's room for a bit, the 2 of them hanky pankying a bit in bed while i sat on the floor watching a bit of TV. i left to go to my room to change. when i came back, they were looking scared, so i asked wot happened. kym'd left her galfriend in her room n went to her kitchen to make some food, and i'd gone to my room. kym's room's the kind where u have a basin in the room, so kym's gal'd gone to the basin to wash her hands. as she was doing that, she looked up and in the mirror, saw a young blonde girl in white sitting on kym's bed, staring at her. she turned around and the girl wasn't there, she turned back into the mirror and the girl was gone.<br><br>i did a bit of research and later found that my halls were previously used by the London School for Girls as a boarding school accomodation as recently as in the late 80s, and that there were a few suicides there.<br><br>Also my flat mate who stays in the room next to mine had her fone ring one nite, and when she answered it, it was her friend. She said hi, and asked him whatsup, and he said he'd just gotten back. then things got weird when she asked why he called her. he asked her why she'd called him! seems like nobody dialed each other's numbers, both phones just rang on their own simultaneously...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow..imagine those 'kind' dare to appear even with many people around... thats spooky..<br><br>ok.I have one more to tell...<br><br>My cousin went cycling with a group of friends one midnight at one end of Changi. She was quite behind the group. Perhaps her cycling skill wasnt that good. As they passed by a desserted road. There was a bungalow house stand alone by itself. Then suddenly my cousin saw one old man standing in front of her. She braked with all her mights immediately to dodge him. But she failed. She banged into the old man. She sprained her angkle so badly, she didnt understand why. In fact, she banged onto a lamp post at the road side.<br>When she refreshed back, she remembered the old man was in green. Her friends helped to get her up. They could sense something was amiss. All of them did not say any word, turned around &amp; cycled back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not my story but heard if from my mum and it's her friend's real life encounter at Genting highland.<br><br>Her family went to a hotel at Genting for a weekend of family fun. When they checked into their room, they felt an eerie coldness in the room but Genting being Genting, coldness is a norm. One strange thing was their young daughter refused to move around the room like most kids would when on tour but instead her face turn pale and hides herself behind her mum's thigh and gripping it real tight. Being a mother, she squat down and ask her why. This was her reply (whispering):<br><br>"mummy, there's an auntie with long hair and white dress standing by the window"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>No need to guess what they did next...
