            <div class='col-md body'>And so, this was what i heard from my friend which happened only recently.<br><br>It was the usual orientation camp and that night, they themed it monster night. They began to paint themselves and act as ghost and ghouls, running ard the place, trying to scare the freshies.<br><br>So, there was this girl who was down with slight fever but she couldn't take a break coz there wasn't enuff ppl so she carried on with her part.<br><br>Everything was over and they all went back to their rooms respectively. Now this girl stayed in a single room and while she laid on her bed, trying to sleep, she had this funny feeling that she was being watched. So just closing her eyes as tight as possible, she forced herself to sleep. Suddenly, she felt her bed sink. Its as though someone sat down next to her, and then she felt someone stroking her hair. She didn't much that night. It happened on the second night as well.<br><br>She then told one of her relative who took her to the temple and she spent the night at the relative's place. At night, the relative had a dream. It was a small boy telling the relative why is she so kpo. The relative woke up in cold sweat and found scratches on the hands and stomach.<br><br>Freaky huh...<br></div>
