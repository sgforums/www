            <div class='col-md body'>I have a friend, who seems to be attracted to certain funny encounters, always.<br><br>He told me there was a time when he came home late, just after midnight.  He was walking to his block in Telok Blangah.  They lift is located at the mid-point of the first and second floor.<br><br>As he was walking to the lift, he noticed the door closing, with an old man inside.  He saw him thru the opening of the lift.  He then shouted, "Hello, Hello! Wait ah!".  The door halted and opened.  He was glad that the old man had the decency to wait for him.  He ran in, turned to face the panel, pressed his floor, pressed the door close button.<br><br>As the door was closing, he turned around to thank the old man.  Dam it!  He was alone in the lift!  He punched at the door open button, waited for an opening, then ran to the first floor, turned and looked up at the lift.  Shit! Really nobody.<br><br>He waited around the playground for somebody to take the lift with.  Just then, he noticed the swing beside him swing higher and higher with nobody on it.  Dam freaky!<br><br>He did not care anymore, went up to the same lift, alone, took it, went home and had a shower, all the while with bumps on his skins.<br><br>Since then, he always had such encounters.  Never could shake them off.<br><br>Scarrrry!</div>

Normal, right?  Means that the patient inside needs help.  Well, normal except that...<br><br>... the room was empty!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>We turned on the lights in the room, all of us didnt' dare to go inside.  Then one brave Filipino male colleague went in, turned the call bell off (because somehow, we couldn't turn it off from the counter that night!) but the moment he stepped out of the room, it happened again!  So we all gave a short scream, and scrambled away!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>We called the mechanic to come and repair the call bell but it took him a long long time before he could rectify this error.  All the time, he kept mumbling to himself, 'Dunno what's wrong with this call bell.  I turn it off, step out of the room, it turns itself on again!'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I made sure that when I had to pass by that room that month, if it's all dark inside, I look straight and don't peek inside at all!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

It's almost like if we don't acknowledge its presence, it might just get bored and disappear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Most of us are accustomed to stuff like that and we just ignore it.  A minority of us can actually see things, ie. those who supposedly have their '3rd eye' open.  These are the folks who live a haunted life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  One of my colleague's like that.  She often has insomnia and has awful dark eye circles and eye bags.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Most of us get engrossed in our work but then we'll try to stick together, and talk about it after work.  It's almost like you cannot afford to let the spirit(s) know that you're scared or else, it'll stay on and commit more acts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
