            <div class='col-md body'>Just something to share ....<br><br>I just started clearing up my room and wrapping up my life over here today ...<br><br>it's amazing how much baggage one can accumulate over the course of one's life ....<br><br>I threw out four trash bags of stuff today ... each one a piece of my personal history ... from a bunch of obiang ocean pacific polo Tees I bought with my very first temp job paycheck 11 years ago, to knick knacks from long ago dearlings that i've kept for sentimental reasons, to the collection of papers and essays and term tests with A grades on them, to my collection of notes which I know I'll never ever flip through again, not with google, to a CD full of cellphone pics with girls whose names I cannot recall .... to favoured tattered Tees and shorts dating from my preteens ... to momentos and trinkets from long past trips .....<br><br>I realized something today ... that it's important to let go .... to live free ... no wonder I feel so burdened by life sometimes ... because all these while, I have been dragging along through life ... the baggages of my past ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> ... I just realized that I'm still way too young to start looking back at my past ... that I had to look forward, not back ....<br><br>I was so "siao1 xa3" today ... I did not even look back at the dumpster after I threw out all four trash bags of my personal history ..... perhaps sometimes, to cleanse the soul, you need to excise certain pieces of it .....<br><br>my foot steps have became lighter since ..............<br><br>I look forwards to coming back and meeting all you guys ..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I cleaned up my room. As in really cleaned it. Every nook and cranny. Every piece lying around. I cleared at least 6 bags. Books, papers, letters, receipts, photos, pamphlets, namecards, anything, everything. You name it.<br><br>Everything became nostalgic. I'd take a few moments to stop and think back. Remembering the good (or bad) ol' days. I'm still kinda young now... But to think so much has happened in the past few years or more... It's kinda interesting, you learn, you change. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
