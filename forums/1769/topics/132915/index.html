The part of Bunta was first given to the legendary Hong Kong actor/singer Andy Lau Tak Wah, but due to unknown reasons Andy dropped the role, it was then given to Hong Kong actor/singer Anthony Wong Chau Sang. Korean singer Hyori Lee was to play the role of Natsuki Mogi but the role was later given to Japanese actress Anne Suzuki.<br><br>Woohoo!!

I had to find out more <a href="http://www.meggala.com/drift1.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>"Hi drifting is an interesting motorsport it involves controling a car while it is going sideway whether it through a corner or in a straight line the cars set up for drifting have a completly different suspension setup compared to normal or grip racing as it is called. In grip racing you are trying to get the car to stick to the road at the highest speed . Drift racing as all about style and control the better you are the faster you go and the longer you can drift. Time and speed don't play a part really it the skill of the driver, his level of control."<br><br></div>

I might not be a huge fan of Rap, but I feel that Rap has its place in certain situations, certain moments, and all.  Difference types of music complements different moods and scenarios and gets people 'in the right mood'.  For that very reason, I've discovered that I don't truly hate any genre of music.<br><br>Every dog has its day... and each piece of music has its moment.</div>
