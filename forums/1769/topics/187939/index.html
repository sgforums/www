            <div class='col-md body'>What kind of lousy company cultures have you experienced?<br><br>At my ex company, as it is a local owned company, where the management is mostly made up of the owners who are from the same family, you need to report to all of them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Then when you are unsure about something and ask manager A, he'd tell you to go ask manager B, and B would ask you to go ask C, and C in turn would say to ask A. So you go around in a circle.<br><br>Oh yeah, and they look at you weird when you go off on time, or 15 minutes after the end of the working hours, even when you've finished your work or has something on that day.. you get the picture... really sucks.<br><br>The managers also pitched different company goals that kind of confuse you. They'd also blame the employees if they suspect them of doing something wrongly without checking the facts first, e.g. shouting loudly at the employee in front of everyone. Really bad leaders.</div>
