Sorry, was looking at it from the medical/nursing viewpoint.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   It's well known that boob jobs can turn out looking worse than before, and there have been incidences with the implants, dimpling and puckering of the boobs, unequal distribution in both boobs, having to re-do the procedure or return in a few years' time for corrections and all that...<br><br>With blepharoplasty, there are, of course, risks involved too, as with all other surgical procedures but the side effects are lesser, in comparison.<br><br></div>

He was like "SURE AH SURE AH? then i nodded and said some long winded story about how flat I was, how traumatised how.. err it was quite far fetched so I thought he knew.. I was joking leh...  after that we changed topic.. and I forgot ALL abt it<br><br>3 months down the road.. uhh.. I was making cheeky comments about how this lady on TV must be having fake boobs.. uhh.. when he suddenly scolded me "why u scold people?! yours also fake what?!!"<br><br>uhh.. then I realised... all those months.. uhhh.. he thought they were fake... gawd... err didnt seem to affect him though.. him thinking they were fake I mean.
