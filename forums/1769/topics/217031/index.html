            <div class='col-md body'>I got this information from the internet.... hopefully it gives you more helpful information about arthritis.<br><br>If the arthritis is really severe, the doctor will probably put you on anti-inflammatory drugs.  You can also take some supplements like Glucosamine and Shark Cartilage tablets.<br><br>Take care.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><br><br>Arthritis is a general term that means pain, stiffness and often inflammation exist in one or more joints of the body. There are more than 150 forms of arthritis.<br><br>Around one in five Australians has some type of arthritis. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are two common forms of this condition.<br><br>There is no cure for arthritis. However many techniques can help a person manage arthritis, including medication, physiotherapy, exercise and self-education.<br><br>Symptoms of arthritis<br>Arthritis can affect a person at any age. Some forms of arthritis are more common in middle aged or older people.<br><br>The symptoms may include:<br><br>Persistent joint pain aggravated by movement<br>Inflammation indicated by joint swelling, stiffness, redness and/or warmth<br>Loss of flexibility or range of motion in a joint<br>Joint deformity<br>Fatigue<br>Fever<br>Crepitus (the cracking noise arthritic joints make with movement).<br>Sometimes these symptoms are called Â‘rheumatismÂ’. Rheumatism isnÂ’t a disorder in itself, but the word is often used to describe any sort of joint or muscle pain.<br><br>The workings of the joint<br>A joint, like the knee or elbow, is the meeting point between bones that allows movement. The workings of a joint include:<br>Muscle Â– muscle tissue contracts and relaxes, usually in opposite working pairs, to move a joint.<br>Tendon Â– a tough cord that anchors muscle to the bone.<br>Ligament Â– tough cords, like bunches of rubber bands, that bind the bones of the joint together.<br>Cartilage Â– smooth material found between the bones to stop them from grating against each other. It also acts as a shock absorber.<br>Synovial membrane Â– contains lubricating fluid to keep the joint working smoothly.<br>Bursa Â– lubricates the movement of muscle on muscle, and muscle against bone.<br>Eight categories of arthritis<br>Eight categories of arthritis and associated conditions have been identified. These categories are:<br>Inflammatory Â– for example, rheumatoid arthritis. The membrane of the joint becomes inflamed. Other parts of the body can also be affected.<br>Attachment arthritis Â– for example, ankylosing spondylitis. The ligament or tendon attached to the bone becomes inflamed, commonly in the heels and lower back.<br>Crystal arthritis Â– for example, gout. Deposits of microscopic crystals of sodium urate are found in the joint, usually in the big toe.<br>Joint infection Â– for example, staphylococcus. Bacteria infect the fluid inside the joint; commonly found in the hip, shoulder and knee.<br>Cartilage degeneration Â– for example, osteoarthritis. The cartilage of the joint breaks down; commonly found in the knees, neck, lower back, hips and fingers.<br>Muscle inflammation Â– for example, polymyalgia rheumatica. Muscle tissue becomes inflamed.<br>Local conditions Â– for example, tendinitis. A local injury causes pain, such as tennis elbow.<br>General conditions Â– for example, fibromyalgia. A condition characterised by generalised muscle pain and sleep disturbance.<br>Managing arthritis<br>Experiences of living with arthritis can be different from person to person. For an individual, symptoms can vary from day to day. Treatment and management options vary with the type of arthritis, its severity and the sites affected.<br><br>A variety of approaches can be helpful in conjunction with medical management and, in some cases, management by medical specialists known as rheumatologists.<br><br>Health professions and therapies that may assist include:<br>Exercise physiology<br>Physiotherapy<br>Occupational therapy<br>Chiropractics<br>Acupuncture<br>Osteopathy.<br>Other tools to manage arthritis include:<br>Exercise<br>Medication<br>Aids and equipment Â– for example specially designed cutlery, kitchen equipment and garden tools. These can reduce joint strain and save physical energy.<br>Education programs Â– self-management education programs aim to build the confidence of people with chronic conditions including arthritis.<br>The benefits of physical activity<br>Physical activity plays a major role in both managing pain and keeping joints mobile and flexible. It also offers many other health benefits including weight control.<br><br>A person with arthritis can choose from many different types of exercise. A physiotherapist can help design an individual program. Some physical activity options include:<br>Warm water exercises<br>Tai chi<br>Strength training.<br>It is important to balance rest and exercise to avoid injury and fatigue.<br><br>Medications and arthritis<br>Different types of arthritis are treated by different medications which aim to reduce pain and inflammation.<br><br>Medications include:<br>Paracetamol Â– for pain management, particularly for osteoarthritis.<br>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Â– may be prescribed for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. These drugs aim to reduce inflammation.<br>Anti-rheumatic drugs Â– for inflammatory forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid and attachment arthritis. These medications reduce inflammation and slow the progress of joint damage.<br><br></blockquote></div>
