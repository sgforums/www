            <div class='col-md body'>Great article, Kuali Baba!  Thanks for sharing!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  It brought back so many memories!<br><br>It was awesome... we ate sugar cookies and drank F&amp;N Orange Soda and what-not and never became overweight because yeah, we were out having too much fun running around!<br><br>I remember once, I accidentally ran into a steel gate and fell backwards, momentarily stunned from the pain.  Grandma gave one huge yell, 'AIYOH!!!  SUAY AH!!!', then grabbed me with one firm grip, took off her slippers with her other hand, and proceeded to RUB RUB RUB her slipper on my wound!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   Mind you, her slippers had grains of sand and dirt and what-not in it but according to her, that would heal me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I cried and cried, mostly from the pain SHE inflicted with her over-zealous friction cure but hey, I survived with no scar!  hehehe!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Children then were hardy and innovative.  An overturned plastic stool became my stove for cooking porridge as I mimicked the porridge-seller at the market taking orders and cooking... shredded paper became vegetables and meat that we'd 'fry' on our little plastic woks... grandma's rattan cane, when not used to beat us into submission  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> became a fishing rod... grandma's nice round pomelo meant for prayer offering became my huge stone that I'd lug around like a diligent coolie, until of course, grandma realised the mischief I was up to and used her rattan cane to threaten me.  hehehehehe!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I had only a few books at grandma's place but those I know so well, front to back, back to front!<br><br>Once, I also stood on grandpa's bed when he wasn't looking, grabbed the window rails and sang 'Rain, Rain Go Away!' at the top of my lungs and when the rain finally stopped about 25 minutes later, I was so convinced it was because of my singing!  hahahaha!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The innocence of a bygone era...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
