It is included in powders, lotion and skin milk for its high anti-bacterial effects and mild stimulation of the skin.<br><br>The agent, ironically, is also used in products intended to reduce the skin's exposure to ultraviolet rays.<br><br>"I think women should avoid strong and direct sunshine when wearing cosmetics containing methylparaben," said professor Toshikazu Yoshikawa, who headed the team of researchers at the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.<br><br>Yoshikawa's team conducted the research to determine any side effects from normal use of the agent, which has been deemed safe under government standards.<br><br>The researchers added methylparaben to skin cells in a density similar to that used in cosmetics.<br><br>The skin cells were then exposed to about 30 millijoules of ultraviolet rays per square centimetre, about the average daily amount on a summer day.<br><br>About 19 percent of the methylparaben-added skin cells died, while the fatality rate for cells with no methylparaben was only about 6 percent, Yoshikawa said.<br><br>The amount of lipid peroxide-the driving force behind the aging process-in the methylparaben-added cells was almost three times the total in the untreated cells.<br><br>Lipid peroxide is generated inside oxidised cells when exposed to ultraviolet rays.<br><br>Yoshikawa said the findings confirm that methylparaben, when exposed to ultraviolet rays, advances the aging process in skin cells</span><br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/health/view/165072/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/health/view/165072/1/.html</a></div>
