              <p>earn 4K a month and u dunno what to do with it for the past 7-8yrs?</p>
              <p>u should have done something with your money and come out without worries.</p>
              <p>heck, i did things with my 1.6K a month!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u are "giving up" just because of the new fellas?  you are in the industry, they were not. you should be more valuable due to experience.</p>
              <p>if you think u are losing out due to skills (computer language) then u should have continued upgrading all this while or u can go learn it yourself if u really thought out your future properly.</p>
              <p>don't tell me that you have no time.  the most successful people "suffered" to get where they are, if they had no time, they would make time even if it cost them sleep.</p>

              <p>Ok. I will answer your answers based on my thoughts</p>
              <p>1. Considering that you have NO IDEA what to do with your future? yes, do this.</p>
              <p>2. see? NO IDEA. u want to jump into the sea without the ability to swim?</p>
              <p>3. NO IDEA too. See if can start own biz is different from WANT to start own biz.  See if = not sure, not a very good start... business mentality wise.</p>
              <p>4. Either you have enough money to sit around while u take lessons, or u work and take part time lessons.  Looking at your posts, it seems like u still need money, so the first option is out.</p>
              <p>5. you are not comfortable going against the locals, u want to take on the foreigners in their own turf?</p>

              <p>Interestingly, I was in this similar position quite a few years ago when I was in my late 20s.</p>
              <p>My previous job was also in the creative line, and there was just so much saturation in the field. One of the late night's work, staring into the computer, I just felt that whatever I was doing is so meaningless. I can't imagine spending the rest of my life doing this. If you have read Hitchhiker's Guide, I felt doomed to be in the spaceship that was designed to crash.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, I don't have much financial commitments (plus my pay then was lower than yours :P so I decided to quit :) and take some time off to think about what to do with the rest of my life. One of the things I enjoyed was working with children. so, during this period, I took a part time job which involved working with children to make ends' met.</p>
              <p>I grew to enjoy the job so much, I moved on to another job working with children. And now, I am still in this job after many years.</p>
              <p>Does this job require the same amount of work and upgrading and everything? - yes. But because there is interest in it, there is a far greater motivation and enjoyment in the learning. You learn because you want to perform the job better.</p>
              <p>So perhaps think abt what might fuel the passion you have, and explore them?</p>
              <p>Give yourself a time deadline for exploration - so you won't end up bumming and obsolete.</p>
              <p>Even if it means, hey I wanna try the life of a bus conductor for a while - why not? At the very least, even if you return to ur previous job, you will hopefully be rejuvenated and inspired again.</p>
              <p>31 is still young lah. You can still do a career switch.</p>
              <p>Stay inspired.</p>

              <p>before u think i'm some looney bin giving this kind of "advice" to you, here's a little background</p>
              <p>i worked for 7yrs, take home pay 1.4 - 1.6K</p>
              <p>i left my previous job because the hours to money ratio was way too pathetic, but i left knowing what i will do when i get out.</p>
              <p>i sometimes get more, sometimes less or sometimes the same amount of money. But i work way way way way less.  The work to pay ratio is way way way way better.</p>
              <p>either way, i can afford to sit at home the whole month (i've been sitting at home for almost 2yrs already) because i have investments and assets that i sit upon.  things i prepared when i was earning that amount of money.</p>
              <p>i have so much free time that i can take up casual jobs for fun.</p>
              <p>do i have a car? no. what for? its a liability.</p>
              <p>do i pay my bills? yes.</p>
              <p>do i have to work to pay my bills? no.</p>
              <p>what did i do with that pathetic pay i used to get? split to 3 accounts.  savings, allowance, fats.</p>
              <p>savings remain untouched, 10% goes in. allowance cap at $400/month.  everything else is fats.</p>
              <p>fats goes to investments and whatever stuff i gotta pay.</p>
              <p>if i can do that with 1.4 - 1.6K and live comfortably now, i don't see why u need more than 4K to start thinking that you can manage finances.</p>
              <p>i can give u 10K and it will still go down the drain.</p>

              <p>yup, 4k is actually v low considering the hours &amp; most impty the effort i put in.

              <p>Hey! I see wat you are going through. I went through something like that a few years ago when I was super jaded with my job and life although I tried to put a fake front. I was in a better position, as at least I do not have disturbing collegues like yours. But I was quite fed-up with my industry and the way how things were. But commitments made me stick on to the job and the pay then was good too. So I thought it was just a phase in life and it would past, but after months, this "jaded-ness" became worst.</p>
              <p>I thought off exiting the industry and doing other things but like you, having been a num of years in the job, I hav no idea what I can do. Suggestions from close friends include ideas and things I can do to "shake up" my life to see new opportunities, be it in career of life. One of them was Steve Jobs style, i.e. go off to tibet for 3 months.Of course I didn't do that.</p>
              <p>Anyway I just quit my job then. For abt 3 mths, I did some stuff that I have never thought I would do before. I found new groups of friends, and really, job opportunities really did happened. An by 20% luck and 80% personal action (I mean one must take action to seek what you want. Better opportunities do not just pop out like in movies or dramas) I was given the opportunity to join another industry. In fact, I didn't like this job in the past, and I thought people in this job in the past was weak. Now I'm in this job for a couple of years, and so far so good surving on a paycut.</p>

              <p>you are consider lucky to be an interactive art director at 31. I am 29 as a graphic designer but multimedia trained. Me too having this "mid life crisis" problem. Now not sure to go . . . the pay in this industry is really bad. Everywhere are agency and your worked long hours and late nights and your pay doesnt even justify it. I wonder why still so many people go to art schools? Have seen many many people spending a lot of money in art schools then wait till they start to find job in this industry then they will know that being a designer is not as glam as what they seem to be. So messi you are getting 4k is consider very good already. Ofcos being an A.D got lots to handle. You are right about how long can you still staying up late nights, learning new scripts . . . ofcos u can learn new scripts but can you handle like many projects, many changes...etc?</p>
