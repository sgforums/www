              <p>Me, welfare secretary and ah sir was at ah sir's desk and talking about drinking tea.</p>
              <p>Then the whole thing starts on talking about IPPT.</p>
              <p>Then the we joked about all our above 45 years old having to do IPPT soon, and that we have a bonding session coming up involving food.</p>
              <p>So I was making noise about how we should not have food bonding session but jogging session.</p>
              <p>And after the joggings, we can then all bond over mug of Teh O dun wan sugar.....kinda.</p>
              <p>Then I was wondering, should I be using Siew Dai after the teh O.</p>
              <p>Then my ah sir correct me to say I should say Teh O Mai Dai.</p>
              <p>We talk talk talk until our really quiet sweet shy welfare secretary was commenting.....its errr......not mai dai.....its teh o kosong!</p>
