              <p>We are having a food bonding session at the Icon Condo, several units there belong to a family of officers there.</p>
              <p>Then another officer was telling us about how she had originally wanted to buy a unit there with her hub.</p>
              <p>But they decided not to, so they got a hdb.</p>
              <p>Then hor.....they realised that people are making money, buying those icon units and selling them even before its properly built.</p>
              <p>And that started their discussion about properties......and I was weeping at the background when the more they talk.....the more I get depressed.  So there I was sulking in a corner and messing with my handphone......</p>

              <p>but well, whatever properties you guys got, it's still a very good investment, cos my assessment is that property prices are going to stay up in Singapore the way things are going.</p>
              <p>Cos the population target for Singapore's still not reached yet, foreigners, new citizens are pouring in all the time, they all need a place to stay. further more, after the financial crisis and scandals in recent times, people are scared to invest in such financial products and deriviatives nowadays ... and there are a LOT of cash rich people in Singapore .... so where better to park their money than in properties ? ....</p>
              <p>and trust me, despite what the goverment says about a bubble forming, they won't dare do much about it .... cos for most singaporeans, the foundation of their wealth lies in their HDB flats .... it's their biggest asset. the goverment would have an untenable situation on their hands if they were to devalue the people's most valuable asset in the face of such discontent. And there's not much they can do too, really.</p>
