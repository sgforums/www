              <p><br>orh.. i thought here in sgforums..</p>
              <p>knn, the ex-regular occifers who join my department after they finish their contract usually end up being prime assholes.. i still remember once a particular asshole tried to score points when i reported that their bloody ops room mobile phone and photocopier spoilt.. don't want to fix, don't want to replace a 4-year old phone with dead batteries, still dare to write to senior management that things spoil because of "abuse"</p>
              <p>i blasted him so bad and told him to "stop trying to justify yourself and your nonsense and fix the things, they are critical for the ops room" and he still can try to score points, each time, he added more people to the cc list.. as if by adding more, he'll be supported but all it did was to magnify his incompetence..</p>
              <p>until someone really high up told him to stop and go fix the things..</p>
              <p>knn, bloody skin like armour, still can add on and on.. no one cared after that.. and worse, his kar kia (my friend) add one leg, wrote in the mess that he'll go fix the things even if the asshole didn't want to..</p>
              <p>end up the asshole got taken aside and blasted by his head, and a few others from the senior management..</p>
              <p>and then he can go add some more in the huge email chain after everything died down..</p>
              <p>by that time, no one cared anymore, and his kar kia damned dulan with him.. until a stage where he can go "f**k you understand??" to the asshole.. in front of everyone...</p>
              <p>and.. he put down CPT(NS) XXXXX when he first joined my department <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
