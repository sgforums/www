              work.</p>
              <p>wah lao..that 133 bus driver, like to whistle non stop...and
              loud somemore... plus, he like to jam on his brake last min
              when the bus is about 2 metre from the vehicle in front.</p>
              <p>all passengers nearly fall when he approach every bus stop..</p>
              <p>i have to grab the seat for my life...</p>
              <p>nearly puke out my breakfast.!!</p>
              <p>then switch to bus 138.. i was last one to alight the bus when
              reach my place.   the young lady in front of me, kept
              tapping her card, which it din read well and i waited patiently
              behind her..</p>
              <p>Finally she is done, she got down, my turn to tap card...and my
              card went "di" means oki,... before i could take a step forward to
              step out,  THE DOOR CLOSE ON ME...! i turn around and look ad
              the bus driver, the grumbly driver show me a kind of face, and open
              the door. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HELLO, I WAS STANDING THERE ALL THE TIME, and the bus is nearly
              empty!!!!!</p>

              <p>Reminds me of the time I was going to Bedok Camp.... I took a bus all the way to the East Coast Terminal (which is right next to the camp)....</p>
              <p>The uncle thought that the bus was completely empty, and so he shut down the ezlink machines a long way from the terminal.... unfortunately, he didn't realise that I was actually still on the bus.</p>
              <p>Then as the bus was pulling into the terminal, and I walked to the exit, he was shocked to see that there was still someone on the bus.... he sheepishly admitted that he had already shut off the ezlink machines.</p>

              <p>At that time, while I was based at Bedok Camp, 13 was the only service at the terminal. Very few people used the terminal then.</p>
              <p>Speaking of which, once I was returning home from camp..... I waited for no. 13 again at the terminal. I was the only passenger there.</p>
              <p>The bus uncle just boarded the bus and drove off without stopping at the passenger pick-up point first. I suppose he thought there were no passengers there.</p>
              <p>I friggin' chased the bus to the exit junction and hollered at the driver to let me on board. He was shocked to see me, and opened the door for me. Once I was aboard, I blasted him to pieces.... after all, from my observations, it was clear that he didn't even bother to check if there was anyone at the terminal who wanted to board the bus....</p>

              <p>I had this rather amusing bus ride many years ago(before ezlink and stomp existed). Can't remember what bus but I took it from the old clementi bus interchange. the driver waited for us to board, then proceeded to only allow passengers to disembark along the journey. I was taking it to somewhere in Bishan, enjoyed a faster than normal journey while looking at angry people at every bus stop along the way screaming at the bus driver and banging on the door!! Some tried to board from the back but he'd speed off before they could. The driver was a real psycho! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
