              <p>my father in law just had to see the doc on monday too, I brought him to the national eye center, to get some lazer treatment done.</p>
              <p>before that, he was seeing some doc at mount E, recommended by his eldest dotter, who's a tai tai ..... the mount e doc was likely a quack; the gentleman went to see him for problems on his right eye, but his left eye was declared to be "bad" and was operated on first. there were follow up consultations every week, where the doc would shine a light, mutter something, scribble something down in doctor's chicken scratching scrawl, and then send the gentleman on his way, this three minute thing costs $300 each time ......</p>
              <p>fatumnette got fed up, so I told her to bring her dad to the SNEC, know what's the best part, this mount e doc hemmed and hawed when asked to transfer the gentleman's medical records over to the eye center, giving lots of excuses, and finally, he asked for $150 for the records to be released !!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>later on, fatumnette discovered that a lot of fees, which were already paid in cash and visa, were deducted from her and her sister's medisave as well .......</p>
