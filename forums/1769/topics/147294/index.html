            <div class='col-md body'><strong>(HealthDay News)</strong><br><br>-- <span style="color: blue;">Being a desk jockey weighs heavily on workers, according to a study that finds the more a man sits at his desk, the more likely he is to be overweight.<br><br>The finding suggests office work may be an important factor in the obesity epidemic.<br><br>"The current findings present the sedentary workplace as a potentially hostile environment in terms of overweight and obesity," conclude the Australian authors of the study, which appears in the August issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.<br><br>Researchers at Queensland University examined data on nearly 1,600 male and female full-time workers. They found that workers sat an average of more than three hours a day, with 25 percent sedentary on the job for more than six hours a day.<br><br>Higher total daily sitting time was associated with a 68 percent increased risk of being overweight or obese.<br><br>Overall, men sat an average of 209 minutes while at work, 20 minutes more than the average for women. Those extra 20 minutes may make a difference: The study found a significant association between sitting time and overweight and obesity in men, but not in women.<br><br>Getting workers up and exercising may favorably affect their bosses' bottom line, the researchers added. "Time and productivity lost due to chronic diseases associated with overweight and obesity may make it financially worthwhile for employers to be more proactive in the health of their employees by promoting physical activity at work," they wrote</span></div>

Some examples - on her 1st day of job attachment the protagonist was held hostage by a patient who didn't want his leg amputated; later, she was asked to assist in wrapping a woman corpse, and promptly threw up after that, followed by recurring nightmares of the dead woman; on her nightshift, she was so scared of seeing ghosts of dead patients and hearing weird noises, and too scared to visit the toilet, etc. Is it an accurate depiction of your profession?

Most of the time, I don't bother because my shifts are irregular so if I really wanted to watch a series, I'll just go and get the VCD's.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I think I know which series you're talking about.  I saw the VCD's on sale.  The nurses wear this cute pink uniform, right?<br><br>I'm sure to spice things up, they make things dramatic.  But sometimes, as they say, real life can be more dramatic than movies and TV!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>There are quite a few ghost encounters me and / or my colleagues have had.  Sometimes, it scares the hell out of us so much so that when we're on night duty, we'll not go to the locker room alone!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>When I was a student nurse, I remembered this incident where this man with a huge 'hole' at the top of his head came in and the polyclinic nurse who did the dressing had to chuck rolls and rolls of ribbon gauze inside the wound and my schoolmate turned very pale and looked like she was about to faint so someone had to support her and get her out of the room.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And yeah... there are a few pretty interesting moments in my career so far.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Got scandals too, like affairs between doctors and doctors, and docs and nurses!  And then, there are the homosexuality scandals...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I think a few of the families must have been huge fans of such drama series... because sometimes, in the hospital, they put on such a huge, overly-dramatic act of wailing loudly, shaking the patient, crying until they fall to the floor and then thrashing about, etc, that it kinda looks like... drama.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

I thought night shift would end around 7am? Which means you're getting too little sleep?

How come not here har? Being practical, I suppose.

I used to have problem even lifting my right leg up properly, but with pilates, it's improved like 70%, and the backaches aren't recurring so often.
