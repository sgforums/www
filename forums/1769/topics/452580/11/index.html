              <p>and i've come across cyclists who flipped me the bird even after i safely passed them, giving them enough space.. i think they expected me to follow them slowly at 30km/h?</p>

              <p>The way I see it, it's just about having the <em>will</em> to enforce it.</p>
              <p>After all, seat belts did not come with the first car. They were only invented later on, and were made compulsory even later still. I'm pretty sure that drivers were at first highly resistant to the wearing of seat belts until the authorities pursued it aggressively.</p>
              <p>On a similar note, I'm sure we can institute some form of Rider's Education lessons or something in secondary schools, make everyone take Basic Theory at the end of Sec 2, then give all those who pass a licence to cycle on roads. The Traffic Police can be given the mandate to aggressively go after cyclists who break traffic rules.</p>
              <p>So really, I think it's just a matter of having the will to do all that.</p>

              <p>The way I see it, it's just about having the <em>will</em> to enforce it.</p>
              <p>After all, seat belts did not come with the first car. They were only invented later on, and were made compulsory even later still. I'm pretty sure that drivers were at first highly resistant to the wearing of seat belts until the authorities pursued it aggressively.</p>
              <p>On a similar note, I'm sure we can institute some form of Rider's Education lessons or something in secondary schools, make everyone take Basic Theory at the end of Sec 2, then give all those who pass a licence to cycle on roads. The Traffic Police can be given the mandate to aggressively go after cyclists who break traffic rules.</p>
              <p>So really, I think it's just a matter of having the will to do all that.</p>

              <p>The same way we deal with migrant workers who want to drive vehicles. We make sure that they have a valid foreign licence, then make them pass the Basic Theory test before they can cycle on the roads.</p>
              <p>My point here is that it's time to enact proper legislation on cyclists. We can enact laws like requiring everyone to get a licence before they can ride on the road. We can allow exceptions, such as not requiring licensing if people just want to cycle in parks.</p>
              <p>As to whether or not such laws are enforceable...... seriously, it once again comes down to how aggressively the authorities want to enforce them. Surely a good patrolman on a bicycle can chase down a maniacal cyclist if it comes down to that.</p>
              <p>It's just a matter of having the will to do all that. </p>
