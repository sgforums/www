              <p>Agreed. With all this talk about creativity and all, people lose sight of the fact that it was against the law, period.</p>
              <p>In my eyes the girl is just another Michael Fay, only with a more creative streak. If she had been male, I'd have demanded the rotan for the vandal.</p>
              <p>By all means, express your creativity, but not at the expense of good manners like the seeking of approval from the relevant authorities. After all, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was painted only with permission. </p>
              <p>And frankly speaking, people who are trying to defend the girl would certainly not be singing the same tune if the vandal had been, say, a PRC scholar at NUS.</p>

              <p>Well, street art as it's called has always existed outside the boundaries of what's legal (until Banksy's work was put in galleries) and this is how it works. It wouldn't be the same if it was expressed in tamer ways because of how the graffiti artist/vandal chooses the site and the way the message interacts with the environment. It's very different from being given a wall in the mall or skate park and being told to decorate it there. The act of rebellion is missing</p>
              <p>Having said that, there's a risk of getting caught and everyone knows and accepts this. Just because Banksy's work has been "legitimised" in galleries doesn't mean it's no longer a crime. Hypocrisy is at work when we claim that there are 2 different laws for locals and foreigners, or the rich and everyone else, and yet want her to go free.</p>
              <p>However, I'd like to see the stickers remain until they wear off, because they humour and meaning to the urban landscape and make you think for a moment about our behaviours. The city of Bristol has left Banksy's graffiti as it is after all these years. That'll be the sign that the authorities have progressed in their views on creative expression.</p>
