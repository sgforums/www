              <p>Quiche, soup, pasta and sandwiches, even those fancy sounding dessrts like macarons, sticky pudding and panna cotta are definitely everyday food items in Europe. The same goes for Japanese ramen, but look at the difference in prices for renditions of similar quality. I think it's safe to say that we're classier than these organisers, on the basis that we don't reject hawker stalls that sell French, Italian and German food.</p>

              <p>Of course but how can you compare champagne to fortified or distilled drinks? I've only ever had Piper before and it's quite grapey. Cider (the proper barrel-aged stuff and not the chemical soft drinks from Strongbow and Somersby) is good stuff in the summer over ice.</p>

              <p>It totally defeats the purpose of double decks when people are too lazy to go upstairs.</p>
              <p>And we are not talking about old or infirm people - these are mostly fit and healthy undergraduates that we're talking about.</p>
              <p>And surely standing for 1 km over undulating terrain in cramped conditions (during afternoon peak hour traffic) is hardly any better than a short flight of stairs leading to comfortable seats.</p>
              <p>I tell you, admissions standards have dropped. We are admitting people into university who are academically smart but still do not know how to use their brains properly.</p>

              <p>No one wants to go up becoz all of them wants to be the first to alight... same reason why people does not want to move into the train and same reason why ppl like to crowd around at the bus exit door and not moving into the back...</p>
