              <p>Try to help someone in places like these, and you'll get sued for "causing" whatever injuries the victim they sustained. And the drivers would rather kill their victims because a one-time payment to the next-of-kin is less crippling than a lifetime of payments to support a quadriplegic.</p>

              <p>As we would have known now, it rained crazily in the night. And I was giving tuition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case I had to give tuition.</p>
              <p>I had a lot of satisfaction teaching by J2 class then. </p>
              <p>I know I am a slacker who doesnt really prepare for class in detail, but preferring to rely on my innate abilities to help students decipher the concepts and building up their confidence to tackle exam questions.</p>
              <p>But my current bunch of students can only be described as good-for-nothings. I'm so fed up now, that I sit at the back of the class and make them draw and write on the board as I ask questions so that they'll somehow friggin get the logic as taught week after week.</p>
              <p>Did they get it anyway? Nooooooooooooo <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>And last night I watch my 854 Citaro driver do his favourite SMRT stunts.</p>
              <p>1. Hiding behind the SBST rival 25 to let that bus steal all his customers and ensure SMRTB continues bleeding money. And then overtaking the bus once he reaches the less crowded sectors.</p>
              <p>2. Ramming the throttle like fuel is free whenever he can to bankrupt SMRTB.</p>
              <p>3. Stepping on brakes hard to try to melt the brake-pads.</p>
              <p>4. And most disturbingly, creating understeers as the bus brakes violently with tyre screeching.</p>

              <p>Well, the same goes with wedding photographers. At the very least the parents should ask the tutors to bring along photocopies of their academic certs on the first lesson.</p>
              <p>No honest tutor will take offence at that. If you don't check their credentials, then prepare to be burnt.</p>

              <p>I still don't think our education system is so lousy to the extent that the argument for tuition, tuition and more tuition is valid.</p>
              <p>I don't buy that crap.</p>
              <p>I was a product of MOE teaching and I came out fine. It really depends on the drive of the students.</p>
              <p>The way I see it, most should just be sweeping roads if they are so darn uninterested in learning.</p>

              <p>Well, my cousin fired me from teaching his son last year.</p>
              <p>Ok, not really fired. It was more like he let me go by ignoring all my calls and messages.</p>
              <p>Apparently they thought that I was being too harsh with my nephew by making him do homework and scolding him for not doing them.</p>
              <p>Which would have been true, if it hadn't been that the homework always consisted of several basic questions from the kid's school textbook. I just wanted to bridge the weekly tuition sessions with some basic homework. If I had really wanted to tekan the kid, I could have done much worse.</p>
              <p>And you know what's worse? I just learnt that I got replaced by a deadbeat cousin who barely scraped by her O Levels and almost didn't get her diploma.</p>

              <p>It wouldn't be so bad if my cousin had called me up to tell me that he was firing me and replacing me with a university professor.</p>
              <p>But just ignoring me, to the point of very visibly avoiding me at my brother's wedding? That's just plain insulting.</p>
              <p>If they ask me to come back, I'll flip them off. To heck with family ties - if anything, they are the ones who took a dump on the family ties between me and them.</p>
