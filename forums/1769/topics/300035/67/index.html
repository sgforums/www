I think it would help if more parents attend parenting classes. Sometimes, what most children need is a firm, consistent set of discipline (it doesn't need to be physical punishment) Unfortunately, parenting inconsistencies mean that by the time the child is old enough for his behaviour to become a pain - it is too difficult to enforce the necessary discipline. A lot of parents resort again to inconsistent and often severe punishment by this stage which is often too much, too late. It takes time to 'undo' lack of discipline. A lot of parents don't understand why a child behaves in school, and misbehaves at home - and teacher is definitely not using physical punishment (wanna die ah.) - but often ebcos they know teacher means business and mommy and daddy can be bullied <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

I think it would help if more parents attend parenting classes. Sometimes, what most children need is a firm, consistent set of discipline (it doesn't need to be physical punishment) Unfortunately, parenting inconsistencies mean that by the time the child is old enough for his behaviour to become a pain - it is too difficult to enforce the necessary discipline.</div></blockquote></div>

The complexities of being consistent 24/7 through the years of going up can be very difficult.<br><br>My friend, a teacher, shared about her experience with her 2 year old son. She is firm about what time her child goes to bed every night - at 8 pm. However, issues with family cropped up, and for 2 weeks the child went to sleep late. All sorts of behaviour problems cropped up due to this little inconsistency. It took her a lot of patience to slowly adjust him back to his schedule and the behavioural problems disappeared.<br><br>Many don't realise how even small incidents like these have repercussions - yet, how many people can practice CONSTANT VIGILANCE!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's not a matter of caning or whatever either.. it's just that there are parents out there who believe their little brats must never be scolded, punished or anything at all.. which makes it horrible as the brat never learns responsibility and is shielded from everything.. including consequences of their own misdeeds...<br><br>remember the brat screaming and making a general nuisance of himself in Borders?  people still think the stranger should have also slapped the mother of the brat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShrodingersCat:</div><div class="quote_body">yah.. there will be parents like this I guess.. i think a lot of them buy into the 'love' method.. but don't realise that.. the complete method is love AND logic.<br><br>But my dad was a ... caner.
