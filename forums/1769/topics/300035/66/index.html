Anyway, we ended up getting the stuffs from Harvey Norman. Lots of $$ just go out of the window......<br><br>On the bright side, we only have to wait till now to buy them as my in-laws gave us their old fridge and freezer when we first moved into our house.  Imagine to have to buy those when we first got the house, on top of the wedding and other expenses.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The fridge is not cold enough and the milk keeps on going off before the used by date.  The freezer, on the other hand, the top 2 drawers stop to freeze a few months ago.  In Oz, it might cost you more to get a technician out to fix it than to get a new one.  We did try to get one to look at our fridge and he couldn't find anything wrong.

It is a new condo, though, how many blocks they will be building, I have no idea.<br><br>Especially since the site it occupies used to be a triangle island surrounded by roads.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
