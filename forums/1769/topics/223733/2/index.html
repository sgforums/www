We arrived at the 12 apostles just in time for the sunset...and i dare say that was the most beautiful scene i had ever seen wif my own eyes. On the way back..we stopped by a town called Lorne for dinner, where they serves the biggest seafood basket a person could ever ask for.

Heaps of marine life in those shipwreaks and submarines. Water gets a little bit cold. Watch out for great whites.... crayfish and abalone are in huge abundance. These things make great meals after your dive.</div>

You seem to have had a really awesome time!  You remember the names of the places too!  Sadly, my memory is really awful these days and it was only when I saw your post that I realised, "Oh yeah!  Those were the names of the places we went to!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Thanks for sharing your experience of Great Ocean Road.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   I really want to return to that place, probably driving my own li'l car and putting up at a cozy place there for a few days so I can spend more time there and really do that place justice!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>BTW, the cheeky driver cum guide told us, "There!  Can you see the whale out in the sea?!" when we drove past an area that supposedly had whale sightings and we all went "Where?!  Where?!" and started to crane our necks and get our cameras ready, then he suddenly laughed and said, "Pulling your legs!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>So, when we passed by an area of wild Eucalyptus trees and he slowed the coach and pointed up at a tree and said, "There!  Koala!!", we thought he was kidding but nope!  There really WAS a koala!  In fact, we spotted more than a few wild koalas high up in the Eucalyptus trees either having their afternoon siesta or chewing away!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Too bad my camera couldn't take close-up's at that distance!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   HOWEVER, I DO have shots of koalas taken during my visit to the Koala Conservatory but I'll put those up another day!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Several times, in fact, from LA to SF along the PCH, when I was out in CA visiting my sisters.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Rhonda:<br><br>And this is London Bridge!  There used to be land hanging over the waters connecting the two bits but it collapsed recently, leaving tourists stranded on the outer bit but thank goodness, no one was killed when it collapsed.  Helicopters were called in to rescue the stranded tourists.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/The%20Great%20Coach%20Trip/078_78.jpg"><br>[/b]</blockquote>We were told by our guide that there was actually a couple who was having an affair that went off for a secret getaway on this thing when the bridge collapsed that fateful day. So they were stranded there for a few hours. And what shock it was to be on national tv, when they were not supposed to be there at all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
