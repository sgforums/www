              <p>Of course we don't expect them to release information that other prisoners can use to plan their escape, but they do need to be more accountable for such a serious breach of security!  I worry about what this man is up to now.  I worry about the devastation and deaths he can cause.  The public outcry and backlash on this matter must remain strong.</p>
