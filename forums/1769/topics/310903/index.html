              <p>Prices of what?  Accommodation, maybe.  Food and transport prices remain the same.  Well, at least, food in the places I frequent.  I'm not venturing anywhere near the F1 this year - work and studies beckon, and the blardy lousy weather puts a damper on everything else.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Soon, I shall get to wake up to the thunderous roar of the F1 cars!  Kewl!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>*me mysteriously appears in a puff of smoke*</p>
              <p>Going for the FS's colleague's little daughter's birthday party later.... I helped to order the cake from Royal Cakes. Si beh expensive..... $61.50 for 1.5kg. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>
              <p>But the service was horrendous.... be prepared for a super-long rant:</p>
              <p>1. Last Wednesday I made a telephone booking, and I told the girl that 'I want Cake number WC20'. She claimed that it was not in her catalogue, and I told her: 'But it's right here on your website!!!!!'</p>
              <p>She kept insisting she was right..... until she realised that she was reading the wrong catalogue. Kaoz....</p>
              <p>I asked for an order reference number, but she said that I didn't need one. Bear this in mind....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. A deliveryman from Royal Cakes called me yesterday, saying that 'Hi Sir, I'm on my way to delivering your 2kg cake to Island Resort at East Coast Park.'</p>
              <p>The thing is..... my order is for TODAY, and I'm picking it up myself at their outlet later!</p>
              <p>The deliveryman then said he would checked.... and he realised that the girl in (1) had messed up my order with some other person's order. Kaoz....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3). A full investigation was ordered, and the manager called me back to explain.</p>
              <p>She referred to me as 'Madam Fauziah'...... those of you who know my real name would know that 'Madam Fauziah' is incredibly, incredibly far from my real name. And any damn idiot would know that 'Madam Fauziah' is a woman's name while my voice is surprisingly.... masculine.</p>
              <p>She also asked me for my order number.... but because the silly girl in (1) didn't give it to me, I couldn't tell the manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I told her, point blank: 'HOW THE FLYING FREAK CAN I TRUST YOU IDIOTS TO FULFILL MY ORDER PROPERLY IF YOU CAN'T GET THE BASICS RIGHT?!?!'</p>
              <p>I made her promise me that I would have no problems at all when I go to pick up the cake later..... or else......</p>
