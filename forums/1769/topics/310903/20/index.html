              <p>The problem is, I can't juggle the course fees and the subsequent temporary drop in income as some work hours are sacrificed for school, nor would I be able to have the time to learn driving whilst doing the course. </p>
              <p>You have no idea how intense the Post-Graduate Diploma in Critical Care Nursing gets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Everyone who went through it, or are going to it, scream bloody murder!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  I start the prelude to the actual course in June... I am quite fearful of the theory and the clinical hurdles I have to demonstrate competence in.  I think going through my Management and Office Admin courses were easier - you can kinda bluff your way in those subjects, but not in Nursing / Medicine / Science / Maths / Law... </p>
              <p>I am keen to do the course though... because by the end of it, I will be as good as the rest of my mates!  So good that I can glance at the ECG on the screen and diagnose, "This guy has a past history of IHD in the anterior section of his heart and he also has a 3rd degree heart block right now."</p>
              <p>Even better still, go up to the doctors and tell them, "I think the patient has an ischaemia and we have to send him to the cath lab to be stented stat!"</p>

              <p>Sigh... just last weekend, I met my dream man...</p>
              <p>He's a contemporary British man who is now an Aussie.  He played Rugby in his younger days.  Now, he's a Managing Director.  The minute I stepped into his room, I felt something different about him.  He just had this 'it' factor.  He's in his 40's and oooh, he's soooooo gorgeous!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  I feel myself blushing just talking to him... </p>
