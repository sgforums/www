              <p>Yes.  And that's how the phrase 'designer babies' was coined - it refers to embryos that were implanted because it was somehow deemed to be genetically 'flawless'.  Well, as 'flawless' as detectable with the latest technology anyways.</p>

              <p>some societies are certainly more "egalitarian" than others ... Canada is a pretty class free society, unless you're in the criminal classes of course ...</p>

              <p><br>PRC there are like 3 kinds I think.</p>
              <p>1. The labourers which are loud and crass and basically stick to themselves</p>
              <p>2. The sex workers :P</p>
              <p>3. White Collar workers. These tend to intergrate better with Singaporeans. I know quite a few and sometimes I think they are more Singaporean than I am in terms of kiasu-ness. Especially those who started a family here don't wanna go back to China because their kid cannot adapt back there :x</p>

              <p>I had a very open discussion with an Aussie patient yesterday.  He's a well-travelled man and has been exposed to many different cultures.  We got talking about the different types of Chinese and I told him openly that a lot of Aussies make the mistake of assuming that all Chinese are from China because Chinese from other countries might just feel insulted to be categorised with the PRC's and he agreed!  He says he notices the differences between the Chinese in Hong Kong, PRC and Singapore. </p>
              <p>I confess that when people mistake me for a Japanese, I'm flattered.  When they mistake me for a Korean, I kinda don't mind.  BUT, when they mistake me for a PRC, ggggggrrrrrrrr!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
