              <p>Going for the FS's colleague's little daughter's birthday party

              <p>But the service was horrendous.... be prepared for a super-long

              <p>1. Last Wednesday I made a telephone booking, and I told the
              girl that 'I want Cake number WC20'. She claimed that it was not in
              her catalogue, and I told her: 'But it's right here on your
              website!!!!!'</p>
              <p>She kept insisting she was right..... until she realised that
              she was reading the wrong catalogue. Kaoz....</p>
              <p>I asked for an order reference number, but she said that I
              didn't need one. Bear this in mind....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. A deliveryman from Royal Cakes called me yesterday, saying
              that 'Hi Sir, I'm on my way to delivering your 2kg cake to Island
              Resort at East Coast Park.'</p>
              <p>The thing is..... my order is for TODAY, and I'm picking it up
              myself at their outlet later!</p>
              <p>The deliveryman then said he would checked.... and he realised
              that the girl in (1) had messed up my order with some other
              person's order. Kaoz....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3). A full investigation was ordered, and the manager called me
              back to explain.</p>
              <p>She referred to me as 'Madam Fauziah'...... those of you who
              know my real name would know that 'Madam Fauziah' is incredibly,
              incredibly far from my real name. And any damn idiot would know
              that 'Madam Fauziah' is a woman's name while my voice is
              surprisingly.... masculine.</p>
              <p>She also asked me for my order number.... but because the silly

              <p><br>Sounded like my recent experience at a vet's...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After visiting the vet, they took a sample of my cat's fur and said will call me when the results comes out after 3 days. I also noticed that they spelt my name wrongly on the chit, but it was a small typo error so I did not bother to correct them since I left the vet's liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they did not call. So eventually I called them</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although I spelt out my cat's name SEVERAL TIMES - XIAO XIAO - asked them if they could track me down using my IC? Address? Telephone number? but somehow their database was tagged ONLY to pets' names (imagine if I called my cat.. meowmeow or meowmie or something!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally they called me back and said they called me BUT I gave a wrong number. So I was like.. Hmm okay mebbe I have bad handwriting - then he read out the wrong number I 'gave' them - which was COMPLETELY different. THEN I said Noooooo that is NOT my number. Then he checked my address - AND the address was COMPLETELY different too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now I am a bit worried whether the medicine they gave my cat is correct or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sekali my cat does have ringworm after all.</p>

              <p><br>Sounded like my recent experience at a vet's...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After visiting the vet, they took a sample of my cat's fur and said will call me when the results comes out after 3 days. I also noticed that they spelt my name wrongly on the chit, but it was a small typo error so I did not bother to correct them since I left the vet's liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they did not call. So eventually I called them</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although I spelt out my cat's name SEVERAL TIMES - XIAO XIAO - asked them if they could track me down using my IC? Address? Telephone number? but somehow their database was tagged ONLY to pets' names (imagine if I called my cat.. meowmeow or meowmie or something!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally they called me back and said they called me BUT I gave a wrong number. So I was like.. Hmm okay mebbe I have bad handwriting - then he read out the wrong number I 'gave' them - which was COMPLETELY different. THEN I said Noooooo that is NOT my number. Then he checked my address - AND the address was COMPLETELY different too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now I am a bit worried whether the medicine they gave my cat is correct or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sekali my cat does have ringworm after all.</p>

              <p>There are still non-aircon public buses operating in SG?</p>
              <p>Anyway, it got up to 49°F here today, and most of the snow has already melted. Spring is definitely in the air. Went grocery shopping just after work today and noticed a fair number of people out in short-sleeved t-shirts. Some were even wearing bermudas!</p>

              <p><br>There's abt 95 non aircon double decks, 34 non aircon single decks</p>
              <p>Aft Apr 5, only 31 non aircon single decks left... This remaining 31, not all appears either as some as spare buses... You can still see them at City Hall, Bugis &amp; SMU cos 3 of them serves SBS Sv 32 and 1 more on Sv 186 serving Shenton Way</p>
              <p>Aft end of tis year, only the 95 non aircon double decks remain until at least 2011 or the most 2013</p>
