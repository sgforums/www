              <p>but yeah, there were plenty of excuses as well .... when I was
              still a chao botak in hendon, reporting sick was like being
              interrogated as prisoners of war ...</p>
              <p>there were a bunch of MO's who thought their slackened commando
              occifer conversion course makes their balls bigger, and thought
              every report sick case from the botaks were chao keng cases ...</p>
              <p>we had to report sick in full pack, and sit cross-legged in the
              court yard in the sun for hours till the MOs deems himself ready to
              see us ...</p>
              <p>and invariably, they'll call up the medics to practise inserting
              IVs on the chaps who report sick ... those farkers will order IVs
              for whatever fark reasons ... stomache, fever, leg pain, back pain,
              whatever, doesn't matter ... it's all IV practise for the medics
              .... maybe the medical council should investigate these MO farkers
              ....</p>
