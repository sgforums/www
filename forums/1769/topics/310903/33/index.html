              <p><a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20080320-55416.html"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.asiaone.com/News/Educatio...320-55416.html</span></a><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;">'Weak' poly student snubbed at NUS open house</span> <img src="http://www.asiaone.com/a1media/site/common/blank.gif" border="0" alt=""><br><br>I AM writing about my experience at the NUS open house last Saturday. I was initially excited but the pleasant experience was dashed by the attitude of a lecturer/professor from the Life Science Department. I waited a while for a lecturer to be free as all were engaged in conversation with fellow prospective students, and when this lecturer was free, I proceeded to ask her a few questions.<br>When I identified myself as a poly student, her attitude changed. I enquired about the school's requirements for the admission of a poly student, and her reply was that the school only accepts 'the best of the best' and that poly students were 'the weaker ones'. What upset me was that she said all this in a deprecating tone. I continued my enquiries with a smile. She then told me: 'We take in about 50 students, with more than 200-300 students applying. We only take in the best students, including international students and you would have to compete with all these students applying. It does not matter whether you are a Singaporean or not."<br>I am not a poly student with an unrealistic dream. I do not expect that being a Singaporean can get me into NUS more easily then overseas students. So what did she mean by her statement? I understand I have to compete not only with my fellow countrymen, but also international students. It is sad that people in the teaching profession still has the mindset that poly students are 'the weaker ones'.<br><strong>Ong Ruo Yan (Ms)<br></strong></p>
