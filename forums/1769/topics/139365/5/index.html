Basically, what we are doing is making up for each other flaws like he can't write letters and hate filling up forms whereas I know nuts about the difference between a wrench and a crowbar.

Anyway, I'm not going to comment on what I think she thinks but on what I think she wrote about, in my opinion (like anyone cares  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) Anyway, I think in today's context the word 'obey' carries a very negative meaning....kinda you obey because you're a slave.....<br><br>Anyway, my dad, like most dad's have the old and ancient dark ages mentality that a woman's place is at home, in the kitchen (Actually I think he has conflicting views too - He thinks my mum should work and take care of the house at the same time, anyway that is him and my mum have accepted from day one that he will not help out with the housework)<br><br>Therefore, in view of that, I do not think that To love, is to obey. But it is more like, To love, is to accept who the person really is, within reasonable limits, meaning that the person is not abusive for example.<br><br>Take me and Chris for example. I don't think there is a clear defination on who is the 'leader' in our relationship. For certain stuff, he is the main decision-maker though he ask me for my views, and for other things, I'm the main decision-maker though I seek his point of view as well. Basically, what we are doing is making up for each other flaws like he can't write letters and hate filling up forms whereas I know nuts about the difference between a wrench and a crowbar. It really all boils down to mutual respect and recognizing each other strengths and weaknesses, so in a way, you can say, "To Love, is to Accept and compliment each other"<br><br>We also stay out of each other's way when the person is in a bad mood. If the person were to lash out for no reason, we hold our tongue because it will lead to nothing but arguments. <span style="color: red;">We just wait for the party to cool down before sitting down to thrash it out like adults. Be it man or woman, we have our moods and tempers.</span> Though it is not right to take it out on each other but keep in mind that the person didn't mean to, it's just that you were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Just be there for the person and they will cool down once the pressure is out.<br><br>I agree with her strongly though, never ever put your partner down in front of others. This applies to both the guy and the girl. This is BASIC mutual respect.<br></div></blockquote>I think the best way is to try to explain carefully in a proper tone instead of screaming. Patience also has to come in when you allow time for your partner to express their views. Communication is a skill, very important to a couple.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Waah... Elindra showed me the article before she put up the thread but I was too tired and then got too busy to comment and after a day or so, a 5-page thread!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I felt kind of uncomfortable reading the article.  It sounded a tad contrived to me, as if the writer was trying to convince herself that she likes doing the things she claims she does.  Know what I mean?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>The word 'obey' has negative connotations to me.  Let's look at the synonyms for 'obey' in the thesaurus.  A search yielded the following :<br><br>abide by, accede, accept, accord, acquiesce, act upon, adhere to, agree, answer, assent, <span style="color: red;">bow to</span>, carry out, comply, concur, discharge, embrace, execute, follow, fulfill, give in, give way, heed, hold fast, keep, <span style="color: red;">knuckle under</span>, live by, mind, observe, perform, respond, serve, submit, <span style="color: red;">surrender, take orders</span>.<br><br>I have trouble accepting the subtle insinuations of the word 'obey' as shown in the synonyms I've highlighted in red.  Those words like 'bow to', 'surrender', 'knuckle under', etc all suggest a higher 'authority' that one is under and has no choice but to 'surrender' or succumb to.<br><br>I'd rather think that instead of quiet obedience, there's a partnership in the decision-making instead.  Each of us are good in different areas, and why can't we use our strengths to make up for the weaknesses of our spouse?  Even if he's making all the decisions, calling all the shots, he still doesn't expect us to blindly 'obey' but he would consult us, seek our opinions, have a discussion, and then reach a final decision / compromise?  There's no need for power-play in a relationship, I feel, because if you love someone, you won't be looking to make your spouse 'take orders', 'execute orders', 'submit' to you or worse, 'surrender' to ... your Lordship?!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Whoa... it's gettin' hot in here... those words are good in a different context  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ... if you know what I mean!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>OK, back to the topic!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>We don't make good decisions all the time.  When I get married and I realise that my husband is going to make a dodgy decision that might have bad consequences, I will gently step in to point out the dangers to him and discuss alternative solutions.  I sure hope that he won't be so 'ba dao' / dictatorial that he will not listen and expect me to blindly obey, because I cannot and I won't go against logic and I cannot just stand by and watch our ship sink.<br><br>To love is to 'obey', as in, to 'accept, accord, acquiesce, agree, assent, concur,  and embrace' my spouse's decisions.  I will accord him the respect by not belittling him and shattering his fragile ego whilst we're discussing about things.  Because I love him, I will tread carefully when I have to tap him on the shoulder, and point out the possible dangers ahead.  But sorry, to blindly obey, especially when you see that he's steering the ship towards a huge iceberg, just does not cut it for me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I would probably love him too much to see him walk into a ravine and will definitely 'disobey' by gently but firmly grabbing hold of his hand and together, walk around the ravine, and not into it together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
