            <div class='col-md body'>Has outsourcing of the parking warden's job to United Premas Limited, a private firm, led to an unprecedented level of policing in HDB car parks?<br><br>This has resulted in motorists getting numerous fines within a short span of time, and car owners don't have sufficient time to react and adopt appropriate measures.<br><br>One wonders what are the terms of the outsourcing contract and whether United Premas is paid a management fee or are the wardens earning commissions by issuing summonses.<br><br>Within a week, I received four parking summonses, leaving me no time to breathe. Firstly, car owners are usually given one week to settle a summon with a composition fine. I do not see why one should pay the fine immediately as if one owes the loan shark money.<br><br>Secondly, the HDB states that a car owner will not be allowed to apply for season parking until all outstanding fines are settled. Most Singaporeans are busy and do not give top priority to the payment of parking fines.<br><br>Shouldn't one be given more time to take appropriate measures, like paying the fine and applying for a season parking coupon at the same time?<br><br>Apparently, United Premas does not think so and its wardens have been visiting the same car parks day and night. It appears too enthusiastic in issuing parking summonses to poor car owers who do not have sufficient time to react accordingly.<br><br>I would like the HDB and United Premas to come clean and let the public know how does the outsourcing contract work and what advantages United Premas gets out of this contract.<br><br>I would also like the HDB to let the public know what it thinks is an appropriate and reasonable timeframe for car owners to pay their fines.<br><br>Most of us are busy people and it is definitely not a wise move to shove parking tickets down our throats by issuing new ones every day and driving car owners up the wall. The HDB and United Premas should learn to be more transparent and reasonable to car owners.<br><br>Alex Ng Xun-Yi<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forums.<br><br>Parking wardens should be commended, not lambasted, for doing job<br><br>I read with disbelief the letter 'Has outsourcing led to more policing by wardens in HDB car parks?' by Mr Alex Ng Xun-Yi (ST Online Forum Oct 31).<br><br>Here is a classic case of one trying to shift the blame when he is obviously at fault. Mr Ng has no one to blame but himself for being fined four times in one week.<br><br>Firstly, he could have easily avoided all this by displaying a parking coupon. The excuse he gives about being too busy is an extremly lame one. How much time does it take to tear a parking coupon? Surely less than one minute.<br><br>Secondly, he lambasts United Premas' parking wardens for doing what they are paid to do and asks them to come clean. What is there to come clean about? They are just doing their job, which is to check for parking offenses.<br><br>He is complaining because they are doing a better job than the previous administration. May be he preferred the old administration because he could save money by not displaying coupons and still not get caught?<br><br>In fact, I would like to compliment United Premas for doing an incredible job after taking over the job for HDB. At the HDB carpark at my place, people who previously did not buy season parking tickets or display coupons are now doing it because of the frequent checks.<br><br>Previously, the wardens came only once a month and as the fine was less than the season parking fee, it made economic sense to some people to risk a fine. This to me is cheating and it is as bad if not worse than the fare cheats on public transport.<br><br>If fare cheats can be jailed, Mr Ng should thank his lucky stars that HDB parking is not under the Public Transport Council.<br><br>United Premas should continue its great work and not change its policy. Only by sending the wardens many times in a week to check the car parks can we drive home the point that no matter how busy people are, they should still obey the rules or face the consequences.<br><br>Teh Hoe Leng<br></div>
