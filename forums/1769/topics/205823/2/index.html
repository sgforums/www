            <div class='col-md body'>I wun say that cannot means cannot. Everyone can do maths lah.....<br><br>But i do believe that certain people do have more flair for numbers than some people. I got B3 for A and E maths in my O levels but if u ask me, whether i am good at maths, I will say no. I scored B3 becos I wanted the grades. Some of my frens can understand the formulaes very well and thus it comes easy to them... for me, i look at the formulaes, I switch off immediately liao. It is the same when i took my accounting module in poly and uni haha. I have no interests in subjects like maths mainly becos in the world of maths, most of the time, there is only one right answer...it isnt a very 'creative' subject  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

My boss... notwithstanding disagreements, is a person who could bring history to life, and I guess through him, I had the opportunity to open my eyes to the past. And ... ya.. through history, the value of something becomes very different. It's like getting to know a person, and if you know what he's been through, suddenly you can't help but respect him a bit more for all that.<br><br>But ooh.. we were talking abt maths <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
