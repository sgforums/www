            <div class='col-md body'>well, this is one of the things that has been bugging me.. people who say they "cannot do math" and people who "can do math"<br><br>i've always thought math, all you needed to do for the level we do, is to look at the problem with a different perspective... and to use the different types of tools to solve it..<br><br>all you need is a good teacher to show the way and light the path...<br><br>those who "say they cannot" (note the quotation marks) seem to spend an inordinate amount of time and energy trying to convince others they cannot.. instead of using the imagination and effort into understanding the problem and finding ways to solve it... i wager, if you did use the time and effort towards the problem, you'd solve it.. and from there, build on it and the mind becomes more adept at mathematical stuff...<br><br>before the flamethrowers come out, here's the deal of why i say these things:<br><br>i could not.. but someone taught me to be imaginative and to go for it.. and showed me the way... and yes, i saw.. and saw that (our level) math isn't that difficult.. all it took was a different perspective, and effort with the will to do it.. you can..<br><br>my sister too.. there was once i broke an equation into 17 colour-coded lines for her when it could be done in 3 lines.. she could not at that time because she refused to see it... trying more to convince me that she could not.. but ultimately, she scored A1 for her E-Math and passed her AO Math..<br><br>so... what do you think?  i don't believe "cannot means cannot" while the person shows so much creativity, effort and will just to show that he cannot <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>(p.s. this does not mean the insanely complex math required for stuff like Fermat, Goldbach or Riemann Hypothesis <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShrodingersCat:</div><div class="quote_body">-scratch head-<br><br>Comparatively, I am a 'typical' arts student, i.e. much better at my humanities than maths. E Maths was interesting cos.. well its really APPLICATION, but I began to find A maths confusing cos of the formulas. Like you said, thanks to a very GOOD tuition teacher, I manage to do ok for both subjects, so a good teacher really helps. So trigo and calculus is OKAY but if you talk about differentiation and integration... I am boggled.<br><br>But I tell you hor.. I remember before O levels A maths exams, I sat outside my door and cried, feeling so helpless and worried.<br><br>... but when I tried Maths C in JC.. I found it way beyond my grasp. I could not understand what the teacher was saying and struggled constantly. It doesn't help that teachers propagate the stereotype that arts students are not good at it. (I had a teacher told us not to waste her time and our time and drop Maths C in JC. Eventually I did. My friends told me of another teacher who told them to drop A maths cos they would all fail anyway).<br><br>I think for most people, the problem they have with maths is<br><br>1. Teacher<br>2. Understanding of concept<br>3. Memory. Can't remember the formulas.<br>4. Application. Can't remember which formulas for what.<br>5. Carelessness.<br>6. Lack of confidence.<br></div></blockquote>You forgot the linguistic presentation of the problem. English is a very tricky language.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">I retake my O level but still failed..<br><br>I think it was bcos I was very demoralised by my darn sec 1 teacher who always chose me to solve maths problem.. and if I failed to solve, I had to remain standing for the whole period.  Also, my sec 4 E Maths teacher then.. whenever he sees me, he will mock and me and say "xxxxxx, u are a born failure!".  All the humiliation and emabrrassment..<br><br>I dropped A Maths, bcos I wanted to concentrate on E Maths.. but I made the wrong move..<br><br>I got D7, no matter how hard i tried.<br><br>but I dun have much problem doing accounting and business statistics..<br><br>i think it's that darn teacher I had that really killed my interest for Maths.<br></span></div>
