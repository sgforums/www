            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NEW YORK (AFP) - Atkins Nutritionals Inc. (ANI), </strong><span style="color: blue;">the company founded by the late, low-carb diet pioneer Robert Atkins, said it had filed for bankruptcy protection.<br><br>A company statement said Monday that the filing in US Bankruptcy Court in New York marked the final step in efforts to reorganise the business, which has been hit by waning interest in the once phenomenally popular, meat lovers' diet.<br><br>The company listed assets of 301 million dollars and liabilities of 325 million dollars.<br><br>The company said it had secured 25 million dollars in financing from creditors to operate during the bankruptcy proceedings, which it insisted would not impact day-to-day operations.<br><br>"In the past year we have adjusted our organisation to accommodate a smaller business and have begun to position the Atkins brand more broadly for consumers who are concerned about health and wellness," said ANI president Mark Rodriguez.<br><br>ANI, which sells its low-carb products in more than 30,000 stores across the United States and Canada, will focus its energy on its "core nutrition bar and shake portfolio," Rodriguez said.<br><br>"I am confident in our future," he said. "We expect to proceed quickly and will emerge from these proceedings with a significantly improved balance sheet and greater operating flexibility."<br><br>Atkins, who founded ANI in 1989, died in April 2003 after slipping on some ice on the way to work.<br><br>The New York medical examiner's report into Atkins's death said he had a history of congestive heart failure and hypertension -- a diagnosis that helped fuel criticism of his dietary theories.<br><br>First published in 1972, the Atkins diet advocated a counter-intuitive approach to dieting that stressed consumption of high-protein, fatty products, at the expense of carbohydrates.<br><br>According to Atkins's theories, eating virtually no carbohydrates causes the body to enter a state known as ketosis, in which it uses stored body fat as fuel.<br><br>The unique selling point was that if dieters stuck to certain types of foods, principally meat, fish, eggs and dairy products, they could theoretically eat as much as they want and yet still shed weight.<br><br>Initially, the concept had few takers. But ringing endorsements from high-profile Atkins adherents like Hollywood stars Rene Zellweger, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston helped transform a minority fad into am entrenched regimen.<br><br>Just a few years ago, ANI claimed that about 25 million Americans were on the Atkins diet and nearly 100 million were adhering to some sort of "controlled carbohydrate" diet.<br><br>While Atkins's detractors insisted those figure were inflated, the economic impact was undeniable.<br><br>While demand for meat products surged, consumption of grain staples slumped so badly that leaders of the US bread industry convened an emergency in 2003 to discuss strategy for countering the "Atkins effect."<br><br>In the past two years, however, the Atkins diet has begun to lose its popularity, as other dietary regimens have come into favour and concerns have grown over the long-term health impact of the Atkins method.<br><br>According to a review of scientific data published in The Lancet a year ago, the Atkins Diet lacked essential proof to show it is effective for more than a year and safe in the long term.<br><br>"There is no clear evidence that Atkins-style diets are better than any others for helping people to stay slim and despite the popularity and apparent success of the Atkins diet, evidence in support of its use lags behind," the report said.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you read closely, on the packaging of most slimming products, and yes, that includes those on the recent ads aired on TV - you know which ones, there's always some fine print stating the side effects that are most commonly, diarrhoea.  Xenical has that side effect on an even worse scale - fecal incontinence!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Prolonged and / or excessive diarrhoea can bring about dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the body.  Depending on the severity, the damage done can become a chronic issue.<br><br>Remember Slim 10?  The liver is the body's 'safety mechanism' as that's where toxins are detoxified.  The liver is also 'in charge' of dealing with excess lipids (fat).  Therefore, if you consume any slimming tablets, it's bound to pass through your liver at some stage.  Now, we won't know what sort of damage it does because remember - a lot of drug recalls happened only after the drug has been in use for a considerable amt of time.  Remember Phenfen, the 'miracle' slimming drug that was quickly pulled off the shelves only months after it was approved, because it was causing cardiac episodes in users.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Ask kops how he lost weight - good ol' exercise and good ol' discipline.

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, there's a simple and effective way to keep fit:<br><br>Eat a decent, well-balanced diet. Exercise regularly.<br><br>It will take a while for you to lose weight, but hey, you didn't gain all that weight all of a sudden either.<br><br>I have always been one of the critics of the Atkins diet. Theoretically it may make sense. From what I can figure, by cutting down on the carbs, you force your body to go into ketosis, forcing it to burn fat instead as its source of fuel. The high-protein diet would in turn help to build up muscle, thereby stoking your metabolic furnace (causing you to burn fat faster).<br><br>When you really think about it, though, it has all the makings of a disaster in the long run. For starters, by depriving yourself of carbs, you end up depriving yourself of one major source of energy. Fats don't burn as efficiently as carbs do. You will end up feeling lethargic much of the time. As Bear (was it Bear?) said, you're in quasi-starvation mode.<br><br>The Atkins diet has also been linked to increased risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, and kidney failures.<br><br>Come on.... we're Asians. We've been eating rice for hundreds of years, and has it really brought about huge numbers of fat people around?</div>
