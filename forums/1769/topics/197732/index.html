            <div class='col-md body'>Personal accountability is totally missing. Passing the blame becomes the weapon of choice.<br><br>This is already happening in Singapore wear parents blames everyone else when their children screws up. Or ignoring these kids when they do dangerous things like running along the aisle of MRT trains and using the hand rings on the buses as monkey bars. When these kids get injured, they blame the driver, the system, but never themselves.<br><br>When these kids messes up their grades, they blame the teachers for not teaching. Obviously there are some teachers that are not too good, but at the end of the day, the child should take ownership of his own life.</div>
