              <p>I think one or two of my cats tried to act fussy on me.  They catwalked over to their food bowl, disagreed with what was in there, gave me that look which said "Nuh-uh!", and sat right beside the bowl waiting for me to change the food. </p>
              <p>Too bad, I just shrugged my shoulders, tell them, "Eat it or leave it and starve!" and walked away.  They'd refuse to eat for a day or so, but I refused to back down.  Eventually, bo bian, hungry, plus owner not easily manipulated, so eat lor!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
