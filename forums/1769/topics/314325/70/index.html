              <p>This is a fantastic piece of article!  I've always thought that the Minister should step down in disgrace as a form of public apology.  They are honourable enough to do such things over in Taiwan, the US, and even China!  In many instances, CEO's of companies have stepped down even when they are not directly responsible for the errors, but just because something happened on their watch, and they have the moral gumption to feel ashamed and responsible enough to step down as an acknowledgement that they have failed to fulfill their roles.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, nobody will expect Ministers who protect their own kind.  This issue has probably left a sour aftertaste in many citizens'  mouths.</p>
