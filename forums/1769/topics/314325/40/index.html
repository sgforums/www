              <p>Weird dreams AGAIN!  I dreamt of this large floating school, ie. a school built on a mega-huge shipping vessel!  Somehow, there were ghosts haunting the old school and apparently, they came from the sunken ship that was directly below the floating school.  I don't seem to be in the dream per se but then again, sometimes, it felt as if I was the student being haunted, other times, I thought I was the kind female teacher trying to help her...  Odd...  There was also a helpful young, male P.E. teacher who tried to help.</p>
              <p>I think I'm slowly simmering up some psychosis or split personality disorder, manifest with all my nightmares and weird OTT (Over-The-Top) dreams!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  If I get dragged into the looney bin kicking and screaming, will one of you please kindly inform my psychologist / psychiatrist of my history of weird dreams and vivid nightmares since Jul 07 - it might help in treatment!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>I used to have the occasional dream or nightmare and I've gone by more than a year without any dreams too.  It disturbs me that I'm having nightmares and dreams nightly now because it disrupts my sleep, I wake up feeling as if I've worked the night shift, and I can't function optimally during the day.  It has robbed me of my concentration powers, sorely needed when studying!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p>You dream almost every night?  For years??!!

              <p>I used to have the occasional dream or nightmare and I've gone
                  by more than a year without any dreams too.  It disturbs me
                  that I'm having nightmares and dreams nightly now because it
                  disrupts my sleep, I wake up feeling as if I've worked the night
                  shift, and I can't function optimally during the day.  It has
                  robbed me of my concentration powers, sorely needed when
                  studying!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>BTW, you're an early riser!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>hell yeah. n i have sleeping problem. if i sleep i dream. It does bother me. Only time i dun drink is maybe if i am too drunk or wasted and smashed. That i dun even know i am dreaming even if i was dreaming. hell , i may even dream i was drinking. Just to wake up to throw up. hahaha.</p>
              <p>yup , u will wake up extremely tired. Nightmares , even dream of work. Sometimes i even dream that we solved a complex problem and i wake up to find myself that its not the case. But the dream if i can remember can become helpful.Like ur dream tells u what to do. lol. I kinda got used to it , just that i will have many deja vu isntances.</p>
              <p>So i think its good if u dream u wake up while u can still remember u jolt down what u dream . Catalogue it for future references. lol.. but normally who got time wake up jolt down. haha. I even got dream i went to school , everything normally then WHAM accident or what.. then i wake up. hahah.</p>
              <p>I am an early riser when i work. I actually woke up at 11. time diff here now. he he. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> u wake early too ar</p>

              <p>I dun take caffeine. Cause i will have 2 extreme opposite effects. I will either become very very sleepy... or become wide awake that i cant even sleep n become too hyper. haha.</p>
              <p>www.dreammoods.com ? lol..  i got check before but i gave up. Cause too many dreams and most are complicated with this n that. n i may even have 3 dreams. in a row. damn.. wake up from 1 dream then sleep to dream another. K K.. one of the worst experience is waking up from a dream just to wake up from another dream. i tell u that is really REALLY ...fudfged up man.U will go nuts. Cause the second time u wake from ur dream u will realise u are still dreaming . haha n trying to figure out what the hell is going on.</p>
