Or whether that person told u. or was it in a dream. lol. not exactly u can ask the person did they tell u this or that. N normally its p&amp;c. cause whatever it is , even if its real.. the person will be like WTF how u know! haha..  if its false.. u feel stupid.</p>

              <p>I remember most of my dreams. sigh.. even those like normal ones. I may dream going somewhere meeting someone talking about what i can even remember. Then when i wake up i wonder did i dream or was it a flashback to when went out with the person. N did that person in real life actually told me wahtever i was told and i dreamed a flashback , or was it a dream that in the dream what the person telling me is true.</p>
              <p>i tell you. it can drive one nuts.</p>
              <p>Well. there are some dreams u will remember vividly.</p>

              <p>Exactly !! u become in doubt. u know. n then when it actually deja vu's u will be even more convinced n sometimes acting on what you dreamed can be rewarding and also can be a bit foolish. I even dream how my colleagues n the other ppl will react n when they reacted the way i dreamed i am further convinced that i should just act on what i dreamed.</p>
