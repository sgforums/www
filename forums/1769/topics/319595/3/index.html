              <p>Recently, I heard a really odd one... "Hweeee-Dub!  Hweeee-Dub!" Turns out the man had a valve implanted a few years back.  I let him listen to his own heart sound and he was very amused by it.  I let his daughter listen to her own normal heart sound, and then his, and she was also very amused.  She said it sounded "like a baby crying"!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Too bad that online site from the US doesn't ship internationally.  Otherwise, I can custom-make the stethoscopes and have colourful ones with lovely stethoscope heads!</p>
              <p>The stethoscope does come in pink, but it's for a basic model, not good enough.</p>

              <p>Wow...that's very uncommon here in Sg though lol...and not that
              most of them are really that good in their field tsk...wonder what
              gives them the right to be so arrogant...</p>

              <p>Well, my new workplace is much more pleasant, compared to my previous one. </p>
              <p>I met up with a few other nurses who used to work in my previous ward but have all transferred to other wards, like me.  We all felt it was way too political there with a handful of power-hungry bitches running the show. </p>
              <p>I'm glad I left when I did, cause I'm sure with that moody, temperamental and lazy Team Leader being promoted to the Nurse Unit Manager position, things won't look pretty.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  She's one of those really pretty blondes who can't do their work and is extremely lazy and unhelpful (and she even 'tsk's' often and rolls her eyes when you approach her for something that's within her job scope) but somehow, is good at charming management and so she practically had the job pushed onto her although we all felt someone else in the ward deserved that promotion more.  </p>
              <p>Well, my new workplace is more pleasant because most of us are concerned with getting the job done well, then heading home.  There are, of course, a few that I would tread carefully around and beware of, but they are a minority, thankfully. </p>
              <p>I smile everytime I look at my roster now... I work 12-hr shifts now and every week for the next few weeks, I receive pay to attend a course!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  I have so many days off a fortnight, I'm still feeling very merry over the thought!  Kekeke!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
