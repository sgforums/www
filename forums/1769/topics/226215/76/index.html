            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Wanda:</div><div class="quote_body">Haiya, why can't they follow the Jap and Get things right the First time?  </div></blockquote>I had an extremely unpleasant experience with Samsung. They got it wrong many, many times.<br><br>My Samsung digicam broke down after just several days. They said that it was a simple problem and that it would be fixed within 'a couple of days' and that they would contact me 'as soon as possible'.<br><br>After nearly two weeks, they still hadn't called me. <strong>Strike One.</strong><br><br>I then called their customer service and asked about the status of my repair job. The girl said that she would get back to me 'as soon as possible'. Four hours later, with the end of office hours nearing, they still hadn't called me. <strong>Strike Two.</strong><br><br>I was starting to get agitated when I called them again. This time, the customer service girl mocked my name. In her words: 'Eh sir, how to spell your name ah? You name very funny leh...'<br><br>Basket... I didn't ask for my name to be insulted. <strong>Strike Three</strong><br><br>So I scolded that girl and demanded the information I sought. She eventually panicked and told me that my camera had already been fixed and was sitting idle. As it turns out, some idiot who was supposed to call me neglected to do so. <strong>Strike Four.</strong><br><br>I went down to the Samsung repair center near IMM and blasted the customer service manager to hell. He promised me a full investigation and promised to get back to me 'the next day'.<br><br>Well, it took him three days to do so. <strong>Strike Five</strong><br><br>At this point I blew my top off and demanded a one-to-one exchange for my defective camera. He told me that if I faxed him the warranty and receipt slips, he would have it ready for me 'in a couple of days'.<br><br>After one week, there was still no reply from him. <strong>Strike Six.</strong><br><br>At this point in time, I totally lost all my cool. I wrote an incredibly long and scathing email to their customer service. I can't remember exactly what I put in, but it was something along the lines of:<br><strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">... the way I see it, considering the experience I had with your personnel, it's either:<br><br>A) It is the Samsung culture to treat all your customers with such contempt, or<br><br>B) I'm being singled out for some unknown reason.<br><br>So which one is it?<br><br>Get back to me really, really soon, or I shall refer this matter to CASE.</span><br></strong><br><br>Eventually, I did get what I wanted.<br><br>I'm never buying Samsung products again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
