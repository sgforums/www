              <p>since we are here, let's list the phones i've had... most either died on me or they were phased out...</p>
              <p>let's start with my first... the Ericsson GH388</p>
              <p><img src="http://st2.gsmarena.com/vv/bigpic/ergh388b.gif" alt="" width="139" height="184"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i then gave it up for the new and advanced system, CDMA network and got this, a Sony Z100</p>
              <p><img src="http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b187/jpjr50/Sony_CM_Z100.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="221"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>M1 stopped supporting CDMA so i went and got myself a Nokia 8210 which lasted a very short time on the account of me leaving it in my pocket as it was very small</p>
              <p><img src="http://images3.souq.com/uploaded/310511/02ac5493c173ee5607651edbfd1f61c4_41838290891295097303.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="303"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so i got myself an "upgraded version" the Nokia 8250 with the nifty blue screen</p>
              <p><img src="http://st2.gsmarena.com/vv/bigpic/no8250.gif" alt="" width="139" height="184"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>soon, that went to heck and i was too cheap to go buy a battery so i got myself a Samsung S200.. which i dropped so many times on account of it being so small it cracked, moisture went in and it went to shit...</p>
              <p><img src="http://schematicsbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Samsung-S200-scheme-image.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so after this, i got myself a Motorola V3 Razr which was excellent.. i used it until it decided to lose its mind, losing some of my contacts</p>
              <p><img src="http://st2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/motorola/mov3_00.jpg" alt="" width="417" height="350"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i liked the Razr design so i got myself a Motorola V8 Razr to replace it.. it worked well until the buttons started to freeze and not work</p>
              <p><img src="http://i450.photobucket.com/albums/qq222/vnet2k4/Juvencio/Motorola-RAZR2-V8.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="383"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so i took the plunge and started using a smart phone.. my first was a HTC Magic.. it looked good but after a year, it started to overheat as the processor could not handle the serious horsepower necessary for some apps.. it finally went to shit when the battery started to bloat</p>
              <p><img src="http://cdn.cbsi.com.au/story_media/339295692/htc-magic_1.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="330"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so i traded it in for a very very nice and powerful Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.puremobile.ca/insiderblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Sony-Ericsson-XPERIA-Arc.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>very nice... very powerful, bigass screen but crappy battery life...</p>

              <p>Well, I'll list out all my phones....</p>
              <p>1st: Nokia 3310, which lasted me through half of my NS life.....</p>

              <p>2nd. Nokia 3610. This had an extremely powerful vibration mode. The whole table would shake with it.</p>

              <p>3rd. Sony Ericsson T630. Best dumbphone I ever used. Until it died.</p>
              <p><img src="http://hotelarbat.com/data/Art/sony-ericsson-t630.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="436"></p>
              <p>4th. Sony Ericsson z520i. My first flip phone.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.livingroom.org.au/cameraphone/Sony-Ericsson-Z520.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="334"></p>
              <p>5th. Samsung SGH J700. The first 3G phone I used. But it kept dying on me, leading to my everlasting hatred for all things Samsung.</p>
              <p><img src="http://static.trustedreviews.com/fa85a3%7C98ec_7267-SamsungSGHJ700img4.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450"></p>
              <p>6th. Sony Ericsson T700. Nice and clean. The second best dumbphone I ever used. T630 still wins because T700 is just a little too slim.</p>

              <p>My first phone, since I was a late entrant in the mobile phone consumer market...was already a phone with colour on the screen.</p>
              <p>Dec 2006 - 2008. Nokia 2610....</p>
              <p>Its still well and alive today, living with my mum. This dumb phone lasts nearly a week on a single charge even today with the same batteries. (3 of them on rotation basis) Most reliable of all my phones.</p>

              <p>For a short period in 2008, probably 3 months, I was using Nokia E51, the version with no camera since I was still serving the nation. Nice phone, very solid build, but died the most tragic way while it was still brand-new when I came back half-dead from sailing, and then absent-mindedly deposited my coverall with my phone with it into the washing machine. Heard a THUD when I threw my clothes in, but thought nothing about it. Came back 5 min later realising what had happened, but it was too late. Phone was a complete loss.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"> </p>

              <p>It was back to the good old Nokia 2610 for the remainder of my NS. Then shortly after NS, around July 2009, purchased without plan, my slightly smarter but slim and sexy Sony Ericsson T700. Loved that phone to bits, but in Dec 2009, while still under warranty, phone suffered dead pixels on the screen, thereby starting a whole string of problems with this phone. Small phone with great voice....this phone's mp3 playing quality was fantastic.</p>

              <p>Around April 2011, the phone started going bonkers and deleted my games, my contacts and failed whenever calls came in. Desperate to save my phone, repaired 4 times, to no avail, before finally accepting the inevitable in May 2011. As with the previous case, it was back to the old but super trusty Nokia 2610.</p>
              <p>And then I decided to borrow my friend's Sony Ericsson W705I while waiting out for my plan to mature. Current phone I'm using now. Slightly smarter than the T700, with similar mp3 playing qualities.</p>

              <p>I last used one in secondary school. I carried a phone card with me in year 1 of JC but don't remember using it. Then I got a free phone in September that year.</p>
              <p>A Sony Ericsson T200. It had a monotone screen when my classmates were already using camera phones with polyphonic tones. Still I managed to play Vivaldi's Gloria by keying the score into the composer:</p>
              <p><img src="http://st2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/sonyericsson/snt200_00.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="401"></p>
              <p>A year later, my cousin handed me her phone, a T610. It had a camera and basic tunes but it was crap at receiving signals or even waking people up.</p>
              <p><img src="http://st2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/sonyericsson/snt610_00.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="599"></p>
              <p>I got rid of it before BMT. My contract was up for renewal so I got another free phone, a Nokia 3120, which had no camera but signal strength was so much better than the last two. It worked very well for one and a half years until a cabbie decided to drive away with it and never return it. I was livid and heartbroken because I kept precious messages in it.</p>
              <p><img src="http://st2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/nokia/no3120_00.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="450"> </p>
              <p>So I got a Motorola W220. Like the last one it had no camera or choice of message tones. I used it for 30 months, and it still works today!</p>
              <p><img src="http://st2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/motorola/motorola_w220_00.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="501"> </p>
              <p>In June 2009, my contract was up for renewal again. This time I paid $38 for my Samsung F400, which I'm still using today. I had a camera phone again for the first time in 4 years (but I hardly used the function) but most importantly, I could use whatever song I wanted for my message and call tones. This was when my classmates were already oohing and ahhing about the iPhone 3GS.</p>
              <p><img src="http://st2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/samsung/samsung-f400-01.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="599"></p>
              <p>None of these phones lasts less than 5 days on a single charge, and I prefer the tactile feedback of a physical keyboard, so it's unlikely that I'll be trading in for a smartphone any time soon.</p>
