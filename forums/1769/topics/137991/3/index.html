He's quite a typical, chinese family man. Conservative, stern &amp; a man of few words. Growing up, we lacked of communication badly. Following his footsteps, all of us (siblings) refused to tear away that "shy" mask when we r facing him. We love him dearly as much as he loves us.. just that we don't show it.<br><br>As some1 mentioned earlier, some of us might have taken our fathers for granted.<br>I did. Till 1 day, my father collapsed without any warning symptoms. My strong, fit &amp; energetic Papa who doesn't smoke/drink, suffered a heart attack. Doctors diagnosed that his arteries were abt 80% blocked. @ the ICU, we were told, the next 48 hrs shall decide whether he pulls through or not. That was the darkest hours of my life. My father was dying, I have yet to tell him I love him &amp; I have yet to make him proud. That night, regrets came hitting hard on me. No amount of tears or prayers can deliver my unspoken love to him if he fails to make it.<br><br>6 yrs after, my Papa still acts "cool" sometimes but me &amp; my siblings r no longer stingy with our affections. Though we hardly say it, we display it clearly in our own ways! Eg. I'll write mushy stuff &amp; paste it somewhere eye-catching for my parents to read. And my sister made use of her naughty little boy to relay her affections to 'Gong-Gong' on behalf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I juz wanna say...
