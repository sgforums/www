            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: maroon;">Review of the MPH Warehouse Sale</span></span></strong><br><br>Yup!  Yup!  Yup!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I was right in the thick of action just five minutes after they opened the doors at Hall 6 in the Expo!  I went right after I completed my night duty.  Just a month ago, it was the Times the Bookshop Warehouse Sale, at the very same hall, and coincidentally, I headed there right after my night shift too.<br><br>You grab an empty box once you enter the doors so you can put your chosen books inside.  There are boxes of books lined neatly on the floor for you to go through.  The paperbacks are placed in no particular order so the fun of it is to spot a good title.<br><br>In less than five minutes, I had already picked out my first book!  I couldn't believe that it was there at the sale!  It was a Dean Koontz novel, 'The Face', retailing for $16-18 thereabouts, but it was right there for $5!!!  Pristine condition too!<br><br>That very first book was the key that unlocked the floodgates of book bargains!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I thought I'd 'go pick out up to five books max'... but I came home with my box full and almost bursting!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>They have some spanking new fiction paperback out there but there aren't too many copies of those - less than five or so on display.  I grabbed a copy of Amy Tan's 'The Opposite of Fate', (displayed at Border's as 'New' and retailing for $18.90, I think) for only $6!!  I only spotted two other copies of the same title.  Other great buys of new fiction paperbacks in limited quantities include Rebecca Wells' 'Little Altars Everywhere' for just $5 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> , Peter Moore's Swahili for the Broken-Hearted for $6  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> ,  and Bill Bryson's not-so-new 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' for a mere $5!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   Early bird catches the big, fat, juicy, succulent, worm though... I saw less than five copies of Wells' aforementioned book, and I think three copies of Bryson's and about four of Moore's paperback.<br><br>There are Lonely Planet travel guidebooks on sale there too.  Not all the copies are of good condition though.  Be sure to check the edition too because when I was looking out for a guidebook on Australia, I saw a copy of the 10th, 11th and 12th Edition.  There were quite a few copies of the guidebook for Japan, and other SEA nations.<br><br>Sadly, there weren't a good selection of cookbooks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Those on display were the exact same cookbooks I saw a few years back when I first attended MPH's Warehouse Sale in this inconspicuous warehouse in some industrial park area.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  They do look kinda yellowed.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   They are the Joie, Inc published cookbooks of mostly Japanese cuisine and they're going at half-price ($12) if you're interested.  I think they normally sell for close to $30.<br><br>There were tons of children's books too.  Cultivate a reading habit... start 'em young!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Overall, I prefer this MPH warehouse sale to Time's event.  The variety was greater and the titles were newer.  However, I hated having to cart around a box and having to kneel on the floor / bend over to look at the books in the boxes placed on the ground.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I was also disappointed that the three Cashier counters there only accepted CASH!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   I mean, what happened to NETS and VISA??!!  The Times the Bookshop Warehouse sale had those options on top of cash.  Notwithstanding, there's a DBS ATM just after Expo Hall 3, which is a looooooooooooong walk away!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>As I trudged on towards the ATM located in Mt Zion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> , I passed by the Singapore Food Manufacturers' Fair, which was still closed with an eager crowd already amassed outside its doors.  I had to give it a miss because there's no way I'd lug around a carton heavy with books and salivate at the food, which I won't be able to sample or try or feast on because of my load!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   I was sooo upset I had to give it a miss!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>ok next was some Aqua show.  No!!  Not 'aqua' as in transvestites but 'aqua' as in the Aquarium Fish show.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  If you want to enter that exhibition today, you'll have to pay for entry because it's still restricted to trade folks only but tomorrow, it will be opened to public.  I peeked into the hall and saw a few new designs of fish tanks that were soooo pretty!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So, for those of you who are heading down to the Expo for the MPH Warehouse Sale, go!  And go early!!  I was there at 9:05am and the crowd was sparse for only about half an hour afterwhich, it got crowded!  By 10:30am, the crowd that had built up was large!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Also, remember to bring your CASH along because that's the ONLY mode of payment they'll accept.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Unless you don't mind making the pilgrimage to the ATM altar beyond Hall 3!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
