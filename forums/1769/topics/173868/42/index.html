The lower income group have no bargaining power at all. The worst thing is that they take a low paying job which they can be replaced easily and you have young foreign workers who can work faster and better than them with the same or less pay <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> At the rate of things going from what I see, they might not even have these low paying jobs left to do if the government doesn't control the influx of foreign workers!<br><br></div>

I think something is very wrong when basic essential services like public transport are privatized and they become profit oriented organizations ... I think we're on very dangerous ground when the goverment (govt linked companies) are about the biggest players in the economy ... and the public sector is the biggest employer in the country ... perhaps my com sci's better than my econs, but all my econs training tells me this is not quite a sustainable model .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>oh well ... nevermind ... this should be in speaker's corner anyways .... though that place is populated almost exclusively by rabid anti-goverment nutcases who're caught up in their own fantasies ...</div>
