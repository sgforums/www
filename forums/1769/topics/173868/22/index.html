Sometimes I think employers forget the effects of overwork and fatigue. even machines break down when you overwork them, much less humans!  Remember I mentioned how I ended up going into the ladies toilet when I was very tired and sleep deprived?

Sometimes I think employers forget the effects of overwork and fatigue. even machines break down when you overwork them, much less humans!  Remember I mentioned how I ended up going into the ladies toilet when I was very tired and sleep deprived? If I had been doing something dangerous I'd have ended up killing myself or someone because of some mistake!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  This is an example of the human cost I'm talking about in my earlier post. People need to work less hours, sleep and play more, in order to be more productive. But its never going to happen. We're going to hell in a handbasket and nothing is going to stop that!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>I committed a non-fatal error myself in my course of work.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   It bugged my conscience no end because it could have been a fatal mistake with dire consequences.  In my line of work, it is THIS easy to accidentally harm / kill someone under our care.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I had a few sleepless nights after that incident.  I could have been more careful but I was at the same time, resentful that I was made to work in an area I was totally unfamiliar with and despite my protests, no one bothered to rectify anything and, I was overworked, tired, hungry (no breaks at all for me that day!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ), frustrated, etc etc... and although I indicated that I needed help, no help came.  I was worried something bad would happen cause I was working so fast, it was easy for a slip to occur... and then, when something wrong happened, I was stunned.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  At the same time, so many things point to that being an 'inevitable' error, almost.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>There will be no solution to this problem, because the higher-up's are still smiling and saying, ''We've functioned this way for the past few decades, we don't see a need to change.'' and then it becomes your own inefficiencies, your inadequacies, your shortcomings and your own failure.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">   Worse, in my line, everyone wants to 'look good' so they'll never complain to the higher-up's.  They'll just complain amongst themselves but when asked, everyone paints a rosy picture because no one wants to be thought of as 'incompetent'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I've stuck out like a sore thumb from the very day I entered Nursing School.  There aren't many who share my trend of thought.  I've stood firm and refused to back down on my ideals and thoughts, knowing that my experience in my previous jobs and my attachment in the US tell me that they can work, but not in our local context.<br><br>From a pro-active, Type 'A' person, I've become a Type 'C', uninvolved, uninterested, unmotivated employee.  My greatest desire is to blend into the wallpaper so that I won't be 'targetted' by the seniors.  I shirk all after-work responsibilities that would otherwise have been of interest to me - stuff like research and presentations.  I wanted to be 'low profile', to remain 'under the radar' all these years and so, I slowly changed.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">   And I realised that if I cannot change anything, because the culture is so ingrained, then, one way to cope, is to 'shut off'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>This nightmare is going to be over soon!
