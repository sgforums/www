Her reason was that she see no reason why she should broadcast that she is getting married soon.<br><br>So the issue goes:<br><br>1. How soon into a 'friendship' with the opp sex would you mention that you are married if you are?<br><br>2. Does it mean that after marriage you are not entitled to male friends?<br><br>3. However, if you suspect that a guy is interested in you, and you are not interested in the guy BUT will like to be friends - at what point do you tell him that  you are married?<br></div></blockquote>well unless you want to take advantage of the guy i would say if you think hes interested please tell him earlier always good to avoid misunderstandings and not waste his effort, time and money.<br><br>if you were the kind of girl that wants to enjoy such stuff and take advantage of pple then don't say i guess</div>
