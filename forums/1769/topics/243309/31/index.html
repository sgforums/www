Consequently, lots of items get picked up and turned in to the L&amp;F counter. Umbrellas, sunglasses, car keys, coffee mugs, watches, jewelry, wallets, CDs, even electronic devices like calculators and MP3 players. How anyone loses a set of car keys and not claim it back, is beyond me.<br><br>Once a month, L&amp;F items turned in and unclaimed within the past 30 days are displayed on a <span style="font-style: italic;">looooong</span> table adjacent to the reception area in the lobby. The table stays for a couple of days, and then any unclaimed items are gathered up and thrown into a L&amp;F bin in the Building Maintenance department and kept for another month. During this time, employees can request to rummage through the bin to look for lost items. After the month in storage is up, any remaining L&amp;F items are released for disposal and either distributed to local charities or simply junked.<br><br>Incidentally, I have no doubt that some of the people helping themselves to the items on the L&amp;F table <span style="font-style: italic;">aren't</span> the owners of said items, but realistically, what can the reception area staff do to curtail that?<br></div>

We shrunk down some of the non-critical parts, but some of the parts with severe loads had to stay in their original dimensions.<br><br>We'll just argue that the budget of S$1500 simply does not allow for a low-cost, low-weight solution. There's only so much that you can do with aluminium. And we're already using aircraft-grade aluminium 6061 T6 alloy, by the way.<br><br>If they were to triple our budget, we could conceivably present them with a titanium wheelchair, but otherwise, there's only so much that creative engineering can do....</div>
