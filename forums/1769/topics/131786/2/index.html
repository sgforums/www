I thought we could start a thread on renovations to share our experiences with this or to imagine how we'd renovate our pad should we do it.<br><br>Phua Chu Kang not invited to this discussion, ah!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Wahhhhh Rhonda!!! I'm not having that much problems. In fact I'm having more work problems than renovation problems. It's the time I have to spend on work that is making it difficult for me to juggle between the two!!! Plus I'll be gone for over a week travelling!<br><br>Also, I'm a worry wart. I start imagining the worst!I think everything should turn out ok.<br><br>Yes, I love the woody feel in a house too but having everything in solid wood is wayyyy over our budget so we are substituting with veneer finishing which looks really good too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The flooring for every room will be Burmese parquet  though, with the exception of the kitchen and toliet flooring!<br><br>We're going for a zen + contemporary feel and we are going to have our own tatami area as well as a revolving bookshelf which I got the contractor to make. Behind the bookshelf is our storeroom <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">. Anyway, there is a lot of wood and a lot of glass to balance things up.<br><br>I think I am going to start a blog on the whole renovation. Need to take pictures of the empty house first. Hehehe. Should be fun. I will be much less stressed up after my trip. Ahhhhh Murphey's Law is in-force for me now. Whatever can go wrong, is all going wrong!!!! Work-wise at least.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, wanna share an interesting fact - did y'all know that there are shopping malls that state in their rental agreements with the stores in the mall, that every stipulated no. of years, they would have to undergo some sort of renovation to change their storefront?  Apparently, that is to kinda give the store a makeover and keep the overall appearance of the shopping mall updated and new.<br><br>I thought that was pretty interesting.  This also helps the economy by ensuring that renovation work will always be in demand by these stores, and then the good ol' multiplier effect kicks in!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
