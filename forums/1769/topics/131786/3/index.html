            <div class='col-md body'>I used to get my furniture from Ikea when I first moved into this apartment (budget reasons).  But I found that they didn't last.<br><br>I've also looked at the small furniture shops, especially around the HDB areas, but they were not to my liking at all.  Felt that they were more for display than for comfortable usage.<br><br>In so ends up that nowadays, I buy most of my furniture from the bigger stores like Courts, for these reasons:<br><br>(1) You can walk around and take your time to try the furniture.<br>(2) Wide range to choose from.<br>(3) Surprisingly economical/affordable.<br>(4) Can pay by interest-free instalments if you want (interest-free...why not?).<br>(5) Service is reasonably good, with delivery options, etc.<br>(6) Peace of mind that you're buying from a reputable store.<br>(7) Prices are clearly displayed, so no hassling required.<br><br>Another choice is to wait for one of these fashion furniture houses to offer items on sale - I've done this too and bought some "branded" Italian furniture.  But they didn't last long either.<br><br>Try searching in the newspapers each day, especially Saturdays.  There are lots of furniture warehouse sales, etc. everywhere.  Some can be quite attractive too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Choco B,<br><br>Unfortunately, it wasn't the one at IMM.  As I live in the east, I went to the Sim Siang Choon near Singapore Expo.<br><br>I feel that these rods (L or straight) are tougher than we think.  Remember the doorway chin-up bars we used to have, which could take the weight of a person?  (Just a metal bar secured at two ends).<br><br>I would say quite safely that unless you jump and hug the shower curtain, the rods should stay in its place.....what can you do in the bathroom thats so rough anyway? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Come to think of it, with the straight rods which are secured without screws....if it drops, you can just simply prop it up again in less than a minute.  Can't say the same for the L-shape ones, since you have to drill and screw them in again.<br><br>PS:  My new seat is transparent (colourless base) with some brown shells and pebbles embedded.  I chose transparent as it is the most neutral base colour.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gentlerock, you're right about L shape being uncommon.  I could only find extendable, no-screw straight rods in IMM, and only one type in all the shops <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">.   Well thanks for the info anyway .<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gentlerock:</div><div class="quote_body">Come to think of it, with the straight rods which are secured without screws....if it drops, you can just simply prop it up again in less than a minute.  Can't say the same for the L-shape ones, since you have to drill and screw them in again.<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a difference for renovating a resale or new flat. For resale flat one can do the toilet and kitchen wall and floor. But I think the killer in renovation is doing the floor. For me I get a resale flat with ceramics but I want to opt for homogeneous 600 x 600 tile which look more class and I choose design that like marble hhahaaha.... but they need to hack the existing ceramics floor up and then lay cement before start to put on those homogeneous tiles. For a 125 sq metres room do all except kitchen and toilet it cost me about 10K including of hacking cost.<br><br>So to me doing the floor is a major issue and a big ticket item in renovation. For other people they bypass the floor (i.e no do) and focus on painting and build L-box false ceiling false wall down lights etc etc. Doing the kitchen and toilet wall and floor also not cheap not to factor any kitchen cabinet or wardrobe you want to build in. There are also window grilles curtain track curtain TV fridge sideboard coffee table toilet accessories and cooker hood and hob etc etc..... fridge and washing machine base copper pipes laying rewiring (if any) etc etc.....<br><br>For me it cost me 45K reno+furniture. The most expensive items I have spent in my whole life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
