            <div class='col-md body'>I have discussed this with many people, and it's interesting how different people have totally different opinions on metrosexuality.<br><br>A lot of people think that being a metrosexual is akin to being 'gay', and god forbid that they should be labelled as such, much less admit to being one.<br><br>Being a metrosexual does not mean that one is 'gay-ish' or feminine. Rather, it is more of an embodiment of personal traits and characteristics. It is not based solely on outwardly appearances...and heterosexual men are actually the ones legitimate enough to carry this tag. Being a passive homosexual and/or bisexual, one would expect you to have these inclinations, it's part of the package. A well groomed man takes as much effort as a well groomed female... more so in fact, if you take into consideration that these men bother to find the products that would best suit their needs.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with a man getting in touch with his 'feminine side'. After all, who doesn't like a well groomed persona? The rogueish guy who catches your eye from across the bar may look cool and hip with his jacket artfully faded and torn at the right places, little bits of hair escaping the carelessly tied ponytail, trailing a faint whiff of a scintillating scent in his wake - but perhaps the art to looking nonchalantly good takes more effort. Don't be shocked if he takes longer in the bathroom than you do!<br><br>Metrosexuality is not about being effeminate... rather, it is not being afraid to admit that you care about your appearance. It shows confidence in appearing good without looking like you put in too much effort, it is being a SNAG (Sensitive New Age Guy).<br><br>Of course, there will be guys who would say that they don't give two chits about all these girly stuff... and nothing would ever change their views. I respect that. So long as one is comfortable being who he is, labels and tags shouldn't matter. Neither should society dictate how / what one should be... quick to form a stereotypical opinion against a man / woman just simply as a matter of preference.<br><br>Ideally, things should always be in moderation, regardless of whether you are male, or female. It is tough to maintain that balance without going to absolute extremities... but my point here is metrosexuality is perfect if some guys do not take it to obsessive levels. I think its perfectly all right (encouraged even) for a man to prevent a blemish or two, or to smell good, or to be 'put together' in general. It becomes silly if he takes it over the top of course - yell at the slightest sight of a bump, or rush home as though the house is on fire if the kid at the next table accidently causes a ketchup stain on the pristine white shirt.<br><br>It is being comfortable in one's own skin.<br><br>Metrosexualism is a personal choice... it is stepping on the threshold of the female and the male sections. If a heterosexual male understands more about beauty regimes and helpful hints to banish puffy eyes... I hardly think that would make him any different from the average Male.<br><br>It is definitely not about fulfilling or trying to attain an 'idealism' either. The ideal look is what one perceives it to be. If 2 hrs in front of the mirror is what it would take to give a person that assured 'confidence' then it is what he should do. The rest of us can snigger and look him up and down as if to say: 2hrs... and you look the same to me...; but if he walks out with a higher tilt of the chin and a more assured air... then leave him be.<br><br>There are no rules in the metrosexual world.<br>It is whatever works.<br></div>
