              <p>long story</p>
              <p>son gets married to china woman, now comes back to SG with china woman and in-laws</p>
              <p>because the house is under the brother's name, he tells the father to move out.</p>
              <p>the twist is that the son doesn't fork out a cent for most of the things.</p>
              <p>1) factory in china - paid by father</p>
              <p>2) house in china - paid by father</p>
              <p>3) flat in SG - downpayment paid by father, monthly payment partially paid by son</p>
              <p>4) private house in SG - paid by father, mother staying there (divorced)... when son came back to SG, he never paid the bills at all, everything father pay</p>
              <p>5) son is probably getting rent from the china house which his father paid for.</p>

              <p>I can only say be really prepared if you are going to have a baby coz one of my friend's wife just gave birth and she is suffering from post natal depression now coz they can't cope</p>
              <p>They wanted to save money and not hire a nanny...you know one of those who look after women and their child after giving birth and it so happens his MIL suddenly found work and can't help out and his mum can only help out in the evenings</p>
              <p>And that injection thingy the wife took (whatever u call that) is making her bones ache like crazy and it doesn't help the baby cries every 2 hrs for milk :x</p>
              <p>They're now frantically looking for a nanny but you usually need to book one at least 6 mths before the birth of a child :x</p>
