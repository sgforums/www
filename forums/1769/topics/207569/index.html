            <div class='col-md body'>sigh...<br><br>recently... kenna sabo.  ehh.... not really a sabo... maybe it's my misunderstanding.<br><br>My boss told me that there will be a certain meeting and told me to prepare a certain powerpoint slides.  She said that I have to present this while she would prepare another one that covered more details.<br><br>I had no idea what meeting this was going to be cuz I didn't receive anything from the organiser of this meeting.  I didn't even know where this was going to be held.  But I agar agar know should be at this certain place (no exact location was given to me).<br><br>Then on the actual day of the meeting, my boss fell sick and I had to present her part as well.  At this point I kept thinking it's going to be just a meeting in a meeting room, with a big table and everybody would sit around it.<br><br>As I reached the meeting place, I was told to sign in.  So I did so.  And then I saw my name in bold.  So I joked with the receptionist asking her why my name was so special, printed in bold.  Then she said, you're the speaker mah!<br>I was wondering what the hell she was talking about.<br><br>Then I walked in.  It was an auditorium and I was being arrowed by my boss to be the guest speaker.  I didn't feel a little bit nervous at all cuz I totally had no idea what was going on.  I simply brushed thru the powerpoint slides and just wanted to get it done and be over with it.<br><br>It was only in the evening then I sort of woke up and realised what was happening.  For the rest of the evening, I was like.... "OMG!  OMG!  My presentation was like shiiiitttt"  You see, I thought it was some small time meeting, so I didn't prepare myself.  Somemore, I wasn't supposed to be the one talking so much on stage.<br><br>Really hate myself for such lousy performance.  TAMADE!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember there was this cute angmo boy who was supposed to do a presentation in class.. and he's got stage fright. So he went to gulp like 3 cans of cola, got a sugar high and when he was doing his presentation, he was totally HYPER and everytime he referred to his notes, his hands were shaking like nobody's business.. just shaking uncontrollably</div>

She said that I have to present this while she would prepare another one that covered more details.<br><br>I had no idea what meeting this was going to be cuz I didn't receive anything from the organiser of this meeting.  I didn't even know where this was going to be held.  But I agar agar know should be at this certain place (no exact location was given to me).<br><br>Then on the actual day of the meeting, my boss fell sick and I had to present her part as well.  At this point I kept thinking it's going to be just a meeting in a meeting room, with a big table and everybody would sit around it.<br><br>As I reached the meeting place, I was told to sign in.  So I did so.  And then I saw my name in bold.  So I joked with the receptionist asking her why my name was so special, printed in bold.  Then she said, you're the speaker mah!<br>I was wondering what the hell she was talking about.<br><br></div></blockquote>confirmed ur boss sabo you lor</div>
