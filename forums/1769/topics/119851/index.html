            <div class='col-md body'>I often feel that most of us aren't expressive enough when it comes to dishing out praises, compliments and appreciation.  Also, when someone else actually comes along and tells us something nice about ourselves, we often try to brush it off and become very 'uncomfortable'.<br><br>Maybe I get to see sudden death or a sudden inability to speak or sudden unconsciousness so much that I feel life's too short to not live it up to the fullest so I often like to let my friends know that I like them by telling them how special they are.  Basically, I don't want those I love to not know how fond I am of them.  Often though, people start getting very uncomfortable.<br><br>Example:<br><br>"You know, you're one of the sweetest people I know.  I'm so lucky to have you as a close friend!"<br><br>"... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ... oh... erm... aiyah... hehe!  No mah... I never do anything special one!"  *nervous giggles<br><br>With caucasian friends, it's the reverse.  They're often very expressive and whilst sometimes, you wonder if they're just being sincere or just being 'nice' and socially correct, it sure does feel good hearing positive things!  (Especially if you are constantly in an environment where complaints and harsh words and rebukes are the order of the day.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br>Maybe we ought to go out and tell a friend today how fond you are of them, how much you appreciate them and how special they are to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  It'll definitely make their day!<br><br>(Hopefully, you don't scare them off... some folks just don't take compliments and appreciation very well!  hahaha!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah.. i totally agree... we have to be more expressive, esp when it comes to our loved ones. Family.. friends.. partners..<br>Often we just keep the feelings to ourselves, taking for granted that those people who are close to us know how much we treasure them.<br><br>Why not let them know? Its always good when u hear it urself how much u are being treasured as a friend or as a family member rite? Why wait till the last minute? Seriously... have u told your mum lately tat u love her?<br><br>Heres one of my entry in my blog last year Sept.:<br><br><strong>Friends </strong><br><br>"I LOVE YOU"<br>that is the message i sent to some of my friends in msn two days back.<br><br>I thought i should let my friends know how much i love and adore them. How dear they are to me and that they are being treasured by me. Friends don't just come and go... they stay if you choose to let them stay and your life will be blessed with another gem.<br><br>If its not for what had been happening for the past one week, i wouldn't have come to realise the importance of friends. How important they are to me and my importance to them. If i have not been a good friend, give me another chance and more time, i want to be a better friend <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Its never easy saying "I Love you". Especially to people you are really close to. I remember the first time i tried to say I love you to my auntie, she stared blank right back at me. Then i saw a faint and shy smile... and those three words came out from her back to me.<br><br>Its silly to know that we treat strangers nicer than people who are closest to us. Why is this so? and why are you letting this happen? Don't you love them? Don't you know how important these people are to you?<br><br>Let there be Love!!! Show appreciation... don't take for granted that they know. Tell them you love them. You never know if tomorrow will ever come... if given a choice, let the regrets that you gona have after you die be reduced by more.<br><br>So how many "I love you"s are you gonna say today?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You  must know that this is still an asian society, no matter how "westernized" we are. It's not like we are brought up to shout our feelings out to everybody we meet. Our parents don't go around declaring their love for us, so people grow up keeping their feelings to themselves. Personally, I don't think it's neccessary to keep giving compliments and nice comments to others, I think me and my friends have this sort of "connection", whereby we don't have to tell each other about our feelings or admiration or whatever, because we just know.<br>Besides, when people give compliments freely, do you think they really mean it? It's nice, to get a nice comment once in a while, but not too often, because I think that's just "sucking-up".</div>
