            <div class='col-md body'>Who ask you lower your price? If you think ur worth 2k, then stick with it. Employers dont like it, then let them be. You have the knowledge and experience to offer them at 2k, not less than that right? Its a normal human reaction. For example Im more reluctant to hire an indon maid for $300 with heaps of experience compared to a chinese maid for $700.<br><br></div>

The American Idol.  We are having our Canadian Idol right now and week and week, I see the faces of the contestants.  I feel their stress and pain.  I don't have to experience it to imagine what they are going through.  Especially sitting on the couch, with emcee facing the individual to announce if it's a go or a no-go.<br><br>So, yes, I know what a pain it is for you to go through all these cycles.  But zodi has a very good point.  You may not want to work for that type of employers too.  Even if you got the job, you may be unhappy there too and may eventually leave.  Don't short-change yourself.  Persevere.  If you know you are good, go for the market rate and like what one suggested, tell them that you are willing to negotiate because you really like to build a career with them.<br><br>Stay strong, dragg.......don't lose hope.  Come back here and yak with us.  We can't solve your problems but at least hopefully we can provide some sort of distractions of your misery.<br><br>Cheers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
