            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, majority of the employers advertised their job vacancy in the newspaper BUT in actual facts, they are simply NOT interested to hire the locals... due to $$$. They rather employ foreigners coz they can do the job and the pay is acceptable to them(employer). But if that is the case, why do they still want to advertised?<br>The Reason : They can report to Ministry of Labour / Manpower that the locals are asking for TOO MUCH thus they can have the "permission" to hire the foreigners to cover the job.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">on both occasions they said i am perfect for the job and commented that my asking pay is low, but eventually did not offer me the job.<br><br>isnt that contradictory?<br><br>dont employers want workers that are cheap and good?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
