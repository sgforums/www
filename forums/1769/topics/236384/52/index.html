Thank you Fatum.<br><br>Okay...bro in law liked it cos he feltt that its like my sister's char kway teow, except using rice instead of noodles.<br><br>Me &amp; sis sort of was planning for her to cook char way teow for him, as its valentines day and all...but the kids being sick and clingy &amp; difficult. I was lucky to be able to have that dinner ready was a miracle already.<br><br>The 'tang yuan' was the ready frozen ones I got from the asian supermarket, but it dont taste as nice leh....I even boiled ginger soup with brown sugar to go with it.  The soup looks black enough with the sugar, but the taste like not enough sugar leh.  And the 'tang yuan' was no better.  The sesame ones taste liked its burnt &amp; the red bean wan totally got no red bean taste.<br><br>Either our smells are whacked, or our tastebuds are.<br><br>Little gal was adventurous enough to try the tangyuan though.  very funny when the sesame fillings was smudging her mouth like she grown a moustache.</div>
