With the male being 2 years older naturally.<br>Most theories behind this is that Woman's primal urge is to feel safe and be taken care of.... older male likely to be better providers.<br><br>Do you have a problem with going out or marrying an older woman or younger man?<br><br>And do you fit the theory?<br></div>
