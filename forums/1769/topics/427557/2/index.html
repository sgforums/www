              <p>Hey, nice 15200 - been thinking of getting one with a grey dial myself.  The 16233's gold bits demand babying, and most of the time I've either got my Sea Dweller or Tudor 79170 on, and those can take a beating without missing a beat.</p>

              <p>Hey, nice 15200 - been thinking of getting one with a grey dial

                          time I've either got my Sea Dweller or Tudor 79170 on, and those

              <p>Thanks, that baby just went for an overhual at RSC, spring finally gave in and broke. It has never been serviced since the day it was bought till dec 2010. Despite this, it still tells precise and accurate time, a testament to rolex's quality and engineering..  This is how it looked like before</p>

              <p>It was passed down from my dad to me. one can say it's a gift of love and trust. He trusts that I will take care of his first mechanical timepiece.. bought together with his first love, my mom. Everytime i look at it, I am reminded of it's history. </p>
              <p>This watch has been lying in a safe for quite a few years, not being run like it's supposed to. I like the conversations I had with the lady at RSC, she said that owning a watch is an easy thing, but maintaining it is the hardest part of watch ownership. </p>
              <p>Anyway, after scrutinising it through a big digial microscope, the watch technician/ engineer came back saying that the dial has oxidised - they could either replace it or restore it. I opted for the arabic blue dual tone dial instead.It's a beauty.. In bright sunlight it looks light blueish, on other occasions it is a dark blue. </p>
              <p>Though come to think of it, i should have kept it the way it is, without restoring or changing it - After all, this timepiece is about the same age as me and it has been through my growing years. It also has the Tritium symbols on the dial... </p>
              <p>The omega on the other hand, is going slow.. but it's a daily beater, once dropped accidentally face down on a wooden floor and still survived without a scuff. </p>
              <p>I have quite a big wrist, so the 15200 feels alittle small (34mm), compared to the bond (41mm) that i was used to wearing..  </p>
              <p>It's an expensive addiction.. watches. Not many people understand it... </p>

              <p>Yup, it's a 10-year-old Laphroaig, and it's my favourite for an everyday sort of drink.  I've tried a Laphroaig 18 and the peat's weaker, although a fellow Laphroaig nut has told me that the peat flavour is stronger in the 30-year-old.  Go figure.</p>
              <p>Talisker's a nice little dram - I've actually had two shots over the course of the evening.  One real dark horse isn't even Scotch - have you tried Yamazaki?</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you're ever headed to my neck of the woods, let me know.  I'll bring you in as a guest at one of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society's quarterly tastings - they serve up six damned good scotches at each gathering.</p>

              <p>Yup, that's a 1019, but the amazing part of the story is that the guy bought it at $4500 at a time when the going price was between 27 and 30 grand.  The previous owner's father had bought two 1019s brand new, and the guy was selling one and keeping the other.</p>
              <p>The Paul Newman Daytona and the Comex Sub are owned by another friend of mine.  The Comex sub was originally issued to a Comex diver, who sold it to a Comex engineer, who took it from Paris to Melbourne so that it could be certified as a genuine Comex Sub.  The RSC technicians just about wet themselves because it was the first one they'd ever seen.</p>

              <p>Yup, it's a 10-year-old Laphroaig, and it's my favourite for an
              everyday sort of drink.  I've tried a Laphroaig 18 and the
              peat's weaker, although a fellow Laphroaig nut has told me that the
              peat flavour is stronger in the 30-year-old.  Go figure.</p>
              <p>Talisker's a nice little dram - I've actually had two shots over
              the course of the evening.  One real dark horse isn't even
              Scotch - have you tried Yamazaki?</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you're ever headed to my neck of the woods, let me
              know.  I'll bring you in as a guest at one of the Scotch Malt
              Whisky Society's quarterly tastings - they serve up six damned good
              scotches at each gathering.</p>

              <p>I had a 12YO Yamazaki years ago, before whisky started making an impression on me. If you've been following some of the convo's we've been having the 18YO's hard to find.</p>
              <p>I'm told that batches may vary but I haven't tried enough to know.</p>

              <p>The funny thing is that I've yet to try a commercially-available Yamazaki.  If memory serves me correctly, I was served a 24-year-old Yamazaki straight from the cask at my first society meeting.  It knocked my socks off, but at $800+ a bottle it was a bit rich for my blood.</p>

              <p>Yup, that's a 1019, but the amazing part of the story is that
              the guy bought it at $4500 at a time when the going price was
              between 27 and 30 grand.  The previous owner's father had
              bought two 1019s brand new, and the guy was selling one and keeping
              the other.</p>
              <p>The Paul Newman Daytona and the Comex Sub are owned by another
              friend of mine.  The Comex sub was originally issued to a
              Comex diver, who sold it to a Comex engineer, who took it from
              Paris to Melbourne so that it could be certified as a genuine Comex
              Sub.  The RSC technicians just about wet themselves because it
              was the first one they'd ever seen.</p>
              <p>Yeah, I wouldn't be caught dead wearing a TAG, or (apart from
              the Chrono Avenger M1) a Brietling for that matter.  They just
              scream "I don't know what I'm doing".</p>

              <p>Interesting.. been reading up on the comex, at one point, seems like Comex divers paid 175 pounds for a rolex .. an interesting figure..</p>
              <p>The rollie just changed it's date with a nice click, @ 11:59:xx there's nothing to be alarmed right?</p>
