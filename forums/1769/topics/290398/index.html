The bridge would have required the two adjacent teeth to be ground down to form a proper foundation for it; the implant would have been screwed into a hole drilled into the jawbone. I didn't even consider the bridge as I didn't want to "sacrifice" the two adjacent teeth, and the implant was too costly for my tastes (the dentist quoted a price of around US$3000, and dental insurance would not pick up any of it as it was considered a cosmetic procedure).<br><br>I decided to do nothing; the hole left by the extracted molar has filled up nicely, and I don't really notice its absence when chewing food.</div>

I don't claim to know much but I think you will need to be in braces to get the gap closed up. I say this because my daughter is now in her 2nd year of orthodontic treatment. During her first year, her two front teeth weren't aligned. Now they are but they are gapped. After her most recent check up, she now has to place rubber bands in her braces to close the gap in the front. So imho, I think that you should visit an orthodontist and see what they say? What's okay to us may not be to a trained eye? JMHO, no offence k?<br><br>My daughter cannot wait for her treatment to be over. She's supposed to be done in less than one year IF she takes care of her teeth, always wears the rubber bands, etc. I have a few friends who have had to be in braces for 5 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Each time I talk about it, (pardon the pun  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) it's helping to numb the impending pain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> This entire treatment will be done in an hour or so with a follow up some 3-5 months after. As for cost, (I'm having my one and only wisdom tooth extracted at the same time), I'm going to be poorer by US$3860. My insurance is only picking up like US$300. Under better circumstances they would cover a higher percentage of the cost but it's a long story. I'm asking to be put under general anesthesia. Local just isn't going to do it for me. *cue sounds of clucking chickens). One interesting tidbit is, I'm going to have human cadaver bone as well as cattle bone in me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><a href="http://www.cfofs.com/proc/proc_implants_index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfofs.com/proc/proc_implants_index.asp</a></div>

You'll have to ask a dentist about this since it varies from person to person. Here in the US, they typically extract them.
