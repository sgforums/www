              <p>Just when I bought a little book on ang moh slow cooker recipes, you put up this thread!  Such good timing!  BTW, for those who aren't aware, the ang moh's call the crock pot a 'slow cooker', so unimaginative, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, I don't have a crock pot here, but when I did have a small one, I cooked a few dishes on it :</p>
              <p>- Porridge.  The crock pot can cook really really lovely porridge.  I remember when I was ill and depressed, mom came over to cheer me up and cooked a lovely porridge for me.  She bought pork and cubed them (don't get the lean ones... a little bit of fat is tastier and won't kill you and if there bone-in ribs, even better!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> ), and threw it into the crock pot (after washing and scalding with hot water) with some brown rice, lots of water, and vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and corn, and left it to cook for a few hours.  Add salt, sesame oil, fried shallots (yew chang), pepper and spring onions to taste.  Oh my gosh... it was lovely!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  Full of mom's love!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Teriyaki Chicken Stew.  This one I anyhow humtum and turned out quite nice.  Let's see... I used chicken, skin on for a few fillets, skin off for others to balance it out.  I also threw in sliced Bombay Onions, garlic, finely minced ginger, hmm... can't remember what else I added, but first, do a quick stir-fry in a wok first, then throw the seared ingredients into the crock pot, add chicken stock to almost cover the ingredients, measure out some mirin, dark soya sauce (I used the premium dark soya sauce made from dates that's available from NTUC, sadly, not available  here <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> ), a little light soya sauce, sugar, stir to mix, leave to cook in medium heat for about 1.5 hrs or so, depending on the wattage of your cooker.  Stir now and then and taste to see if the sauce is alright.  I do remember having to add a few spoonfuls of cornflour into the stew to thicken it a bit.  Don't just sprinkle the cornflour in straight... always mix the cornflour in cold water first to make sure there are no lumps and to ensure a smooth, thick sauce.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think you can cook a wide variety of soups and/or dessert soups with your slow cooker too, which I did.  The sky's the limit, really!</p>
              <p>- Chicken + Ginseng Roots + Ma Ling Canned Button Mushrooms, drained;</p>
              <p>- Pork Ribs + Black Beans + a small root of ginger scrubbed clean + dried cuttlefish (for a stronger body and full-flavoured soup, grill the cuttlefish first);</p>
              <p>- Potato + Carrots + Sweet Corn + Dried Scallops + Dried Anchovies (rinsed to remove excess salt, and try to get the pre-peeled ones where the yucky black intestines have been removed for you); and</p>
              <p>- erm... I can't recall right now what else I cooked in it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, with soups, same principle, high heat first, bring to the boil, then leave to simmer, skimming scum off the surface now and then. </p>
              <p>With meat, some folks like to scald pork in hot water first using a large sieve or colander, then quickly run cold water on them to stop them from cooking, before throwing it into a pot.  I learnt that this is to 'clean' the meat with the heat (scientifically not quite rational but oh well...) but most importantly, it's to provide a natural 'seal' in the meat so as the rest of the meat cooks slowly, flavour is retained.</p>
              <p>I'm not so sure that actually makes any difference because I've cooked soup where I was lazy and just dumped everything in from the start and the meat turned out tender too. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd love to go get a mini crock pot soon and make Meatballs from scratch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  I've had a craving for the lovely meatballs a stall in my Secondary School canteen served as snack ever since I left the school!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  The auntie sold the meatballs on a toothpick smothered with a sweet-sour sauce.  We used to buy a few on a small plate and munch on it whilst sitting not too ladylike because it was an all-girls' school mah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Fatum, with full-bodied beef stews, drop a chunk of chocolate in it, and the taste will be perked up!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png">  And your happy dinner guests will never find out the 'secret' ingredient!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>Oh!  Sudden inspiration!  Here's what I think will go very nicely with Fatum's beef stew too - roast a handful of cashew nuts / hazelnuts / walnuts, then depending on preference and how subtle you want the flavours to be, pound them into bits (or leave them whole but halved) and sprinkle it all over the stew just before serving.  I think it will go well and offer a different texture and 'bite' for the stew.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>NOT to be attempted by people with nut allergies... LF, don't pretend you didn't hear, ah!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Got.</p>
              <p>Here's a recipe I always use.</p>
              <p>Toss lots of garlic, bay leaves and sesame oil.</p>
              <p>Toss in chicken pieces.</p>
              <p>Toss some soy sauce.</p>
              <p>If you like it somewhat dry, follow above steps. If you like it somewhat wet, add some chicken stock.</p>
              <p>Leave to cook on low for couple of hours. When done, serve on rice.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Just when I bought a little book on ang moh slow cooker recipes, you put up this thread!  Such good timing!  BTW, for those who aren't aware, the ang moh's call the crock pot a 'slow cooker', so unimaginative, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, I don't have a crock pot here, but when I did have a small one, I cooked a few dishes on it :</p>
              <p>- Porridge.  The crock pot can cook really really lovely porridge.  I remember when I was ill and depressed, mom came over to cheer me up and cooked a lovely porridge for me.  She bought pork and cubed them (don't get the lean ones... a little bit of fat is tastier and won't kill you and if there bone-in ribs, even better!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> ), and threw it into the crock pot (after washing and scalding with hot water) with some brown rice, lots of water, and vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and corn, and left it to cook for a few hours.  Add salt, sesame oil, fried shallots (yew chang), pepper and spring onions to taste.  Oh my gosh... it was lovely!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  Full of mom's love!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Teriyaki Chicken Stew.  This one I anyhow humtum and turned out quite nice.  Let's see... I used chicken, skin on for a few fillets, skin off for others to balance it out.  I also threw in sliced Bombay Onions, garlic, finely minced ginger, hmm... can't remember what else I added, but first, do a quick stir-fry in a wok first, then throw the seared ingredients into the crock pot, add chicken stock to almost cover the ingredients, measure out some mirin, dark soya sauce (I used the premium dark soya sauce made from dates that's available from NTUC, sadly, not available  here <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> ), a little light soya sauce, sugar, stir to mix, leave to cook in medium heat for about 1.5 hrs or so, depending on the wattage of your cooker.  Stir now and then and taste to see if the sauce is alright.  I do remember having to add a few spoonfuls of cornflour into the stew to thicken it a bit.  Don't just sprinkle the cornflour in straight... always mix the cornflour in cold water first to make sure there are no lumps and to ensure a smooth, thick sauce.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think you can cook a wide variety of soups and/or dessert soups with your slow cooker too, which I did.  The sky's the limit, really!</p>
              <p>- Chicken + Ginseng Roots + Ma Ling Canned Button Mushrooms, drained;</p>
              <p>- Pork Ribs + Black Beans + a small root of ginger scrubbed clean + dried cuttlefish (for a stronger body and full-flavoured soup, grill the cuttlefish first);</p>
              <p>- Potato + Carrots + Sweet Corn + Dried Scallops + Dried Anchovies (rinsed to remove excess salt, and try to get the pre-peeled ones where the yucky black intestines have been removed for you); and</p>
              <p>- erm... I can't recall right now what else I cooked in it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, with soups, same principle, high heat first, bring to the boil, then leave to simmer, skimming scum off the surface now and then. </p>
              <p>With meat, some folks like to scald pork in hot water first using a large sieve or colander, then quickly run cold water on them to stop them from cooking, before throwing it into a pot.  I learnt that this is to 'clean' the meat with the heat (scientifically not quite rational but oh well...) but most importantly, it's to provide a natural 'seal' in the meat so as the rest of the meat cooks slowly, flavour is retained.</p>
              <p>I'm not so sure that actually makes any difference because I've cooked soup where I was lazy and just dumped everything in from the start and the meat turned out tender too. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd love to go get a mini crock pot soon and make Meatballs from scratch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  I've had a craving for the lovely meatballs a stall in my Secondary School canteen served as snack ever since I left the school!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  The auntie sold the meatballs on a toothpick smothered with a sweet-sour sauce.  We used to buy a few on a small plate and munch on it whilst sitting not too ladylike because it was an all-girls' school mah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
