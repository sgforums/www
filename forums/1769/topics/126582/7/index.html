When were you in New York?<br><br>The Manhattan skyline will [b]never</strong> look the same without the imposing silhouettes of the twin towers of the World Trade Center, though...<br><br>MG[/b]</blockquote>I never got to visit the World Trade Center in its splendour but recently, when I went through my old food mags, I saw an article on this restaurant, Windows on the World, that was located at the top floor of one of the towers.  I immediately felt sad for the senseless loss of lives that day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I visited New York City in June 2002.  They had salvaged a damaged sculpture from the WTC and erected it in its damaged state in Hope Garden with a plaque that dedicated it in memory of all the lives lost.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Wish I had a digicam when I went there because I really really regretted not having been trigger-happy then, ought to have taken more photos!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Wish I could share a photo of that sculpture but it has me standing in front of it so, no-can-do!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I dream of returning to the US for a long visit one day... I'd love to spend weeks and weeks just exploring Washington, D.C. and NYC.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Well, six years ago, I made a brave decision to give it all up to answer my calling in a geographically-mobile profession so you never know where I'll land at ultimately!<br><br>The wandering nomadic lifestyle has its appeal to me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>littlestream, I don't live in a place where folks do a lot of DIY projects nor gardening but I did read up on gardening and what-not because it's part of my interests.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Lilies, I believe, are very hardy and resilient perennials.

It was my very first time in the US and it was my first morning in Tulsa, OK.  My American friend had returned to the office to clear some work so I was all alone at home.  I heard a bell ring, a van came to a stop outside our driveway, and then, I saw a huge can of what looked like beans placed near our door!<br><br>Me, being the suah ku, panicked!  I started to think, 'Oh help!!
