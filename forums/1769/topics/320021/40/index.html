              <p>Yeah, they do have to face a lot of crap.  Don't forget the difficult passengers too.</p>
              <p>In fact, I think shift workers AND those who have to deal with the public, ought to be compensated.  Hell, it can be torturous dealing with unreasonably demanding members of the public sometimes. </p>
              <p>Bully culture?  It's rampant in nursing too.  In fact, BEFORE I even stepped into my ward, apparently, the unit's SNM went around boasting that there's going to be a new nurse joining the ward who was the top student, went to Johns Hopkins, blah blah... NO WONDER when I turned up on my first day at work, there were hostile looks cast my way and snide, sarcastic, mak-neknek remarks like, "Oh!  SO... you are the new nurse here, right?" *looks down at me from an upturned nose... </p>
              <p>I got bullied a lot because of that.  TMD... not even my fault!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  I'm just thankful that nursing wasn't my first job because I learnt how to be a royal bitch and I fought back like one, but of course, after tolerating until I couldn't bear it.  Somehow, when the new batch of students enter the ward, they turned their attention on the new batch.  I fought to defend a few of them against the seniors who wanted to make life difficult for the newbies and again, I kena fire.  But like one Senior nurse yelled in exasperation, "Yeah lah!  Yeah lah!  Your English damn powerful, none of us can out-talk you one!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>That kinda environment, even your 'friends' are just enemies that you can tahan more. </p>
              <p>And on top of all that hostility and bullying, we have to face *(#)$(&amp;*@#$ KNS patients and their relatives. </p>
              <p>AND get paid shit at the end of the month.</p>
              <p>Now that I realise how good life is for nurses here, I'm never returning to work!  NEVER.</p>

              <p>Yeah, they do have to face a lot of crap.  Don't forget the difficult passengers too.</p>
              <p>In fact, I think shift workers AND those who have to deal with the public, ought to be compensated.  Hell, it can be torturous dealing with unreasonably demanding members of the public sometimes. </p>
              <p>Bully culture?  It's rampant in nursing too.  In fact, BEFORE I even stepped into my ward, apparently, the unit's SNM went around boasting that there's going to be a new nurse joining the ward who was the top student, went to Johns Hopkins, blah blah... NO WONDER when I turned up on my first day at work, there were hostile looks cast my way and snide, sarcastic, mak-neknek remarks like, "Oh!  SO... you are the new nurse here, right?" *looks down at me from an upturned nose... </p>
              <p>I got bullied a lot because of that.  TMD... not even my fault!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  I'm just thankful that nursing wasn't my first job because I learnt how to be a royal bitch and I fought back like one, but of course, after tolerating until I couldn't bear it.  Somehow, when the new batch of students enter the ward, they turned their attention on the new batch.  I fought to defend a few of them against the seniors who wanted to make life difficult for the newbies and again, I kena fire.  But like one Senior nurse yelled in exasperation, "Yeah lah!  Yeah lah!  Your English damn powerful, none of us can out-talk you one!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>That kinda environment, even your 'friends' are just enemies that you can tahan more. </p>
              <p>And on top of all that hostility and bullying, we have to face *(#)$(&amp;*@#$ KNS patients and their relatives. </p>
              <p>AND get paid shit at the end of the month.</p>
              <p>Now that I realise how good life is for nurses here, I'm never returning to work!  NEVER.</p>

              <p>I had the privilege of working in an American MNC that was run mainly by the Americans themselves and they brought over American-style work benefits for all of us.  That was my first taste of how good life CAN be and should be and I think the seed of migration was planted back then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>I liked how they acknowledged that the majority of us go to work because we have to, not because we want to.  They also recognised the fact that we all have lives outside work, and therefore they were extremely flexible in a lot of areas.  We got to choose our working hours and we weren't expected to work overtime and if we projected an increase in work activities, we could request for temporary staff.  In the end, we did OT anyways, but we were happy doing it, cause the bosses practised empowerment and basically, after they entrust a task to you, they left you to it to get things accomplished and meet the goals without breathing down  your back, unless you proved to be inefficient. </p>
              <p>THAT is the way working life is meant to be, not work you dry of your blood, and then pay you so little it's outrageous and then expect you to put your entire life on hold for the organisation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>In the end, things may or may not change, but you feel a bit happier knowing that your grievance has been heard and that there are many others out there who have aired their grievances too and so sooner or later, change just might happen.  Even if it doesn't, you feel a bit 'sorng' about it, cause you are not repressed and it's not a thinly-disguised socialist state.</p>
