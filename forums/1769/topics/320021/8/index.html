              <p><br>I'm insured with AIA as well. Not bad, they process claims rather fast(I made a claim for food poisoning before). Certainly much better than NTUC Income.</p>
              <p>I have 2 term insurance policies(accident/hospitalisation/cancer) with them, 3 CPF linked investment policies, plus one savings related one.</p>
              <p>I cannot buy the full life policy type that covers everything under the sun because of the pre-exisiting condition on my left hand. tried and got rejected.</p>

              <p>what fast lens and whatever.. what's wrong with these?</p>
              <p>anyway, from what i heard from the clerical officer, the smelly stuff hit the fan on friday.. the stupidity of my boss trying to take over what is not our section to do, is now a bone of contention somewhere..</p>
              <p>the section which was supposed to do it, went over everyone's head and straight to the No.2 to approve the idea that we take over the whole thing..</p>
              <p>given that my boss keeps stepping all over them in order to impose her own stupidity on the project which is not any of our business, i don't blame the other section..</p>
              <p>thing is, no one sought the approval of our division boss... they just went over her head and straight to the No.2 and that guy, being the useless waste of space that he is, just approved it..</p>
              <p>the division boss is mad with that section for not seeking our consent, and probably with my boss for the total clusterfuck that we're in now..</p>
              <p>i'm going to sit here, do the work, pick up the pieces as best i can, and waltz off to my vacation when the time comes...</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>TOKYO : A man went on a stabbing spree on Sunday in a Tokyo neighbourhood famed for comic-book subculture, killing at least seven people and leaving around a dozen injured in Japan's deadliest crime in years. <br><br>The assailant, who later told police he was "tired of living," swerved a truck into a crowd of pedestrians shortly after noon in Tokyo's bustling Akihabara area before jumping out, and screaming and stabbing strangers. <br><br>The assailant was identified as Tomohiro Kato, 25, from central Shizuola prefecture. <br><br>He first said he was a gangster before retracting his story. <br><br>"I came to Akihabara to kill people. It didn't matter whom I'd kill," he was quoted by Jiji Press as telling police. <br><br>Kato, bespectacled in a beige suit and black-and-white sneakers, was armed with a survival knife and duelled with a police officer who fought back with a baton. <br><br>By the time Kato finally dropped his knife in face of an officer's gunpoint, 17 people lay bloodied on the street of the crowded district, according to fire department and police officials. <br><br>Kato had blood running down the side of his face as he was taken into custody. <br><br>Jiji Press and other Japanese media said seven people were dead - six men aged 19, 20, 29, 33, 47 and 74, and a 21-year-old woman. <br><br>The attack fell on the anniversary of the last incident of such magnitude - a stabbing frenzy that left eight children dead at an elementary school in 2001. <br><br>Ambulances with sirens blaring raced to the scene, where Kato's rented white Isuzu truck was abandoned with a shattered windshield on streets that were closed to traffic on a balmy Sunday afternoon. <br><br>Hundreds of stunned pedestrians stared from a distance as medical workers set up green plastic sheets in the middle of an intersection to ensure privacy as they gave emergency treatment. <br><br>"I was shocked to hear the news as I've visited this place quite often," said Wataru Amano, a 26-year-old truck driver who often visits Akihabara. "I could have been a target if I had been here a few hours ago." <br><br>"I'm afraid this will give a negative image on Akihabara, where people are coming from around the world," he said. <br><br>Akihabara is best known for major electronics stores and in recent years has mushroomed into a haven for Japanese subculture, pulling in tourists from home and abroad interested in comic books and video games. <br><br>Akihabara's attractions range from a museum of Japanese animation to cafes where waitresses dress as maids and video-game characters. <br><br>It is also a major commuter hub. <br><br>"When I passed by, I saw a man collapsed on the street. He was stabbed in the chest and bleeding badly," a young woman said. "He was unconscious." <br><br>It was seven years to the day since a mentally disturbed man went on a rampage with a butcher's knife at the Ikeda elementary school in the posh suburbs of the western metropolis of Osaka. <br><br>Mamoru Takuma, who had an apparent grudge against children of the elites, stabbed to death eight youngsters. <br><br>At Takuma's sentencing, the judge called the killings "one of the most heinous cases in Japan's criminal history." <br><br>Takuma was executed in 2004 at the age of 40. <br><br>The elementary school attack stunned Japan, which prides itself on its safety, and authorities moved to step up security at schools. - AFP/ac/ms <br></span></span></p>

              <p>what do u mean lens not fast enough?</p>
              <p>if u want sharp photos, there's just clearly not enough light to sustain the sharpness required for a fast shutter.</p>
              <p>2 ways to do it, accept the motion blur and think of ways to make a nice photo out of it</p>
              <p>or you should have gotten a canon in the first place.</p>
              <p>even if you are given an ED lens with VR, it still won't work because with so little light, you're shooting at f2.8 (assuming you don't jack up your ISO), the dancer moves out of focus and u still get a blur photo.</p>
              <p>sometimes u just have to accept the "noise", if u want sharp photos u can't have clear photos under low lighting.</p>
              <p>personally i see nothing wrong with these photos. you have to ask yourself what are you looking for in the first place because u can't go on being disappointed all the time and not knowing what you really want to improve on</p>
