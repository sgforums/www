              <p>This space is for sharing interesting and thought-provoking articles, presentations, shows and ideas that provide great insight and might change our lives and societies. Personal essays are welcome, as are those hipster posters, but conspiracy theories do not belong here.</p>
              <p>I'll start with this - why do we go through bubbles and recessions? Our institutions and minds favour stability or constant growth, but that's at odds with reality, which is volatile and unpredictable. Taleb details 5 ways this can change.</p>
              <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324735104578120953311383448.html">Learning to Love Volatility </a></p>
              <p>Summary from <a href="http://www.thoughtyoushouldseethis.com/post/36093381349/nassim-nicholas-talebs-five-policy-rules-for">Thought You Should See This</a>:</p>

              <div class="post"><blockquote>
              <p><strong>Rule 1: Think of the economy as being more like a cat than a washing machine.</strong><br>—”[The] denial of the antifragility of living or complex systems is the costliest mistake that we have made in modern times. Stifling natural fluctuations masks real problems, causing the explosions to be both delayed and more intense when they do take place.”</p>
              <p><strong>Rule 2: Favor businesses that benefit from their own mistakes, not those whose mistakes percolate into the system.<br></strong>Citing the airline and restaurant industries, Taleb describes: “<span>These industries are antifragile: The collective enterprise benefits from the fragility of the individual components, so nothing fails in vain. These businesses have properties similar to evolution in the natural world, with a well-functioning mechanism to benefit from evolutionary pressures, one error at a time.”</span></p>
              <p><strong>Rule 3: Small is beautiful, but it is also efficient.<br></strong><span>—“Experts in business and government are always talking about economies of scale. They say that increasing the size of projects and institutions brings costs savings. But the “efficient,” when too large, isn’t so efficient.” </span></p>
              <p><strong>Rule 4: Trial and error beats academic knowledge.<br></strong><span>—“To promote antifragility, we must recognize that there is an inverse relationship between the amount of formal education that a culture supports and its volume of trial-and-error by tinkering. Innovation doesn’t require theoretical instruction, what I like to compare to “lecturing birds on how to fly.”</span><strong> ”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rule 5: Decision makers must have skin in the game.<br></strong><span>—“In the business world, the solution is simple: Bonuses that go to managers whose firms subsequently fail should be clawed back, and there should be additional financial penalties for those who hide risks under the rug. This has an excellent precedent in the practices of the ancients. The Romans forced engineers to sleep under a bridge once it was completed.”</span></p>

              <h1 id="article_headline"><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-20/singapore-confronts-an-emotion-deficit">In an Emotional World, Singapore Is Comfortably Numb</a></h1>
              <p>Maybe its a sign that I should now apply what I have learnt over a couple of months into this here.</p>
              <p>A sociological approach to this would immediately tear this article to shreds.</p>
              <p>1. Emotion is not "expressed". It is more than that. Emotions are in fact complexes that embody the somatic (biological), feelings, behaviour. What we see here is just one aspect: behaviour, but that's the common mistake for the layman.</p>
              <p>2. There are many perspectives into how we see emotions emerging from.</p>
              <p>-&gt; From self: Biological aspect. Emotions are universal due to our genetic make-up that endows up with the biological capacity for emotions. That means we can't just conclude that we are more emotional than others, unless it be "different" humans we imply. We can also use our cognitive abilities to do "role-taking". That means us formulating courses of actions with advance knowledge on what would happen with their executions. In so doing, we use our mental ability to create our "self" and so shape our emotions.</p>
              <p>-&gt; From culture and social construction. Here we relegate biology as "a base" upon which "secondary emotions" are built upon (etc shame, guilt, pride). Of course this would fit nicely into the above article, which brings me back to the point of how one sided it is considering the many perspectives on emotions.</p>
              <p>-&gt; From interpersonal relationships. There are sociologists who figured that it is wrong to see emotions as arising from "myself" or "them". Instead the loci of emotions arises from the relationships between people. Put simply, it can be said that aggression led to conflict. But it also makes sense to say that <em>conflicts led to aggression</em>! If social relations =&gt; social institutions, then we can actually conclude that our very institutions are in fact, not quite as rational as we think. Emotions are embedded inside, and to just conclude that because people are "numb" because they do not <em>express how they feel</em> without taking a look at the social institutions is a tad naive then.</p>
              <p>Which also brings us to another interesting western-centric view of the separation between emotions and rationality.</p>
              <p>1. Our institutions are no more rational than "irrational ones" because those who shaped them can't be called "emotionless" can they? Consider "formal declarations of war". What difference is it from "bomb them to tell them" besides the veil, except that it "seems more rational"?</p>
              <p>2. We can't be rational without emotions. That's what psychologists have concluded after examining a patient who lost his emotions and subsequently became "irrational" despite <em>knowledge of what it takes to be "rational"</em>. The hypothesis put forth is that we use emotions to rank our priorities. Without emotions, we won't be "rational".</p>

              <p>There ought more to life than just getting married, buying a house, starting a family and then 'boom'. It'd be sad if one lives according to the expectations of other people who can't live their lives for them. Sometimes I wonder how much of this preaching is out of genuine concern, or jealousy bringing one down to the lowest common denominator.</p>
              <p>But I guess there's a reason why certain people are so keen on achieving those standard milestones and why they remain desirable. Having kids is the only way one's possessions and beliefs can live on after he/she dies. It's probably the more "dignified" way of having someone to depend on in old age and to visit one's grave. In short, it's an attempt to preserve one's memory, because <em>we're afraid of being forgotten</em>.</p>

              <p>If anybody is curious about how Samsung burst into the fore in the electronics sector, and amazingly for a sector known for wild turn-overs of leadership, managed to stay at the front since the early 1990s, this paper is for you.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/ecs/pub/wp-scape/0513.pdf">Creating First-mover Advantages: The Case of Samsung Electronics.</a></p>
              <p>Written by Prof Shin, who is widely regarded to be expert in East Asian economies, as well as Innovation Economics.</p>
              <p>42 pages long, but will reward the patient people, because it goes in depth into how Samsung's management has worked to its advantage, and how as long as it stays, Samsung's leadership is likely to stay on, barring radical developments. Yet the paper is devoid of all the fancy math and what-not, and is easily accesible for the laymen.</p>
              <p>I have read it, so if anybody wants a summary, I can do so, but not now, as I am busy.</p>

              <p>A paragraph from Joseph Stiglitz's book " The Roaring Nineties" on 
              how improper deregulation of industries have led to the money being 
              channeled to the rich instead of where it need be.</p>
              <p><em>Fortunately most Americans did not know how bad things had become, or they would have become frightened of flying. I did an on-site inspection of the equipment at National Airport, serving the nation's capital. The computers were so old that they still used vacuum tubes that had to be imported from Poland, since almost everyone else had stopped making them. The roomful of out-of-date computers had a computing power less than the laptop on which I am now writing. The backup batteries occupied another room, old-fashioned chemicals with an on-site shower in case any of the acids spilled - but for all the drama, in the event of a black-out, they could last only about a half hour, far shorter than the battery for my laptop.</em></p>
