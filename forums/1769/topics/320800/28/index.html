              <p>i will be giving the ass force one last chance before i bring it up to the MP about my issue. The answer they have given is non satisfactory at all.</p>
              <p>so i talked to my CO and told him that if i get a crap answer one more time, i'm bringing it to the top (prepare him for being chromed by higher ups). so he told me to write an email, and he will forward it to the top person in charge of this instead of letting some DXO answer. he said if i'm still not happy then its out of his control and i will have to talk to a MP.</p>

              <p>my contract. they are not keeping to their word.</p>
              <p>i have to serve a 4 yr bond after my course finishes.</p>
              <p>i am given 2 yrs to finish the course.</p>
              <p>i finished my course before the given 2 yrs, therefore my bond has to start since i've started work as a qualified technician at that point.</p>
              <p>but now they are telling me, even though i'm qualified, i'm still under the 2yrs training period.</p>
              <p>WTF? i went to Tsunami relief as a trainee?</p>
              <p>they can't give me a good answer except "its policy"</p>
              <p>policy? what policy? does that make the paper i signed totally useless?</p>
              <p>regarding the 2 years, its like i give u 3 yrs to get your diploma but you get it in 2. what are u gonna do? hang around campus for another year?</p>

              <p>Like what Tare said, if you have loads of $$, you can choose where you want to stay.  Just don't rely on the government/welfare.  While you might get help from the government, it's not enough for you to live comfortably given the cost of living is pretty high.</p>
