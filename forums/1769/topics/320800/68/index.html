              <p>Oh!  I recall my dream this morning!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was in some foreign land, wielding a bulky black digicam, trying to take shots of this endless field of flowers, when suddenly, I trudged out of this gigantic greenhouse, and saw a tornado in the distance!</p>
              <p>The tornado soon got quite close, and dunno how come suddenly, I'm in a Japanese movie like that, got Japanese detective mates and I standing around, looking at the tornado destroy a few blocks of buildings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>We then ran on the open grassland, and came upon this construction site where they had piled up 'boxes' of building extensions, you know, like the HDB projects where they add-on extra rooms to old flats?  And each 'box' was tiny and had different coloured stoves in them.</p>
              <p>We just looked at the tornado in the distance, and we were discussing if the tornado will come close to us and destroy the semi-constructed blocks of apartments...</p>
              <p>... and then I woke up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Weird!</p>

              <p>He claims that he then hugged her with her consent.</p>
              <p>But their friendship has gone sour after she accused him of allegedly molesting her on a trip to South Korea last October.</p>
              <p>The man is giving his side of the story following a report in The New Paper yesterday.</p>
              <p>Amy (not her real name) a graduate student, had recounted the incident on her personal blog.</p>
              <p>She had asked Jim (not his real name), 34, an engineer, to accompany her to Seoul to settle an accident claim because none of her female friends could make the trip.</p>
              <p>Amy, 24, claimed she had booked a hotel room with two separate beds, but because of a reservation error, they were asked to move to a room with a double bed after one night.</p>
              <p>She alleged that on the last night of the trip, she was asleep when she felt something rubbing against her buttocks.</p>
              <p>She has since made a police report in Korea about the incident.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Jim told The New Paper they had been friends for more than three years, since they were colleagues at an IT firm in 2004.</p>
              <p>He said: 'In early 2005, I asked her out for the first time. From then on, we saw each other frequently for the next two years or so.'</p>
              <p>He said he would ask her out regularly, often for meals and movies. At one point, he saw her almost daily.</p>
              <p>'We wouldn't necessarily go out each time. Sometimes I would just pick her up from work,' he recalled.</p>
              <p>'It was clear to her that I was interested. When we went out, she would sometimes let me hold her waist or put my arm around her shoulder.'</p>
              <strong>
              <p>However, Amy said Jim tried doing this at group gatherings, but she would shrug off his advances each time.</p>
              <p>She said he had asked her to be his girlfriend several times but she rejected him because their 'personalities did not match'.</p>
              </strong>
              <p>Early in their friendship, he said he offered to lend Amy $48,000 to repay a study loan. Although she was 'apprehensive about it at first', she accepted his offer.</p>
              <p>When asked, she confirmed this, but claimed that the money was a gift from him. She claimed that she had told him upfront that there was a possibility she would not be able to repay the loan.</p>
              <p>'He told me not to worry about it,' she said.</p>
              <p>But Jim said that after the Seoul trip, he fell out with her and wanted his money back.</p>
              <p>He was only able to communicate with her through a mutual friend.</p>
              <p>'I told her, through her friend, that I wanted my money back. She said she was agreeable to that,' he said.</p>
              <p>At the time, he was holding another job as a financial planner and had sold several policies to Amy.</p>
              <p><strong>ANGRY</strong></p>
              <p>Soon after they returned from Korea, Amy wrote in to terminate the policies because he had allegedly outraged her modesty.</p>
              <p>'I was very angry,' said Jim, who then sent a letter through his lawyers to demand the money back.</p>
              <p>She replied, also through a lawyer, that the money was a gift from him.</p>
              <p>Jim's lawyer then sent a second letter saying the money was a loan, and not a gift.</p>
              <p>Amy told The New Paper she understood the money was a gift because Jim had not asked for it to be returned until the Seoul incident.</p>
              <p>Before the trip, she had been planning to buy a small car. She asked Jim to accompany her to a car showroom because he was knowledgeable about cars.</p>
              <p>She said: 'Jim knew about my intention to buy a car. If the money was supposed to be a loan, he would have insisted I pay him back right away.'</p>
              <p>He said that she had given him mixed signals on whether she was interested in him.</p>
              <p>'In May last year, I went for a motivational course to learn how to open up. After the course, I told Amy one night that I loved her,' he said.</p>
              <p>He claimed he asked her whether he could give her a hug, and she agreed.</p>
              <strong>
              <p>Amy claims to have no recollection of the incident. She said that she had always made it clear to him that she regarded him only as a friend.</p>
              </strong>
              <p>'I believe he knew this. Whenever we were out at gatherings and people asked if I was his girlfriend, he would reply no,' she said.</p>
              <p>He said he did not push her for a reply after he revealed his feelings for her and did not hear from her for months.</p>
              <p>He said he was surprised when she asked him to go to Seoul with her because they hadn't spoken in a while. He asked her why she had asked him along instead of a female friend.</p>
              <p>'She told me her friends couldn't make it, and that she needed a companion because the airfare would be cheaper if two people went,' he said. He agreed to go because 'I needed a break because I had been very busy at work'.</p>
              <p>He added: 'And, of course, I was still interested in her.'</p>
              <p>He declined to comment on what happened during the trip because his lawyers have advised him not to talk about it.</p>
              <p>Jim said he was unaware of Amy's accusations because he seldom reads blogs. He learnt of it only when a friend e-mailed the blog entry to him last Sunday.</p>
              <p>He said: 'After that first e-mail, more of my friends and colleagues began telling me about it because they recognised my name on her blog.'</p>
              <p>He said he had not contacted Amy about her allegations, but added: 'This has affected me. I haven't been able to stay focused at work.'</p>
              <p>He said Amy was the first woman he has pursued in nearly a decade.</p>
              <p>The last time he had a girlfriend was during his school days.</p>
              <p>Of his courtship, he said: 'I had been waiting for her for more than two years.'</p>
