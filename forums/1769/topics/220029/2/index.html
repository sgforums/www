            <div class='col-md body'>Example of our Non-DKP ZG Run loot system<br><br>Priority Invites<br><br>1. Only KoME Guildies are allowed to go. No outsiders allowed. Alternates are also not prioritized, unless needed to satisfy class balance.<br><br>2. Class balance is priority over queue.<br><br>3. Regular members have more preference over probationary ones. Unless there's a need for class balance, only then the person on probation will be prioritized.<br><br>4. The raid leader, backed up by an officer, has the authority to decide who will be locked out and who will stay should there be an excessive turn out in the raid. The preference will be based on class balance, member status, and lifetime DKP. The raid leader is not allowed to be questioned at anytime during the raid on his decision to lockout anyone.<br><br>Loot rules<br><br>1. Please note that most loots, if not all, are class preferred. Meaning when these items drop, only selected classes are allowed to roll. some loots have primary and secondary class preference. If the primary class pass on the item, then secondary classes will be allowed to roll. If seconday classes pass on the item, then the item will be open roll to anyone who wants it.<br><br>2. There could be multiple rounds of rolling for item. 1st round, only members are allowed to roll. Also, if the item is not preferred to your class, you are not allowed to roll. 2nd round, If there is a secondary class preference to the item, then the preferred class will roll. If none, then it's an open roll.<br><br>3. Open roll means that everyone can roll on the item if they want it, whether they are on probation, alternate, or someone who has already won a loot previously. However, please don't be greedy and roll only when this item is useful for you. If you have yet to win a blue/epic loot and rolled on an item during open roll and win it, you take the loot but it doesn't count as your epic/blue loot.<br><br>4. Everyone is entitled to win 1 loot (blue/epic) only. However, if another item drops that is an upgrade for you and no one else wants it, you can roll for it during the open roll round.<br><br>5. Primal Hakkari items are open roll in the beginning. All classes which is classified by the item can roll as they wish. If you win this item, it doesn't count as your blue/epic loot. You can only get 1 primal hakkari item per instance reset. However, if you already won a primal hakkari item and another drops that is for your class while no one wants it, then you can roll again.<br><br>6. Hakkari Idol (drops from Jindo and Bloodlord) is preferred for those who have Tier 2 Helm + class doll. If you have both, you are allowed to roll. If none in the raid has tier 2 helm + class doll, then roll will be opened for 2nd round to those who have tier 2 leggings + class doll. If in any case, no one has tier 2 leggings + class doll, and you do not have a class doll but has tier 2 helm, then you can roll on 3rd round. If no one has tier 2 helm and no one has doll, then those who have tier 2 leggings can roll for the idol on 4th round. You can only get 1 idol per instance reset. Please bring your doll in the raid! If you forgot to bring your doll and is left in the bank or your alt, it doesn't count as you having a doll.<br><br>7. Bind on Equip item drops whether it's epic, rare, or uncommon should be greed rolled by everyone. If you accidentally roll need on the item, the item will be subjected to manual rolls by the raid. As a penalty for you, you will not be allowed to roll on this specific item.<br><br>8. Coins and Bijous should be greed rolled by everyone. If you accidentally roll need on the item, the item will be subjected to manual rolls by the raid. As a penalty for you, you will not be allowed to roll on this specific item.<br><br>9. Dolls are open roll in the beginning. All classes which is classified by the item can roll as they wish. If you win this item, it doesn't count as your blue/epic loot. You can only get 1 doll per instance reset. However, if you already won a doll and traded it for enchant already then another drops that is for your class while no one wants it, then you can roll again.<br><br>Bid/Rolling Rules<br><br>1. Raid leader will call for rolls on loots. Rolls will only start after the raid leader typed "Need Roll on [Item on Bid]" in raid chat channel. Any rolls before this message is called will not be valid.<br><br>2. Raid leader ends the call for rolls by typing "Roll Closed on [Item on Bid]" in raid chat channel. Any rolls called after this message will not be valid.<br><br>3. Rolling on items is a serious event. Anyone who jokes around and throw random rolls will be subjected to disciplinary action and can anytime be removed by the raid leader from the raid without questions.<br><br>4. If the loot winner has been declared by the raid leader, it is final. If you missed on rolling on an item that you wanted because you were not aware when raid leader called for rolls, you cannot complain about it and better luck next time.<br><br>Raid Specifics<br><br>1. Class balance is very important and the following are the minimum number of class combinations needed for the raid:<br>3 warriors<br>3 primary healers (at least 1 priest and 1 druid)<br>2 mages<br>2 secondary healers (at least 1 shaman)<br>1 warlock<br>1 rogue<br>1 hunter<br><br>2. Anytime during the raid that you need to AFK for a while, it is strongly required to inform the raid leader about it. Otherwise, you maybe removed from the raid and possibly be temporarily banned from the next ZG raids as penalty. This will be raid leader's decision with an officer backing up.<br><br>3. Anytime during the raid that you need to leave, it is strongly required to inform the raid leader about it rather than just leaving without prior notice. Otherwise, you maybe temporarily banned from the next ZG raids as penalty. This will be raid leader's decision with an officer backing up.<br><br>4. If you refuse to follow the raid leader's instructions without reasonable excuse at anytime during the raid, you maybe subjected from removal in the raid and could be temporarily banned from the next ZG raids as penalty. This will be raid leader's decision with an officer backing up.<br><br>5. If you flood the raid chat channel and/or pollute the ventrilo channel for no apparent reason, you maybe subjected from removal in the raid and could be temporarily banned from the next ZG raids as penalty. This will be raid leader's decision with an officer backing up.<br><br>Loot listing Class Preference<br><br>Loot Class: Caster Items<br>Primary class Preference: All Casters (Druids, Priests, Mages, Warlocks, Shamans)<br>Â¤ Fang of Venoxis (8.41%)<br>Â¤ Mar'li's Touch (7.85%)<br>Â¤ Jeklik's Opaline Talisman (9.97%)<br>Â¤ Zulian Defender (9.45%)<br><br>Loot Class: Ranged Weapons<br>Primary class Preference: Hunters<br>Seconday Class Preference: All warriors, rogues<br>Â¤ Mandokir's Sting (5.05%)<br>Â¤ Gurubashi Dwarf Destroyer (3.50%)<br><br>Loot Class: Healing Gears<br>Primary class Preference: Priests, Restoration Druids/Shamans<br>Seconday Class Preference: DPS Druid/Shamans, All Casters<br>Â¤ Primalist's Band (11.86%)<br>Â¤ Primalist's Seal (6.84%)<br>Â¤ Mar'li's Eye (12.27%)<br>Â¤ Hakkari Loa Cloak (8.79%)<br>Â¤ Ritualistic Legguards (12.89%)<br>Â¤ Will of Arlokk (6.20%)<br>Â¤ Jin'do's Evil Eye (7.45%)<br>Â¤ Jin'do's Hexxer (8.63%)<br>Â¤ Animist's Spaulders (4.30%)<br>Â¤ Animist's Leggings (12.38%)<br>Â¤ Animist's Boots (15.29%)<br>Â¤ Zulian Headdress (5.18%)<br>Â¤ Zulian Scepter of Rites (4.34%)<br>Â¤ Arlokk's Hoodoo Stick (18.25%)<br><br>Loot Class: Tank Gears<br>Primary class Preference: Guild MT/OT, Protection spec warriors<br>Seconday Class Preference: All warriors, Feral druids (if can equip)<br>Â¤ Bloodlord's Defender (5.05%)<br>Â¤ Overlord's Crimson Band (13.36%)<br>Â¤ Bloodsoaked Greaves (14.23%)<br>Â¤ Overlord's Onyx Band (17.15%)<br>Â¤ Overlord's Embrace (11.37%)<br>Â¤ Aegis of the Blood God (7.67%)<br>Â¤ Talisman of Protection (12.47%)<br>Â¤ Bloodsoaked Gauntlets (12.16%)<br><br>Loot Class: DPS Plate Armor<br>Primary class Preference: DPS Warriors<br>Seconday Class Preference: All warriors<br>Â¤ Bloodsoaked Pauldrons (11.07%)<br>Â¤ Bloodsoaked Legplates (4.67%)<br>Â¤ Sacrificial Gauntlets (4.35%)<br><br>Loot Class: 2h Melee Weapons + axe<br>Primary class Preference: DPS Warriors, Shamans (if can equip)<br>Seconday Class Preference: All warriors, Hunters (if can equip), Druids (if can equip)<br>Â¤ Jeklik's Crusher (5.67%)<br>Â¤ Halberd of Smiting (2.77%)<br>Â¤ Zulian Stone Axe (8.94%)<br>Â¤ Ancient Hakkari Manslayer (5.17%)<br><br>Loot Class: 2h Melee Weapons (Can be Hunter Weapon!)<br>Primary class Preference: DPS Warriors, Hunters<br>Seconday Class Preference: All warriors<br>Â¤ Zin'rokh, Destroyer of Worlds (5.00%)<br><br>[b]Loot Class: 1h Melee Weapons<br>Primary class Preference: DPS Warriors, Rogues<br>Seconday Class Preference: All warriors, Hunters<br>Â¤ Arlokk's Grasp (4.01%)<br>Â¤ Thekal's Grasp (9.54%)<br>Â¤ Warblade of the Hakkari (2.44%)<br>Â¤ Fang of the Faceless (8.50%)<br>Â¤ Warblade of the Hakkari (5.67%)<br><br>Loot Class: DPS Caster Gears<br>Primary class Preference: Mages, Warlocks, Shamans<br>Seconday Class Preference: Priests, Druids<br>Â¤ Zanzil's Band (7.87%)<br>Â¤ Zanzil's Seal (11.40%)<br>Â¤ Bloodtinged Kilt (8.14%)<br>Â¤ Bloodtinged Gloves (9.41%)<br>Â¤ Flowing Ritual Robes (7.24%)<br>Â¤ Jin'do's Bag of Whammies (7.06%)<br>Â¤ Jin'do's Judgement (8.63%)<br>Â¤ Heart of Hakkar (49.50%)<br>Â¤ Cloak of Consumption (5.00%)<br>Â¤ Belt of Untapped Power (4.96%)<br>Â¤ Bloodcaller (8.33%)<br>Â¤ Touch of Chaos (6.50%)<br>Â¤ Soul Corrupter's Necklace (9.33%)<br>Â¤ Band of Servitude (3.23%)<br>Â¤ Cloak of the Hakkari Worshipers (4.06%)<br>Â¤ The Hexxer's Cover (6.67%)<br>Â¤ Betrayer's Boots (5.41%)<br>Â¤ Nat Pagle's Broken Reel (18.66%)<br><br>Loot Class: DPS Leather Gears<br>Primary class Preference: Rogues, Feral Druids<br>Seconday Class Preference: Hunters, DPS Warriors<br>Â¤ Blooddrenched Footpads (12.34%)<br>Â¤ Blooddrenched Grips (9.93%)<br>Â¤ Blooddrenched Leggings (20.00%)<br>Â¤ Blooddrenched Mask (4.38%)<br>Â¤ Foror's Eyepatch (6.22%)<br><br>Loot Class: DPS Cross Class Gears<br>Primary class Preference: Rogues, DPS Warriors, Feral Druids, Hunters<br>Seconday Class Preference: DPS Shamans, All Warriors<br>Â¤ Might of the Tribe (5.17%)<br>Â¤ Seal of the Gurubashi Berserker (3.91%)<br>Â¤ Zulian Tigerhide Cloak (8.94%)<br>Â¤ Band of Jin (9.86%)<br>Â¤ Seal of Jin (11.60%)<br>Â¤ The Eye of Hakkar (7.50%)<br>Â¤ Zulian Slicer (5.67%)<br><br>Loot Class: Hunter Items!<br>Primary class Preference: Hunter<br>Seconday Class Preference: Shamans<br>Â¤ Runed Bloodstained Hauberk (7.16%)<br>Â¤ Bloodstained Coif (5.88%)<br>Â¤ Bloodstained Legplates (7.06%)<br>Â¤ Bloodstained Greaves (8.25%)<br>Â¤ Gloves of the Tormented (4.03%)<br>Â¤ Tigule's Harpoon (19.14%)<br><br>Loot Class: Shaman Items!<br>Primary class Preference: Shaman<br>Seconday Class Preference: Hunter<br>Â¤ Seafury Leggings (4.38%)<br>Â¤ Seafury Gauntlets (6.67%)<br>Â¤ Seafury Boots (5.67%)<br><br>Loot Class: Druid Weapon!<br>Primary class Preference: Druid<br>Seconday Class Preference: Hunter<br>Â¤ Nat Pagle's Fish Terminator (1.44%)<br><br>Loot Class: FFA (doesn't count as blue/epic loot if you win this)<br>Â¤ Panther Hide Sack (9.12%)<br>Â¤ Tiger mount<br>Â¤ Raptor mount<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah ... read through the posts and i suddenly feel v lucky.....<br><br>my guild use to have turn out problems but it resolved it self when we recruited a few more. It was like a 2 prong problem solver - first we solve our shortage of turn out, next we make the lazy buggers wake up their ideas. of cos now we have problems with people fighting for raid slots and we had 2 pple who gquit cos they are not picked for raid.<br><br>imo, a guild that progress will automatically attract people to join and raid. therefore a good strong core team of raiders and a strong raid leader is the key to every progressive guild. if you find that you guild is not progressing due to manpower problems, then gotta rethink guild policies, structure or look for a merger.<br><br>a little about my guild. my guild is run differently from others that i know off. we have 1 gm and 8 class officers. the power lies with the 8 class officers. they decide who to recuit, wat is good for their class, who gets to raid and make decisions that affect guild policies. GM is like co-ordinator <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>we are only 7 months old but we have Nef on farm status. we got a good strong raid leader and a good strong core team of raiders. these are the mad hats that drive progression. with progression people will tend to stay and people are more willing to listen and follow.<br><br>another thing is that we are not afraid to change. if a policy is outdated, we change it. if the guild structure is no longer working as intended, we change it. (we just had our first guild general elections). i believe it is our willingness to accept change that makes my guild so strong.<br><br>humm okie, i think i express a lot of love for my guild liao. signing off!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

And we are always changing policies too.<br><br>For example, AQ20 and ZG used to be DKP system but we scrapped there. When ppl picked and choose instances, we adopted blind raids and not schedule raids. Not enough people we recruit but we let the members know that this is the outcome of them not turning up.<br><br>We have our core raiding team too only thing is so paiseh I'm one of the core mages and the mage officer but lately no time to raid  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all system got pro and con la. with dkp it is a sure thing that pple get the gear according to effort. but that does not keep out idiots who dun think before saying "i go more dkp than u i dun care if u can use it better". with the assigning loot system the raid is built up according to the direction of the guild which is good but that itself often result in unhappy people. i guess best is to adopt wat works best for the guild  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>i went to TX to look at the wow trading card game. it is soooo nerdy. i fear my other half is turning into a nerd-monster  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
