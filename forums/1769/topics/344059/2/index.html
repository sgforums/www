              <p>In 2009, Chinese Lunar New Year – or the first day of the first lunar moon – falls on the Gregorian calendar date of 26th Jan 2009. Chinese all over the world will celebrate the new Chinese Year of the Earth Ox (Heavenly Stem of Ji Chou).</p>
              <p>The current year of the Earth Rat will be replaced by the <strong>Earth Ox</strong> which is the next stem branch combo in the Sixty ‘Jia Zi’ astrological cycles.</p>
              <p>The New Year brings a change in the ‘qi’ that affects us. Knowing what they are allows us to make better use of our home and office premise and maximize our Feng Shui luck in 2009.</p>
              <p>In 2009 the inauspicious energies of Five Yellow affects the north sector. Five Yellow is associated with major illness and calamities and it is wise to stay away from the north sector if you can. If your bedroom, study or office is in the north sector, you should move – if you can - to another sector (preferably south east which I will explain in a while). If you main door is located in the north sector and/or facing north, you should use another entrance if available.</p>
              <p>If you cannot relocate to another room or you do not have an alternative entrance then you should place metal items such as wind chimes or a copper vases or metal coins in the north sector to counter the effect of <strong>Five Yellow</strong>. Try your best not to disturb the area and remove any activators such as moving water feature, that could fan the energy and make the situation worse.</p>
              <p>In 2009, <strong>Three Killings</strong> – or San Sha - resides in the east. Three Killing comprises of the triple combo of year, disaster and robbery sha. In addition to obstacles, Three Killing is also associated with accidents and losses (financial included).</p>
              <p>To counter the triple effects of Three Killings, you should place a plant together with water and metal in the east sector e.g. money plant in water placed on top of metal coins. If you have space outside the house in the east sector you can also plant a tree to soften the effect of Three Killings.</p>
              <p>And of course no major renovation works in these sectors – especially those involving ground breaking - in the north and east for the whole of 2009.</p>
              <p>Tai Sui is in NE1 – the 15 degree part of NE that is adjacent or closest to the north sector. The opposite of Tai Sui is Sui Po – or Year Breaker at SW1. If you house is facing Tai Sui (NE1), you should refrain from carrying out any renovation at all in 2008! Also place a metal item in the NE1 sector to block the effect of Tai Sui.</p>
              <p>Now that you have taken care of the highly dangerous sector, let’s look at what we can do to improve the other areas. This year the better sectors are the south east (8) and center (9). The energy in the south east is associated with career growth and business success while that in the center (9) is associated with fame, position and happy events.</p>
              <p>You can improve your luck by using these sectors and by energizing the south east especially with an activator such as an indoor fountain or aquarium.</p>
              <p>The north-west is associated with promotion and growth (1) and it is good to make use of this sector.</p>
              <p>Looking for romance or need a boost with your education? Make use of the south (4) sector as the energy of romance and learning resides there this year. Place a plant in this sector.</p>
              <p>The south west is inhabited by the authority (6) star in 2009. This is a good sector for those holding high position that requires authority e.g. CEO, politician or military. Place earthen ware objects to enhance the sector.</p>
              <p>In addition to north which is a very bad sector in 2009, you should also take care of the other sectors that are inhabited with inauspicious energies. There are the east, west and north-east sectors. The robbery star (7) resides in the east. To diminish its effect, place a bucket of still water in the east.</p>
              <p>The argument star (3) resides in the north east sector. Place a lamp or many lamps in this area.</p>
              <p>The illness star (2) occupies the west. Since the west is associated with the youngest daughter, mouth and lungs, young girls with mouth and respiratory problems should take extra care. Place a metal Wu Lu (close lid) here to reduce the effect of this star. Those who are recuperating from an illness should also avoid this sector.</p>

              <p>Everything can be classfiled as one of the 5 elements. The 5 elements are Metal Element, Wood Element, Water Element, Fire Element and the Earth Element. These elements represents the movement and action of the energy, therefore it cannot be taken literally that you are a block of wood if you belong to the wood element.</p>
              <p>The relationship of these elements represents the productive and the destructive interaction between them.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Productive cycle</span></strong></p>
              <p>Giving water to the trees would make the trees grow producing wood</p>
              <p>From the trees you get wood that can be used to produce fire</p>
              <p>The ashes from the burnt wood would produce earth while it from the earth that metal can be found.</p>
              <p>These metal ore when melted will produce a liquid form thus representing the water element.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Destructive Cycle</span></strong></p>
              <p>Water can be used to put out the fire while fire can melt even the hardest metal </p>
              <p>Metal can be made into an axe that can cut down the trees while the trees can penerate the deepest earth.</p>
              <p>Earth can use used to dam the river blocking the water flows </p>

              <p>From the Yin Yang Theory, we have derived the trigram or <strong>å…«å�¦. </strong>So how can we remember which is which? There's a song to it. It goes like this</p>
              <p>chien san lian (chien is 3 straight line)</p>
              <p>kun liu tuan  (kun is 3 broken lines of 6)</p>
              <p>dui shang que ( tui has a broken top)</p>
              <p>sun xia duan (sun has a broken base)</p>
              <p>li zhong she (li has a false centre)</p>
              <p>kan zhong mun (kan has a full centre)</p>
              <p>zhen tan yu (zhen is like a spitoon)</p>
              <p>gen fu wan (gen is like a reverse bowl)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These Trigram also represents represents directions, natural phenomenon, attribute of a person as well as member of a family.</p>

              <p>It must have been pretty boring for some, so it's story telling time to lighten the atmosphre here. Once during a flood long time ago, a man named Fu Hsi found a dead giantic horse in the river. This horse was known as a dragon horse Therefore it is sometime represented with a horse with a dragon head. On this horse, there were special marking on it body. These marking  were recorded as later known as the River Map or The Early Heaven Trigram.</p>
              <p>Later on in the Hsia dynasty, there was another flood and this time a man by the name of Hsia Yu found a tortoise in the River Luo with special marking  on its shell. These marking was also recorded and is known as the Luo Shu or the Later Heaven Trigram.</p>
              <p>Thus the Early Heaven Trigram and the Later Heaven Trigram becomes the basis of fengshui, i-ching, Ba Zhi etc....</p>
              <p>Some of you may know the name of my son is Yu Jiang ï¼ˆç¦¹æ±Ÿ as in  å¤§ç¦¹æ²»æ±Ÿ) I have selected his name based on the story of emperor Hsia Yu</p>

              <p>Economic Preview for 2009</p>
              <p><br>We start 2009 in the midst of major economic changes shown by Pluto in the sign of Capricorn. This cycle’s purpose is to transform the economy, the government, businesses and even capitalism, so we can develop a sustainable economy that<br>supports the entire Earth and everyone on it.</p>
              <p><br>In late November – January, the Federal Reserve is undergoing major challenges (See the article, The Federal Reserve and You). These challenges are also to the US dollar and we could see discussions related to rescuing the dollar or changing currencies.</p>
              <p><br>In February, we get the second peak of Saturn opposite Uranus on February 5th, suggesting that we’re in the midst of another “earthquake”. Whoever wins the Presidency will be working hard on damage control. In February the US has a<br>major debt crisis that peaks (USA Venus opposed by transiting Pluto), and this is the FIRST time the US will have this cycle.</p>
              <p><br>Earlier this year, it was reported in the Wall Street Journal that at the end of 2008, about $600 billion more of sub-prime home mortgages are due to increase in rates. This alone has the potential to cause the crisis.</p>
              <p><br>However, that could just be the trigger for a much bigger challenge as trillions of dollars in mortgage derivatives crash.</p>
              <p><br>This is no doubt why the Treasury and the Fed are shaking in their boots these days. They know there is not enough money in the entire world to cover the many trillions of dollars of derivatives that could crash with the mortgage mess.<br>It’s also possible that this debt crisis could end up crashing the US dollar. This could happen due to too many dollars being printed and the value finally crashing, but this is more likely to wait until March.</p>
              <p>March 6th through April 17th we get Venus retrograde (Red Contracts) square to Pluto, a clear sign that the financial situation is in trouble. In late March we also get the beginning of what will be with us throughout the year until mid-January 2010: hyper-inflation or stagflation. This is shown by Jupiter, Chiron and Neptune all in the same place (conjunct). The last time we had this trio in a major configuration in the 80s, we<br>had stagflation. This time we could see hyper-inflation.</p>
              <p><br>What’s the difference between the two? Stagflation occurs when we get inflation together with a stagnant economy or no growth. Hyper-inflation occurs when the value of a currency has devalued to the point that it finally crashes. This is caused by the printing of too much currency relative to the amount of goods and services that are being “chased” by the money.</p>
              <p><br>Severe hyper-inflation gets to the point of daily inflation increases. Brazil experienced 100% inflation per day at one point, but people learned to deal with it. If we get hyper-<br>inflation, it will strategically be a mistake to save dollars. You will need to buy gold or silver in order to save money. And speaking of gold, if you have any, hold onto to it. If the currency is replaced this year with a new currency that’s partially backed by gold, the price of gold could go to $5000 per ounce if they back 10% of the new currency with gold.</p>
              <p><br>The July and August 2009 eclipses also suggest a sudden need for new reforms due to unexpected changes. Trying to solve problems with old solutions will not work and new ones must be found. The debt issue shows up in these eclipses as well, suggesting they are part of the problem.</p>
              <p><br>In September we get the peak of third “earthquake” cycle of Saturn opposite Uranus. If the dollar doesn’t crash earlier in the year, this is the most likely time for it to do that.<br>On October 29th, Saturn moves into the sign of Libra and immediately squares Pluto. This cycle is related to major challenges for transforming structures. It’s a challenging cycle for the economy and depending on what happens before then, will depend on how serious this cycle will impact the economy.</p>
              <p><br>The power of a similar cycle, Saturn opposite Pluto was demonstrated by the 9-11 destruction of the World Trade Towers. That event has changed many other structures in our daily lives. Look for similar levels of impact from this.</p>
              <p><br>We continue to revisit the issues of debt or financial loss and high inflation throughout the year. By the end of December or late January 2010, we start crawling out of this mess. In the meantime, we’ll find ways to deal with it as life goes on.</p>

              <p>Happy Lunar New Year everyone. Sorry for the long break. There should be some more short elementary theory and the History of Feng Shui before this topic ends.</p>
              <p>I will be starting 2 more new thread after that</p>
              <p>1) <strong>Feng Shui Intermediate</strong> - This topic shall discuss the Landform theory (more stories to tell). I will try to include more Singapore landscape (need to go for photo shoot) although it will include some from China and South korea during my holidays.Next we will do some simple calculations and the Ba Zhai compass theory</p>
              <p>2) <strong>Feng Shui Advance</strong> - What is all these theory without practical. Will try to do a step by step example on a house (including all rooms)</p>

              <p>Happy Lunar New Year everyone. Sorry for the long break. There should be some more short elementary theory and the History of Feng Shui before this topic ends.</p>
              <p>I will be starting 2 more new thread after that</p>
              <p>1) <strong>Feng Shui Intermediate</strong> - This topic shall discuss the Landform theory (more stories to tell). I will try to include more Singapore landscape (need to go for photo shoot) although it will include some from China and South korea during my holidays.Next we will do some simple calculations and the Ba Zhai compass theory</p>
              <p>2) <strong>Feng Shui Advance</strong> - What is all these theory without practical. Will try to do a step by step example on a house (including all rooms) </p>

              <p>In 2009, Chinese Lunar New Year – or the first day of the first lunar moon – falls on the Gregorian calendar date of 26th Jan 2009. Chinese all over the world will celebrate the new Chinese Year of the Earth Ox (Heavenly Stem of Ji Chou).</p>
              <p>The current year of the Earth Rat will be replaced by the <strong>Earth Ox</strong> which is the next stem branch combo in the Sixty ‘Jia Zi’ astrological cycles.</p>
              <p>The New Year brings a change in the ‘qi’ that affects us. Knowing what they are allows us to make better use of our home and office premise and maximize our Feng Shui luck in 2009.</p>
              <p>In 2009 the inauspicious energies of Five Yellow affects the north sector. Five Yellow is associated with major illness and calamities and it is wise to stay away from the north sector if you can. If your bedroom, study or office is in the north sector, you should move – if you can - to another sector (preferably south east which I will explain in a while). If you main door is located in the north sector and/or facing north, you should use another entrance if available.</p>
              <p>If you cannot relocate to another room or you do not have an alternative entrance then you should place metal items such as wind chimes or a copper vases or metal coins in the north sector to counter the effect of <strong>Five Yellow</strong>. Try your best not to disturb the area and remove any activators such as moving water feature, that could fan the energy and make the situation worse.</p>
              <p>In 2009, <strong>Three Killings</strong> – or San Sha - resides in the east. Three Killing comprises of the triple combo of year, disaster and robbery sha. In addition to obstacles, Three Killing is also associated with accidents and losses (financial included).</p>
              <p>To counter the triple effects of Three Killings, you should place a plant together with water and metal in the east sector e.g. money plant in water placed on top of metal coins. If you have space outside the house in the east sector you can also plant a tree to soften the effect of Three Killings.</p>
              <p>And of course no major renovation works in these sectors – especially those involving ground breaking - in the north and east for the whole of 2009.</p>
              <p>Tai Sui is in NE1 – the 15 degree part of NE that is adjacent or closest to the north sector. The opposite of Tai Sui is Sui Po – or Year Breaker at SW1. If you house is facing Tai Sui (NE1), you should refrain from carrying out any renovation at all in 2008! Also place a metal item in the NE1 sector to block the effect of Tai Sui.</p>
              <p>Now that you have taken care of the highly dangerous sector, let’s look at what we can do to improve the other areas. This year the better sectors are the south east (8) and center (9). The energy in the south east is associated with career growth and business success while that in the center (9) is associated with fame, position and happy events.</p>
              <p>You can improve your luck by using these sectors and by energizing the south east especially with an activator such as an indoor fountain or aquarium.</p>
              <p>The north-west is associated with promotion and growth (1) and it is good to make use of this sector.</p>
              <p>Looking for romance or need a boost with your education? Make use of the south (4) sector as the energy of romance and learning resides there this year. Place a plant in this sector.</p>
              <p>The south west is inhabited by the authority (6) star in 2009. This is a good sector for those holding high position that requires authority e.g. CEO, politician or military. Place earthen ware objects to enhance the sector.</p>
              <p>In addition to north which is a very bad sector in 2009, you should also take care of the other sectors that are inhabited with inauspicious energies. There are the east, west and north-east sectors. The robbery star (7) resides in the east. To diminish its effect, place a bucket of still water in the east.</p>
              <p>The argument star (3) resides in the north east sector. Place a lamp or many lamps in this area.</p>
              <p>The illness star (2) occupies the west. Since the west is associated with the youngest daughter, mouth and lungs, young girls with mouth and respiratory problems should take extra care. Place a metal Wu Lu (close lid) here to reduce the effect of this star. Those who are recuperating from an illness should also avoid this sector.</p>
