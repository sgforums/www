              <p>Then next thing you should know is <strong>å¤©å¹²</strong> or commonly known as <strong>Heavenly Stems.</strong> The origins of the heavenly stems is :</p>
              <p>The Shang people believed that there were ten suns, each of which appeared in order in a ten-day cycle (æ—¬; xún). The Heavenly Stems were the names of the ten suns, and were found in the <a title="Given name" href="/wiki/Given_name"><span style="color: #000000;">given names</span></a> of the kings of the Shang. Some historians think the ruling class of the Shang had ten clans, but it is not clear whether their society reflected the myth or vice versa. The associations with Yin-Yang and the Five Elements developed later, after the collapse of the Shang Dynasty.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The <strong>Earthly Branches</strong> (</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span lang="zh">åœ°æ”¯</span></span><span style="color: #000000;">) provide one </span><a title="China" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/China"><span style="color: #000000;">Chinese</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> system for reckoning </span><a title="Time" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Time"><span style="color: #000000;">time</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">This system was built from observations of the orbit of </span><a title="Jupiter" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Jupiter"><span style="color: #000000;">Jupiter</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. Chinese astronomers divided the celestial circle into 12 sections to follow the orbit of <span lang="zh">æ­³æ˜Ÿ</span> <em>SuìxÄ«ng</em> (Jupiter, the Year Star). Astronomers rounded the orbit of Suixing to 12 years (from 11.86). </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In correlative thinking, the twelve years of the Jupiter cycle also identify the twelve months of the year, twelve animals (</span><a title="Mnemonic" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Mnemonic"><span style="color: #000000;">mnemonics</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> for the system), directions, seasons, months, and </span><a class="mw-redirect" title="Chinese unit" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Chinese_unit#Measures_of_time"><span style="color: #000000;">Chinese hour</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> in the form of double-hours. When a Branch is used for a double hour, the listed periods are meant. When used for an exact time of a day, it is the center of the period. For instance, å�ˆ (the Horse) means noon or a period from 11am to 1pm. (The jie qi system provided single hours and 15-degree arcs in time and space.)</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Heavenly Stems and the Earthly Branch, together, they form the 60 years cycle calendar. </span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, the year 2000 was the 17th year of the sexagenary cycle, a gÄ“ng-chén year (åºšè¾°å¹´), a year of the Yang Metal Dragon. Therefore, 2006 is the 23rd year of the sexagenary cycle, called a bÇ�ng-xÅ« year (ä¸™æˆŒå¹´), a year of the Yang Fire Dog; 2007 a year of the Yin Fire Pig.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The naming of the months and days is not common now, although they are shown on Chinese calendars and almanacs.</span></p>

              <p> A little about the origins of fengshui. When early man were hunters, they lived on the tree top to keep out wild animals. However, trees could not keep out the wind, the rain and the seasonal weathers. So man began to search for alternatives such as caves. When man became "the gathers", they began to notice the seasonal and nature changes. So they had learnt to select their abode based on these.</p>
              <p>Probably the first historical record of fengshui started with the man called FuXi. He was the one who discovered the dragon horse marking. This formed the Early Heaven Trigram å…ˆå¤©å…«å�¦. During the Hsia dynasty, emperor Hsia Yu discovered the tortoise marking and this formed the Later Heaven Trigramã€€å�Žå¤©å…«å�¦.</p>
              <p>During the Shang dynasty, abode were selected base on the landform selection æ‹©åœ°. This was probably the begining of é˜´å®… (House for the Dead). During the Zhou dynasty, where the art of oracles æ˜“ç»�ã€€flourished, abode were selected based on oracles å�œå®….</p>
              <p>Subsequently, during the warring period, é˜´å®… (House for the Dead) began to decline as people started to move about to escape the war. It was during this period a very famous architect (Lu Panï¼‰é²�ç�­ was borned.ã€€During that time, houses were made from wood and he was said to be the father of carpentary and could make a house without even a single nail. Perhap he was also remembered to be the founder of the Lu Pan ruler é²�ç�­å°º</p>

              <p>During the Han dynasty, the method of selection was based on the surname that rhymes with the 5 elements. It was said that “<strong><span style="color: #cc0033;">å®…ç›¸</span>”ï¼Œä¸»è¦�æ˜¯ä»¥ä¸»äººçš„å§“ï¼Œçœ‹å§“çš„å�‘éŸ³ï¼Œç©¶ç«Ÿæ˜¯å±ž“å®«ã€�å•†ã€�è§’ã€�å¾µã€�ç¾½”äº”è¡Œ<span style="color: #cc0033;">äº”éŸ³</span>ä¸­çš„å“ªä¸€ä¸ªï¼Œç„¶å�Žæ�¥é…�å�ˆæ‰€å±…æˆ¿å®…æ�¥è®ºå…¶å�‰å‡¶ã€‚è¿™ç§�æ–¹æ³•æ˜¯ä»¥é˜´é˜³äº”è¡Œç”Ÿå…‹çš„è§‚å¿µè€Œè¡�ç”Ÿçš„.</strong></p>
              <p>During the Tang dynasty, there was an imperial scholar name <strong>æ�¨ç­ æ�¾</strong> (yang jun song) who got hold of the books <strong>å�§é¾™ç»�</strong> (hidden dragon book) from the western region from the imperial court. He took the books and went hiding into the Kun Lun Mountain to study. Finally with the skill, he came down from the mountain and went about helping the poor with his fengshui skill. He was also known as <strong>æ�¨æ•‘è´«</strong> (yang the helper of the poor)</p>
              <p>During the Ming dynasty, fengshui flourish once again. There are many fengshui stories related the Ming dynasty. It was said that the Ming emperor wanted to build a palace but to no success. Then one of the imperial astrolger had a dream about Lu Pan and his method. He used the method was could successfully complete the palace. The emperor was very happy and thus request the court to collate all the method of Lu Pan and named it <strong>é²�ç�­ç»�.</strong></p>
              <p>By the Qing dynasty, there were 2 school of thought during that time. It was known as the <strong>åˆ‘æ³• or Form School</strong> and the <strong>ç�†æ³• or the Reasoning/Calculation School</strong>. They were constantly quarrelling about their theory. The form school claimed that if the location is at the choice spot, it is enough but the reasoning/calculation school said that without the "Chi", even if the spot is good, it's not enough. For example, if the spot is located in a desert, without water, without greeneries, without roads, does the form school theory work? We only have to look at Las Vegas to verify. At a later stage, the form school and the reasoning/calculation theory combine to form the Ba Zhai(<strong>å…«å®…). </strong>It was known as the <strong>æ˜Žé•œå…«å®…ã€‚</strong></p>
              <p> Finally, in the æ˜Žå›½, (the last 70 years) another school known as the flying star school  çŽ„ç©ºé£žæ˜Ÿ was form. It was said that it includes the time factor as part of the fengshui. This school is presently the more popular choice.</p>
