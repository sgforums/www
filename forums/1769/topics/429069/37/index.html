              <p>I think the main issue is that these boys are never put to the test.</p>
              <p>Coming from a September 11 batch in NS was a wake up call for the SAF during that period as too many took peace for granted. RPS like me then and RPS inside my unit now are really miles apart.</p>
              <p>My Lao Jiaos who kena September 11 had the worst.</p>
              <p>Simply put, if there aren't any real situations, as long as those soldiers trained and put into the job without any form of life/death experience, they are just a bunch of whiny kids all the way till they ORD...</p>

              <p>You think leh?</p>
              <p>In the past, if you misbehaved in class, you would dread having the teacher call your home to complain to your parents.</p>
              <p>Now, if a student were to punch his teacher in class, his father would simply excuse it as being 'only 20% of full strength'.</p>
              <p>I've got half a mind to ask Manny Pacquaio to give that father a punch at 20% of his full strength.</p>
