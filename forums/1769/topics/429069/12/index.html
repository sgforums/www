              <p>Seriously e PAP govt's attitude has changed in recent years (real recent).</p>
              <p>I still remembered writing in 2008 over upgrading e MRT system w/ signalling system upgrade and more MRT trains procurement for the growing population.</p>
              <p>Back then it was a NO. Now today whenever I suggested abt things like why can't e govt look into bus - bus transfer system (because e MRT cannot accomodate to everyone's travelling needs during the peak hrs) or some bus service adjusment, feedback is really taken.</p>
              <p>It might not be done immediately but changes are in e works.</p>
              <p>As far as I know, they're upgrading those bus stops with higher volume of transferring passengers from bus A to bus B into bigger bus stops.</p>

              <p>I'll be frank here; I have no issue with attracting <strong>truly talented</strong> foreign students to get their higher education here. Like it or not, we do need talents to fill in the gaps where needed. If I have to face off with someone more talented than I am, then it's my job to work harder to make up for my lesser talent.</p>
              <p>What really pisses me off are foreign students who seem to be here just to make the numbers. Some of this riffraff cannot be called 'talents' by any stretch of imagination. And it seems that any Ahmad, Ah Lim or Muthusamy with a foreign passport instantly becomes a 'foreign talent'.</p>
              <p>Back when I was an undergrad, there was this so-called FT student from India who was attached to my project group.</p>
              <p>The bloody fool was a total skiver and did not perform his responsibilities to the group. Why? Because he was spending half the time doing <em>part-time modelling.</em> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>In the end, we all had enough, and we ganged up on him. We told him in no uncertain terms that our taxes were subsidising his education, and that we would kick his rear end both figuratively and literally if his skiving led to us having poor grades for that project.</p>
