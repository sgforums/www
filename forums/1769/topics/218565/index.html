It's so sad that they're tearing it down.<br><br>'I took some pictures so that I can remember it.<br><br>'We should try to conserve more of such old buildings instead of tearing it down.'<br><br>But the building was gone when we visited the site again on Tuesday.<br><br>When URA exhibited its Identity Plan in 2002, the Jalan Besar cluster was earmarked as a historically significant area with many unique buildings with history and architecture that should be conserved.<br><br>Called the Old World Charm, the aim of this plan was to evoke a sense of national identity and belonging among Singaporeans.<br><br>Unfortunately, before the study could be concluded, the building caught fire in January this year.<br><br>According to URA, the engineers' report submitted by the owner stated that the building was badly damaged and had become unsafe.<br><br>'In view of the damage to the building caused by the fire and for safety reasons, we reluctantly agreed to drop the building from its conservation study and approved the owner's application to demolish the building for future redevelopment,' said a URA spokesman.<br><br>For now, the redevelopment plan for that site is still uncertain.<br><br>According to a Building and Construction Authority permit pasted on the building, the site belongs to the estate of a Mr Lee Seng Choh, and was administered by a Mr Lee Cheng Kee.<br><br>We tried to contact the latter but a relative said he was out of the country.<br><br>GY Chow Consulting Engineers, which was supervising the demolition, said they were employed by the owner to tear down the building by the end of last month.<br><br>A member of the staff, who declined to be named, said: 'I don't think the owner has any plans to develop the place yet.'<br><br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,116751,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,116751,00.html?</a></div>
