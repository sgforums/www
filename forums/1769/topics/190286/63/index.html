Don't bluff me.  They said if wanna make money, go south.  Over here, it's only a relax life.  Wanna make big bucks, bu ke nen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   So, you folks are the ones making the money and then bringing it to Oh Canada to retire.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Huh?  Burn calories ah?  I don't know leh.  I not that fitness freak lah.  But I can check with my sister.  She is a certified trainer but then I've not exchange emails with her for a while now.  Let's see if she responds, okay?  How's that?<br><br>You on a fitness run?  Hubby bugs me that I should too, for health reasons.  So sad to hear my friend who went for colon cancer ops take a not so good turn.  I am praying for him.  Talking about it, I should call his wife.<br><br>Okay, bye for now.  Let me go make that call.</div></blockquote>I always thought Victoria's secret was that she was actually... a he! If this secret were revealed, it would make it easier for them to introduce a line of mens' undergarments, don't you think? Talk about a lost business opportunity!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Thanks for checking with your sister. Actually, I'm not on any fitness binge right now--I was just curious as our office recently relocated from the fourth to the sixth floor of the building, which means an additional two flight of stairs to climb. I make four ascents and descents a day, for a total climb of 20 floors, and was just curious as to the calorie burn of such an activity.<br><br>Here's hoping your friend with colon cancer gets better real soon; please keep us informed of his progress.</div>
