              <p>well, I'm not saying the ISD's wrong for doing so, but that's just the way things are. We cannot afford to indiscriminately throw the book at everyone that crosses the ODs.</p>
              <p>The kids were made example of as a warning to the young that they have to be responsible for their words even online. I mean, just look at some of the SC lunatics.</p>
              <p>But this chap, he has a following, and many of those "mega" churches are affliated with much more massive ones overseas in the americas. They can generate a lot of adverse attention on our country without any regards for our local geo-political context, or even the truth.</p>
              <p>I think the ISD did right for doing what they did, it's probably the best course of action in this case.</p>

              <p>born-agains of any religion can become very militant about their religions. I guess that's just how things are.</p>
              <p>But I'm very comfortable with the catholic church, you'll never get such things from there. During our RCIA classes the priests and brothers and nuns said it more than once, it doesn't matter what religion you are, if you're a buddhist, be a good buddhist, if you're a muslim, be a good muslim. No such things like if you are not with us you're going to hell. What's more important at the end of the day is to be a good man, the chap upstairs will judge you in his mercy. Cos we believe that the chap that was nailed to the cross, died and redeemed himself for all of mankind.</p>
              <p>But some of the more militant churches, thinks everyone who doesn't believe in him is going to hell. I've asked some of them like "what about your parents ? your other loved ones who don't share the same faith ? " ..... "too bad lor ..... "</p>

              <p>born-agains of any religion can become very militant about their
              religions. I guess that's just how things are.</p>
              <p>But I'm very comfortable with the catholic church, you'll never
              get such things from there. During our RCIA classes the priests and
              brothers and nuns said it more than once, it doesn't matter what
              religion you are, if you're a buddhist, be a good buddhist, if
              you're a muslim, be a good muslim. No such things like if you are
              not with us you're going to hell. What's more important at the end
              of the day is to be a good man, the chap upstairs will judge you in
              his mercy. Cos we believe that the chap that was nailed to the
              cross, died and redeemed himself for all of mankind.</p>
              <p>But some of the more militant churches, thinks everyone who
              doesn't believe in him is going to hell. I've asked some of them
              like "what about your parents ? your other loved ones who don't
              share the same faith ? " ..... "too bad lor ..... "</p>
              <p>-_-" .....</p>
