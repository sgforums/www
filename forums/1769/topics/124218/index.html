            <div class='col-md body'>So get this: in February, Sasha and I called SIA and asked what we have to do to transport Eddie, our cat, to Australia.  They said to just check him in as excess baggage.<br><br>Sasha called again this morning before her flight to make sure, and this time, she got bounced between 7 numbers,  and none of the people she talked to could agree if Eddie was excess baggage or manifested cargo.  Eventually we got fed up went down to the SIA office at Paragon, and as it turns out, it was cargo which had to be booked ONE MONTH in advance!<br><br>Anyway, the girl at Paragon was great, and fast-tracked it all; it was the scummy morons at cargo who took their own sweet time.  By the time they arranged it, the quarantine office (AQIS) in Melbourne was closed for the day.  The cargo dispatcher refused to send Eddie on tonight's flight because he hadn't received verbal confirmation from AQIS that someone was waiting to pick him up. All the bloody paperwork already stated that tomorrow morning was the arranged time, but they wouldnÂ’t care about that, would they?  Instead, the idiot gave me some cock-and-bull story that if nobody's there to receive Eddie, they'll put him down.  I explained to the dispatcher that Eddie's 4-day health certificate expires tomorrow, and if they put him on tomorrow night's flight, he'll arrive with an expired certificate, and they'll really put him down.<br><br>By this time, of course, Sasha had already checked him into cargo and paid SIA $150 for cargo charges.  I told the asshole that I'd already spoken to AQIS this afternoon and confirmed the pickup time, but the cock-gobbler insisted on his bureaucracy despite of all of the paperwork already presented.<br><br>Eventually, it turned out that if I left Eddie there, it would be a death sentence, so I told Sasha to take him back and get a refund.  Now I'll have to do the paperwork all over again, and it's going to cost me stacks, and on top of that I've got to push my flight from Thursday to Saturday.<br><br>When we got to the check-in counter, I made a point of making disparaging remarks loudly in front of the SIA counter at the airport.  The staff were alarmed, but from the look on my face they were at least smart enough to stay clear of me.<br><br>Sasha now sees why I'll never, and I mean NEVER, fly SIA - they suck!</div>

My sister's friend was killed in a car accident in LA, and his mother went to collect the body.<br><br>When she checked in for the return flight, they told her that the casket would have to go back on another flight because they had no space.  Can you believe the insensitivity?  Here she's flown halfway across the world to accompany her son back on his last trip, and they treated him like a shipment of lima beans.  The SOBs.<br><br>Eventually, someone at Northwest Airlines got wind of what was happening and offered to fly the mother and the casket back to Singapore on the same flight, FREE OF CHARGE.  SIA matched the offer in order to save face.  If I were the woman, I'd have taken the NW flight without a second thought.<br><br>SIA, world-class airline?
