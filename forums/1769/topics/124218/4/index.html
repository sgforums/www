My sister's friend was killed in a car accident in LA, and his mother went to collect the body.<br><br>When she checked in for the return flight, they told her that the casket would have to go back on another flight because they had no space.  Can you believe the insensitivity?  Here she's flown halfway across the world to accompany her son back on his last trip, and they treated him like a shipment of lima beans.  The SOBs.<br><br>Eventually, someone at Northwest Airlines got wind of what was happening and offered to fly the mother and the casket back to Singapore on the same flight, FREE OF CHARGE.  SIA matched the offer in order to save face.  If I were the woman, I'd have taken the NW flight without a second thought.<br><br>SIA, world-class airline?
