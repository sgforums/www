They said to just check him in as excess baggage.<br><br>Sasha called again this morning before her flight to make sure, and this time, she got bounced between 7 numbers,  and none of the people she talked to could agree if Eddie was excess baggage or manifested cargo.  Eventually we got fed up went down to the SIA office at Paragon, and as it turns out, it was cargo which had to be booked ONE MONTH in advance!<br><br>Anyway, the girl at Paragon was great, and fast-tracked it all; it was the scummy morons at cargo who took their own sweet time.  By the time they arranged it, the quarantine office (AQIS) in Melbourne was closed for the day.  The cargo dispatcher refused to send Eddie on tonight's flight because he hadn't received verbal confirmation from AQIS that someone was waiting to pick him up. All the bloody paperwork already stated that tomorrow morning was the arranged time, but they wouldnÂ’t care about that, would they?  Instead, the idiot gave me some cock-and-bull story that if nobody's there to receive Eddie, they'll put him down.  I explained to the dispatcher that Eddie's 4-day health certificate expires tomorrow, and if they put him on tomorrow night's flight, he'll arrive with an expired certificate, and they'll really put him down.<br><br>By this time, of course, Sasha had already checked him into cargo and paid SIA $150 for cargo charges.  I told the asshole that I'd already spoken to AQIS this afternoon and confirmed the pickup time, but the cock-gobbler insisted on his bureaucracy despite of all of the paperwork already presented.<br><br>Eventually, it turned out that if I left Eddie there, it would be a death sentence, so I told Sasha to take him back and get a refund.  Now I'll have to do the paperwork all over again, and it's going to cost me stacks, and on top of that I've got to push my flight from Thursday to Saturday.<br><br>When we got to the check-in counter, I made a point of making disparaging remarks loudly in front of the SIA counter at the airport.  The staff were alarmed, but from the look on my face they were at least smart enough to stay clear of me.<br><br>Sasha now sees why I'll never, and I mean NEVER, fly SIA - they suck!</div></blockquote>GED, I think you only have got yourself to blame for all that trouble that you have caused to your pet and all the staffs at SIA. Honestly if you choose not to fly with SIA, I have reason to believe that all the staff at SIA would be very happy.<br><br>Transporting a pet across to another country doesnt sound like an easy task to me. I think you should have taken the intiative to check with the airline instead of leaving everthing for Sasha to handle. (You are the MAN dude)<br><br>If you need to transport animal on a plane, I think you should reconfirm your flight details at least 48 hours before the flight, and not like 12 hours or something. And btw, dont call people working at SIA ass hole or morons just because of your own stupid mistake.<br><br>No matter what you want to say, I still think that SIA is the best airline in this world.<br><br></div>

From the money I save by flying with much better airlines, I can buy myself a you-beaut laptop and keep myself happy, thank you very much.<br><br>Make no mistake about it - SIA treat people like cattle to be loaded on their transports, especially if they're dead.  They didn't care if they got Eddie killed, and I'd be surprised if the fatalities from their last crash were regarded as anything more than non-paying fares.<br><br>SIA are suckass SHIT!</div></blockquote>Ged, I think the reason why you are getting shit from SIA, is because they are not interested in your business. I presume you are one of those typical Sg passenger who pay for a Y class ticket and want to be treated like a first class passenager.<br><br>I have flew with SIA for so many years, on economy, raffles and first class, and I have NEVER NEVER have any problem with them. For people of your status, maybe you need a private jet.<br><br></div>

When I took the Air France flight to Paris, I was barely aware that I've landed. I'm one of those sort of people who enjoy takeoffs and landings, be they smooth or rough, but in this instance, I couldn't even tell the transition of the load on the wings to the load on the wheels. Impressive.<br><br>To be fair though, I had one landing which was even more impressive by SIA i think. We landed in a pea soup fog at LAX, and we totally had no idea we'd landed because, although I was sitting next to the wing, the fog was dense enough that I couldn't see it, so we had no idea if we were on the ground or in the air. Yet the pilot put the plane down so delicately that for about 5 mins after we'd landed, most of us actually thought we were still flying.</div></blockquote>How bout trying on a concorde? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
