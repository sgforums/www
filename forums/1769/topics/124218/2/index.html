When I took the Air France flight to Paris, I was barely aware that I've landed. I'm one of those sort of people who enjoy takeoffs and landings, be they smooth or rough, but in this instance, I couldn't even tell the transition of the load on the wings to the load on the wheels. Impressive.<br><br>To be fair though, I had one landing which was even more impressive by SIA i think. We landed in a pea soup fog at LAX, and we totally had no idea we'd landed because, although I was sitting next to the wing, the fog was dense enough that I couldn't see it, so we had no idea if we were on the ground or in the air. Yet the pilot put the plane down so delicately that for about 5 mins after we'd landed, most of us actually thought we were still flying.</div></blockquote>I enjoyed takeoffs and landings too. I've only tried Air China (too young to recollect anything, around 11), British Airways and Thai Airways. BA was pretty ok, I enjoyed the flight. Thai Airways was a semi nightmare, when it was trying to land, I felt nauseous.</div>
