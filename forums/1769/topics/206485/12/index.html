            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, and one really really strange thing I encountered... a few weeks back, I woke up one morning, put on my contact lenses, and realised that, lo and behold!... I couldn't see well!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>So, I thought I had placed the L lenses in my R eye and vice versa, so I switched, but still, cannot see clearly!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>So, I re-switched again, thinking that maybe it's one of those flukes.  I still had blurred vision!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>OK, deep breaths, opened up a new pack of disposable contact lenses cause maybe the old one's really old liao!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   Biangz, the world still looks blur to me!  So I switched sides again thinking that maybe I got them wrong again although they were clearly labelled L and R.  Still can't see!<br><br>PANIC!!!!<br><br>Up till today, a few weeks later, I'm still stumbling around with blurred vision.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   I have to squint a lot and sometimes, squinting doesn't help either.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>One of my friends suggested that maybe, an incident at work that happened recently just shocked me so much, the stress affected my eyesight!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   She reasoned that if one can be shocked till one's head of hair turns white overnight, why can't the eyesight get afflicted?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Don't know if there's any medical truth to it or not but I'm going to ask the next friendly doctor I see.  Too bad the docs here are all busy and most of them aren't exactly approachable.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Weird, right?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

Glad that all's well with you and happy to see you back online!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>It is a cozy pad... to me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   It helps to keep the blues away and I usually spend a lot of time at home so it's a good investment to surround oneself with nice things.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   Moreover, the stuff were all bought on sale, including the TV!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   The sales here can be super-duper good, man, unlike in Singapore where the sales appear to be a 'token' rather than the real deal.<br><br>A shopaholic like me can be quite happy here in Melbourne, especially with my proximity to town!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Of course the range of stuff offered here isn't as wide as back home, but when it comes to grocery shopping and shopping for household items, Melbourne's good!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Bear's sis and I have been afflicted by the Supermart Syndrome - whenever we're stressed, or whenever we cho-bo, we like to go to our neighbourhood Cole's and spend time looking at the aisles and aisles of products on sale.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   Moreover, every week, there are specials on offer so my larder is very well-packed.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   I still plan my meals impromptu and I improvise often and because I cook for one, it can get quite challenging!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   For instance, if I get a bag of carrots at the Richmond Market on Saturday for just $1.50, for the next few meals, I have to somehow incorporate carrots!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  It was cute though - one Saturday, an Asian lady and me were looking at leeks - two bundle for $3, one for $1.80.  So she approached me to split a bundle and we both went home with a bundle each for just $1.50!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Economies of Scale at work on the micro level!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I'm into the 2nd week with bloody three more bwee-bwee carrots left!  I could've sworn they seemed to have increased in size since I last saw them!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  So, bo bian, I can't keep rabbits so I can't throw the carrots at them, so today, to entice myself, I used a special Butterfly Mould on my sliced carrots so I get Carrot Butterflies!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Oh see, you ask me about my life and I get so carried away!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   OK, OK, I zip up liao... for now!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>Hee hee........no lah, I really love reading so please continue to write.<br><br>Huh?  Are u sure or not?  The carrots can become bwee bwee one meh?  Eh, ever thought of cooking and then freezing them up?  I don't but my friends do, especially those who end work later and by the time they get home, it late to even start to cook from scratch.  But hey, butterfly carrots.  Sounds good to me.  Can show pic?<br><br>Yeap, we do that at the supermart too, like 3 bunch of spring onions for 99cents.  Like what am i gonna do with 3 bunch?  So, we split with other shoppers too.  Wah, looks like supermarkets are your playgrounds now too eh?  Well, that's about the only shopping I do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I'd love to try some of their food cause I've not tried it before, and to cook it myself would be a risk cause, what if I don't like it?<br><br>I'd love to try stuff like Artichoke, Fennel, etc at least once.  These are vegetables we never get to see in Singapore so I'm really curious.<br><br>Like, couscous and polenta, have always wanted to try those but I'm not about to enter the supermart and purchase one packet of those, nosiree!  Cause what if I don't like them?  It'll be such a waste.<br><br>Oh well, I'll get to know a few more colleagues better and then see if they're into some meal exchange kinda deal so we don't have to cook every freakin' time!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Rhonda,<br><br>fennel tastes like anseed almost liceqish (sp?)like... artichokes are very nice... you just eat the outside leaves (not the whole leaf, ya pull them apart with ya teeth) and the hearts are nice in salards (you can get jars of them brined etc at the supermarket once you find you like them)<br><br>polenta is also nice, with lots of butter and cheese. grilled or just runny with osso buco (see: http://www.newitalianrecipes.com/osso-buco.html)<br><br>have you tried stuffed vine leaves yet?? they are absoutely delicous!<br><br>as you've guessed rhonda the australian food is as we have lots of cultures in this country!!<br><br>Simsy</div>
