The salt really does a number on cars, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a vehicle on the road without some amount of visible corrosion on it. That's why many people here own two vehicles: a regular "non-winter" car, and a corroded "winter beater."   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

The "detergent" method works well when it rains, but in winter, it goes through the automated car wash. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>One thing I learned a long time ago: never, ever, send your car through a car wash on frigid winter days. Sure, the car wash facility and water are heated, but whatever water isn't blown off during the drying phase, <strong>freezes</strong> on your drive back. In other words, water in the keyholes, locks, and around the door frames freeze, meaning you can't open the doors until the water melts. I had this happen to me a long time ago, after I came back from washing the car on a particulary cold winter day. The doors were frozen shut and the windows wouldn't roll down, so I had to exit the vehicle by folding down the rear seatback, crawling into the trunk, and pushing the trunklid open (which, fortunately, wasn't frozen shut).</div>
