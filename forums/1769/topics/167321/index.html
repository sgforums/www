            <div class='col-md body'>kops, this is actually old news.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>It takes A LOT of nurses to keep a hospital running.  The better hospitals take care of patients AND their nurses by having a 'good' nurse : patient ratio so that patients get the care and attention they need for their holistic health, and nurses don't get burnt out and over-stretched.<br><br>I think the 'best' place, in terms of salary, benefits and remuneration, as well as professional development, is in the US.  That's where Nursing Research is well-established and new developments spew forth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In fact, in the US, you'll find that there's a high percentage of foreign nurses working there.  Africa had a huge outflow of nurses who left their country to work in the US, and the situation got so bad that they actually wrote to the US govt asking them to please stop taking in their nurses because there's a severe shortage back home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>The US had a kind of quota system and early this year, they announced that all nursing applicants who were born in China, The Philippines and India, would be backdated two years, meaning, nurses born from these countries who applied to work in the States later than 2002, would have to face an up to five year wait for their visas to be approved!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>This created a stir amongst the affected applicants, as well as amongst the nurses and hospitals in the US, because they are badly in need of foreign nurses to beef up their manpower.<br><br>Heard that the latest news is, they've lifted the restrictions somewhat and modified the rules.<br><br>Still, the rule means that a Malaysian / Singaporean nurse would find it much easier than the nurses born in those aforementioned countries to get their green card.  In fact, for nurses, her immediate family gets the green card easily too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The major obstacle would be to ensure that the NCLEX-RN, the nursing licencing exams in the US, is cleared.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  And boy, that's ONE killer-whale of a hurdle!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
