Mum has to store some stuff like a 3 seater sofa, queen size bed, 5ft x 1ft x 2 ft tv stand, some kitchen items, laundry pole, some fold up chairs, etc. She has to wait 2 years for her hdb rental. While she waits she has to rent a room, which explains the need for long term storage.</p></div>

              <p><br>Thanks so much bear! I just spoke with Mum and she's frustrated with the moving process. I wish the buyer had given me more than the 2K they did. Then I'd be able to fly back and help Mum sort things out. I'm going to ask my realtor what he thinks. Vk told me her buyer gave her 10K.</p>

              <p>It's about SGD 200.00 / mth for mine.  My storage space can store about 45-50 cartons and it's not completely full.  We get to lock the room with our own lock and the storage staff do not have access to our space.  We are also given a card so that we can access the secure facility 24/7. </p>
              <p>I'm hanging on to my storage space only cause I'm still in limbo - not quite sure yet whether I'll be here for good or not.  As long as I'm not quite sure that I'll retire and live in Australia, it doesn't make sense to ship my stuff over. </p>
              <p>However, in your case, if you are sure that you won't be returning to SG to reside here permanently, it's better to just give / sell away your stuff because paying for storage fees is like having your funds drained with an open tap.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif">  I try not to think about it because ... well ... I just try not to think about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>There are various sizes available.  They range from little cubes that allows you to store files and paperwork and books to semi-garage sizes where people store their entire furniture collection and what-not.</p>

              <p>I was quite surprised to learn that a lot of Singaporeans are making use of personal storage services.  The staff there revealed to me that as Singaporeans become more affluent and exposed to the culture and lifestyles overseas, they tend to acquire more possessions or desire a Zen-like simplicity in their own homes, but still want to keep certain things therefore they rent personal storage. </p>
              <p>Others are well-seasoned travellers who keep their winterwear and luggage and other bulky possessions there. </p>
              <p>Yet others are collectors who need storage away from their home so they can continue to keep their precious collections and yet live in clutter-free homes.</p>

              <p>It's about SGD 200.00 / mth for mine.  My storage space can store about 45-50 cartons and it's not completely full.  We get to lock the room with our own lock and the storage staff do not have access to our space.  We are also given a card so that we can access the secure facility 24/7. </p>
              <p>I'm hanging on to my storage space only cause I'm still in limbo - not quite sure yet whether I'll be here for good or not.  As long as I'm not quite sure that I'll retire and live in Australia, it doesn't make sense to ship my stuff over. </p>
              <p>However, in your case, if you are sure that you won't be returning to SG to reside here permanently, it's better to just give / sell away your stuff because paying for storage fees is like having your funds drained with an open tap.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif">  I try not to think about it because ... well ...

              <p>Sadly, I came to that conclusion a couple of weeks ago. A friend has graciously agreed to buy the two pieces of furniture I have. My mother is on the wait list for hdb housing. Since it's an 18 month wait, she will have to store her stuff somewhere since she'll be renting a room in the interim. Since my furniture has been sold, it's Mum's stuff that needs storing. My sister and I have asked her many times to move in with either one of us here but she enjoys her life in Sg and is fearful of losing her sense of self and independence should she move here. Our argument is that she's in her 70s and working to survive in Sg. It pains us to see her like that. My sis and I are hoping that she will come to her own conclusion to move here. Just in case, her green card is getting processed as we speak. Don't ask about other members of the family still in Sg, they don't have the room to store her stuff.</p>

              <p>me was gossiping with my sister since we are both sick with flu at home.</p>
              <p>my mother made a mess of things, and there is no way my sister want to sponsor her to live in USA.</p>
              <p>Also, her secret marriage and then divorce again thingy shook us siblings so much.  That we gave up trying to work things out for her.  If she needs, she will do so herself.</p>
              <p>my sis wasnt happy that I gave $$$ to Mom, but I guess I did it because she is mom.  Though we all are hopping to stay far far away from her.....I cant leave her destitute and what i've done is Done.</p>
              <p>Next for me, should I go back to sg to work? I kinda spent way too much money and need to refuel before I could buy another HDB flat later in Sept 09.</p>
              <p>Or should I just stay in thailand, spend less and go back to sg destitue?</p>
              <p>Answer is quite obvious.  But I dont want to be detained emotionally by my mother back in sg.</p>
