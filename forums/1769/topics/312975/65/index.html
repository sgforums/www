              <p>which is silly, overseas the chopper pilots are looked upon and those in the fighter jets are ball-less pricks dropping bombs safely high above.</p>

              <p>yea, but since their training school in aussie, the elites are the fighters paywise also, followed by the choppers then the transport pilots... but the ironic thing is that the transport pilot has the best chance of converting to a civilian pilot.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>everybody still outside playing ah ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>witnessed a punk fight just now outside gluttony bay ... across the road at marina square there's a huge group of young punks hanging out ... suddenly there was this huge group of malay boys chasing after one malay boy down ... he fell just before the road and about 20 of them were kicking and stomping the shit out of the fellow .....</p>
              <p>across the roads at the esplanade an elderly ang moh couple and a few other touristy types had their cameras out taping the thing ...</p>
              <p>watch out for it on youtube .....</p>
              <p>there was a esplanade security guard near the bus stop ... several people went up to him, including me, to ask him to call the police or do something about it .... he replied nonchalantly that what happens across the road was none of his business ... and proceeded to make himself invisible .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I dunno ... the eldery tourist couple was in shock I think .... they keep looking there long after it was over and muttering and shaking their heads ...</p>
              <p>well ... someone called the police in the end I think, but it took forever for the police to get there, and we left before they arrived ... if at all .... </p>
              <p>maybe they were too busy chasing mas selamat and SDP members to bother about a few punks hammering one of their own in public .... and no, I'm not sure it was rioting ... rioting implies a two way fight ? ... it was a huge crowd of teens kicking one hapless guy on the ground .... a few of them were clearing enjoying it ... laughing and shouting and jumping around after they got their licks in ......</p>
