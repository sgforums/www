ItÂ’s much more worthwhile to invest in a dream than to build hopes on people because all betray, cheat then leave you to rot in eternal hell at some point. YouÂ’ll be brought so high, then, dropped like a potato. Disappointment is 100% guaranteed if you ever built your dreams in people. Why even bother believing in something that clearly doesnÂ’t exist anyway. The media will trick you. You will be tempted to fall for fictitious stories from the very same people whoÂ’ve never had love, but chose to continually believe in it just because they desperately needed something to believe in. the best way to live shall be to be totally aloof and detached. ItÂ’s peopleÂ’s core negativity that makes them think that itÂ’s impossible to do that. IÂ’ve seen enough and I honestly think thatÂ’s the best way to live. DonÂ’t mix emotions with body.

Why even bother believing in something that clearly doesnÂ’t exist anyway. The media will trick you. You will be tempted to fall for fictitious stories from the very same people whoÂ’ve never had love, but chose to continually believe in it just because they desperately needed something to believe in. the best way to live shall be to be totally aloof and detached. ItÂ’s peopleÂ’s core negativity that makes them think that itÂ’s impossible to do that. IÂ’ve seen enough and I honestly think thatÂ’s the best way to live. DonÂ’t mix emotions with body. Better still; leave emotions out of the way totally.</div></blockquote>..... Look beyond the outer limit of ugliness, you will find the wings of beauty.
