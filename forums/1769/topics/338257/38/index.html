              my skin is breaking out in blood spots where I scratched.  Now the arm is starting too.
              
              I went to Disney Lands California Advanture park today.  Was unexpectedly gone for a Hotel Hollywood Ride.  Didnt know its will be that scary.  Thought its just a ghost house.
              
              We were strapped into seats, the seats raised 10 over storeys high, drop us and lift us again. all in the dark.
              
              afterthat, I did the Malibu Bomber, same thing, seat us, raise up real fast and drop us real fast.  My knuckles was so white and I couldnt remove my hands from the handle bar.  I forgot to scream though. Its only me screaming: Og My god, oh my god!
              
              Then I did shopping.  I didnt buy the donald duck dressed in Darth Maul clothes, not the Muppets figurines wearing star wars costumes.  I wanted to, but the family beckons.  I only got away with some teqila glass &amp; a waterbottle.

              <p>my skin is breaking out in blood spots where I scratched. Now the arm is starting too.</p>
              <p>I went to Disney Lands California Advanture park today. Was unexpectedly gone for a Hotel Hollywood Ride. Didnt know its will be that scary. Thought its just a ghost house.</p>
              <p>We were strapped into seats, the seats raised 10 over storeys high, drop us and lift us again. all in the dark.</p>
              <p>afterthat, I did the Malibu Bomber, same thing, seat us, raise up real fast and drop us real fast. My knuckles was so white and I couldnt remove my hands from the handle bar. I forgot to scream though. Its only me screaming: Og My god, oh my god!</p>
              <p>Then I did shopping. I didnt buy the donald duck dressed in Darth Maul clothes, not the Muppets figurines wearing star wars costumes. I wanted to, but the family beckons. I only got away with some teqila glass &amp; a waterbottle.</p>
