I thought you said you'd be busy until after Christmas??<br><br>It was <span style="font-style: italic;">blardy</span> cold earlier this week--if I recall, last Saturday night, we got down to near -10ÂºF. Now the weathermen are talking about temperatures pushing 40ÂºF this weekend. Is the weather similarly crazy up in TO?<br><br>Yah, I was here back in the early 90s. Can't recall how cold it was, but I do remember the infamous 'Halloween Snowstorm of 1991', during which we got over 36" of snow in a 48-hour period. That was the morning I woke up and couldn't open the patio door because the wind-driven snow had drifted up against and completely covered the door.<br><br>Aiyah, just take a pic of your Mazda, blur the license plate out, and post the image here. You mentioned it before, but I can't remember the colour of your Mazda. Is it light grey?<br><br>Nah, no special Christmas plans. I'll probably end up getting invited to a good friend's house for Christmas dinner, as has been the case for the last 10 Christmases.<br><br>Do you know if the department stores have any after-X'mas sales?<br><br>My plan is still to travel to SG sometime in the first half of next year. It would be a hoot if we could meet up there, together with some of the other regulars in this forum! Pity Rhonda won't be around then, though, as she'll probably be pursuing her dream in Australia by that time...<br><br></div>
