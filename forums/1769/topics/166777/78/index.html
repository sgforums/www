I like that - the characters aren't one-dimensional.<br><br>I liked the Chief Maid, On-Sin, until she seduced the Emperor and started to join in the foray too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><img src="http://www.spcnet.tv/tvb2004/warandbeauty/war_maggie.jpg"><br><br>Do you think Yuk-Fei is the prettiest?  She seems to know that too and certainly used that to her full advantage!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://www.spcnet.tv/tvb2004/warandbeauty/war_gigi.jpg"><br><br>And who can leave out Yee-Shun?  Being made use of by the Eunuch Tsun all along.<br><br><img src="http://www.spcnet.tv/tvb2004/warandbeauty/war_char.jpg"><br><br>I think the most tragic character in the end, is Yue Fei.  Her last words... ''Here has been my home for so many years - and also my tomb in the future!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>The silhouette of her standing alone, glancing at the palace grounds is soooo... tragic!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Haiz... wish littlestream was here!  She'd love to discuss this cause she watched this TWICE!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>I still have the VCDs!! My mum especially packed it for me to bring back. I would sit in the office... going.. c'mon c'mon i wanna go home to watch vcd! HAHAH<br><br>Yuk Fei... i didn't like her.. dunno why. Even when she was at the worst moment and left in quarantine i didn't feel sorry for her. But in the end she was the "happiest" she got to die with the one she loved.<br><br>I liked Yu Fei the power concubine cos she had real attitude and was probably the most misunderstood of them. And she was so alone and afraid of being alone. Poor thing, her daughter died as well and she wanted a son so badly. And her son was killed by Empress! I loved her showdown with the Empress at the end.<br><br>At first I thought he Empress was a good person. ahahahahh MAN!!!<br><br>Yeap.. Yee Shun's sister, who murdered the other sister so that she could get selected?!?! WHAT THE! I was like... die u dieeeee....<br><br>On-Sin.. so stupid right, her friend told her about her grandmother because he was afraid that she would leave the Palace. Aiyohhhhhhhhhhhhhh i was like.. noooooooo don'ttttt... So funny the way she seduced the emperor. She had to steal the scent bag.<br></div>
