              <p>Let's just say this....</p>
              <p>A few years ago, a girl confessed that she liked me. And she was one stone-cold stunner of a minah.... how could she fall for a dork like me?</p>
              <p>The thing is, I had to (politely) turn her down, because:</p>
              <p>1. I wasn't interested in her, at least not more than a friend.</p>
              <p>2. She had just broken off a difficult and abusive relationship with a serial cheater and perpetual DB inmate (for going AWOL repeatedly). I certainly doubted her ability to have another relationship so soon (within <em>days</em> of the breakup!)</p>
              <p>She took it well at first, and accepted my point that we could remain as friends. Then she abruptly cut off all contact from me.</p>
              <p>Did I hurt her heart? Probably. But if I had pursued the relationship, dollars to donuts say that the repercussions would have been much worse.</p>
