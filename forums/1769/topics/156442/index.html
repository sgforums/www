The salesgirl was trying very hard to sell me a pair of diamond earrings, which cost almost three times the cost of the pair of zircon earrings which I had chosen.<br><br>She exclaimed, "Look at how lovely the shine of the diamond is!"<br><br>I looked at my friend, my friend looked at me... we couldn't tell the difference.  OK, so it sparkled.  So did the zircon!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>So, she placed the pair of diamond earring beside the zircon earrings.  Aaaahhh... yup, the diamond ones sparkled more brilliantly.  But you could only tell when you place the diamond and the zircon ones together.  Apart, you really wouldn't be able to tell the difference.<br><br>So, I smiled and said, "I don't see the necessity for getting a pair of diamond earrings."<br><br>As a last-ditch attempt, she said, "All women love diamonds!
