              <p>Yesterday was the long-awaited for Singapore Day 2008 here in Melbourne!  It's the second Singapore Day, with the first one held in NYC's Central Park last year. </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/Longlongwalk.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>It was very exciting to see so many Singaporeans gathering at Flinders Station to make the walk to the venue.  I had at least five different groups of friends who were heading there but I got impatient with the excitement when I arrived at Flinders Station and decided to make my own way there first, ahead of everyone else in my groups.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Psst... can you guys spot the loooooong queue already forming up ahead in the background of the photo?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The day before, it was cloudy and rainy and we were a tad apprehensive about the weather, but according to one of the MC's at the event, they not only brought Singapore Day to us, they also brought the lovely Singapore sun along.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  It was really lovely... it was sunny, but cool like an air-conditioned room at the same time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/Longlongqueuespotted.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Wah biangz... not one, but TWO very very long queues!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  I later overhead from a Singapore Day volunteer that 11,000 people had registered to attend the event online and 12,000 were expected!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/Standinginline.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Biangz... I arrived there 15 mins early and yet, was already so far behind in the queue!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif">   This is how the queue looked like 10 mins after the event started. </p>
              <p>FINALLY, I reached the entrance for a quick security check by the security guards.  Then, after submitting my e-ticket, I was promptly tagged and stamped.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>On to the show!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>The event was held in the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, right in the city.  It was awesome to view the city skyline from the gardens!</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008010.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>It was an interesting terrain with lots of slopes to climb.  Good for working off the carbohydrates from the FREE food!  Yes... FREE food!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>The super kiasu damn early birds were already having their little picnic, having taken their food way before the queues formed. </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008012.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>I thought it was an Aussie thing to just sit / lie smack on the grass with nary a care in the world but apparently, lots of Singaporeans adapt and adopt the lifestyle, including moi.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  It was very thoughtful of the Singapore organisers to include a picnic mat in the FREE goodie bag too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Getting really excited now, I joined my first queue for the day - Bak Chor Mee! </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008013.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Long, long queue!  You have to queue for EVERY different dish you wanted!  Sian, man!  No one could have tried ALL the stalls because of the bloody queuing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>FINALLY, me and my bak chor mee!</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008022.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the Mee Pok at Singapore Chom Chom tastes way better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I was offered the Bak Kut Teh as well but I didn't like the look (and smell) of it - the black peppercorn smell was too overpowering, plus the stall was manned by ang moh's and non-Chinese and I didn't think it would be authentic so, not interested.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008020.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Breytonhartge and friends and also, Bear's sis and friend were two of the groups of people I knew were attending the event but, sitting down on the grass to eat my Bak Chor Mee was more important then...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>After finishing the Bak Chor Mee, what to do next, ah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Darnit... should have quickly gone to join the queue for Satay (because that finished quickly and the queue soon became incredibly loooooong) and Chicken Wings but I was a tad amused at how long the Nasi Lemak queue was...</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008040.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>But ah, this queue is nothing compared to the queue for Satay, Char Kway Teow, Hokkien Mee and Chicken Wings!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>

              <p>The shortest queue in that segment was for Kaya Toast.  Haiz... Glory Kaya is so easily available here, so I guess no one really missed it. </p>
              <p>Quite kewl of the organisers to think of using Singapore Street names...</p>

              <p>For one day nia, a walk from Fort Canning to Newton Circus only took half a minute!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And waaaaah... sooooo good to be 'in' Bouna Vista again, my lao jia!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Aaaah harharhar... even the SAF had a booth cum a mobile kitchen stand in Singapore Day!  The MC's said, "Just in case you guys miss home too much!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008026.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Tastings of army food was distributed. I saved my appetite for the more substantial stuff.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>Gave up on Nasi Lemak because of the crazy queue... saw these instead...</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008025.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Spaghetti?  Gotta be kidding... one can get the best in Lygon St!  Therefore, I went for the claypot rice. </p>
              <p>The display looked nice...</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008031.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>But of course pian lang one.  What you got was more like soya sauce rice with two side dishes.  All the portions were teeny portions nia, because free one what... what do you expect?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>One last wistful glance at the Nasi Lemak ...</p>

              <p>Look!  The Eureka Towers standing tall in the background!  It's Melbourne's tallest residential complex.  If you squint, you can see the protruding little 'cube' at the top floors where the skydeck is.  It's all in glass and you can pay to go stand in that 'cube' where the floor is ALSO glass! </p>

              <p>The concert had not begun, so on to take a look at Singapore's model classroom, obviously an effort to try to woo overseas Singaporeans back home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008044.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The crowd is getting larger by the minute!</p>

              <p>Ah ha!!  PCK!  He got all of us laughing with his antics!  What was really interesting was there was an Indian Singaporean who dressed her son to look like Phua Chu Kang!  That little boy got called onto the stage during a 'volunteer' segment. </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008050.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>And then a kinda weird, or rather, 'new age-y' kinda performance by the ... what do you call them... the drama and artistic productions arm of the SAF?</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/SweetheartD/Singapore%20Day%202008/SingaporeDay2008051.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The stage backdrop actually looks pretty lovely.</p>

              <p>One of the first Singapore Idol contestants, Daphne Khoo, performed two songs.  She's apparently studying in the RMIT now. </p>
              <p>Suddenly, a crowd gathered... orh... got VIP arrival!  Can you spot the VIP?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>My second favourite performance of the day, after PCK, of course - the Acapella group, Vocalicious!</p>

              <p>And look at how everyone is enjoying themselves, just sprawled out wherever, whenever, doing whatever!</p>

              <p>Do you think they can woo us back to return to Singapore for good?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I don't think I can ever give up the carefree, leisure-packed lifestyle in return for the stressful ratrace back home, man! </p>
              <p>You can tell we are Singaporeans from how we prioritise our food!  Standing up / sitting down / lying down, alone or with friends and family, food comes first!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>And all too soon, it all ended.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png">  I only got to meet two groups of friends and missed meeting up with the other three groups.  I guess we were all too busy doing the most important thing of all - queuing up for food!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I had a fantastic day, but am pissed at one thing - I didn't realise the Singapore Day T-shirts were given FREE and thought I'd go buy them after the concert, but by then, gone!!!  They were all gone!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>I'm really grateful to the organisers and the volunteers who helped to make this event possible.  So much thanks to the hawkers who slogged non-stop for us and to the performers too, for making us laugh and for giving us a feel-good, nostalgic feeling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  I wonder where they will hold Singapore Day 2009, but hope that sooner rather than later, Singapore Day will return to Melbourne again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>You've got to get over your apprehension of public transport and slowly learn how to get around Victoria via public transport.  It took me a while to get the hang of it, so no worries, eventually, you'll get there!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>I did have five groups of friends, at least, who attended the event, but I only met up with two groups.  I was by myself most of the time and yes, a large part of time was spent queuing up for food.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  A bit sian... didn't get to eat Mee Siam, Mee Soto, Chilli Crab and Satay.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>I wonder how come no Rojak, Chee Cheong Fun, Soon Kueh, Bee Hoon and Ngor Hiang.  But oh well, free one, cannot hiam!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>

              <p>Interesting, isn't it?</p>
              <p>I recall that when I first arrived, I thought Honeymousey lived like very, very, very far away, like off the face of earth, almost!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Now, it's like, chey, not THAT far what!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Besides, on the occasions when friends and I drove up to the countryside areas, the drive was really enjoyable.  We got to see amusing road signs on the way, look at cows and horses grazing, look at pastures, look at trees, sheep, flowers... all very lovely!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Sigh... all my friends are bugging me to go get my driving licence soon...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
