I dun condone indiscriminate infanticde but rather abortions neccessary to avert future problems n anguish. The child born with down syndrome may not be aware of his condition but imagine the discrimination he unknowingly gets.. note the sadness n various difficulties the parents have to go thru to raise him. In life there is no such thing as black n white.. good n evil. There r many grey areas. Abortion isnt right but neither is it completely wrong.</div>

But its more often the in-laws who start compaining and comparing you to the sow of a sister-in-law who kept having babies after babies (like a pig) and the nosy relatives who don't know how to shut up and start gossips/rumours/comparisons. The eventuality is that if the marriage breaks up, perhaps due to in-law intervention (introducing a fertile woman to the son so as to bear offsprings) or whatever incompatibility reasons, the infertile person (especially if its a woman) will bear the brunt of all the nasty remarks and snide looks that she's barren and thus nobody wants a barren woman and her infertility cause her marriage to break down and the husband to seek other women and is so justified.<br><br>social conditioning.<br></div>
