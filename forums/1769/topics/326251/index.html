              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear friends and clients, </span><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">             </span></span><em><span style="color: fuchsia;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></em><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">I would like to discourage all from choosing Arnoma <span id="lw_1217822355_1" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Hotel in Bangkok</span> as your choice of accommodation when you visit Bangkok.I had an extremely bad experience a few days ago. <br>              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em><span style="color: fuchsia;"> </span></em> </span><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">The housekeeping entered my room after me and my family went out for lunch and shopping around 1.30pm (9th June).We only returned around 1030pm. My husband discovered that some cash was missing.We informed the Duty Manager and requested to see the CCTV footage. The DM said he could only oblige if we can produce a police report. So, we went to the <span id="lw_1217822355_2" class="yshortcuts">police station</span> to lodge a report.When we returned from the police station, we demanded to see the CCTV and the log of the key card to our room. The log showed that the housekeeping entered my room at 1.41pm even though the 'DO NOT DISTURB'sign was hung on the door knob. It also showed that the floor manager, the DM and the housekeeping had tried to enter our room 13 times on 10th June, while we were out in the afternoon!!!( Hey, we are paying for security and privacy and these people from the hotel actually entered your room without your presence and permission??? )Next we demanded to see the CCTV but the DM and the security officer on duty said that the GM took the remote control for the CCTV with him??? He could only show us the footage the next morning when the GM reports for work. We relented and waited till the next day. <br>              </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em><span style="color: fuchsia;"> </span></em> </span><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next morning......We saw the footage on the CCTV. It was clearly stated that we left the room at 1.....30pm. After that, the timing on the footage actually skipped to 1.44pm!!!Nothing was recorded between the time after we left the room(1..30pm) to the time that showed the housekeeper entering my room(1.41pm). The footage bewteen this time has been deleted!! We pressed for an explanation and loads of lies were given by the DM, security officer and <span id="lw_1217822355_3" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">chief security officer</span>. 1) DM told us the the CCTV was on motion sensor, so could not capture anything as there was no one along the corridor during that period of time (1.30pm to 1.41pm). 2) Chief security officer said the CCTV was faulty during 1..30pm to 1.41pm.3) Security officer said he saw the footage and was certain no one entered our room. So, who shall I believe?</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">             </span></span><em><span style="color: fuchsia;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></em><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">ANYWAY, they insisted that no one entered our room but could not explain the missing footage and the log report. What crap is this??</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">              We wanted to see the GM and was told that he was not around, in an urgent meeting , in the toilet....etc etc... No apologies, no solutions and no compensation was offered by the hotel as well. We had to go to the police station 4 times before we could leave the hotel safely (the chief security officer threatened us earlier on) as we refused to pay the room charges unless a satisfactory explanation was given. <br>           </span></span><em><span style="color: fuchsia;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></em><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">  I believe the hotel staff, from the housekeeping to the DM were in cahoots. If not, why did they tamper with the security tape just to protect the housekeeper who stole from my room?? I just want my stolen money back and an apology and the hotel staff have to go such great length to cover up for the housekeeper. When things like this happen, the story-telling competition starts. Each has their own incredible story and boy, they can really lie, even in front of the police!! The GM is even worse...... He must be a disciple of <span id="lw_1217822355_4" class="yshortcuts">David Copperfield</span> or <span id="lw_1217822355_5" class="yshortcuts">Pink Panther</span>. No sight of him from 9th june to 11th June.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">         </span></span><em><span style="color: fuchsia;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></em><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">    I have seen the ugliest side of these people from Arnoma Hotel, Bangkok. Can you imagine how many times these people enter your room and rummaged through your luggage while you were out? And how much these people have stolen from us? Why must we give this hotel business when they cannot even protect our property and our interests? <br>            </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em><span style="color: fuchsia;"> </span></em> <br></span><span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Thanks for reading and this is a true story.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> <em><span style="color: fuchsia;"> </span></em> <br></span>

              <p>In
              fact, only 59 per cent of them have both a Singaporean mother and a
              Singaporean father. But if births where at one parent is a foreigner
              were included, then the figure goes up to 82 per cent.</p>
              <p>Perhaps
              what is of great significance is that records of Immigration and
              Checkpoints Authority (ICA) show that Singapore men fathered 75 per
              cent of all babies born here, while Singapore women account for just 65
              per cent.</p>
              <p>Climbing the career ladder is one reason sociologists
              give for the low fertility rate among Singapore women, particularly
              among those with degrees.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Angelique Chan,
              assistant head of Department of Sociology at the National University of
              Singapore, said: "A woman puts a lot of effort, time, overtime, into
              her work in her early 20s, mid—late 20s, then she gets to be about 30
              years old and then she is thinking about marriage but it’s hard for her
              to find someone (at that age). The older you get, the more entrenched

              <p>If Singapore men are fathering more babies than Singapore women are giving birth to, then who is delivering the goods?</p>
              <p>6,071
              babies were born to Singapore fathers whose wives are Malaysians,
              Indonesians, Chinese nationals, or are from other countries in the
              region.</p>
              <p>Some women from further afield have also been increasing Singapore’s birth rate.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s
              Total Fertility Rate — which measures the average number of children a
              woman will have in her lifetime — currently stands at 1.29.</p>
              <p>Among the Malay and Indian communities, their birth rates have fallen steadily from year 2000 to 2006.</p>
              <p>While the birth rate among the Chinese community has crept up very slightly, it still remains the lowest of all the three races.</p>
