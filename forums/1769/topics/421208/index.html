              <p>There are so many of us animal lovers in Club 30.  Thought it would be interesting to share funny anecdotes with each other here.</p>
              <p>I'll start the ball rolling by talking about my cat, Shona.  I unofficially adopted this tuxedo stray cat off the streets.  It used to seek warmth by lying on a neighbour's doormat and would run away each time it saw me coming home after a late shift.  I started to feed it, gradually gained its trust, eventually persuaded it to come indoors to be fed, and now, 1 yr and 1 mth later, it is a collared cat with its own feeding bowl and cat bed.  It's still a part-time pet cause it loves to gallivant outdoors in the 'hood and only comes for dinner and occasionally, for b'fast and lunch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So... this is what my cat has taught me -</p>
              <p>For trusting me enough to let me stroke its underbelly - I am trustworthy.</p>
              <p>For liking to snooze on my lap and getting angry when I fidget just a wee bit so I can't move once Her Royal Highness lies on my lap - I am disciplined.</p>
              <p>For giving me a dirty look when I turn on the noisy cooler when it gets hot, so I can't use it at all cause it disturbs Her Royal Highness - I can conquer all physical discomfort and suffering.</p>
              <p>For looking at the offerings in the food bowl distatefully and giving me a snotty look - I can do better.</p>
              <p>For running away when I approach her sometimes, and then running after me when I turn and walk away - I will not get what I want all of the time.</p>
              <p>For being able to distinguish her different meows to know what she wants - I am a good communicator.</p>
              <p>For pausing at the doorway, surveying my apartment and then turning her head to give me a haughty look full of rebuke - I need to tidy up my messy apartment. </p>
              <p>For coming up to me and me only, refusing everyone else in the block - I am 'special'.</p>
              <p>And lastly, for following me out on the streets and escorting me a fair bit (for a cat) - I am loved and will be missed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Really?!  That name has a meaning?  I just thought it sounded pretty.  I actually call her NinjaCat sometimes because she's quite territorial towards the other neighbourhood cats and often starts cat fights.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>My fishies are mostly shy and reserved except for one Lemon Tetra that loves to prevent other fishes and shrimps from coming anywhere near the food.  Thing is, it's not a bottom feeder and the algae pellets are meant for the shrimps and the sucker fishes anyways.  It's quite the bully.</p>

              <p>ShroCat!  Yup, she's not only tuxedoed, she has white 'socks' on all four paws.  She's very fussy, moody, and territorial.  So to gain her trust is no small feat!</p>
              <p>Anyways, Her Royal Highness came into my house this morning, and crashed in her bed for almost 12 hours!  I couldn't head out at all because I couldn't bear to chase her out of the house when she's sound asleep so I ended up staying in the whole day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Sometimes, you really wonder who's the master and who's the slave.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>I felt really awful yesterday when the sky turned dark and threatened to rain and when I opened the door to head out for an appt, she turned up and meowed pitifully, wanting food and shelter and I had to close the door on her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif">  She then followed me out onto the streets where the stupid neighbour's dog got loose and chased her down the street.  I was stunned and feared for her safety but she very deftly climbed up onto the roof of a house, escaping the stupid dog.  I really hate the neighbour's ill-disciplined dog.</p>

              <p><strong>Lion Head gold fish: </strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>They are so peaceful and cute... fat and swimming slowly all the time... </li>
              <li>They give a kind of quiet peace, joy, happiness to anyone looking at them. </li>
              <li>But when you get near them, they are always excited to see you. Its especially nice to see them after a hard day... as they always make me feel I am wanted no matter what </li>
              <li>When you put your finger on the tank, they try to nibble it but cannot. So when you move your fingers on the tank.. they will follow. So we managed to get them to do loops. </li>
              <li>Until one day they did loops when they see us ...and we reward them with food. So cute</li>
              <li>There was one tiny gold fish who always get himself stuck in small spaces. I guess he's bullied but he is tiny so he gets things rough ....  </li>

              <p>ShroCat!  Yup, she's not only tuxedoed, she has white
              'socks' on all four paws.  She's very fussy, moody, and
              territorial.  So to gain her trust is no small feat!</p>
              <p>Anyways, Her Royal Highness came into my house this morning, and
              crashed in her bed for almost 12 hours!  I couldn't head out
              at all because I couldn't bear to chase her out of the house when
              she's sound asleep so I ended up staying in the whole day. 
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Sometimes, you really wonder who's the
              master and who's the slave.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>I felt really awful yesterday when the sky turned dark and
              threatened to rain and when I opened the door to head out for an
              appt, she turned up and meowed pitifully, wanting food and shelter
              and I had to close the door on her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif">  She then followed me out onto the streets
              where the stupid neighbour's dog got loose and chased her down the
              street.  I was stunned and feared for her safety but she very
              deftly climbed up onto the roof of a house, escaping the stupid
              dog.  I really hate the neighbour's ill-disciplined dog.</p>

              <p>Yeah if anything, I think my cat taught me that love without expectations exists - from me to her that is.</p>
              <p>It's like you said, if the cat is resting her head on your body, you rather suffer body cramps than move to wake her up. Reminds me of the story of Prophet Muhammad and his cat, Muezza, and how he cut off the sleeves of his robe so the little cat can continue sleeping!!!!</p>
              <p>I think for people who are owned by cats.. hahaha we love them just by being given a chance to share their sheer personality, their grace and agility, their artless beauty and yet, stealthy little ways of getting what they want - you can't help but marvel at how much beauty is encompassed in that tiny little body.</p>
