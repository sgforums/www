It's nice here too, but no place for children to grow up in. We are deprived here, and some people are so eager to embrace American culture. Hello, American culture isn't quite the best the emulate.<br><br>Anyways, I think I may have found out where I hope to immigrate to (don't know if it's possible to). I will need to find out more. I want a place where I get to experience four distinch seasons, and enjoy winter sports, good laws for workers' rights, uncrowded dinners... I want all of that.<br><br>Ok, GCT would have labelled me a quitter, but I don't care. </div></blockquote>go canada...</div>
