            <div class='col-md body'>a sample from that hilarious blog:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Sunday, May 07, 2006<br>Mandate what cheebye mandate?<br><br>Wah so exciting this time. Especially the Potong Pasir and Hougang fight. $80 to $100 million fucking dollar and plus send Lau Goh go there also cannot help them win Chiam and Low Thia Khiang. People cannot always be win by send Big Gun and give money. People want your heart not just your hand. Aljunied that side is good example of what the new Singaporean want. Ang Mo Kio result also another big sign.<br><br>But fuck lah, you just see lor, Aljunied sure kena chop chop like Cheng San one. Almost 44% the people there choose Worker Party. Fuck care you put how many PAP minister down there. 44% of Aljunied don't mind lose one Overseas Minister and two small minister. What that tell you? People not happy. People want more. People want MP that can do thing for them. They heng in Aljunied still got the woman MP like Cynthia Pua do her work or else die. I have many friend in Aljunied and they tell me they never see the General before. So have a big minister as my MP for fuck?<br><br>And Ang Mo Kio is the best! All the time walkover until WP send their Kamakazee team there. Six no-experience young punk fight the Small Dragon and can win until 33% of the vote there! Lim Boon Heng got say 85% win for Small Lee right? Hahahahahaha!!!! Where is your 85% now? 70 fucking percent also dun have! Still can say got mandate and got new young voter support. Just kena fuck backside by six virgin, support ki lan ah! AMK the 66.13% cannot even beat the average Singapore 66.6% score. Mandate ki lan ah!<br><br>I heard the Cheng San that side got help a bit. Cheng San people still never forgive PAP for 1997. You can chase away their Tang Liang Hong. You can swallow their Cheng San put inside Ang Mo Kio. But you cannot take away the toolan in their heart. This 33% is their present to you. This 33% is Cheng San middle finger give to PAP.<br><br>Friend just told me they arrest Gomez. Dunno true or not. Nabei election over liao so can start to bully people. You just see lah, your life will go back the same hell like before.<br><br>Actually the most big loser is not Opposition. They actually improve a lot, almost every place they fight the percent increase, PAP percent go down. Even Talk Cock Ling and his Self Destroy Party also can get 20%, quite good liao. No, the most big loser is Goh Choke Tong who kena send to become PAP Suicide Man. Send him go to Potong Pasir and Hougang and die. At least the Worker Party Suicide 6 go with nothing, come back with some result. Lau Goh go with his name and his million of carrot, come back with the million of carrot push up his kar chng by the people who support Chiam and Low. Somemore dunno how come this election, Lau Goh say so many stupid thing, like say bad thing about Chiam even make Chiam wife cry. Lau Lee and Small Lee lend him the knife by send him go to PP and Hougang, but Lau Goh ownself poke his own stomach. Small Lee not just fix opposition, also fix Lau Goh I think. Hahahahahaha!!!!<br><br>The other big loser is the cheebye Singapore newspaper like PAP Times and Mediacocksucker TV station like Channel News of PAP Only. After this election, no people want to believe you now. The internet show you all as Big Gahmen Running Dog. Maybe the auntie and the old man still will read you and believe you. But the new generation not just will read you less and less, and watch you less and less, they will never believe you fucker again.<br><br>Maybe Lau Goh can start new party, the Last-Time PAP party! Hahahahahaha!!!</div>
