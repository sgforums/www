              <p>at my estate, they're bashing another road through to the AYE because it's getting ridiculous when a whole estate + condo has to go through 1 little lane</p>
              <p>but they're getting resistance from the people who live near where the new road is... i dunno, i'd be happy if my side of the neighbourhood has a road out... then i'd not have to drive around the entire estate just to get out</p>

              <p>well, there's still a range of smaller flats being built to demand right now.</p>
              <p>If I remember correctly, for 2 room flats and below, the income ceiling is only 2k.</p>
              <p>These are reserved for the really poor folks.</p>
              <p>Then there's the additonal housing grant if your income falls below 5k a month. The grant can go up to 40k</p>
              <p>Considering that a two room flat costs around 70k and a 3 room 100+, it makes a lot of difference.</p>
              <p>I think the class of folks that are really farked right now are the ones raking in more than 8k a month but can't really afford a sizeable condo just yet.</p>

              <p>Nah.... it's not just CPF..... our study allowances don't count as proper official income as well, since we don't pay taxes on it. At least, that was what DBS told me when I called.</p>
              <p>Oh well, we've already decided on moving in her mom's Pasir Ris flat. As for buying it over or getting a new flat.... that's a problem for two years down the road.</p>

              <p><br>here, you are dead wrong...</p>
              <p>HDB flats are leases.. and if i move out i need to buy another place.. and i get hammered with the COV of the other place... borrowing from Peter to pay Paul...</p>
              <p>if i want to upgrade to a condo, i better be ready to get hammered by the costs because it's private property..</p>
              <p>btw.. HDB flats do not belong in the free market... they were not put up in free market circumstances and you can argue that until the cows come home, they are still not and should never be part of the free market...</p>
