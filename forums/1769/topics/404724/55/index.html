              <p>I hardly sit in taxis but a lot of them don't pay attention to what's happening around them or what they're doing. You'd think that they'd take better car of a machine which is their bread and butter. And they still behave like self-righteous arses in the forum.</p>

              <p>Those pricks at the forum grates on my nerves with their "taxi-driver ethics".</p>
              <p>Not only their defensive driving phail, even the way they drive borders on the madness. Some start from 2nd gear, some like to free-wheel from point to point, others don't even reach 4th gear.</p>
              <p>Considering I hardly take taxi, and I have a terrible impression of their lack of skills, simply shows the proportion of taxi drivers who think they are kings of their little world.</p>
