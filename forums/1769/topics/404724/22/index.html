              <p>well, if you think about it, the HDB policies are still semi
              socialist. Yes, it's true that BTO flats are priced slightly above
              their cost price, but then they are used to subsidize buyers of resale
              flats, each of whom get 30-40k each, and poorer buyers, with their
              additional housing grants of up to 40k each. And judging from the number of resale
              transactions; each quarter around 8500 transactions, the subsidies required is much bigger than whatever supposed profits there is.</p>
              <p>As for the HDB resale market, whether it should be allowed to exist at all, that's another issue altogether.</p>

              <p>if people are going to monetize their asset this way, would they be stupid enough to just sell off the place first and then get flummoxed by the question of where to stay next ? Or be flummoxed by the cost of their new place ?</p>
              <p>of course, if they've made the consious decision to sell their current place, they must have either a pressing, urgent need to cash out, as I've shown above, or have decided they'll still make more money in an alternative housing arrangement, eh ? </p>

              <p>actually, that's true .....</p>
              <p>fatumnette and I were truly truly lucky ...... you can't believe how so.</p>
              <p>We got a cheap place near to my parents, on our first try, and just in time as well, though I'd have to start reporting income tax by this year, fatumnette got a pay rise right AFTER we were informed of our ballot success. This payrise would put us out of the income ceiling. Luckily, the income statement for the previous year was enough to make us still eligible for our new place.</p>
              <p>If not we'd be quite farked as well. We'd have to look for a place on the resale market, and her 3 room bachelorette would not be quite enough for a couple and a dog and a rabbit, not to mention any kids.</p>

              <p>Actually it's left towns like Bt Panjang, Sengkang, Punggol, Yishun, Sembawang that has big potential for more flats.</p>
              <p>Choa Chu Kang, Bt Batok, Woodlands has pockets left to go around.</p>

              <p>While running an errant at Upper Thomson Road, I decided to pamper myself with a stumpous lunch. Yes, it's Parker restaurant and yes, it cost 4 times my normal lunch of cai png but it's worth it.</p>
              <p>Tak bugolgi or Chicken Hotplate. The side dishes were very good today. Other than the green spanish, I ate everything. That orange strips are not carrot but cuttlefish. Too bad I have work to do. Otherwise a cup of soju with the cuttlefish would be wonderful.</p>
