              <p>COV is a vicious cycle. In the end everyone just pays more for the same thing. Since everyone pays inflated prices, they also have to sell at inflated prices. And the cycle continues. If the government puts a stop to it now, the current lot will suffer a loss but the rot stops now. But because there will be a riot if they do that, current and future generations will have to continue to suffer. </p>

              <p>This is a true story someone related to me:</p>
              <p>There was this large company that was facing hard times. Management asked the employees to choose between 2 options:</p>
              <p>1. everyone takes a 15% pay-cut and there will be no need for retrenchment</p>
              <p>2. pay remains the same but 20% of the employees will be laid off.</p>
              <p>In the end nearly everybody chose option 2!!! Those that got the pink slips were shocked that they got axed. They didn't think it would happen to them. </p>

              <p>well, read what LF's said. It's a conundrum. What's the right thing to do for one group, would be the wrong thing to do for another. There are two sides of this coin. Of course, from your side of the coin right now, it'll be the wrong thing to do.</p>
              <p>But let's look at it from another angle shall we ? Why is assets appreciation and wealth creation important ? Because in practically every country in the world, especially ones with first world economies, housing represents your single biggest cost over your lifetime. It takes up the largest chunk of your income. It would also be your single biggest asset.</p>
              <p>Now imagine the single thing that you've spent the most amount of money you've made on, can only remain a black hole, and a neccessary one, because the value of which is not allowed to appreciate via a free market mechanism.</p>
              <p>Would you be happy ? I'm sure you'd be cursing the powers-that-be just as much then.</p>
              <p>And further more, it's not always correct that you'll always loose out when you sell your flat and get another one cos you'd be hit with the double whammy of another COV all over again. I'll give you an example. The last HDB transaction I was involved in, this family lived in a 4 room flat, when the childre reached their teens and needed a room each they applied for a 5 room BTO and got it. When they sold their 4 room, they got it for more than what the 5 room cost. So their new house practically paid for itself, even after levy. Shiok neh ? Of course, try selling the idea of no COV to the family.</p>
              <p>People buy and sell their flats for all sort of reasons. I've seen it all, people selling to pay off gambling debts, to cash in to travel around the world, to pay for the kid's cambridge law degree, to upgrade to condo, to get out of bankruptcies, to pay off a particularly huge overseas medical bill. Regardless of the reasons, it is important to all these people that they were able to monetize their assets. In some cases their lives depend on it. If they weren't able to get a premium on what they paid for the flats, they would all be quite farked.These are the people on the other side of the coin you're standing on.</p>
              <p>People like to blame property agent chaps for high prices of course, it comes with the turf. But I tell you, our instincts is actually to push down the prices to make the deal go quicker. Let me work out the sums for you. our commission averages 1%, so for every 10,000 we can wheedle up in prices, we'd only make $100 more ... in terms of opportunity costs, we'd much prefer to close the deal as quickly as possible, instead of sqeezing out a further 10 or 20k from the buyer, and move on to sell another house, where we may pick up another 10k instead of 100 bucks.</p>

              <p>This is a true story someone related to me:</p>
              <p>There was this large company that was facing hard times. Management asked the employees to choose between 2 options:</p>
              <p>1. everyone takes a 15% pay-cut and there will be no need for retrenchment</p>
              <p>2. pay remains the same but 20% of the employees will be laid off.</p>
              <p>In the end nearly everybody chose option 2!!! Those that got the pink slips were shocked that they got axed. They didn't think it would happen to them. </p>

              <p>well, if COVs were to be outlawed, such things still happen because economic crashes are things beyond anyone's control.</p>
              <p>However, taking away the COV mechanism would certainly hinder the recovery of asset values, making asset prices practically a one way street. People would be farked over, much longer in such a crash.</p>

              degree, to upgrade to condo, to get out of bankruptcies, to pay off
              a particularly huge overseas medical bill. Regardless of the
              reasons, it is important to all these people that they were able to
              monetize their assets. In some cases their lives depend on it. If
              they weren't able to get a premium on what they paid for the flats,
              they would all be quite farked.These are the people on the other
              side of the coin you're standing on.</p>
              <p>People like to blame property agent chaps for high prices of
              course, it comes with the turf. But I tell you, our instincts is
              actually to push down the prices to make the deal go quicker. Let
              me work out the sums for you. our commission averages 1%, so for
              every 10,000 we can wheedle up in prices, we'd only make $100 more
              ... in terms of opportunity costs, we'd much prefer to close the
              deal as quickly as possible, instead of sqeezing out a further 10
              or 20k from the buyer, and move on to sell another house, where we
              may pick up another 10k instead of 100 bucks.</p>

              <p>MY side of the coin is that of the hapless single who will never qualify for BTOs, never get married, can't afford a condo, and is forced to look at the open market to secure a roof over his/her head. and from our point of view, COV is a very bad idea. </p>
