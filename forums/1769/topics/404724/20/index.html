              <p>well ... the alternative would be the goverment let you go tikam and the one sized flat you get would be your lot till you die or upgrade to private housing ?</p>
              <p>and I don't think COVs are a speculator's thing, since you can only own one HDB at a time, and must live in it for 5 years before flipping it. And remember, during the property market doldrums, people's gripes were, ironically, about the low prices then.</p>
              <p>Imagine you're a 5 room flat owner right now, who bought your place
              years ago, and reared your children there, now that your children's
              grown up and fled the nest, you decide to cash out and flip the flat
              for a smaller unit that's easier to clean and use the money to travel
              around the world. And the market falls out from beneath your feet
              because premiums are outlawed, or prices are artificially capped, what
              happens ?</p>
              <p>like I said, public housing in singapore has to operate within the free market context because they constitute 80% of the housing supply. Looking at the public tenements and micro condos of hong kong, I'm convinced that things would be a lot worse if the HDB weren't around.</p>
              <p>Mind you, I'm not saying this only cos I got my BTO and am happy; I was pretty impressed when I went through my CEHA and agents training and have to plough through what the HDB have done. Every other clause was "Singapore Citizens only". Could they have done a better job in the past couple of years managing the property market ? yes they could have. Are they doing something about it, within the context of the free market ? yes they are. Could it have been worse otherwise ? Absolutely.</p>

              <p><br>no wonder some of my lady friends just refused to move into the in-laws big houses.  but they analysised, should the parents in law "died", they would secured themselves the house &amp; $ (when the house is sold eventually) (if the husband has only 1 or 2 siblings, even better, bigger pie)..</p>
              <p>.. so they need not marrying the entire extended family, but they are making sure that they hit the right jackpot, thus security future $assets, of course they might say goodbye to their hushand later, only when the money secured..... they called it the long term plan ... this is one wrong woman huh....?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>

              <p>well ... the alternative would be the goverment let you go tikam
              and the one sized flat you get would be your lot till you die or
              upgrade to private housing ?</p>
              <p>and I don't think COVs are a speculator's thing, since you can
              only own one HDB at a time, and must live in it for 5 years before
              flipping it. And remember, during the property market doldrums,
              people's gripes were, ironically, about the low prices then.</p>
              <p>Imagine you're a 5 room flat owner right now, who bought your
              place years ago, and reared your children there, now that your
              children's grown up and fled the nest, you decide to cash out and
              flip the flat for a smaller unit that's easier to clean and use the
              money to travel around the world. And the market falls out from
              beneath your feet because premiums are outlawed, or prices are
              artificially capped, what happens ?</p>
              <p>like I said, public housing in singapore has to operate within
              the free market context because they constitute 80% of the housing
              supply. Looking at the public tenements and micro condos of hong
              kong, I'm convinced that things would be a lot worse if the HDB
              weren't around.</p>
              <p>Mind you, I'm not saying this only cos I got my BTO and am
              happy; I was pretty impressed when I went through my CEHA and
              agents training and have to plough through what the HDB have done.
              Every other clause was "Singapore Citizens only". Could they have
              done a better job in the past couple of years managing the property
              market ? yes they could have. Are they doing something about it,
              within the context of the free market ? yes they are. Could it have
              been worse otherwise ? Absolutely.</p>
