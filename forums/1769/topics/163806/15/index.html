            <div class='col-md body'>OK, share one point with you guys to expose how idiotic the whole situation can get...<br><br>One ward is notorious for being super busy cause of the bad staff : patient ratio.  Its staff never get to go for breaks because of the high activity level there.<br><br>So, I raised up the issue of improving the working conditions for our nurses there, cause no one should work in such a condition.<br><br>One of the nurses was from that ward.  She agrees.  But then, maybe she didn't dare to be honest, she quickly added, 'It's ok lah... we're used to not having our breaks and not eating our meals already'.<br><br>And the management quickly smiled and said, 'See... you learn to cope!' and, that was it!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>So, me not happy about the way it was handled, spoke up again, 'Just because they have learnt to adapt to not having any breaks does not mean it's RIGHT!'<br><br>There was a pause, then very quickly, they moved on to the next topic!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
