But need to get business plan for M1 users and mobile voice plan for starhub users.<br><br>I used motorola before..and ya i dun like nokia too..now using Sony Ericsson phone.  Service centres should not be a problem ba.  That time my phone needed repair and there was a service centre at jurong point..i could get back my phone within hours.  Send to nokia still have to wait duiz..<br><br>Perhaps he asked u to repair bcos he can repair it now and then make some parts loose or watever, next time u will go back to him for repair again.  Just the cost of repairing is enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Serious lor, i sent my nokia phone for repair once due to LCD prob..then when i got it back, i realized that hp could not vibrate anymore.  </span></div>
