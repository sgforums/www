            <div class='col-md body'>Juz came back from a wedding dinner with my pig. The groom is my pig's good frend since secondary school...The couple actually now both working in HK and purposely came back to arrange this wedding dinner...Luckily we were sitting with the other 5 couples that we are close to. There were a lot of unfamiliar faces there, a lot of family friends of the juz married couple, a lot of ah peh and aunties... The dinner started quite late and ended late as well. We left at about nearly 12 midnight...The bride sang a song at the end of the dinner as a surprise for the groom...The is probably the best part of the dinner...The couple did this for their friends and relatives. Some of them came all the way from US, UK or Indonesia to attend the dinner.<br><br>It is mixed feelings after we came back home. Although it is tiring and costly, i can tell that the couple enjoyed the dinner with all the friends and relatives...I am still not sure if one day it is my turn, will i arrange the wedding dinner as well... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>
