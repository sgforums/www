              <p>I agree with you, which is why I joined another bank when I know her work style. For my colleague, she is married with a kid, joined the company for only a year, and actually took a pay cut because she wanted a job that have lesser responsibilities. She didn't want to resign because she is afraid it will look bad on her CV (paycut plus change of job too frequently) so she have to hang around for another year or two. Tough luck for her!</p>

              so exactly what's your question/problem ??
              
              If you need pointers to find out what's next, try the following suggestions:
              
              a. Thank God everyday and be the best you can be in your job, relationships
              b. Find your passion and do what you are passionate about
              c. Give your time and money
              d. If you need companionship, start to look around
              e. work out a plan that enable you to do a-d full time.

              <p>Hi everyone! I am turning 30 this year, and am gradually realizing that I am at different life stages of my peers (i.e. friends I used to study with).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They are either married without kids, married with kids, single with BF or single without a BF but not really enjoying their life trying new things. Personally, there is nothing wrong with their life, because I am not here to critic. I am here to meet people who are at the same or similar life stage as me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am at the life stage whereby I am young (or I like the idea that I am still young!), well-educated, have a very successful career that pays me well, have the time and ability to try different things, ranging from going away for vacations (sometimes alone, sometimes with friends) at least once a month, to picking up new hobbies like horse-riding. Most of my (male &amp; female) friends are foreigners and/or expats, but I am pretty sure that there are Singaporeans or maybe more foreigners, who are at the same life stage as me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone out there in this forum, who is in similar situation as me?</p>

              <p>Anyway, I am decently educated and gainfully unemployed. Married but free to do anything I want. I loves to go on vacation alone, especially to Asian countries. Must try vacations that are not the norms. I would love to go to Kashmir in India...Beautiful place but could be killed any moment...enjoying nature's beauty with the suspense that I might not live tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Would u be interested to join me on a 2 weeks trip to Kashmir in Dec? Esp the Indian/Pakistan border part.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> Or would u be interested in Beirut?</p>
