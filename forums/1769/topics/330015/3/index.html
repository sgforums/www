              <p><br>Try reading my first post (you know the part where I said "Most of my (male &amp; female) friends are foreigners and/or expats, but I am pretty sure that there are Singaporeans or maybe more foreigners, who are at the same life stage as me.).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not lonely or seeking companionship. If there are people around who are similiar to me, young, single, well educated, well travelled, well paid and always up to meet more new friends, or try new things, its good. Forum is merely an option to know more interesting people, right? Or I got it all confused with the definition of "bitch-fest"? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, if I am in the wrong place, I will just stick with my caucasian friends, because "I am so easily impressed by caucasians and don't make any effort to hang out with Singaporeans".</p>
