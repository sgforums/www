              <p>Tell me about it and maybe species are wiped out in the wild for damming projects etc and forests being cleared to make way for more corn and soybean fields because there is just not enough food.</p>
              <p>And then we have the Americans who are busy marketing food as alternative source of energy when producing them consumes as much fossil fuels -_-"  </p>

              <p>Well, the reason our govt wants us to have more babies is because they need more workers for the economy. So do you think they think we are some sort of factory?</p>

              <p>I guess I can't subscribe to this view.. having just a baby myself recently :)</p>
              <p><br>I think subscribing the problem to the population quantity is sort of confusing a correlation with the cause.</p>
              <p>In the whole history of mankind- the average number of babies PER couple is probably far more than the current situation. Just look at our grandparents, most of them stop at... 6-7? We stop at 1-2. The advanced technologies in medical, agricultural fields simply meant out of the 1-2, more survive and survive longer. Thus, population boom.</p>
              <p>Now, the problem of environmental destruction is due ALSO to the advanced technologies: that are not advanced enough to use but not abuse. The worst of this is: the benefit of these technologies are only enjoyed by a SMALL group of the entire population. It isn't consumerism due to LARGE population. It is consumerism and wastage by a much much smaller 'elite' piece of the population pie.</p>
              <p> Sure, CHina<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html"> contributes the most to global warming</a>. India is on the list too. BUT per capita, their contribution is TINY. Instead its United States and Australia,  that contributes the TOP Co2 to global warming - and comparatively - their population is much smaller.</p>
              <p>So... population may MAKE the problem worse - but it isn't the cause of the problem. I think what we need is .. to make a BIGGER Portion of the population start being aware and conscious of the wastage and damage..

              <p><br>Yeah some of my friends have decided to reduce consumer wastage by totally not buying anything new. They either borrow, buy 2nd hand, get from freecycle.com etc. It requires a lot of discipline and commitment and a HUGE paradigm shift.</p>

              <p>Yes, we can reduce our footprint but only by so much, because every living person needs to food, water, transport and shelter. And it doesn't help when people in rapidly-industrialising countries aspire to the kind of lifestyle that is portrayed in the developed world, and believe it's their right to attain it before thinking about saving the planet.</p>
