              <p>i figure what he meant was that as you grow older, sometimes you grow wiser..</p>

              <p>things which we chased, stuff like prestige, status, things, money, whatever seem trivial and pointless...</p>

              the bear &gt; do you mean the protagonist in the movie? He obviously loved defusing bombs more than his son.
              
              I think what he meant was, as you grow older, you realize that you have slowly become a product of your environment.

              <p>I can relate how u feel cos I too feel eveything I used to do seems to be unappealing to me again...but I am not sure is it because of the age thing or is it simply because I am lazy... I suspect its the latter that cause the lost of interest <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>People changes their preference as one grew older. One tend to able to let go of what they felt was of almost importance in the past and pursued something that they felt has become more importance.</p>
              <p>What is important to U now? Ur family or the friends that accompany through the endless nights in pubs. I'm sure now you begin thinking about the next stage of Life where who has become your No. 1 priority.</p>
              <p>I can't gif a definite answer to ur question But i do know when past 30, one will look back and start to count the things not yet done before 30 and start thinking about their life</p>

              <p>The line above comes from the movie <em>"The Hurt Locker"</em> which I watched last night. The protaganist says it to his infant son while playing with him. I think he was actually talking to himself.</p>
              <p>It struck me pretty hard as being true. Now that I've hit my thirties, I begin to find that things that I used to love, simply hold no more attraction for me. The older we get, the less things we seem to be able to love.</p>
              <p>Anybody else feel that way?</p>
