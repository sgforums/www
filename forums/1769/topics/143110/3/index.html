First, you need to get the right doctor for the right age. My kids can't go see the same doctor as us cos they need to have peds. The medicine is only available in pharmacies and not from the doctors. Then there is the stupid insurance companies. What the heck, in Singapore, just go to any doctor and voila...solved. Man, it is such a hassle. It is no wonder the people here are so into self medication. </blockquote>Afraid that is due in part to the high litigation rate in US and everyone is practising defensive medicine. It's also coming to Singapore now, including the need to get medication from pharmacies. The pharmacists are saying that doctors are earning money from the medicine and now the Ministry is planning to ban doctors from selling the medicine. Hope we don't learn the worst from the US..</div>

If you are willing to sacrifice convenience and shop around a bit, you can usually find good deals on consumables. Substituting generics for "name-brand" items at the supermarket can save you a bit on your grocery bill as well.<br><br>But if you <strong>really</strong> want to save money, especially on "big-ticket" items like home electronics, your best bet is to shop on-line. Prices are usually significantly less than buying the item at a retail store, and in most instances you do not pay sales tax. And it's getting to the point where almost <strong>anything</strong> can be purchased via the Internet. My most recent car and most of the firearms in my collection, for example, were acquired that way.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I agree!

Not so here. Unless you're living right downtown in a major city with semi-decent public transportation, it's almost a given that you need a car to survive in the US. The distances require that.<br><br>Minneapolis/St. Paul, like many other major US cities, does have a fairly decent public transportation network which was recently augmented by the addition of a light rail system. The trains and buses don't run as often as the ones in Singapore, but what they lack in frequency, they make up in punctuality. If you need to use public transportation to move about, you'll have to schedule your activities around the bus and train timetables. As a matter of fact, my daily commute involves driving to a nearby "park and ride" lot and jumping into an express bus that takes me downtown.<br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prima has this range of ready-to-eat instant food sold in the fridge section of 7-Eleven's that's pretty good!  So far, I've tried the Mee Siam and Mee Rebus.  I think the Mee Siam's really nice, for instant food!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  There's even a whole hard-boiled egg inside!<br><br>There's also Dodo Fishball noodles on sale at Cold Storage and 7-Eleven's.  Not bad too!  Just add water and pop it in the microwave oven for about 2-3 mins on High and voila!  The Laksa is also pretty delicious!  If you buy a handful of bean sprouts from Cold Storage and pre-cook them a little before throwing them into the Laksa, it's nicer!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Hungry!

Traditionally spicy ethnic foods, like Szechuan and Indian fare, are <strong>severely</strong> toned down at restaurants around here to accommodate local tastes. Consequently, eating out can be a rather bland experience...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>MG</div>
