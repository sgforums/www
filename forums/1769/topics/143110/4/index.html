However, most of them are just clueless about how to approach us or if we would want to be approached at all in the first place.<br><br>I've discovered that if you communicate openly to them, most of them would be more than happy to strike up a conversation with you.  I've learnt to just walk up to a neighbour and exclaim, "Say, I just wanted you to know that your roses are the loveliest I've seen in this neighbourhood!  You've really got green fingers!" and before long, ta-da!  ... a new friend.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>They kinda tend not to take time to draw someone out of their shells, so you'll have to take a deep breath, bury your fears, and just walk up to them and make small talk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Sometimes, friendships start by asking each other for help or helping each other out.  In that sense, try not to think of them as 'making use' of each other.  For sure, their friendships are different from the ones we enjoy here, but I've learnt that once they accept you into their lives, they are pretty warm folks too!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
