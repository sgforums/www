            <div class='col-md body'>Just back from Legoland.<br><br>Jetta's hubby has been very nice to drive me 1hour to Legoland to meet up with my family on my way home.<br><br>And guess what, on my way to San Diego on the Amtrak, met one very nice handsome young man who was on the cruise last month.<br><br>He is on his way to San Diego with his friends.  We chit chatted a bit and its nice to meet someone I know on the train.<br><br>It was great at Jetta's place.  Ate her lovely moist Chocolate cake, scones &amp; loves her house.  It was small, but very very comfy.  I really wish my little 3 room flat has her kind of home flavour.  Maybe its because we are Singaporeans, so we are used to homes that is small, efficient &amp; comfortable with furnitures that we  love.</div>
