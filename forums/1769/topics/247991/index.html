            <div class='col-md body'>Being called names should not be tolerated by anyone, ANYWHERE. How can someone, boss or not boss, call us 'stupid', 'idiot' or whatever degrading words like that? I would stand up and tell the boss off, albeit in a cool tone that he should not be so personal in the workplace. If there is any mistake in the task, he should point at the mistake and said 'tis is a silly mistake' and not addressed his employee as 'silly' because there is a lot of difference in making angry remarks at a piece of work and a person.<br><br>If the boss fires me for my speaking up then well and good.
