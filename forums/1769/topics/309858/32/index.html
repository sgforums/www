              <p>Seriously Fatum, as an employer do you want to keep hiring and
              training because people just walk out on you?</p>
              <p>And we are not even talking about freezer temperatures but
              chiller temperature. They have warm clothing and how dangerous is
              stickering stickers on a small retail pack of pork? Ya you might
              catch a cold. Same like you walk out of a cold office to our hot
              weather outside and you might catch a cold.</p>
              <p>Sure if you want higher pay, your output have to make up for it
              too. You cannot just pay more because that fella is a Singaporean
              but his effeciency is just not there.</p>
              <p>Well for higher pay you would expect better output  too
              right?</p>
              <p>Why are the Americans able to have high pay and yet remain so
              competitive?</p>
              <p>That's because they are very efficient and fast workers.</p>
              <p>In a busy resturant you can see like maybe only 1 waitress and
              she takes orders and get the bills etc and does it with a smile. In
              the cutting plants, you will be amazed at how they work and the
              workers there are all Americans.</p>
              <p>On their fields, 1 man can harvest acres and acres of land.</p>
              <p>Speaking from the employer point of view, the typical blue
              collar worker here, expects to be treated nice with light work load
              because he is Singaporean and most of the time they bo chup and
              just tell you 'Dunno la' so they don't have to do it.</p>
              <p>Sure the pay for them can go up, but at the same time one has to
              be realistic that attitudes have to change and seriously a lot of
              Singaporeans need to realise that our world is becoming borderless
              now.</p>
              <p>Anyway the Chinese are not just invading Singapore. They are
              invading everywhere. Even in Canada, for Maple Leaf Foods, with
              their major restructuring, most of the traders I deal with now are
              PRC and mind you they are very sharp traders and write better
              English than most Singaporeans in SgF</p>

              <p>show them the high pay, and people will follow, pay them a good wage and their output will increase ... why are people willing to work and slave long hours, like my cousin, as an investment banker, being on call 24/7, getting maybe 3-4 hours of sleep a night, getting your work faxed to you if you call in sick ! .... cos they are being paid 800k US a year .....</p>
              <p>if you pay peanuts in Singapore, what kind of locals would you get, but the truly lazy and unambitious ? .....</p>
              <p>imagine, pinky, if you're being paid 1/4 of your current earnings, would you still be putting in the long hours you're putting in now, and putting up with ham murderer besides ? ...</p>

              <p>I have to say that the other "developed" countries have their own agriculture</p>
              <p>They are the producers and exporters of these commodities and every year the Government have subsidies handed out to the farmers so in a way, local prices are pretty much controlled in a way.</p>
              <p>And with any exporting country, export prices have to be better before they see the need to export instead of selling to the local market.</p>
