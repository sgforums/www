              <p>Precisely!!  For me, 'fresh' means you cook the meat the minute it's slaughtered.  Or, you cook the seafood the minute it's hauled up from the nets.  Other than that, it has to go through some form of refrigeration whilst being transported and if you think about it, to reach the market frozen would definitely be a better method of keeping it fresher, than to just chill it.</p>

              <p>Japan had zero resources too, how did they become the second biggest economy in the world ? ... their domestic economy was a result of their own spending after their boom .....</p>
              <p>and I am sick of people saying that we have to be competitive .... Singaporeans are enterprising, we are not sheltered, naive, or dependent .... lots of people have survived and made our way outside of our nanny state  ....</p>
              <p>you know what's the real billion dollar answer ? ... it's because we have become too dependent on foreign investments and goverment enterprises ... in singapore, the majority of big businesses have goverment links, or a directly goverment owned ... Singtel, Sembawang, Jurong shipyard, NOL, Singapore airlines, DBS bank, ST, the list goes on and on .... what's left over are the big foreign players ....</p>
              <p>creative got farked over by the goverment before .... that's why their research center is located in malaysia, in a direct slap to the goverment, for attempts at reverse engineering their products ... remember the two chaps who thought of licensing minivans to sell food at carparks in the CBD ? ... instead of being granted their licenses, the authorities took their idea, and started selling licenses to the general public, and the two chaps got not a single cent ....</p>
              <p>this is the crux of the problem .... i resent being told we are spoilt, we're a nanny state, we can't survive on our own, all of which is untrue .... the only truth is that we are over-regulated and managed to the point that on one is able to exercise judgement and initiative even if they want to ... all the time we're being forced to play a field that's getting ever crowded with one hand tied ... CPF contributions, yearly NS obligations, High housing costs, all that against a backdrop of lowering wages caused by foreign competition .... </p>
              <p>something's got to give ... we cannot keep being asked to accept less and less forever ... low wages is not the only way for us to compete .... infact, it is NOT the way for us to compete ... anyone would tell you, sooner or later, everyone would be facing the same wage structure, what then ? ....</p>

              <p>I totally agree with you.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are too spoilt and fussy in their job search.  They flock to 'cushy' professions, whilst shunning the less glamourous ones.  If we don't have FT's to fill up the posts shunned by Singaporeans, what then?  Sit and put our feet up and watch our economy fail, simply because too many vital jobs are left vacant because no Singaporean wants those jobs, and yet, we do not allow foreigners who are willing to work, to get those jobs too? </p>
              <p>FT's do not deprive Singaporeans of jobs.  FT's FILL THE QUOTA left when Singaporeans refuse to take up the jobs! </p>
              <p>Look at all the major developed countries in the world today.  Which one does not import FT's?  Look at London, NYC, Sydney, Melbourne, Paris, etc etc.  All major economies welcome FT's to a certain extent.  Without FT's, Melbourne will never be what it is today - a vibrant, booming economy.  Rather, it would be a backwater city that's lacklustre and very much a cultural desert. </p>
              <p>FT's know that they can stay in a country only if they work hard.  They have more at stake so yes, in certain instances, they will tend to work harder and even be more cheerful doing the same jobs that the Singaporeans somehow dislike. </p>
              <p>We shouldn't adopt a 'closed' attitude like our immediate neighbour with their protectionist Bumi Putra policies.  Look how far their protectionist policies have brought them!</p>

              <p>Japan had zero resources too, how did they become the second
              biggest economy in the world ? ... their domestic economy was a

              <p>you know what's the real billion dollar answer ? ... it's
              because we have become too dependent on foreign investments and
              goverment enterprises ... in singapore, the majority of big
              businesses have goverment links, or a directly goverment owned ...
              Singtel, Sembawang, Jurong shipyard, NOL, Singapore airlines, DBS
              bank, ST, the list goes on and on .... what's left over are the big

              <p>creative got farked over by the goverment before .... that's why
              their research center is located in malaysia, in a direct slap to
              the goverment, for attempts at reverse engineering their products
              ... remember the two chaps who thought of licensing minivans to
              sell food at carparks in the CBD ? ... instead of being granted
              their licenses, the authorities took their idea, and started
              selling licenses to the general public, and the two chaps got not a
              single cent ....</p>
              <p>this is the crux of the problem .... i resent being told we are
              spoilt, we're a nanny state, we can't survive on our own, all of
              which is untrue .... the only truth is that we are over-regulated
              and managed to the point that on one is able to exercise judgement
              and initiative even if they want to ... all the time we're being
              forced to play a field that's getting ever crowded with one hand
              tied ... CPF contributions, yearly NS obligations, High housing
              costs, all that against a backdrop of lowering wages caused by
              foreign competition .... </p>
              <p>something's got to give ... we cannot keep being asked to accept
              less and less forever ... low wages is not the only way for us to
              compete .... infact, it is NOT the way for us to compete ... anyone

              <p>I also know of plenty of Johoreans who are married with wife and kids and they sacrifice the time spent with their family to earn more money here so that they can have a easier life back there. To top off they commute between Malaysia and Singapore everyday.</p>

              <p>You put in so many hours a day Fatum because you are your own boss. If you don't work, you have no $$.

              <p>now I am not advocating bumi policies for singaporeans, but if
              you fail to make the distinction between Singaporeans and Foreign
              Talents, then we'll cease to exist as a nation ...</p>
              <p>our situation is different ... we have conscription, other
              countries don't ... we impose duties on our citizens beyond what's
              asked of other people ... we impose handicaps on them .... while at
              the same time, give many FTs a leg up and headstart in our society
              here ....</p>
              <p>filling in vital jobs is one thing, but what I see is that many
              older, less educated Singaporeans are being edged out of jobs by
              lower cost, younger foreign talents ....</p>
              <p>why hire a 55 year old Singaporean aunty as a toilet cleaner who
              has to get home at 5 everyday to tend to the house and cook dinner,
              while you can hire a 25 years old china kid who can put in two
              hours more everyday, and accept a lower wage ? .... get my drift ?
              ... I'm not sure if it's even a fair comparison to start with
              ...</p>
              <p>and employers are screaming, not enough people ! not enough
              people ? ...</p>
              <p>our public services are being taxed, look at our trains and
              busses ....  we're being over-crowded ... every single public
              event is a sea of sweltering humanity .... not enough people ? ...
              or too much already ? ...</p>

              <p>It is not FT's that should be targetted, but rather, labour policies.  The Unions are weak in Singapore, they do not offer any protection whatsoever to workers.  Even without the FT's presence, if a corporation is ruthless enough, they will still fire the older, more expensive workers, and replace them with freshly-graduated, keen as puppy dogs Singaporean youths.   The absence of FT's alone will not guarantee that the unfair practice will not permeate.  The solution to that problem, is to enforce labour laws that make such practices illegal and enforce a penalty on such practices, which, as we can already guess, will be futile thinking, it being Singapore. </p>
              <p>As for public transport and over-crowding, seriously, WHICH major developed city doesn't face the same problems?  Rising costs of housing, lousy public transport, hard-to-find parking lots, expensive parking, overcrowding... ALL are typical problems encountered by all major cities in the world.  We aren't doing any worse.  We win some, we lose some.</p>
