              <p>It is not FT's that should be targetted, but rather, labour
              policies.  The Unions are weak in Singapore, they do not offer
              any protection whatsoever to workers.  Even without the FT's
              presence, if a corporation is ruthless enough, they will still fire
              the older, more expensive workers, and replace them with
              freshly-graduated, keen as puppy dogs Singaporean youths.  The
              absence of FT's alone will not guarantee that the unfair practice
              will not permeate.  The solution to that problem, is to
              enforce labour laws that make such practices illegal and enforce a
              penalty on such practices, which, as we can already guess, will be
              futile thinking, it being Singapore. </p>
              <p>As for public transport and over-crowding, seriously, WHICH
              major developed city doesn't face the same problems?  Rising
              costs of housing, lousy public transport, hard-to-find parking
              lots, expensive parking, overcrowding... ALL are typical problems
              encountered by all major cities in the world.  We aren't doing
              any worse.  We win some, we lose some.</p>

              <p>exactly ! ... but that is being used as an excuse to keep wages low now, especially at the lower end of the spectrum ....</p>
              <p>it's getting worse, not better ... I'll give you an example ... an average unigrad in computer science a few years ago, local or overseas, could have gotten 2.5k and better as a starting wage ... people are now accepting 2.3 and below ... cos I knew an indonesian chap, (actually a classmate of mine) who accepted a job here in singapore for 2k a month .... I smacked him on the head and told him he's spoiling the market here ... but he shrugged and said that's what they offered him, so he took it .... my father's ITE graduates are barely nudging past the 1k mark now, when they were taking 1.5 and above a month ... people are dropping down the rungs on the wage scale ...</p>
              <p>i don't deny that foreign talents do Singapore a lot of good, indeed to economies everywhere, but when there is a whole sale hollowing out of the local work force, .... something is seriously wrong ....</p>

              <p>Instead of questioning stuff like that, (because you will never win nor will you see your ideals come to fruition, ever) do what I did... vote with my feet!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  I'm one of the increasing no.s of nurses who are slowly but surely finding their way out here, and someday, our numbers will be substantial enough for the govt to FINALLY realise that something HAS to be done to improve the working conditions for nurses in Singapore.  Basically, I realised almost a decade ago, that there are some policies back home that I detest, but there's nothing I can do to change the situation, so therefore, I will change what I can to open up opportunities for myself. </p>
              <p>I'm an FT here, and because of the good labour laws here, I do not deprive anyone of their job, nor does my presence cause wages to spiral downwards.  That's something the Singapore govt can emulate.  In contrast, my presence makes it easier for all nurses to enjoy a flexible roster that's largely self-planned, and to take sickies when needed, as well as to take Annual Leave without the ridiculous need to submit an entire year's annual leave request by Oct of the preceding year just to plan for manpower needs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Don't just stay in the rut of thinking that FT's do more harm than good.  FT's do bring advantages, and not just to the country's economy.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Competitiveness is not measured
              based on strictly monetary terms.  I think we win hands-down
              in terms of efficiency and productivity, in being the least corrupt
              amongst all our neighbours, in offering secure investment
              opportunities, in our low corporate tax rates, etc.  In
              international surveys done annually, we always come up tops, not
              always due to cost.</span></p>
              <p>exactly ! ... but that is being used as an excuse to keep wages
              low now, especially at the lower end of the spectrum ....</p>
              <p>it's getting worse, not better ... I'll give you an example ...
              an average unigrad in computer science a few years ago, local or
              overseas, could have gotten 2.5k and better as a starting wage ...
              people are now accepting 2.3 and below ... cos I knew an indonesian
              chap, (actually a classmate of mine) who accepted a job here in
              singapore for 2k a month .... I smacked him on the head and told
              him he's spoiling the market here ... but he shrugged and said
              that's what they offered him, so he took it .... my father's ITE
              graduates are barely nudging past the 1k mark now, when they were
              taking 1.5 and above a month ... people are dropping down the rungs
              on the wage scale ...</p>
              <p>i don't deny that foreign talents do Singapore a lot of good,
              indeed to economies everywhere, but when there is a whole sale
              hollowing out of the local work force, .... something is seriously
              wrong ....</p>

              <p>Yes... something IS very wrong.  And what's wrong is the absence of labour laws that eradicate such unjust practices, NOT the presence of FT's.</p>

              <p>I went on a ride to Batu Bahat Malaysia for durians with my biker ah pek and friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The flies there are so horrible, they make a sticky paper all black in colour when they landed on it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And there was more.  If I can upload the handphone pics. you folks are going to faint.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I started lamenting that we should have a tennis racket electric thingy to kill the flies....and an hour later, another young girl wished for it....then another ah pek wished for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it will be funny to see everyone swatting and running after the flies....and we dont have that with us!</p>

              <p>I had dinner at Ramen Ten at Tampines just now.</p>
              <p>The sashimi wasn't fresh...... and the slices of salmon were so small!</p>
              <p>And the sushi was also pretty stale..... the crabsticks weren't that fresh, and the glutinous rice crumbled apart when I picked the sushi up with chopsticks.</p>
              <p>What the heck is wrong with them.... I've been to their outlet at Far East, and I had much better sushi and sashimi there!</p>
