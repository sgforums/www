              <p>the only thing i'm thankful for is that i no longer have to see him as we are posted to different parts of the camp.</p>
              <p>that effing guy is useless and incompetent, and because he stays at Yishun, by right he should've been posted to SBAB, but because he's so terrible, they knew better then to post him to a ops unit, so they did the next best thing and post him to the flight simulator centre because there he could not harm or endanger anybody and it was a slack and relaxed job. And because of that, he's at the same camp as me, obviously very happy, as he had told me before that he won't be so lucky to be in the same camp as me. FARK was all i could murmur that the higher ups had punished me for his lack of intelligence, brains, eq whatever its countless.</p>
              <p>Posted to the tower for orientation with him for a week, followed me everywhere i go, kept looking at me, kept calling me by my chinese name, there was only so much i could take, and thank god that my limit was slightly above the 1 week period.</p>
              <p>Now i can finally start my own unit life in peace. He even asked whether he could go visit me, but thankfully, the heavens were smiling as the WO told him that he couldn't as he didn't have the proper secruity clearance to enter the area where i am.</p>
              <p>How the fark did CMPB send such a nutjob to a vocation such as mine?</p>

              <p>That guy is just totally useless and incompetent. I was being sarcastic when i said that the poly he came from RP, stood for Retarded Polytechnic, but he was obviously very happy with it, saying that i'm good and whatever because i came from somewhere better.</p>
              <p>When you give him instructions to do sth, he will triple confirm it with you before proceeding to do so, and stop at every step for confirmation whether it was the right thing to do.</p>
              <p>Things that i took 1-2 days to learn, he couldn't even remember em after doing for 1 whole week and lamented the fact that i was born smarter then him.</p>
              <p>This was the same guy who threw a live HG sideways, fitted the magazine of a M16 the wrongway during a live firing, and kept repeating things that happened in BMT. Such as asking me on how to do simple drills, yes he can't even march properly even after 6 months in NS. He also likes repeating the same thing over and over again just like how a MRT train will travel over the same route.</p>
              <p>CMPB had better have some good explanation for not giving him a PES status of E and giving him a easy vocation where he just have to sweep the floor or wash toilets cause he obviously doesn't mind that.</p>

              <p>He claims he has an iq of 90. And how on Earth did he get posted to the Airforce with an IQ of 90? I think his sergeants and pc specifically gave recommendation for him to not be posted to any combat unit for fear that he will probably accidentally cause the life of someone else.</p>
              <p>Told me his father once told him that his attitude is farked up, but doesn't care bout that even though he knows it, and obviously can't change for the better.</p>
              <p>If i had to spend my new 1 1/2 year with him, i will probably be driven insane too.</p>

              <p>Denies he is gay, even though the whole course suspects he is.</p>
              <p>Even asked me whether i was afraid that he remembered all my personal particulars, of course i had to act otherwise and told him nicely that his memory could be better used for other stuffs instead of meaningless numbers.</p>
              <p>But i guess, he has already memorized the whole mrt train route, and nothing else can be more meaningful already.</p>

              <p>Thats why my wallet is with me at all times, every friday without a doubt, he will asked me whether i'm going out with my gf. A ploy my friend and i came up with to get him off my back. He remembers my friendster profile, and every nick that i write in msn!</p>
              <p>I just hope that he isn't God's test of faith for me. That i have to love thy neighbour as i love thyself. If thats the case, i'm really starting to hate myself for not being to able to attract the gals, and got him instead.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
