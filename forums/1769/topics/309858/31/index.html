              <p>They are a pork cutting plant in Singapore</p>
              <p>They tried their best to hire locals and got some aunties to do the packaging and pasting stickers etc. They work on shift and in the chiller and yes they are provided warm clothing</p>
              <p>What happened? The aunties bitched about the shift, the cold and some just walked out in an hour. You are talking about people who need the money and job and this is how to act.</p>
              <p>What did my customer do? They turned to PRC workers and guess what? No problems at all besides them talking too loud and their salary is cheaper than those aunties.</p>

              <p>right now, there's inflationary pressure on prices and deflationary pressure on wages, especially at the lower end of the scale ....</p>
              <p>in japan, a "freeter", an odd-job worker, can earn more than $4k a month, they thus can afford the astronomical prices, and have some left over besides, that's how japanese bums can afford to go backpacking in thailand and australia, without going on goverment's dole .....</p>
              <p>in Singapore we're being pushed in two directions ... with an influx of foreign workers, driving down basic wages, especially for workers at the lower end of the spectrum, at the same time, we're facing ever-increasing cost of living, be it transport costs, food costs, housing costs ....</p>
              <p>we are rapidly becoming a stratified society .... there are the "haves" .. and the "have-nots".....</p>

              <p>They are a pork cutting plant in Singapore</p>
              <p>They tried their best to hire locals and got some aunties to do

              the chiller and yes they are provided warm clothing</p>
              <p>What happened? The aunties bitched about the shift, the cold and
              some just walked out in an hour. You are talking about people who
              need the money and job and this is how to act.</p>
              <p>What did my customer do? They turned to PRC workers and guess
              what? No problems at all besides them talking too loud and their
              salary is cheaper than those aunties.</p>

              <p>you know what I think ? ... I keep flashing back to those upton sinclairs that I've read ... where the exploiters recruits ever more wretched people to work at their factories ...</p>
              <p>first they got the Irish to work at Chicago's meat packing plants, then when they got too expensive, they move onto the russians, the ukrainians, the lithuanians, finally, they grabbed blacks from the cotton fields of the south .... paying each wave successively lower wages in turn .......</p>
              <p>is that where we want to go in Singapore ? ... so let's say that Singaporeans are a bunch of lazy workers who onlyn want a cushy job in an air-conditioned office and don't want to sweat on the job .... sure, you can always find someone more wretched and desperate to do the job ... someone who's willing to complain less and work longer hours and accept less pay ..... but where will we be ? ....</p>
              <p>so the conditions suck, pay more, and you'd naturally have people working there .... look at the oil rigs of north america .... dangerous work, back-breaking work, blue collar work, long hours, no women, no alcohol, no cigarettes for months on end .... and they average 300k a year ! .....</p>
              <p>you know why I think those aunties walk out ? ... I think they walked out not because they are lazy, cos they think their health and safety is not worth the $600 they are being paid per month ! ...</p>

              <p>Seriously Fatum, as an employer do you want to keep hiring and training because people just walk out on you?</p>
              <p>And we are not even talking about freezer temperatures but chiller temperature. They have warm clothing and how dangerous is stickering stickers on a small retail pack of pork? Ya you might catch a cold. Same like you walk out of a cold office to our hot weather outside and you might catch a cold.</p>
              <p>Sure if you want higher pay, your output have to make up for it too. You cannot just pay more because that fella is a Singaporean but his effeciency is just not there.</p>
              <p>Well for higher pay you would expect better output  too right?</p>
              <p>Why are the Americans able to have high pay and yet remain so competitive?</p>
              <p>That's because they are very efficient and fast workers.</p>
              <p>In a busy resturant you can see like maybe only 1 waitress and she takes orders and get the bills etc and does it with a smile. In the cutting plants, you will be amazed at how they work and the workers there are all Americans.</p>
              <p>On their fields, 1 man can harvest acres and acres of land.</p>
              <p>Speaking from the employer point of view, the typical blue collar worker here, expects to be treated nice with light work load because he is Singaporean and most of the time they bo chup and just tell you 'Dunno la' so they don't have to do it.</p>
              <p>Sure the pay for them can go up, but at the same time one has to be realistic that attitudes have to change and seriously a lot of Singaporeans need to realise that our world is becoming borderless now.</p>
              <p>Anyway the Chinese are not just invading Singapore. They are invading everywhere. Even in Canada, for Maple Leaf Foods, with their major restructuring, most of the traders I deal with now are PRC and mind you they are very sharp traders and write better English than most Singaporeans in SgF</p>
