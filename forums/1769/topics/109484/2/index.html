            <div class='col-md body'>Eric, I'm sure that for the next few years at least, you'll be very busy trying to establish your career.  I get that from my chats with you.  However, I'm also sure that when the opportunity arrives, you will gladly jump into charity work.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I've got a small piece of great news to share with all of you!  About six months ago, I applied to be a Befriender with Club Rainbow.  This is a charitable organisation that matches volunteers to sick and dying children and their families and what you do is to promise to visit them and provide whatever assistance that's needed, be a friend to the child, and help out in Club Rainbow activities.  I got worried when I didn't hear from them for months and re-sent my application twice and then ...  yay!!!  just heard from them over the Christmas period.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I prayed that the Snr Nurse Manager would allow me days off on the two training days for new befrienders and today, when I approached her, she agreed!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  So, after February, I shall be a full-fledged volunteer Befriender matched with a kid living near my neighbourhood!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I know a lot of folks are not able to handle the issue of death well but in my job, I've learnt to cope with it.  I'm still in touch with a few families of patients under my care who died and it just goes to show that out of one's death, it's possible for something beautiful to grow out of it.  Death is not the be-all and end-all.  Plus, I think I'm psychologically and emotionally strong enough to handle being with these sick and dying kids and I just hope that in my own little way, I can bring a little sunshine and rainbow in their lives.<br><br>I can't wait to befriend my very first little friend.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
