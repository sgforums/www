              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">One of my friend's husband has been unfaithful to her. She came crying
              to me yesterday, and was understandably hurt. What was less
              understandable was that her vitriol was reserved mostly for the girl
              her husband cheated with, whom she called all manner of names, cursed
              her with poison reserved for serial murderers, and wished a fate worse
              than death on her.<br><br>Although
              I did not say this to her but instead made all the right, sympathetic
              noises, in my heart, I thought that was unfair. I have thought about
              this often before - if my boyfriend or husband were to cheat on me,
              what would my reaction be? <br><br>Who would I hate more? My partner or the third party?<br><br>I
              always try to distinguish myself from the unthinking caveman/cavewoman
              who are apt to have knee-jerk reactions. I have observed that most of
              these neanderthals tend to reserve their hatred for the third-parties.
              Guys would seek out and try to maim/kill the other guy. Girls will do
              the same, sometimes with worse if more subtle vengeance. However, as in
              all my actions, as an aristocrat, whenever Peasants do something in
              droves, my alarm bells tell me something must be wrong.<br><br>The
              truth is that rationally speaking, I have decided that most of my
              vengeance should be exacted on my own partner. Morally, he has made an
              obligation, a commitment to me. If he were my husband, this obligation
              would be even more solemn, in the form of a vow, taken in Church, and
              backed up by the law. The other girl on the other hand, if she's a
              stranger to me, has no moral obligation to me, much less a legal one.
              What hatred do I have for her? It takes two hands to clap, two to tango
              - all those cliches are true. She may be a conniving bitch, but my
              husband would be no angel either. In addition, he has a moral,
              emotional obligation to me. The act of betrayal was perpetrated by him,
              not by the other girl.<br><br>The only exception to this scenario would
              be if the girl were my friend as well. In this case, moral blame should
              be apportioned to both parties, vis-a-vis me, as one would have
              betrayed love, and the other friendship. Yet, again in this scenario,
              it would be unfair to wholly blame the third party, as unthinking human
              beings are wont to do.<br><br>Moral theorists say that the best moral
              decisions are made in cool times, when primitive feelings do not cloud
              the head. I hope I remember this if ever I were to be cheated on.</span></p>

              <p>when it come to guy, thing is abit different. some guys cheat due to lust. But when a women cheat, itis more of a emotional thing. And there is no returning once a woman cheat. But when a guy cheat out of lust, he blame himself for not standing up to his urge &amp; come home with his tail in between his leg. Where else women.... they left their nest and start making new nest with that other guy... :P</p>
