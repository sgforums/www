              <p>Lets see.  Its old news but I was reminded of it just now when I gave my divorce papers to my tenants to scan and send to HDB for the flat sale procedures.</p>
              <p>Reasons why I was written as cheating:</p>
              <p>1. He begged me not to let his age old mother knows that it is I divorcing him because she is old, weak &amp; sickly.</p>
              <p>2. I was given a choice to act righteous or I can take the blame and buy overr my flat.</p>
              <p>3. His new g//f was pregnant and he wanted to divorce fast. (I didnt know that till much later, I only thought his was in need of money.)</p>
              <p>4. I have plenty of male friends, so it was easy to pick any to be the adulterer.</p>
