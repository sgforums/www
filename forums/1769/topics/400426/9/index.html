              <p>Ya. There is a person who had a tumour. Also last stage if I remember correctly. When it was diagnosed, he changed his diet immediately. For breakfast he'll have a cup of fruit/veg juice (by that, it is actually a blend of mostly veg and a bit of fruits) He just blends them using a blender and takes the pulp.</p>
              <p>Forgot what he takes for lunch. Either the fruit/veg blend or some veg i think.</p>
              <p>For dinner, he takes a little bit of rice with steamed chicken/fish.</p>
              <p>With this diet, his tumour actually decreased in size and he is still alive.</p>
              <p>He published a book with his diet and the different type of veg blend for different types of illnesses ... its a chinese book, so whoever is interested, i can lend it to you all.</p>
              <p>I tried his veg blend. tastes horrible. haha</p>
