              <p>Two years ago, my CO extended our ICT by one day for 'Battalion
              Cohesion Day' at a SAFRA club where we were all 'encouraged' to
              bring our families.</p>
              <p>To ensure our attendance, we could only outpro at the end of the
              Battalion Cohesion Day.... he actually made the outpro staff turn
              up at the SAFRA club with the outprocessing machines at the end of
              the day.</p>
