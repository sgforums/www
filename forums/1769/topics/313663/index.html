              <p>okay.. for the past few months, i've been complaining about all the "suay kuan" and "chao kuan" of my boss... let's all kpkb together... i start with mine:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>says one thing and immediately contradicts herself (flip-flop rate in the teraflop range)</li>
              <li>sycophancy before substance.. so fake even the clerical staff can't stand it</li>
              <li>tells you to do something like take time off yet makes you do stuff which will make it impossible to take the time off</li>
              <li>takes on more jobs than we can handle (then says it's an honour that the big boss "trusts us")</li>
              <li>ambushes people just before lunch or knocking off and drones at us or gives us work to do so that we are stuck in office (she bloody sat on the work for the whole day)</li>
              <li>"let's discuss this" lasts for 2 hours when "do this" takes 1 second</li>
              </ul>
              <p>there are more.. so much more..</p>
              <p>most of her past subordinates hate her with a passion</p>

              <p>ever had a boss which spends more time screwing with your document than actually amending it?</p>
              <p>i give you an example:</p>
              <p><em>remove comma from 3 line, replace with "and"<br>4th line, replace "spread" with "dissemination"<br>6th line, use italics on the word "recommend"</em></p>
              <p>or actually go into the bloody document and then use strikethroughs, colour and other things just to "amend" the document needing you to clean up the whole thing afterwards?</p>
              <p>it took her about 20x more effort doing all that than actually just typing over the bloody document!!</p>
              <p>then it becomes a huge mess which is unreadable and i have to clean up again!!</p>

              <p>My boss has the habit of asking us to write memo on his behalf, print the hardcopy out for him to sign, scan into pdf document and then email it out when a simple email will do! Its not as if the contents of the memo is so important that it has to be on memo format!</p>
              <p>He also prints a whole stack of stuff for filing and throw it out to us to file for him.</p>
              <p>Every morning, he'll ask us go into his office, he'll go through all the items he asked u to do and the status. If its not done yet, he'll say "why so slow??" Even though it might be something that he threw out in the evening lik 6pm.. immediately next morning he'll ask for it.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>haha my boss, he's really one of his kind.</p>
              <p>He will ask me what is his msn email account for the 999th time.</p>
              <p>He will call back to office and ask me to pass the message to another colleague to call the customer to call him and he said it was urgent. He just couldn't ask me for the number to make the call himself.</p>

              <p>my another female boss also like that. She likes to call you into her office JUST when you're about to leave office. You can stand there carrying your bag .. she'll just continue to talk and talk and talk..</p>
              <p>But sometimes I just tell her, I got appt, need to rush off then i go off.. can't be bothered..</p>

              <p>what pissed me off is that she spent the whole morning talking nonsense with the dy director.. and dunno who else.. and doing rubbish (i know.. i was in the cc list of email crap)</p>
              <p>thing i also don't understand is that she's not well.. she's had a persistent cough for about 2 months.. refuses to see a doctor.. and somewhere in there, she pengsan for about 5 days.. still refuse to see a doctor about it..</p>
              <p>her spine is screwed from osteoporosis.. and full of bone spurs.. and has shifted so that she needs an operation.. what does she do after her MRI which ended at 4:15pm? she rushes back to work!! and only gives us what has been at her inbox for 2 days at 5:40pm...</p>
              <p>what the hell is wrong with people like her??</p>
              <p>thing is, according to a few people who were from the other side of the merger, this is the culture of the management from their side...</p>
