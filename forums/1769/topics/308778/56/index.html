              <p>Went out to the back to hang laundry and oh my gosh, that irritating Greek woman in the neighbouring house just wouldn't shut up!  She has a low-pitched, gruffy voice like a man's, and she was shouting at her children, and then criticising her husband and finally broke out into an argument with him.  The thing is, I couldn't hear the man's meek voice, only her rat-tat-tatt'ing away like some merciless machine gun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Horrible, noisy creature!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She reminds me of a few divorced (and remarried) doctors in our ward.  One is undergoing a divorce and he's lost the plot and has become very moody and tempestuous, throwing tantrums around.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif">  Two others have recently remarried, and have become so much happier and chirpier.   One of them was Mr Scrooge reincarnated before his divorce was through but now, he's like a completely new man!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Art imitates real life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png">  Some of the things I encounter whilst at work just leave me dumbfounded!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Yesterday, an Ivana Trump look-alike stepped into the room of a patient and when the other two ladies left, she asserted authority by announcing to me that she is the partner of the patient.  The other two ladies are his ex-wife and daughter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  Wah... can co-exist so 'peacefully' one?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, towards the end of the shift, when she exposed her forked tail and raised hell, I guessed the other two ladies must have been mortified into submission to Her Royal B!tchiness!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">  She was kicking up so much fuss over a stupid urinary bag, not knowing much, but yet trying to act smart and know-it-all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  It was so amusing, so funny, and yet not.  She was so aggressive, I ended up getting the Team Leader to deal with her.  It was kinda entertaining hearing them fight it out with my Team Leader accusing her at one stage to stop being verbally abusive!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>Pathetic life... nothing better to do on a Sunday evening, then fuss over a urine bag!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>point about spam: it's only 9:02am now..</p>
              <p>she's replied to the same person twice and wrote to me once.. because that person (same type as my boss - they were from the same department in the past) generated 2 emails.. one to tell my boss that he is okay with her request and will be assigning 2 officers in his section to help us check up on a few records periodically on request.. that one is cc'ed to the 2 officers and myself.. and the other one is to inform the two officers...</p>
              <p>so she has to generate three...</p>
              <p>write once to thank the boss of the two officers.. (cc'ed to all)</p>
              <p>write another to thank the two officers... (cc'ed to all)</p>
              <p>write another to tell me to proceed with the work.. (again, cc'ed to all)</p>
              <p>each time, the same stack emails going back and forth, they do not delete that hugeass attachment...</p>
