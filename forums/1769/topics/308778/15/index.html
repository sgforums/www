              <p>btw.. you are trying to create additional eddys in the flow in
              order to "mix" a few fluids?  another concept the other way
              around has been done by someone who created fountains.. in order to
              reduce the eddys, he's "polarised" the water by putting something
              akin to a huge bunch of drinking straws into a pipe so that the
              water is forced into moving only in 1 direction.. the result is a
              stream of water from the fountain which seems clear as glass and
              transparent as hell.. the result also enables him to "illuminate"
              the water like it was an optic fibre...</p>

              <p>Well, basically right now I'm doing a few more sets of experiments involving 600mm-long springs of varying pitches. Basically the idea is that a spring in a tube would mix two liquids together by imparting a rotational component to the flow - that's what I'm investigating.</p>
              <p>I actually finished the main bulk of the experiments using 300mm springs over the December holidays and for much of January.... but then, my prof was pleased enough with the results to ask me to further my investigation into longer springs....</p>
              <p>That in itself was pretty difficult to prepare. Had to prepare some new equipment, new springs, and such. And some other equipment had to be (quite literally) scrounged from junkpiles or begged from other labs.... seriously, my lab is poorly-equipped.</p>
              <p>And frankly speaking, much of my equipment is jury-rigged.... you really should see how I had to fix the green laser . It's pretty much placed on top of a cardboard box and held down with duct tape. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Oh well.... at least I can take heart in knowing that my prof's a sensible guy..... he doesn't expect me to do more than what he thinks is reasonably achievable.</p>

              <p>hey.. inventiveness should be a plus-point in your experiment..</p>
              <p>instead of getting expensive purpose-built equipment, you used cheap, cobbled-together parts which worked as well.. that's part of being an engineer.. not just being able to build something, but being able to build something that is practical..</p>
              <p>the Germans built the best tank in WWII - The Tiger Tank..</p>
              <p>but the Soviets built the practical tank - T34..</p>
              <p>sometimes, that's what engineering is about.. unless you work in places like Ferrari or Bugatti <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Yes, that's a good thing. Because my boss is having a major disagreement with that SVP and its making things difficult for me, because I have to deal with SVP. They fight behind their computers, shooting arrows all over and ultimately, the ppl who kena those arrows are us because we're in the "front line"</p>
