            <div class='col-md body'>Was reading in the papers today that in the UK, a promising black youth was killed in an unprovoked attack, just because he is not white.<br><br>I have always wondered what causes these deep rooted hatred in a person, towards another human being, just because the other party is of a different race. I am sure that everyone of us would have faced some form of discrimination in one way or another, or we have discriminated someone due to their race.<br><br>I think that it is only human (not saying that it is right), to hold some stereotypes, either due to experience or lack of understanding of cultures. However, to most, I believe it is more of a sweeping statement and generalisation of matters instead of hating and condemning a whole race to the extent that you feel motivated enough to commit murder.<br><br>Sometimes, I think the other motivator for discrimination is jealousy. Jealous because the other race is perceived to be much more successful in your own country and they are amongst the rich, while your own people is struggling to make a living. I think the closest examples would be the persecution of the Jews and the attack of Indonesian Chinese in Indonesia.<br><br>I wonder how can someone be so blinded by the fact that their own future lies in their own palms and they need to work towards something to succeed. Instead they grow bitter and jealous and start hating someone else for their own misery. I guess it is easier to blame someone, your fate than trying to do something about it.<br><br>To me racial harmony these days is much much more important than in the past because the world is getting smaller. It is so easy to gain access to another culture via the internet and travel is getting cheaper as well. Of course it won't be an easy path.<br><br>I think, the key to racial harmony and peace here is acceptance and understanding. You can never get the other party to respect you if you try to force your culture and ideals onto them. Then again, sometimes it is just plain hate, because you look different.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Racism exist everywhere in the world. Like it or not, somehow everybody is a racist in someways, be it consciously, subconsciously, or even ignorantly. People are mostly judgemental, as in we are brought up to judge people instantly. To categorise them according to their built, skin color, nationality, or even religion. FOr me, i think its a form of defence mechanism, that is to protect ourselves. Take for example, if you were to see a black man with dreadlocks entering the lift with you in the middle of the night, surely u get all tensed up, cos u naturally perceived yourself to be weaker physically, but crucially, you judge all blacks to be street hoodlums, to be violent,etc.. Conversely, if it was a white male, the emotions will be different. All these are through the media, tv, etc. In the past, movies always protray the Russians as the baddies, then it was the blacks, then the chinese, and now its the middle-eastern, and that in a way shapes our mindset. Through all these means of influences, we are affected, whether you believe it or not. It doesnt help that certain people, like the blacks are more likely to get involved in crimes, drugs etc.. I'm not saying that all blacks are like that, but if you compare the percentages, then somehow the perspection is explainable. Of course, another fact is jealousy. Like you mentioned the May riots in Indonesia, where they took it up on the Chinese. The Chinese made up less than 1 percent of the total population, yet they control like over 90 percent of the economy.. Whose fault is it?? Its certainly not the Chinese. The Malays there have absolutely no drive to succeed.. THey procreate in abundance, train the kids to beg, while the parents lie in the shade of nearby trees. THeir mentality instilled in them, will pass down from generations to generations, and poverty will stay with them forever. so when given a chance, they put the blame on the Chinese. Most people never look at their own faults, but only pinpoint the blame on others, and somehow, its always the same old group We cannot eradicate racism completely, but we can minimise it. If i wanna bring one up, i can do so easily... "Why is Taufik cast as a pizza boy in his acting debut"... Surely it screams racism... Its spells racism, but there's also an element of truth. Check the statistics.  Also, when we perceive others to be lower in social standing than us, racism creeps in too.... Take a look at how our locals treat the foreign workers like the Bangalas, Philipinos, Indonesians, Indians, etc....  They have no respect for them. Have you ever treated them as your equal. I for one, had never ever hesistate to smile and say a big thank you to them, when they clear my plates, wash my corridors.. Have you?? Start today, and slowly but surely, our future generations will not turn out to be bigots, like the many found in singapore.. Thats sad, but thats the truth. Trust me.</div>
