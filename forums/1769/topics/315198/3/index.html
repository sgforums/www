              <p>Vanilla is fragrant mah!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>In any case, it was donkey  years ago since I last got a whiff of HL milk.  We're talking about more than a decade ago, because Beng used to drink HL milk so it's an olfactory association of sorts. </p>
              <p>Me, I used to be Lactose Intolerant but I think because I kept drinking Big M's Skim Chocolate Milk, I somehow developed less of a reaction over time.  I still do get reactions, but just much milder.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>BTW, bloody Big M is stinging on chocolate because their milk not only used to taste fuller-bodied, it used to taste more chocolatey too.  If they dilute it any further, I'll just stick to buying soya bean milk and just add milo + chocolate powder into it!  Lately, I've been diluting Milo + chocolate powder in a little bit of hot water and then adding it into the milk because there's the chocolate colour, but no taste of chocolate!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p>Organic food? </p>
              <p>'A Current Affair', a local TV program on Ch 9 over  here in Melbourne, did look into organic food a while back.  Here's what they discovered :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="title">
              <h1>Organic food not healthier, say experts</h1>
              </div>
              <div class="line">

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By Damian Murphy</strong></p>
              <p>Researchers at Sydney University have found organic food is not
              nutritionally superior to other fresh produce, prompting questions
              about what kind of value this growing industry offers consumers.</p>
              <p>Mother of two, Sharon Walsh, began buying organic produce for her first child.</p>
              <p>"For me it was very much about 'If I'm going to be a good mum, I should get the best quality I can'."</p>
              <p>But she says, over time, it became clear the only difference between organic food and other fresh produce was the price.</p>
              <p>"I didn't smell or taste any difference and I just thought I was
              paying a lot of money. I kind of questioned why, so I just went back to
              the normal fresh produce."</p>
              <p>Nutritionist Catherine Saxelby is another sceptic of organic food.</p>
              <p>"The studies haven't shown that organic is superior to regular produce," Catherine says.</p>
              <p>Both sides of this debate agree though that organic food is more expensive for consumers.</p>
              <p>"Yep, you do pay more," says organic grocer Pierce Cody. "I say to
              people, not flippantly, that you pay the price now or pay the price
              later."</p>
              <p>We went shopping and found a basket of apples, bread, chicken, eggs
              and milk cost $24.70 at a supermarket. The very same basket of goods
              cost us $42.40 at Pierce's organic grocery store, Macro.</p>
              <p>The organic food industry is a $350 million industry in Australia and it's supporters say it is better for you.</p>
              <p>"Over eight percent of people who are diagnosed with cancer are prescribed an immediate organic diet."</p>
              <p>"Now there's something in that, you've got to think about that," says Pierce.</p>
              <p>"The nutrition value has been shown, in a lot of research, that it's
              much higher in an orange, for example, compared to a chemically-farmed
              orange."</p>

              <p>dude its not about the taste or the nutrition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its about not eating the harmful chemicals from pesticides which might give you cancer. Of course, with good taste and nutrition, it might give you even more of an incentive to buy organic.</p>
