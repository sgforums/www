Your loyalty can never be doubted. You are quite honest and  sincere when it comes to your attitude towards working. You are a very simple  person, indeed. Absolutely hassle free, humble and down-to-earth!! That explains  the reason why your friends cling on to you! You have a good taste for clothes.  If your wardrobe is not updated with what is trendy, you sure are depressed.<br>Popular and easy-going. You have a little group of dignified friends, all of  them being quality-personified.<br><br>If you are a Slug: Always up to some  sort of a mischief! The mischievous gleam in your eyes is what makes you so cute  and attractive to everyone.<br>You are an extremely fun-to-be-with kind of person.  No wonder people seek for your company and look forward to include you for all get-together's.<br>However, you are sensitive which is a drawback. People need to  select their words while talking to you. If someone tries to fiddle around and play with words while dealing with you, it is enough to invite your wrath.<br>God  bless the person then!<br><br>If you are a Cockroach : Quite contradictory to your name, you  are a peace loving person. You best try to avoid a situation wherein you are required to fight. An outdoor person, you dislike sitting at one place for a  long duration. You are a born leader, and have it in you how to tactfully derive work from people. You love being loved, and when you receive your share of limelight from someone, you are all theirs!!!! Well, well... hence some people  could even take an advantage, flatter you to the maximum and get their work  done. So be careful.....<br><br>If you are a Parasite : An extremely  lovable, adorable person, sometimes shy, with a passion for quick wit. At times,  you prefer quietness. You love exploring various things and going into depth of  each thing. Under normal circumstances you're cool but when given a reason to,  you are like a volcano waiting to erupt. You're a fashion bird. People look forward to you as an icon associated with fashion. Basically, you mingle along freely but don't like talking much to strangers. People feel very easy in your company. You observe care in choosing your friends.<br><br>If you are a   Skunk : You are near to  perfect and nice at heart. The<br>examples of your kindness are always circulated  in groups of people. You, too, love peace. You wouldn't like to retaliate even  to a person who is in the wrong. You are loved due to this. You do not wish to  talk behind one's back. People love the way you always treat them. You can give, give and give love, and the best part is that you do not expect it back in return. You are generous enough. Seeing things in a practical light is what remains the best trait of you guys.<br><br>If you are a  Bullfrog   : You symbolize a  very happy-go-lucky approach in<br>life. Whatever the surroundings may be, grim or  cheerful, you remain unaffected. In fact, you spread cheer wherever you go. You  are the leader of your group of friends and good at consoling people in their  times of need. You dislike hypocrisy and tend to shirk away from hypocrites.<br>They can never be in your good books, no matter what. You are very methodical and organized in your work. No amount of mess, hence, can ever encompass you.  Beware, it is easy for you to fall in love....<br><br>If you are a  Snake  : You are  mysterious. You are someone who can handle pressure with ease, and can handle  any atmosphere without going berserk.<br>You can be mean at times, and love to  gossip with your selected group.<br>Very prim and proper. You like all situations  and things to be in the way you desire, which, sometimes is not possible. As a  result, you may lose out in some relationships. But otherwise, you love to help  people out from difficult and tight spots when they really need you.<br><br>If  you are a Ape : Very impatient and  hyper!!! You want things to be done as quick as possible. At heart, you are  quite simple and love if you  are the center of attraction. That way, you people  are unique. You would like to keep yourself safe from all the angles. Shall your  name be dragged or featured in any sort of a controversy, you then go all panicky. Therefore, you take your precautions from the very beginning. When you  foresee anything wrong, your sixth sense is what saves you from falling in  traps.<br>Quite a money minded bunch you people are!!<br></div>
