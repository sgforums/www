            <div class='col-md body'>Changing the carpets in the hospital wards, but not testing beforehand to see if the selected carpet is suitable for hospital wards!  They ended up purchasing carpets that made it really hard to push equipment and beds and trolleys around!  Heck, even the IV pole with wheels is tough to push around now!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>As a result, Occupational Health and Safety had to issue a memo saying nurses are not to push beds around now but instead, they had to train existing porters to use specially purchased motorised equipment called Gzunders, to fit it under the beds, and then push them around.  Each Gzunder costs about A$1K and now, Radiology's employees are unhappy because Radiology refuses to purchase any Gzunders and the porters are having a really tough time pushing the beds around.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> They are already openly talking about "going on strike" to protest this.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Potentially, we're looking at lots of medical claims for backaches and related 'injuries' and strains from this.<br><br>Recently, when the ICU team came to transport my patient to the ICU, they realised that they couldn't use the Gzunder anyways because if the Gzunder is put in place, the doctor cannot stand at the head of the bed anymore, and since the Air Viva was being used to bag oxygen to the patient, that can't do!<br><br>Nurses are also really frustrated, because we might be barred from pushing beds, but pushing the patients around on wheelchairs and commode chairs just got more difficult!!  The patients in one room commented that the management is so stupid and "ridiculous" when they saw us nurses huffing and puffing trying to push a commode chair and the chair barely moved.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   If you have a patient of generous proportions sitting on it, you'd better pray your brute strength gets you to the bathroom on time before they stain / soil the new carpets!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think the impedence is due to the cross-weave pattern.  Apparently, the old carpets were weaved in one direction, so there's little resistance.<br><br>You'd think that the building planning folks running the hospital would have known better!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

              <p>My workplace is notorious for being poorly-stocked in medical supplies, but today, we have hit an all-time low!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"> </p>
              <p>- Spirit Swabs - nowhere to be seen!!!  All of us were walking around the whole ward, opening all the counter drawers, in search of spirit swabs!!!  WHICH blardy hospital does not provide spirit swabs to the wards?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png">  In the end, I had to ration what few I had left in my little bag that I carry slung across my shoulder! </p>
              <p>- 10 ml and 20 ml syringes dangerously low in supply!  Again, nurses had to go around to the different hubs to grab a few for use!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>- 19 G non-bevelled needles - Haven't seen them for such a long time that I'm wondering if they are a figment of my imagination.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>- 19 G needles - Awaiting supply. </p>
              <p>- Duoderm wafers - Non-existent</p>
              <p>- Baxter Pump drip sets - fight for the remaining few!</p>
              <p>- 250 mls Normal Saline bags - order up your own from the Pharmacy, and then hide them from the other nurses.  :P</p>
              <p>- Medicine Cups - you're lucky if you can find one.</p>
              <p>- Tegaderm with Pad - Dream on!</p>
              <p>- Normal Saline for use in Dressings - haven't seen these for 1.5 weeks liao!  Had to improvise and use the N/S for I/V! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I cannot believe I am not working in a hospital in a 3rd world country!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">   All of us are frustrated to the max!  When I told a Team Leader that it's really time to look into the stocking up of our hubs, she gave some blardy excuse about us not having settled in back in our ward yet (we had moved to share half a ward with another ward during christmas) and I curtly quipped, "Well, it's about high time we did because we cannot take care of the patients this way!" </p>

              <p>I've contracted a recycling company to come into the office and collect used papers for recycling. Even signed confidentiality contracts with them to ensure that the papers we send for recycling will be kept confidential.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Companies girls keeps insisting that they are already recycling. Using both side of the paper, tear them up and dumping them into waste paper basket when the paper is no longer needed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh....and here's the following excuses:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) We never need to do this.</p>
              <p>2) Confidential info on paper, cannot let others see</p>
              <p>3) We are already recyling by using both side of the paper.</p>
              <p>4) Bozz never say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No. 3 was their biggest excuse, but their current system of dumping in the trash, some garang guni uncle rammaging our trash and picking up papers for recycling in public view downstairs our office was such a glaring indication of our confidentiality, its so regret-able.</p>
