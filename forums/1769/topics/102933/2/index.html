The Singaporeans would be demanding, grouchy, and won't even return your greeting whilst the 'ang moh's are the ones who would greet them back with a smile and say 'thanks' for things that are being done for them.<br><br>Just look around you and it doesn't take long to spot a Singaporean who's verbally abusing a service staff, being unreasonable, complaining very loudly and just misbehaving.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I applaud the service staff in Singapore for putting up with all sorts of unreasonable behaviour and demands.

I also find the staff at Bossini and Giordano generally very cheerful and helpful.  Music Junction has staff who are also very approachable and helpful.  Citicab drivers and Tibs bus drivers in general are also friendly and cheerful.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I started this thread because I'm really sick and tired of seeing fellow Singaporeans abuse customer service personnel.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> It's time we gave credit where it's due.

And especially since she's from your church.<br><br>Sadly, I'm still a Christian but I've stopped going to church for a long long time already.  I couldn't stand the hypocrisy all around.  Once I switched careers and got on 'ground level' and got exposed to people from all walks of life, I saw more ugly Christians than I would care to and now, I cannot step into any church without having flashbacks of the bad behaviour and encounters.  Most of these Christians are very highly educated and they are very good at subtly threatening complaint letters if you don't do this or that for them.  They're very good at what I call 'verbal blackmailing'.<br><br>I know religion ought not be brought into this issue but the thing is, before you try to witness to the world, please look at your own behaviour.  So many of my colleagues who are non-Christians have been totally put off by the behaviour of so-called Christians.  Whenever some Christian colleagues try to witness to them now or invite them to any church events, they'll always say, 'Don't expect me to ever step into a church.  There must be so many nasty people in there!  We see them at work, it's enough already!"  We even had Pastors who fell ill and they and their family behaved worse than pagans.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>Totally agree with you...I too stopped going to church recently..its just really disheartening to see all the hipocrisy...no matter what actions speak louder than words and young christians could easily fall in their walk when they see such behaviour...I prefer to believe on my own in my own quiet ways now. Its a farce to be going to church.</div>
