            <div class='col-md body'>OK, tell you all one of the horror stories of which I have a huge cabinet full of!  haha!<br><br>Once, I had to tend to a traffic accident victim wheeled in straight from A&amp;E in an extremely critical condition.  He was an 'active bleeder', in extremely bad shape.  We were all struggling hard to stabilise him and arrest bleeding, there were doctors of different specialties, nursing staff, and others, all going in and out of him room, trying to rescue him because he was tethering on the edge of death.  Suddenly, his relative stepped in and I gave him a quick update because I was trying to arrange blood transfusions for that guy and so I kept my answers short and told him that I'm sorry but I'll have to talk to him later because I need to do some more stuff for that patient.  And guess what?  That crappy man said, 'I want to see your Supervisor!  You are so rude!'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So, next time, I'll stop and talk to you and do all the sweet sweet PR stuff, dripping honey and saccharine, whilst the poor patient has no one to tend to him.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   DOH!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

I'm in retail too &amp; I've served all kinds of customers b4.  Even if the service is gd.. who bothers abt writing letters? How many of us wrote more complimentary den complaint letters? Yes, as a service provider, it is expected of us to provide the best for customers but dat does not mean u can throw ur $$$ or cards at us.  &amp; I do agree dat malay customers r nicer.. less demanding &amp; friendlier too. Its the same like having them as ur neighbours, they r more chinchai,very kampung style.. haha =P   R we chinese over-demanding? Y r we reflecting such attitude wherever we go?</div>

I do sometimes get frustrated at service staff but I don't complain, I just try to bear with it unless it's really unreasonable.  And then again, I never kick up a big fuss about it.  I may not be happy with a particular service staff but all the same, I don't want to ruin her rice bowl either.<br><br></div>

A guy in front of my ex yelled out to the poor girl "Oi! Hurry up lah!".<br><br>The poor girl got even more frantic &amp; tried to do things right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Luckily my ex saved her day by scolding the cao ah-beng that it wasn't her fault that she was a bit slow... can't he see that it was her first day &amp; can't he be more patient &amp; polite???

They'll end up spending to much time and resources doing 'glossy PR work' that it eats into the time to do their REAL job!!<br><br>The army also cannot and should not ever become a 'service industry'.  I shudder to think of how effective a 'softened' army will be when it comes to the crunch.<br><br>The medical field should not be a 'service industry'.  We do not run hotels and our priorities should be to tend to whoever is sickest and needs the most medical attention, NOT bring blankets and hot water to that A1 patient or that C class patient whose relatives blast their mouths off faster than the US missiles can fly.<br><br>I'm so glad there are folks who think the same way that I do - that it's usually a case of overstressed people transferring their anger, frustrations and stress to us.  All that education, and they can't even have proper control over their anger and stress issues.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Shame.<br><br>I wish people here would realise that the customer sure ain't right all the time cause sometimes, when you have a**holes on the other side of the counter, they sure can't be right!  This issue encroaches on human rights as well.  Next time some big developed country like the US of A starts to criticise our human rights, think of this.  It does not have to be blatant slavery or making little kids work at brick factories that constitutes human rights violations... to a certain extent, treating fellow humans like they're worthless and 2nd-class or worse, is also a violation of sorts.  In developed countries, they'd probably tell their yelling and screaming customers to please get a grip on their anger, cool down and we'll attend to you later.  Customer service staff are there to help us, not for us to abuse.<br><br>But of course, in a society where the highly educated and working professionals constantly end up abusing their maids, it's gonna be kinda hard for them to grasp this simple concept.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
