            <div class='col-md body'>There are so many complaints of bad service in Singapore all the time but I wonder... have you ever stopped to wonder why?<br><br>I remember a series of correspondence in The Straits Times a while back where an SIA passenger was complaining about the hostesses giving better service to the 'ang moh's and one very brave hostess wrote back to say that it's because the 'ang moh's are more polite to them, respect them, and treat them better.  The Singaporeans would be demanding, grouchy, and won't even return your greeting whilst the 'ang moh's are the ones who would greet them back with a smile and say 'thanks' for things that are being done for them.<br><br>Just look around you and it doesn't take long to spot a Singaporean who's verbally abusing a service staff, being unreasonable, complaining very loudly and just misbehaving.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I applaud the service staff in Singapore for putting up with all sorts of unreasonable behaviour and demands.  It's time we recognise them for their hard work!<br><br>The customer service staff at the various telecommunications companies like SingTel and StarHub really deserve special mention for their never-failing patience.  I also find the staff at Bossini and Giordano generally very cheerful and helpful.  Music Junction has staff who are also very approachable and helpful.  Citicab drivers and Tibs bus drivers in general are also friendly and cheerful.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I started this thread because I'm really sick and tired of seeing fellow Singaporeans abuse customer service personnel.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> It's time we gave credit where it's due.  Also, chew on this - are you a good customer / client?<br><br>If you're a service staff, feel free to share your woes on this thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, once, when I was queuing at the causeway counter at the Singapore side to return home after visiting Malaysia, there was this Singaporean man in front of me who yelled at the counter officer when he announced that his PC had crashed.

How come you cannot do your work properly?!'<br><br>This man then looked around to see if there were people in the queues nodding their approval or something.  I was immediately behind him and I gave him a huge frown and a very black face like this -&gt;  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  Shame on that kinda gangster behaviour!<br><br>Anyways, applause to the officer, he was assertive and he explained to the man that he is not responsible for the computer's sudden crash and no one can predict that so would he please calm down and join another queue.<br><br>If that man had continued being rude to the officer, I would have said something in defence of the officer... then maybe I would kena punched and have to -&gt;  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  for a few weeks.  hahaha!!!<br><br>Seriously, I just cannot stand people bullying others.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Some customer wants to bargain for the seek of bargaining one and if you don't give her at all, she not happy. So, give her $1-2 more just to make her happy.<br><br>Then, in future, don't give her so much discount off at first. Then let her bargain it down. This way, she happy thinking she got what she want. You also happy get your business plus happy customer.<br><br>Most customer are not so appreciative of the automatic discount one, because they usually think that everyone gets the same discount.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Y'know, in Europe, US and other developed countries, the service staff do not tolerate sh it from customers.  If you try your nonsense with them, they'll just look you in the eye and tell you firmly not to treat them that way.  They're allowed to be assertive and they don't stand to be treated like 2nd class people by customers and I think that's the way it should be.  Service staff are people and nobody has the right to shout at them, treat them like servants, talk down to them, threaten complaints so they can get what they want, and other obnoxious things.<br><br>Social finesse, people!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I have decided... next time I'm in line and someone shouts at a service staff or acts all hoity-toity, I'm going to stand up for the poor bullied staff and say something in their defence.  I've seen one ang moh and one local do it before and afterwards, I thought... WHOA... heroes!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Time we take a stand against socially unacceptable behaviour!</div>
