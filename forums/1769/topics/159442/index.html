By rejecting the applicants because of a mistake that they committed many years ago, I wonder what message is being sent to the people.<br><br>The Yellow Ribbon Project has raised much awareness amongst the general public. However it is still unclear if more employers are willing to hire those with a criminal record.<br><br>If the organisers themselves are not carrying out what they promote, then the campaign will continue to have minimal impact.<br><br>Tan Hui Ling Yvonne (Miss)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The concerns are genuine and I can't deny that, but there many ex-offenders who repent their crimes and just want to get on with life after serving their punishment.<br><br>The stigma involves both the offenders' criminal records and the discrimination that the people they interact with have. I believe the latter is what the campaign is targeted at, so that they can integrated back into society (in suitable jobs, of course...no one's calling for the end of criminal records.). Otherwise, there's a chance they could return to old ways to suport themselves or to "escape" the harsh world.<br><br>If an agency with the government organises such a campaign, then naturally we'd expect them to practise what they preach. Otherwise, they'll simply look like hypocrites - we might as well not have any campaign. If we want to be fussy, then at least employ those who have stayed out of trouble for a certain period of time.<br><br>Anyway, they are employing a certain type of "offender" -- didn't Senior Minister Goh say that gay civil servants have been employed?<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ilovemyrolex:</div><div class="quote_body">honestly, if there are no stigma to being a criminal, would it render our Justice system irrelevant?<br><br>Even when there is a stigma associated with being an ex-offender, there are still 11,000 of them turning over every year.
