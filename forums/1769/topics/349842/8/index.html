              grain we get only one pound back as meat. However, that 16 pounds
              of grain has 21 times more calories and eight times more protein
              than a pound of hamburger</em></span></span></p>

              meaning that just 10 pounds of steak is more than my entire
              household use of water for one full year. This ignores the
              staggering levels of pollution from both meat and dairy propagation
