              <p>You do.  I've been reading your posts and you're overly concerned about how your replacement will perform.  To be honest, that's really not something you should waste time worrying about.  As long as you have done your part in handing over, whether or not the replacement performs well or liak bo kiu is really something between her and her bosses.  Not your pasah liao! </p>

              <p>i don't see what's wrong with unpaid jobs/internships. it's just
              part time anyway. and i don't desperately need the money (k, this
              is not really true). i just really want something to do.
              volunteering in singapore (based on the few stories i've heard) is
              shit because people (non-volunteers in the org, people running the
              org) don't respect you etc...and i know in certain hotels, they let
              people do internships in the kitchen for a couple of months. but
              they don't get paid.</p>

              <p>Most 'Japanese' restaurants here aren't really authentic.  One gets a bit tired of trying, only to get disappointed and wasting one's money so I've given up and stopped trying.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  However, I seem to have taken note of three Japanese restaurants that appear to be pretty authentic so sometime soon, I'll probably drag one of my friends to go try them out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"></p>
              <p>You should see what a hopeless basket case I am when it comes to Prima food packs!  Everytime I cook Mee Siam or Laksa using the Prima packs, I tell myself to ration so that I can enjoy over two days but I always end up eating them over two meals for the entire day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>After working here, I don't think it'll be easy transitioning back to Singapore's working conditions.  There's hardly any employee rights.  I like working here where there are strict anti-bullying policies and Unions.  Things aren't exactly peachy here all the time but I feel a bit more 'secure'  with strong and effective union backing and workplace laws.  Australia is huge on workplace safety.  Employers also do not dare to exploit their employees because they will end up in hot soup! </p>

              <p>maybe the bigger possum was killed off by the smaller one when

              <p>No injuries..... </p>
              <p>Initially we thought it was killed by our neighbour's cat but there wasn't any sign of injuries etc.....  We were short of doing an autopsy on her though! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>unpaid internship when it comes to working in the kitchen is not
              that uncommon i think. especially higher class ones. but really,
              being underpaid etc is not that uncommon at all in north america.
              especially in smaller companies. sure, canada has lots of laws
              about this. but since when do people follow them. there are always
              loopholes.</p>

              <p>Well, over here, as far as I know, it's illegal to flout such rules and employers can really get into serious legal trouble.  The minimum wage guidelines are strictly implemented.  That is, unless one is an illegal immigrant working in one of those dodgy organisations that Immigration is always after.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>I'm surprised that Canada is lax about it...</p>
