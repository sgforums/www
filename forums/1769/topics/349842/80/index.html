              <p>then i asked for a fire-axe at the door in case the bloody lock
              malfunctions.. they said having an axe there would be dangerous if
              people decide to use it to hurt other people..</p>
              <p>actually i think they're afraid people will steal it..
              ahahahaha</p>
              <p>anyway, the bloody AED is going to haunt them.. last time i
              heard, the SCDF people were trying to make it mandatory

              <p>WTF..... an AED is idiot-proof. You can only administer shocks with it when prompted to by the machine. There is no manual override for it.</p>
              <p>I know, because I had AED training just before I ORDed. And really, all you have to do is to switch it on, plaster the electrodes over the patient's chest, and the AED does the rest.</p>
              <p>NUS has several AEDs placed around campus. I'm glad that the higher-ups decided on this instead of just saying 'Oh.... NUH is just next door!'</p>

              <p>WTF..... an AED is idiot-proof. You can only administer shocks with it when prompted to by the machine. There is no manual override for it.</p>
              <p>I know, because I had AED training just before I ORDed. And really, all you have to do is to switch it on, plaster the electrodes over the patient's chest, and the AED does the rest.</p>
              <p>NUS has several AEDs placed around campus. I'm glad that the higher-ups decided on this instead of just saying 'Oh.... NUH is just next door!'</p>

              <p>i know too.. because i was talking to the SCDF people and then the people who sold the AEDs.. you place the thing as a sheet over the torso.. and the computer takes over...</p>

              <p>KNN.. workaholic until Hospitalisation Leave for major spine surgery which could have crippled her, still come back to work.. what do you think?</p>
              <p>right now, i'm trying not to laugh.. badgering the other guy about really really unreasonably IDIOTIC thing like "post office" in chinese.. it was translated as é‚®æ”¿å±€ but she insist that the chinese must take into account those small places in shopping centres and whatnot.. because to her, the é‚®æ”¿å±€ is a "building" and those smaller ones in shopping centres are called something else.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>i'm wondering.. wtf!?? people are not as anal as she is!! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>btw.. major projects have been held up be her because she insisted that point form should have full-stops... and we got held up for 1 week while she go and see if she has to get approval for "change of script" of the bloody video..</p>
              <p>you should see the guy made to go talk to the vendor, he looked like he was going to get a stroke whenever she opened her mouth...</p>
              <p>just like now, she has amended her amendments about 6 times already...</p>
