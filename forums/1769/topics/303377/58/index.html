              <p>no..  can understand how you feel... long time ago, i did a
                      project with some dutch girls.. and they used to just go on and on
                      in dutch in front of me....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>of course the only time they spoke in english was to invite
                      these two american guys to one of their birthday party, in front of
                      me without inviting me. I mean its not like I wanted to go... but..
                      it is damn tough pretending i don't understand and its not my
                      business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes people just need a reminder but yes, it would have
                      been so much more considerate if they could do it without you
                      always needing to speak up for yourself. :(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I get annooyed w some of my group mates when they just
                      carry on a conversation in mandarin. Then i know it embarasses my
                      Malay group mate when I keep reminding them, so she just keeps
                      saying its okay. but.. its.. just.. inconsiderate lah. Sometimes i
                      forget too.. but :( tts not an excuse.</p>

              <p>You know what's best? My Maths C tutor would speak to the whole class in Chinese half the time. In the end, it felt almost as though I was in a Maths class which was being taught in Mandarin.</p>
              <p>One day I got fed up and took her aside. I told her, point blank, that I deserved to be taught in English and that she was marginalising me from the rest of the class.</p>
              <p>I pretty much threatened to complain to the principal (and to take the fight all the way to MOE if necessary) if she so much as breathed one more word of Mandarin in the middle of Math class.</p>
              <p>She got the hint and never spoke Mandarin again during official lessons.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking.... the introduction of Chinese characters in
              sgforums has me feeling sucky.</p>
              <p>I was the only non-Chinese in my class for four years straight
              (Sec 3 to JC2).</p>
              <p>I get reminded of the times when my classmates would all speak
              Chinese when we're in a group... and I would end up feeling left
              out and marginalised, wondering whether they're talking behind my
              back or something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Likewise, the possibility that I may get left out of discussions
              (or at least, be unable to follow them) in sgforums for the same
              reason doesn't sit well with me.</p>
              <p>Sigh.... maybe I'm just being selfish. If a lot of people
              benefit from it, then I guess it's not really my place to complain.

              <p>Oh... sorry...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  We'll try not to use them here but if we do, just ask us what it means and we'll just translate for you.  I'm sure you know by now, fudgie, that we mean you no harm in  here and anyways, you're a part of our group already!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>I had a recent falling out with my Filipino colleagues at work for a related issue.  One of them, whom I had considered my friend, started to distance herself inevitably by chatting in Tagalog all the time with a new Filipino female colleague.  That new colleague brazenly spoke loudly in Tagalog in the hospital ward, pissing off quite a few Aussie patients and colleagues, but no one has lodged an official complaint.  Anyways, this friend of mine had been very stressed out for weeks and one day, she snapped at me because I reminded her to do something essential that she had forgotten to do in her haste.  It was bad enough to have her shout at me but then, what made it worse was she turned to another Filipino colleague and they both started to criticise me, in front of me, in their language, with a great display of emotion, none of them seemingly positive!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png">  That was the ultimate last straw for me and since then, I've distanced myself from that group deliberately.  That's it... trust broken!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p>Oddly enough, a month prior to the incident, I had a feeling that things will come to a head and I had a strong instinct that I will lose her as a friend.  So when this happened, I was sad to see it end, but I wasn't taken by surprise. </p>
              <p>Fudgie, hope you'll understand there's no animosity if we forget and break out in our mother tongue out of habit in here.  It's usually in jest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              these two american guys to one of their birthday party, in front of
              me without inviting me. I mean its not like I wanted to go... but..
              it is damn tough pretending i don't understand and its not my
              business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes people just need a reminder but yes, it would have
              been so much more considerate if they could do it without you
              always needing to speak up for yourself. :(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I get annooyed w some of my group mates when they just
              carry on a conversation in mandarin. Then i know it embarasses my
              Malay group mate when I keep reminding them, so she just keeps
              saying its okay. but.. its.. just.. inconsiderate lah. Sometimes i
              forget too.. but :( tts not an excuse.</p>

              <p>Most of my Aussie colleagues are nice to me, but there are a few who'd do what those Dutch girls did - but then again, it was probably a Caucasians-only drunk party far out in the boondocks and I wouldn't be interested in attending anyways but it just makes you feel left out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p>I was going out to shop along Bridge Road with my aforementioned Filipino colleague-friend one Sunday when another Filipino gay colleague wanted to join us.  They then started speaking in their language.  I asked Roberto to  please speak in English otherwise I cannot join in the fun and the conversation.  He staunchly refused saying it's nice to speak in their own language.  I said, "Don't I know that?  But if you were to go out with Ying and I, we'll make sure not to speak in Mandarin when you're around because that will make you feel left out!"  And instead of being understanding, the insensitive brute started a huge fight with me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>I realised since coming over, that at this age, friendships are transient.  Loyalty is rare, and sincerity rarer still.  The more independant one can be, the better.  Sad, but that's our society...</p>

              <p>Well, I'm just glad that I treated the Filipino and PRC nurses well whenever we had to work together.  I always apologised to them for the horrible, shabby way our govt treated them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/sad.png" alt="sad.png">   I always say I wish they had a more positive working experience in Singapore...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yes, you're right - it's quite a dilemma.  In my case, I just take a deep breath, and ask after them because ah well, we're adults and in this case, we are just colleagues and I wouldn't enjoy it even if I had been invited anyways.  </p>
              <p>Speaking of which, I made the extra effort to travel via public transport to a Team Leader's b'day party recently.  2/3's of my time was spent travelling and waiting for the trains, and only 1/3 in the party.  I headed there after a morning shift and I was already zombie-dead-tired but I trudged on anyways and made it there on time to realise that dinner's gone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png">  That lady later said she appreciated my presence the most because she realised it was a long, tedious journey both ways for me.  I wanted to cry that day because when I reached the train station, I got totally lost and spent more than half an hour wandering around her neighbourhood.  Here, the road signs are few and far between and worse, the font size is teeny meeny so by the time you can see the precious, rare road sign, you have to walk a long distance to back-track.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>Please don't invite me to parties in the far-flung suburbs unless I have a ride!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
