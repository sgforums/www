              <p>I have experimented with several ways of defrosting meat. 
              The most effective is, don't even bother waiting!  When you
              buy the meat, immediately divide it into portions, and pack them
              into ziploc bags.  When meat is needed, grab one portion,
              empty it into the boiling water that you will then use to cook the
              instant beehoon later.  Hot water melts the ice quickly, and
              cooks the meat too.  Then when you cook the noodles in it, the
              soup will have more 'body' too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I do that... If I remember. But my mom usually buys em by a kilo/packet. But yeah, I do that sometimes. Except, I didn't expect I'd run out of sausages, so I have to use minced meat to replace it. :P</p>

              <div id="post_message_5781798">6 in 10 new jobs go to foreigners <br><br>By Goh Chin Lian <br><br>Employment rose by 64,200 new jobs in the three months to the end of December, the Ministry of Manpower said. -- ST PHOTO: LAU FOOK KONG<br><br>SIX in ten jobs created last year went to foreigners, the first time in at least six years that their share was larger than locals. <br><br>This comes at a time when job creation is at a record high, and unemployment and retrenchment at record lows. <br><br>The Manpower Ministry noted in its latest employment report released on Thursday that both locals - Singaporeans and permanent residents -- and foreigners benefited from the strong job creation. <br><br>Local employment grew by 92,100 last year, up from 90,900 the previous year. <br><br>This is the third successive year that local employment creation has set record highs. <br><br>But the local share of total new jobs dropped from 52 per cent in 2006 to 39 per cent last year, 'given the limits to the growth of Singapore's indigenous workforce and the larger base of jobs created', the ministry said. <br><br>Foreign employment rose by 144,500 last year, 'enabling the economy to grow beyond the limits of Singapore's indigenous workforce', it said. <br><br>As at December last year, one in three workers here - or 900,800 - were foreigners. <br><br>The booming economy, with the buoyant service and construction sectors, created 236,600 jobs, up from 176,000 in the previous year. This is an 11-year high. <br><br>The services sector contributed 144,100 more jobs, boosted by the rapid increase in hiring across a wide range of industries, led by financial and professional services. <br><br>The construction sector added 49,000 workers, double that of the previous year. <br><br>Manufacturing employment also rose, by 49,900, spurred by strong demand in marine and offshore engineering. <br><br>Overall unemployment averaged 2.1 per cent, down from 2.7 per cent the previous year. Resident unemployment fell to 3 per cent, down from 3.6 per cent in 2006. Both overall and resident unemployment are at their lowest in a decade. <br><br>On average, 56,900 residents were unemployed last year, down from 67,600 the previous year. <br><br>Similarly, retrenchment fell to a 14-year low. Overall, 7,200 workers were laid off, down from 12,603 the previous year. The bulk of lay offs came from manufacturing.</div>

              <p>I have experimented with several ways of defrosting meat. 
              The most effective is, don't even bother waiting!  When you
              buy the meat, immediately divide it into portions, and pack them
              into ziploc bags.  When meat is needed, grab one portion,
              empty it into the boiling water that you will then use to cook the
              instant beehoon later.  Hot water melts the ice quickly, and
              cooks the meat too.  Then when you cook the noodles in it, the
              soup will have more 'body' too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, what really scares me right now is that
              everything will go kaput in one widespread and massive worldwide
              recession that can rival the Great Depression.</p>
              <p>And this time, it's even scarier.... stagflation is worse than
              depressed demand. Depressed demand can be alleviated with Keynesian
              expansionary policy, but stagflation can only be solved by much
              more difficult supply-side tools. Seriously, the world had better
              find a new and reliable source of alternate energy - pronto.</p>
              <p>And with the US national debt soaring, sooner or later they're
              bound to default on some of it. USD 9.2 trillion is no small
              potatoes at all - I'm willing to bet that at least a quarter of it
              is all thanks to Dubya's policy of going into Iraq and Afghanistan
              with guns blazing.</p>

              <p>there's such a term as zero growth economies now ..... and frankly, I think the chances of a global economic meltdown a la the great depression won't happen till oil runs out .... I think we are witnessing history in the making here ... the transition of super power status from the US to China ... yes, the US national debt is the highest in the world, but their thinking is, if we, the biggest super consumer economy in the world, stops spending, the rest of the world is farked, so everybody will still finance our deficit ... they have no choice ..... that is no longer true .... China, India, and much of Asia will still grow this year while the west wallows ... there a trend from the US dollar to the euro ... it's the beginning of the end ........ and you watch ... within 30 years there'll be a war between china and the US in the pacific ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
