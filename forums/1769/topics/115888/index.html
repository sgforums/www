            <div class='col-md body'>I think basically, you think of her so much, you are seeking quick answers here.  You forget though... being in our 30's in no way means that we suddenly become clairvoyant or gain some sort of psychic ability to foresee the future.<br><br>I've known couples who knew each other since Junior College who got married and are parents now.  I've also known this guy who was utterly devoted and lovelorn for this girl in my clique, who sadly doesn't reciprocate his love but he'll hang on, week after week, month after month, lapping whatever little attention she paid to him, misinterpreting whatever little thing she said, etc etc... You could see he was pretty obsessed with her cause everywhere we went with her, he tried to follow or just blatantly tagged along uninvited.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   Now?  She's married... not to him though.  He's also moved on.<br><br>What we like, who we are, and who we love in our 20's might not remain constant into our 30's.  People change, situations evolve, things metamorphosise...  It's best to find a love that's mutual cause only then can you both achieve the same steadfastness, single-mindedness and devotion towards each other that would otherwise not be possible in this constantly-revolving and evolving world.  If one party is willing, and the other party is lukewarm about the whole affair, you'll never achieve a balanced partnership.<br><br>Think about it this way - do you doubt your self-worth so much that you don't think you deserve to be loved just the way you are?  It's only when we've learnt to love ourselves can we then have the capacity to love someone else in a wholesome and unselfish manner.  Otherwise, you'd find a lot of self-serving or self-crippling hidden intentions and desires in the relationship.<br><br>So, never be unequally yoked... we all deserve better.<br><br>Let go, move on, live in the present and look towards the future.  Unshackle those old chains and live free...</div>

Granted, you have to put in effort to make any relationship work but it shouldn't have to be tedious all the time.

I'd rather someone love me for who I am than stand pitifully in the wings, hoping to get crumbs that drop from the table of the one who's having a feast.  In short, do not shortchange yourself in life - why insist on chasing after someone who obviously doesn't seem to have the hots for you the same way you do for her?<br><br>Good luck... and hope you'll finally let go and move on.<br></div>

If there are patterns that repeat themselves, learn how to recognise the warning signs and nip them in the bud.<br><br>Learn to let go... I'd rather someone love me for who I am than stand pitifully in the wings, hoping to get crumbs that drop from the table of the one who's having a feast.  In short, do not shortchange yourself in life - why insist on chasing after someone who obviously doesn't seem to have the hots for you the same way you do for her?<br><br>Good luck... and hope you'll finally let go and move on.<br></div></blockquote>Maybe what u said is right...But miracles do happen..And there are people in this world who have hopes that such thing would happen..Hopes motivate and inspire u......take me for example...there have been a few cases where things didnt work out initially but later on it wroked like a charm , it worked out..not in love but in other areas...Sometimes things are worth giving a second try if not multiple tries as well...as u yrself have said.there are patterns which repeat themselves...on a brighter note......The ability to strike at the right moment results in unexpected outcomes even better than  what u expected initially..dont give up hope .just let it rest in one corner of your head...Be ready when it pops up occasionally..my 5 cents worth for Valentine's Day....Happy Valentine's DAy</div>

You could see he was pretty obsessed with her cause everywhere we went with her, he tried to follow or just blatantly tagged along uninvited.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   Now?

Last I heard, he found himself a girlfriend and is very happy.<br><br>Chewbacca, we never know how what the script in our life holds, what turns we'd have to manipulate, who we'll meet, who we'll end up with, how it'll all turn out... important thing is to sometimes relax, not push it, not rush things, not force things... and let fate take control.  If you believe in God, then commit all these things to Him and He'll take control and reveal His plans for you in His time.<br><br>Chewbacca, I'm sorry you have to go through this... I can understand the pain... and seriously, there's someone out there for you but you'll only meet her when the two of you are ready to meet each other.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Also, Chewbacca, with each relationship,  you're bound to have memories.  Remember the happy ones and discard the bad ones.  You can't help having memories cause they're etched into your history.  Besides, with each relationship, we learn something, we give something, we take something, we gain experience and then, depending on our attitude, we will either grow from it, or regress from it.  Choose to take the positive stance.  Then you'll grow as an individual.  The danger is to become cynical... but don't.  You'll only deprive yourself of the chance to be with the person you're meant to be with in your future.<br><br>Just drop a note here if you wish to get things off your chest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
