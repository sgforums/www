A lot of them are very badly treated by their employers and it's not hard to see why a few of them would crack under such circumstances.  Not condoning their misdeeds, but saying that sometimes, they've been abused till breaking point.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I've witnessed how a patient's relative made her maid stay put at the hospital 24/7!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   The poor maid sleeps in a small couch, all curled up and sooo uncomfortable, every single night!  And every few hours, she has to wake up and check on the patient, even though the patient is asleep and there's nothing she can do.  She bathes in the hospital, eats, sleeps, lives her life in hospital 24/7 and does not step out of it until the patient is released!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I felt sooo sorry for the inhumane treatment she suffers that on my shift, I often get her to go to sleep, assuring her I'll wake her up if her employer turns up.<br><br>I was sooooo tempted to report her employer!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

The poor maid looked like she was about to cry but the kid just continued, thinking it's a 'game' and worse, the parents just sat there, acting as if nothing happened!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I've also seen kids scolding their maids!

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has once been described as a 'killing ground for maids'.<br><br>That's an exaggeration, but not by much either, methinks.<br><br>Seriously, would it really kill the employers to give their maids a day off once a week? Can those freaking employers themselves work seven days a week, 365 days a year for several years without a single day off? If their answer is 'no', then I'd say they are total hypocrites for saying that maids don't deserve days off.<br><br>As for the maid abusers in general... I don't care what their motivation to abuse their maids were. You are not expected to treat your maids like queens, but you're not expected to treat them like trash either. If you can't respect another human being and treat her nicely, then you deserve to get jail. That woman who abused her maid fully deserved what she got. She gets no pity from me whatsover.<br><br>I only pity her children who has to go without their mummy for the next few months.</div>
