Can those freaking employers themselves work seven days a week, 365 days a year for several years without a single day off? If their answer is 'no', then I'd say they are total hypocrites for saying that maids don't deserve days off.<br><br>As for the maid abusers in general... I don't care what their motivation to abuse their maids were. You are not expected to treat your maids like queens, but you're expected to treat them like trash either. If you can't respect another human being and treat her nicely, then you deserve to get jail. That woman who abused her maid fully deserved what she got. She gets no pity from me whatsover.<br><br>I only pity her children who has to go without their mummy for the next few months. </div></blockquote>The ones who bully their maids are those who were never used to being in a situation where they had to take charge and be an employer.Lacking in workplace socialisation graces..<br><br>Oh yes, call me blunt but those who got rich all of a sudden are not any better either.Nouveau riche without good manners and proper upbringing..what a tragedy.</div>

This is when the typical S'porean kia-si mentality kicks in, and some employers decided that to play it safe, they had better keep the maid within their supervision at all times and hence not give the maids any day off.<br><br>Then there are other employers who refused to give their maids day off bec. it is very 'inconvenient' for them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
