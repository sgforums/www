            <div class='col-md body'>I copied this joke from Singapore Bikes Forum:<br><br>[QUOTE=tingchiyen;3452030]it's a joke, akin to this one:<br><br>One day, I was out with my mother-in-law and my wife at the Esplanade taking photographs of the Merlion when to my horror, I saw my mother-in-law had fallen into the water under the bridge and was screaming for help. As I rushed to the water's edge, I heard another scream from the other side and I saw that my wife had also fallen into the water. It was dark, the street-lights were all out and I was the only person there. There was no way I could save both of them before the other drowned. Now, the really tough question I have for you folks, bearing in mind the difficult choice that I was faced with: .... .... ... what speed setting should I have used on my camera? ASA 1600 or a long exposure with a slower speed?[/QUOTE]<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another one:<br><br>[QUOTE=wadafark;3452528]Haha! It's just a joke about how men are less attuned to emotions. Here's an example on why men do not write the advice in magazine love columns:<br><br>Dear Walter:<br><br>I hope you can help me here. The other day I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. I hadn't gone more than a few hundred yards down the road when my engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help.<br>When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes.<br><br>He was parading in front of the wardrobe mirror dressed in my underwear and high-heel shoes, and he was wearing my make up. I am 32, my husband is 34 and we have been married for twelve years. When I confronted him, he tried to make out that he had dressed in my lingerie because he couldn't find his own underwear. But when I asked him about the make up, he broke down and admitted that he'd been wearing my clothes for six months. I told him to stop or I would leave him.<br><br>He was let go from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. I don't feel I can get through to him anymore. Can you please help?<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Sheila<br><br>Dear Sheila:<br><br>A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no debris in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the jubilee clips holding the vacuum pipes onto the inlet manifold. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injector chamber.<br><br>Walter[/QUOTE]</div>
