Just cause of what that ONE doc says?  I'm sorry but I'm not that easily convinced because if that MD is unable to provide strong evidence to back his case, I'm not about to help propagate his idea.<br><br>And you've heard of docs who want to make a name for themselves, right?  Well, a great last-ditch attempt to make everyone sit up and notice your name would be to do what he just did - refute ADHD.<br><br>That ADHD doesn't exist is a suggestion I'd love to explore, but until I read conclusive scientific evidence to back this up, it remains an interesting idea and possibility to me.<br><br>And don't tell me to go watch some Hollywood movie to know what are ADHD kids!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And since when did I suggest this : "what you seem to be advocating is to treat everyone who walks in as a "mental patient" and mollycoddle them with your direction.."  Hell, I've always stood by proper diagnosis being made, not by me, nosiree, because I'm just a humble Missy, but by a professional - a Psychologist, one of them MD's who work in the IMH.  Do you think they will consider "everyone who walks in" as a mental patient?  I'm not about to waste my time on mollycuddling and you're truly mistaken and a real lousy judge of character if you think that I'm the mollycuddling sort!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And by saying this : "my direction is to FIND those who are really in need, hold out our hand and hope they take that hand...", well, just how do you propose to do that?  You aren't trained to "find those who are really in need" so let the professionals do their job.  And yet, when that JC boy was officially diagnosed by MD's as having BDD, you refute existence of the BDD as a valid psychological diagnosis.<br><br>Sorry, but you contradict yourself, IMO.  You're trying to sound like you empathise with those who are truly diagnosed with mental disorders but yet, you seem unconvinced that such diagnosis truly exist.<br><br>Contrary to what most laymen think, mental disorders like Schizophrenia, does not render the person easily detectable, as in, a mildly Schizophrenic person may actually walk in our midst, and appear very normal, and nobody would be wiser to the truth!  We need to change our perception of how someone with a mental / psychological disorder will appear to be like.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...when i was still posting in a teenage depression site, quite a number of the teens there said that their parents refuse to accept that their children had depression, they just think that it's the usual thing that teens feels and it's not real.<br><br>most of them well haven't been diagnosed with depression but some of them had gone to see doctors on their own and have been diagnosed with it, even so, their parents still dun wanna accept that their children has depression.<br><br>those parents who think it's normal for teens to feel depressed sometimes is right but that doesn't means that they should just dismiss it, common problems is still problems right? if it is left untouched, it could lead to more serious cases like bi polar or cutting.<br><br>those parents who refuses to accept that their kids are diagnosed with depression could be because of shame, why their kids can't be normal especially in a well, close knitted, kind of a high class community. it could because of they think mental illness is a taboo kind of thing in society.<br><br>what i want to say is, mental illness is seen different from other illness like flu or fever, ppl dun usually get mental illness, so it is like a taboo. if u usually have some mental problems it's then seen as something that u go through and it's not taken seriously. So mental problems are not really taken to be like a illness, a ill that u go to the doctor to get it fixed. so those serious cases dun really go to see a doctor out of shame or other things and those not so serious cases are not taken seriously.<br><br>i feel it's impt to look carefully at both not so serious and serious cases. not so serious cases can lead to become more serious ones, serious cases should be viewed as just like any other serious illness or diseases that u can just go to the doctor to get it fixed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and now, about schizophrenia. or mental disorders like depression/schizophrenia...<br><br>i believe that it is possible for the sufferer to 'control' it.<br>which is why sometimes it is so hard to detect.<br>which is probably why sometimes people are so shocked when someone commits suicide.<br>ever read those comments which go something along the lines of "but he/she was such a happy child who was always so good in sport/studies, and always willing to lend a helping hand blah blah blah"...<br>John Nash (schizophrenic mathematician in the show Beautiful Mind) supposedly controlled his schizophrenia the first time he was at Macleans. he was let out early for good behaviour... he didnt actually recover at all. after he was let out, he just went back to being 'crazy' again.<br>when absolutely necessary, i believe that the sufferer has the ability to somehow control their illness. but only during that time. once they are alone, or in situations where they are not 'in danger' of being sent off to hospitals or something, they go back to their diseased self.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the subject of mental illness, a 16 year old girl(talented painist, gifted athelete and member of her school's debating team) in the States has been sentenced to 8 years in prison for killing her mother. Apparently, she was driven to it because of the constant stress her parents put her under to be the perfect overachieving daughter. I have no sympathy for the dead woman but I feel sorry for the girl. Oh, its a Chinese immigrant family.
