Kids acting up and disrepecting authorities has more to do with social acceptance and as new parents that have had a relaxed parenting deals with the issue of raising children and teaching them rules and discipline.<br><br>Growing up in the post hippy and baby boom period parents are usually hopeless ill-prepared by their parents and have had a relaxed up bringing. What values are they to instill in children when they themselves are still going out and having selfish fun?<br><br>Here in Australia we are still trying to legalise some drugs namely marijuana. Though new medical reports says it bring outs pre-condtioned mental problems within certain people. Naturally people say well they were crazy in the first place.. it doesnt affect me lol<br><br>Kids these days are far smarter than you and i ever were. We may have played and pushed moderately on the line... but kids now know more than they should about certain rights and rather than be pulled back into line by their parents, some parents encourage them to go further.<br><br>When mobile phones became all the rage their was a case where 2 kids took the school and teacher to court for confescating the phones. I ask you how does a higschool kid know that they have the right to do so and more importantly finance a court action?</div>

Well... some of the children where I work suffer from Autism or ADHD.<br><br>One hyperactive child I know is very sweet. He simply can't sit/stand still, he is constantly moving, jerking, dancing, hopping. He tries his best to sit, but his fingers will be moving, his feet tapping. But he's one of the sweetest kids I know, always helpful, always polite. And I think the reason is because his family understands that he isn't able to 'sit still' or to concentrate, not because he refuses to, or doesn't want to. It isn't just BAD behaviour. By giving him certain exercises and games to 'work off' his energy, they are able to teach him socially accepted behaviour within his hyperactivity.<br><br>With regard to Autism especially, it isn't simply a behavioural problem or issue. You can teach them certain social expectations (but it doesnt mean they would understand or accept it or enjoy the type of socialisation as most people do). Imagine, less than half a decade ago, most people would view 'these' people as 'crazy' or 'mad', but I guess now we know better.<br><br>So my point is, no, I disagree that to 'diagnose' ADHD/autism etc is to be fradulant. However, I do agree that medication may not be the solution in all cases.<br><br></div>
