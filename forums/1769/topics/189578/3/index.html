Anne Sexton mentioned to her therapist that Sylvia Plath's suicide ought to have been hers. there are many people who commit suicide because after years and years of therapy and whatnot, nothing has improved.</strong><br><br>These people need help, and a form of understanding from society and their loved ones that they are not alone in their volatile state, but are we ready to do so?<br><strong>the singapore government complains about the rising suicide rate in singapore. however, after all these years of health education, i just realized two years ago that we never ever touched on mental illness AT ALL. if people are not educated about it, how will they ever know anything about it? most people i know think that its just "in their minds". they cannot seem to understand that depression is a chemical imbalance. that its not something people can control. they get mad at the victim and tell them to just "get a grip", or "just be more positive". people probably want to help. but because they dont know how, they end up making things worse.</strong><br><br>Often,s the stigma sometimes attached to mental illness means that some people delay seeking help. Perhaps if we are more aware of the causes and effects of mental illnesses - and realize that it can happen to [/b]anyone;[/b] even ourselves, more people would seek help as and when they feel 'disturbed' by the silent forces of the mind.<br><strong>a lot of people dont realize that they have a problem. especially schizophrenics. which is why these diseases are so dangerous. the victims do not realize that they are in danger. that they are a danger to themselves and the people around them. many people get help because someone figured out that something was terribly wrong and therefore sorta made the person go seek medical help. and sometimes the victim doesnt because even the victim thinks that mental illnesses are (put in all the stereotypical stuff people say about mental illnesses) and are therefore insulted that someone thinks they are diseased. </strong><br><br>I think the society's attitude and mindset toward these individuals has to change. Then, and only then... perhaps more would work toward improving their ability to function, and thus, enhancing their way of life<br><strong>i dont think it is entirely possible to change the people's mindsets. but the only way to improve things would be to educate the people. only then will they be able to understand why people with certain illnesses behave a certain way. and so that they can treat them in a more correct way, and try to help. and even then, it is hard to help. </strong>[/b]</blockquote>I agree and I find it a realistic view.</div>
