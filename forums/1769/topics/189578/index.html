            <div class='col-md body'>As long as one has been officially diagnosed to have some psychological / mental / emotional disorder, he/she will then be put on a Suicide Precautions alert, which means that even if he/she insists on dying and refuses help, we STILL have to administer treatment, because to refuse to do so would render us professionally liable for the outcome.  People with diagnosed disorders like these are considered to not be in a fit state of mind and like it or not, worthwhile or not, the onus of their safety lies on the health professionals who have been put in charge of looking after the case.<br><br>BDD is a very real psychological disorder, listed under the official DSM-IV list of mental / psychological / mental disorders.  There's nothing unreal about it.  Just like Depression, it's very real.  It's something you might think is constantly used as a convenient excuse by irresponsible people out to abuse the system, but to people suffering from Depression, it is very real.  THey may see themselves plundering into the depths of depression, they might even try to rationalise themselves out of it in the beginning, but it is not a battle they can win alone, without the loving support of close friends and family, as well as trained professionals, and sometimes, medication too.<br><br>Sadly, even the GP's here might not take psychological disorders seriously enough to take the appropriate action fast enough.  When I read the article, his constant obsession with his penis size despite the assurances of everyone, including his GP, is a warning sign that he might have an underlying problem.  I was surprised that the GP didn't try to arrange for him to meet a trained counsellor to discuss his worries.  Sometimes, we're too quick to dismiss early warning signs.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Once again, that poor boy had BDD, and it's unfortunate that the appropriate help wasn't given to him soon enough.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, it is true that there is a limit to what we are able to / how we are capable of helping when it comes to mental disorders.<br><br>I agree that in most cases, people who may be diagnosed with these mental issues do not seek help because they themselves aren't fully aware of what they are facing. Even their families usually attribute it to 'moody episodes' or phases in their lives due to stress at work, or coping with other things in life.<br><br>...and we can only help when they themselves want to be helped.<br><br>Professionals in this field are usually familiar with the symptoms and the best way to go about alleviating one's situation. Whilst it may be so that the success rates are 'neglible' to say the least (these patients usually have to be entirely dependent on medication for almost a good part of their lives) any help is better than none at all.<br><br>For every one that can be helped, it is already a step in the right direction and a hurdle won on its own terms.<br><br>My point here is not so much the patients themselves, rather the attitude of the society in general. We can't ignore the fact that most people (the older generation, in general) have a typical view of these individuals. Usually when they say: Xiao Char Bor (and the reverse in gender) - this is accompanied by a look of contempt and disdain... almost like it was a shameful facet of one's life, an infectious disease, and he / she should be shunned lest they may get 'influenced'.<br><br>Thankfully... all this is slowly changing. As mentioned, hopefully with the increase in awareness and education, the younger generation would not judge mental disorders with as much hostility and scorn as their older counterparts.</div>
