              <p>To be honest what heritage? I'm not ashamed of my skin colour and I'm proud of being me.</p>
              <p>I'm definately not from a typical Chinese family. We don't have any Chinese practices except for Chinese New Year. Believe it or not but we never had anything during 7th month, Qing Ming and what not. In fact MPB knows more Chinese customs than I do !!!! (This is the most paiseh thing I have to admit)</p>
              <p>I used to have an irritating CHIJ accent :P I was not from CHIJ but I mixed around with too many Ah Sia Kia when I was young. People used to think I'm really arrogant in the past because of how I speak till they got to know me.</p>
              <p>Ever since I started working, my standard of English have dropped from I think 'O' Level A1 to maybe now it's a B3 standard -_-"</p>
              <p>I speak more in Mandarin and Hokkien. My Hokkien standard have gone up from an F9 to maybe a C5 now :P</p>
              <p>I switch naturally to an American Accent if I want to but that is only due to all the movies I watch and the people I talk to (I used to game lots with Americans).</p>
              <p>The problem with me is that I switch accents with different people. I can speak in a Malaysian accent too with the Malaysians ^^  </p>
              <p>And I do it not because I'm ashamed of being Asian, (If anything it's hot to be an Asian these days) but because I think they feel more connected with me if I speak in an accent they are comfortable with.  (It has done miracles for me in work)</p>

              <p>it's one thing when you affect an accent to be understood .....</p>
              <p>but it's another when you geng an accent to Singaporeans ....... </p>
              <p>being in denial is another thing from not being "into" one's cultural roots ......</p>
              <p>that's what i've been trying to get at here ......</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that one should become a cho chin chow and dress in flowering robes, spout Li Bai and sip chinese tea ...... but to deny the existence of your own roots, which is what the two girls tried to do .... is just plain sick ..... one who doesn't respect him or herself, has no right to expect people's respect in turn ....</p>
              <p>the ang mohs were univesity exchange students, the singkie chicks were local students .... I sure hope they are not representative of our tertiary student population today ....</p>

              <p>Well, if they're familiar with one another, then the only reason why it doesn't seem to bother them is because the blokes and the local girls were looking to score using each other.</p>

              <p>I've always felt proud of being a Singaporean each time I head overseas.  And now that I'm in Australia, I've never felt prouder of being a Singaporean!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>Strange, right?  But not when you consider how well our education system is, how efficient and productive we are, how good our infrastructure is and how we are all fluent in English.  These are things we all take for granted but when you're in any ang moh country and have to hold your own and somehow distinguish yourself from all the other Asians it helps. </p>
              <p>That is... I'm proud of being a Singaporean UNTIL I step into sgForums and read the idiotic posts that some really TMD WBD (tamade wang ba dan <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">) Singaporeans have the audacity to post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  And then, I feel embarrassed and pray that no curious foreigners wanting to "learn more about Singapore culture" will have the misfortune of stumbling in here and getting the shock of their life!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Some forumites are really xia suay!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I do experience racism now and then.  Sometimes, I pretend I didn't hear a thing and go about my own business.  Sometimes, I get a tad miffed and yell out something like "Go back and learn your geography first before making comments, mate!" or "Not all Chinese are from China (you redneck!)!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>I don't think I think too much of 'heritage'.  Most of us in Singapore are hard to categorise because we are exposed to too many influences from various areas.  We are cosmopolitan, or oh well, at least those of us who spend time improving ourselves, learning about the world and not waste time howling at the moon are!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>As for spoken English, I've often gotten Asians or Aussies who've lived in Singapore or the region coming up to me and asking if I'm from Singapore / Malaysia.  The latter I somewhat take an offence to simply because most, not all, from the latter place have this awful twang, but you can't blame the ignorant for not being able to distinguish between the two.</p>
              <p>I have had my boss-to-be and four other patients ask me before, "Did you train in America?" because they detected a slight American accent, which is easily explained by the fact that I've had American bosses during my corporate years, and also because of my typically Singaporean diet of American movies, TV programs, and music.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>As for the girls that Fatum met that night, I find such behaviour downright disgusting.  But think of it this way - these girls often glorify the Caucasian male, not realising that a lot of them are just having their fun with them and will eventually dump them at the first opportunity.  A lot of them jump on the happy joy bandwagon, thinking that they are being 'posh', etc but if you try too hard to be who you're not, you usually don't come off too glam.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Somehow, an image of Heath Ledger's Joker with that horrible streaky make-up came to mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>now i'm not sure if bad grammar should be part of that .....</p>
              <p>but people should pretend to be some fake banana when they were born and bred in Singapore .... and especially not pretend to be so in Singapore ! ....</p>
              <p>people shouldn't pretend to be someone they are not ..... if you're a chinese, malay, or indian, be one ! .... if you're a real mixed blood, good for you ! .... if you're born and bred in Singapore, don't pretend to be from somewhere else more exotic .... whatever you are, don't go and do a michael jackson and pretend to be something else ..... that's what riled me up .... it's so superficial .....</p>
              <p>of course, such things is not limited to singkies alone .... I mentioned here before about meeting an india indian pretending to be from Singapore ..... and there's this egyptian who tells everyone he holds a french passport, so he's french .... *puti ! .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
