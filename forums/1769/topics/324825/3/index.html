              <p>I am proud of being a Chinese....Our culture is one of the 4 Great Civilizations. We have a rich history. But I am not a traditionalist who blindly follows unreasonable aspects of my culture.</p>
              <p>I am proud to be a Singaporean. Despite having stayed in "Ang Moh Countries" at different stages of my life, and for the past 6 years in Oz, I have never tried to put on an accent. As long as I am clear in my spoken English, I have no problems with Ang Mohs of any countries understanding me. In fact,</p>
              <p>As to the extent of how proud I am of being a Singaporean? In Oz, I use Optus for my home phone, Internet and Mobile, when I could have got a better deal with other service providers.</p>
              <p>When I travel, I mainly use SIA. Only when I cannot get any available seats, the next best option will be Emirates. I read Asiaone every morning before I read Oz news </p>
              <p>Hubby's fren once asked me why did I not take up Oz citizenship? Is this country not good enough for u? My answer, I am a Singaporean.</p>

              <p>You've summed it up very well about those hang-ups and social circles. I guess it is a sad thing for Asians in general - there is always that (sub)conscious issue of segregation based on whether you were born in a western country or a '3rd world shithole', your English proficiency, whether you are with a western accent, a contrived accent, a comically contrived accent, or simply sticking to your 'original' accent, blah.. It is very disappointing when you can't even rely on/count on your own kind in a foreign land, as a result of all these rift-creating 'identity crises'.</p>
              <p>As for those who try so hard to put on different identities, I think they are creating for themselves serious personality disorders. What do you become when you have to play the part of an impersonator every day of your life?</p>

              <p>Nothing wrong with being asian or any other race. Personally i think that some people have this impression that caucasians are superior to asians hence the need to act as if they are exposed to western culture or were raised overseas.</p>
