              <p>Are you proud of your heritage ?</p>
              <p>Are you proud of your own skin ? ...</p>
              <p>are you proud of who you are ? ...</p>
              <p>do you pretend to be someone else you're not ? ...</p>
              <p>Well, something someone said in jive pad triggered a memory ... here's the story</p>
              <p>Twas at my usual watering hole on a weekday late last week (you guys know which one) .... got talking to a mix group of ang mohs (okie, I confess, we were really aiming for the blonde and the redhead babes among them) ...</p>
              <p>there were two singkie chinese chicks with them (our delightful and instantly recognizable accent), who right from the start, was obviously not happy with time sharing their ang moh friends with us .... best part was, they told us, that they were from somewhere else other than Singapore ....</p>
              <p>well, up yours girl, I've seen enough of FBCs from my own time away, you can't take away the Singapore in you, as much as you pretend to, don't pretend to be a kantang eater when you've been eating rice with chopsticks for most of your life .... and it's not very bright to pretend to be from a place whose language you can't speak either .... never thought one of us would start babbling in french eh ... or pretend to be eurasian when you're clearly not .... you're no kristin kruek my dear, or even denise keller .... they are much prettier ....</p>
              <p>it got pretty amusing for us afterwards, when we started winding ourselves up, and making those girls squirm .... I was Patrick Kombu, from Congo, my mates were Frank Neweke from Nigeria, and the coup de grace ... !Xbele (click man ! ... :lol:)  from South Africa.... Chinese Africans .....  it was hilarious .... I wonder if the ang mohs really got the point of the real point .... I think the two girls certainly did ..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>but I feel really sad for the girls, really, to suffer from this sort of identity crisis .... did they really think think themselves superior by hanging out with ang mohs ? .... why be ashamed of who they are ? ...  this is the sort  of people NUS  produces nowadays ? .....</p>

              <p>okay..</p>
              <p>ethnicity - chinese... do i behave like the people in PRC?</p>
              <p>nationality - singaporean.. do i really have the same outlook as my fellow citizens?</p>
              <p>heritage - apart from eating teochew and hokkien food, do i know much about anything?</p>
              <p>tradition - should we follow them blindly? i know i question a whole lot of them...</p>
              <p>so where does that place me?</p>
              <p>am i beating my own path? some call me lazy.. because i "do not bother finding out my traditions, cultures and whatnots"...</p>
              <p>maybe i am proud of my past and heritage, i look at them as lessons learnt the hard way by those in the past.. and then look to the future...</p>
              <p>maybe.. we make and add on to whatever heritage we have by beating a new path?</p>

              <p>And its not just females who speak strangely.</p>
              <p>I was at this bus stop last night when I hear a young boy speaks to his mother in "knn, tar nai nai de'; fcuk.  the mother was speaking to him in perfect singapore english.</p>
              <p>I actually wanted to ask the mother......whether her son is actually a retard, because he cant seem to say a sentence w/o those additive and his replies are never answering his mother. The boy was even trying to hop around and maybe pretend he is those cool black dudes in USA.</p>

              <p>tripple 9 was believable with Lim Yu Beng, but the subsequent additions to the show just make the show unbelievable....lets not mention VR Man.</p>

              <p>I actually enjoyed triple nine. Some of the new characters were quite cock, but I did like Inspector Herbert DeSouza.</p>

              <p>Perhaps those girls have an esteem issue.</p>
              <p>When someone pretends to be someone else, they are in fact in denial and running away. Trying to impress people with the make believe. They cannot accept that they are better than they think, or who they are.</p>
              <p>But seriously, sometimes I do like to be different. Something that makes me stand out from the crowd.... This explains the hairless ogre for a reason!</p>
