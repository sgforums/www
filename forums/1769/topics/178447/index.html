            <div class='col-md body'>Babies and children are innocent.  Whether they're borne out of wedlock, or in an illicit and adulterous affair, the babies / kids remain innocent.<br><br>If I were a husband and my wife would come up to me to say that the child that I've thought of as mine all along turns out to be another man's, due to an adulterous affair she had after marriage, I would hate the woman for her infidelity and for cuckolding me, (sorry, pretending to be a guy with a manly ego here!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ), but it would be hard for me to hate the child that I've brought up and loved all these years as my very own.  Afterall, the child did not ask to be conceived in this sinful manner so it's really not his/her fault.  Yes, I will continue loving the child because it is possible to love children who are not your own flesh and blood as your own, but I do not think I can continue living under the same roof with the unfaithful woman.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Now, for the reverse situation... if I were the wife and my husband came up to reveal that he has a child, it would depend... was it before or after marriage.  If it was before marriage, I'd ask why he had to withold the truth till now.  Such issues should rightfully be discussed after marriage.  I'll definitely smart from the shock and hurt, but I suppose in time to come, I'll accept that and will want to get to know the child and slowly play a more active part in his/her life, depending on how his/her mom feels about it.<br><br>If it was a child conceived whilst being married to me, woe to him!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">   All trust is broken and there really is no excuse for cheating behind my back and I have zero tolerance for infidelity.

            <div class='col-md body'>I actually knew a case like that.<br><br>One of my married friends (a nurse in her late 20's) had an affair (with a doctor in his early 30's) after marriage.  The usual excuse of husband always being in a hurry to satisfy himself and not her, etc.  In her extra-marital romps, she always used a barrier.  Doctors must be trained to get around barriers because thats what happened - she got pregnant and gave birth to a boy.<br><br>She never suspected anything till the boy was over 1 year old, when something (I forgot what) made them bring the boy for a blood group test or DNA test or whatever (I forgot what too).<br><br>Oooooh, it was a rude shock to her poor husband, who immediately divorced her.  Lots of problems with some people wanting to claim the boy, some people wanting to claim the costs of bringing up the boy, some people not having anything to do with it, etc etc.  The boy became an outcaste to some and a commodity to others.<br><br>My only involvement was to accompany her and her boy to the lawyer's office to sign the divorce papers + pin the boy down on the sofa and threatened to tickle him while she talked with the lawyer ('cos the boy was really active and likes running around).  It was a very sad case.<br><br>If it were me, I don't know if I can love such a child (as per your scenario) as if he's my own.....but I know I can never reject him or prevent giving him the life every child deserves.  If I knew the father and can accept his character, it would probably make things easier for me.  The fear I have is that living together for so many years, there are bound to be times of temper.....and thats when we may accidentally blurt out something we shouldn't.<br><br>(To me, this is different from adopting a child, or being a willing step-parent).<br><br></div>

E.g. If it was a one night stand and short affair, If the woman he had an affair with does not want the child at all, and he is grovelling and contrite that he will be breaking off the entire thing and beg me (NOTE the grovel, contrite and beg) the child is not to blame for the adult's problems... actually I think I will feel tt the child and me are both in the same boat ~ child is abandoned by real mother, and I have been 'betrayed' by my husband ~ even.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I can forgive what the husband has done, I should be able to accept the child.  If I cannot forgive, I would reject the child.   I guess there is some sympathy for the child, but then taking in a child isn't as straight forward as - opening your arms and he will fall right into them with love and gratitude.  He would be a stranger to me, it would take alot to grow to love him and vice versa.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let me say that you men are better man that i.<br>Especially sherling22 for actually staying with wife inorder to raise the child.<br>Naturally i see complications when the child is older and when you have "real" children of our own. Aswell as how to explain that you are not the real father and do not want anything to do with the real mother... and have no real reason for hanging around.... very confusing and complicated for the child.<br><br>It is easy to accept a child if the child is conceived before the marriage, whether the wife discloses or not... we all have pasts and many are more colourful than others... but past is past.<br><br>I have to honestly say that there is no way i would accept a child that is conceived as a result of an affair. I am sorry but i could never accept being tricked into raising another mans child. And as Elindra has stated the "mistake" is constantly there. One other problem i see once you get past the hurt, is that the natural father can at any time pop up and say hey i want custody of my child.<br><br>However my most simplistic reasoning is that I, as a man can never have children on my own with out the need for a woman. So i can not see why i should spend my time raising another mans child.<br><br>Interesting i heard a study conducted that given same relationship with sona and daughter, a mother is more likely to love her daughters children more than her sons. The simplistic reasoning is she has no doubts that the children are her daughters 9regardless of who the father maybe). But there is always an element of doubt with her son's childrens.</div>
