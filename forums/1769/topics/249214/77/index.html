An NSF was caught in 2005 trying to use his handphone camera to take pics of girls in a public toilet at a fast food restaurant and was found out by the girls and detained by the restaurant manager and made to wait for the police. The police took damned long to arrive and he made 3 escape attempts. The 2nd time he was nearly run over by a bus but his pursuers pulled him to safety. The 3rd time he got run over by another bus and died.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>(the fast food restaurant was near a bus interchange)<br><br>I'm sorry the guy is dead but this is fucking hilarious  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>You gotta be kidding me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .<br>This sounds like something for Darwin Awards  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
