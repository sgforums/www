              <p>i had a problem that i can't raise my arms because of something the specialists couldn't detect.  actually i still have the problem now.</p>
              <p>and i injured my shoulder while doing weights last time.  its the joint.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so i got downgraded all the way to a modified IPPT where i can only take 3 stations.</p>
              <p>shuttle run, situps, ride bicycle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i refused to believe that i cannot pass the normal IPPT without training my arms.  so i upgraded my medical status so i can take the full IPPT.</p>
