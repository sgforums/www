              <p>Doctors sometimes write 'prn' (when necessary) drug orders for patients so we won't give those medications / injections until the need arises.  I think the use of meds is much stricter in Singapore.  Here in Australia, biangz... sometimes I feel like I'm a waitress for the drug addicts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Hmm... Actually, sometime around Oct 2007, I started to see this dark figure in my home on certain nights.  It scared the bejesus outta me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Twice I went to sleep and felt someone patting my mattress three times - Pat!  Pat!  Pat!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  I was so frightened, it took some time before I opened my eyes and I had to whisper to whatever it was to just leave me alone, I mean no harm.  I didn't exactly see 'it', but something told me it was a mischievous little boy-ghost. </p>
              <p>I was so frightened with the dark figure I constantly saw in my living room, I went to seek help through various channels.  Finally, someone told me that I had met a new friend recently and he's a very sad soul because he had associated himself with an ex-girlfriend who used to dabble in the dark arts and by associating with her, a dark spirit had clung to him and when I associated with him, I brought that spirit home with me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  No wonder everytime I visited him at his place, I could sense an aura of doom and misery and I just felt his place was 'dark', not as in dim lighting but it was just ... 'dark'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              Chinese lady who's lost her wits and is crazy, stay with us for a
              long time.  Because she was nuts, we had to restrain her and
              she used to scream and yell and kick and curse at us.  Months
              later, after a few hospital admissions, in and out, she passed away
              in our ward.  A few days later, when I was working nights, I
              was writing my report when I drifted off to sleep without realising
              it (I was still holding my pen upright <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">).   I saw her standing at the corner,
              pointing at me and scolding me for restraining her.  Then like
              a ghost, she moved closer and closer to my counter!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Suddenly, I gasped very loudly and snapped out
              of it.  My colleagues at the counter were alarmed, all looked
              at me and asked me what happened.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  I told them and they said, if I see her

              <p>Reminds me of "The Eye" movie. The actress was seated, trying to learn caligraphy from where she saw someone standing at the corner or the room. That "someone" said "why are you sitting in my chair!" Then suddenly the "someone" dart towards her with arm outstretched!</p>
              <p>I guess me quite lucky. Never had any serious encounters in any hospitals or army camps. The most spooky was having the feeling something else was around, and noises &amp; knockings in a hotel room.</p>

              <p>Yes, won't be surprised.  But they'd still be diagnosed under one of the psychiatric ailments because that's just the way it is. </p>
              <p>I admire the Psych nurses for their tenacity.</p>

              <p>Hmm... something about ants all over the patient's bed, but they couldn't find any on the floor or on the wall or anywhere else!  All the other patients in the same room were alright but this patient kept having ants suddenly appear on the bed crawling all over him/her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>Think something else happened to this patient but I can't remember.  Anyways, all the nurses agreed it appeared to be a spell / possession.</p>
