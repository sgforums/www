              <p>There's this other room in the general ward, even the tough nut Nursing Sister had a scary encounter.  She doesn't want us to know, but a few seniors there know of it cause she was so scared the day it happened. </p>
              <p>She negotiates with the patients and their families and plans for the patients' discharge.  She's really nasty to us, but sweet like honey to the patients.  She went into this particular room one night, and heard a recently-deceased patient calling her name.  Her hair stood on end and she quickly walked out of the room and into the crowded ICU.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>That room ah... is very very xie!  Everytime I'm assigned to that room, I hate it because at night, the patients usually ask, "What's that up on the ceiling / under the bed?" The patients in Beds 1 and 2 will ask about the 'thing' on the ceiling' whilst those in Beds 3 and 4 will ask about the 'thing' under the beds!  And these patients would usually be 'down on their luck', as in, recovering from some major head surgery so they aren't fully themselves yet.  A few colleagues told me that usually, patients who have undergone major surgeries will be 'down on their luck' and therefore, can see 'things'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>I usually tell the patients, "I don't know what's on the ceiling / under the bed... and I don't care to know either!" <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Sometimes, when I'm all alone doing my work because my colleagues are in the other rooms, and if I see / sense something, I will usually try to ignore it and mumble under my breath to leave me alone, I'm just trying to get my work done.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>I had a very very frightening encounter once that spooked my colleagues too.  We had a long-term patient, an elderly Chinese lady who's lost her wits and is crazy, stay with us for a long time.  Because she was nuts, we had to restrain her and she used to scream and yell and kick and curse at us.  Months later, after a few hospital admissions, in and out, she passed away in our ward.  A few days later, when I was working nights, I was writing my report when I drifted off to sleep without realising it (I was still holding my pen upright <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">).   I saw her standing at the corner, pointing at me and scolding me for restraining her.  Then like a ghost, she moved closer and closer to my counter!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Suddenly, I gasped very loudly and snapped out of it.  My colleagues at the counter were alarmed, all looked at me and asked me what happened.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  I told them and they said, if I see her in my dreams again, just tell her that she was crazy so no choice, we had to restrain her lor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p>There's this other room in the general ward, even the tough nut Nursing Sister had a scary encounter.  She doesn't want us to know, but a few seniors there know of it cause she was so scared the day it happened. </p>
              <p>She negotiates with the patients and their families and plans for the patients' discharge.  She's really nasty to us, but sweet like honey to the patients.  She went into this particular room one night, and heard a recently-deceased patient calling her name.  Her hair stood on end and she quickly walked out of the room and into the crowded ICU.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>That room ah... is very very xie!  Everytime I'm assigned to that room, I hate it because at night, the patients usually ask, "What's that up on the ceiling / under the bed?" The patients in Beds 1 and 2 will ask about the 'thing' on the ceiling' whilst those in Beds 3 and 4 will ask about the 'thing' under the beds!  And these patients would usually be 'down on their luck', as in, recovering from some major head surgery so they aren't fully themselves yet.  A few colleagues told me that usually, patients who have undergone major surgeries will be 'down on their luck' and therefore, can see 'things'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>I usually tell the patients, "I don't know what's on the ceiling / under the bed... and I don't care to know either!" <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Yes, some drugs do cause hallucinations, but why do they all report the same hallucinations?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>When I worked in the neuro wards here, the patients do get hallucinations too, but it's always different things seen by different patients.</p>

Shortly at about 4pm I woke up and I was a little weirded out, but ok. I didn't discuss this with anyone. So then last night I awoke at exactly 3am, I looked at my cell phone and yes it was 3am, I freaked out, I turned on lights and turned the volume up on my TV as well. I was so scared and I didn't fall back to sleep till 4:45am. Nothing happened, but I did get so scared. What is this??? I'm thinking I should go speak to a priest. </em></p>

              <p>Pinky, you remember my classic encounter, right?  The one where more than one of us experienced the same thing at the same place?  I think it was five or six of us.  That was the first time I believed that what I've seen were not figments of my fertile imagination but it was real because how do you explain five - six people reporting seeing the same thing sitting at the same place and all during night duty?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  I tell that classic tale to my nurse friends here and they all get spooked out too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>Most of my encounters happen around that time too. I believe it's called the witching hour. Why 3 am? I believe it's to mock the holy trinity.</p>

              <p><em>I am very new to this, but I just had an experience that has me a little nervous and scared. A few days ago, actually it was Sunday during the day, I was extremely tired from moving into my new home and I mean brand new, no one has ever lived there before. Anyways I fell asleep about 2:30pm I was in a deep sleep and suddenly I felt like someone pushed my feet to where I was in a fetal position, but on my back, I felt myself struggling and trying to pull my covers off me and whoever or whatever it was, had a hold of my feet and was telling "I have you now" I tried pulling and kicking and yelling my brother's name out twice and nothing. Shortly at about 4pm I woke up and I was a little weirded out, but ok. I didn't discuss this with anyone. So then last night I awoke at exactly 3am, I looked at my cell phone and yes it was 3am, I freaked out, I turned on lights and turned the volume up on my TV as well. I was so scared and I didn't fall back to sleep till 4:45am. Nothing happened, but I did get so scared. What is this??? I'm thinking I should go speak to a priest.</em></p>
