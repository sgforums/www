              <p>I remember I was sitting in the garden and I happened to glance down on my legs and I noticed some small red dots on my legs. That prompted me to get my mum to see a doctor. I didn't have these red dots before prior but I remembered it was one of the symptoms,</p>

              <p>That is nursing for you.  It is the bitchiest job, worse than the politicking and bitchiness I've ever encountered in my seven years in the corporate world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  I used to think, how bad can it be working with nurses because we're all working to save patients' lives.  I was too darn naive because it's a female-dominated environment and I tell you, all that estrogen in the workplace is toxic!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>You should see the bullying that occurs in nursing.  All of us, even the strongest amongst us, would have broken down and cried a few times.  I used to be a very tough nut to crack, but there were occasions when the frustration and anger and injustice of it all got to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  I think the seniors in my old ward, they remember me because I stood up to them, fought for the juniors and myself, and even had shouting matches with a few of them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>Nah.  My senior nurses used to keep chanting that our uniform is a kind of 'fu' against the spirits.  We might see / sense them, but they cannot hurt us because (and then she would repeat all over again as if to reassure herself) our uniform is a 'fu'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
