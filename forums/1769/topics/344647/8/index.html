              <p>But the 2nd time, i went there..it was with 5 friends albeit different friends..we started from the entrance with the layout A-B-C-D-E..we made a headcount..heard 5 then we proceed...because C &amp; D were girls..we held hands la as we foraged..because I had been there before..I was A and B also been there before..then, we walked past the lift and the connector to the annex...then we went to the other building..the feeling was overwhelming..like so many pairs looking at u...then, from the lift there..we decided to go back..so we made a headcount..However, after the last person said "5", we heard a deep voice saying 6..it dark and just nice, the torchlight we happened to bring was an old L Torch which is god damn faulty..then, i told my friend "e" not to scare us la..got girls wat..but "E' insisted he didnt say "6" and the voice was in front..So, i decided to modify the headcount by counting your number and make a continous "hummmmm" so u cant say anything..and again, we heard the same voice saying "6" and hummm as well!!!</p>
              <p>Wah lau..in the darkness, we just clawed our way down the staircase and to the carpark because it was a linear pathway..Once on safe grounds, E told one of the girls "D" why she didnt follow the layout and tugged at his arm from behind...but the girl "D' told him she didn't and she was in front of him..and she suddenly was spooked when she looked at E because the hand she was holding was wearing a long sleeved shirt but E was wearing a t shirt..and that the hand she had been holding was very cold and wet...i hear that story and typing it now, already gives me goosebumps...after that, we ciao and promised to not go exploring again..but the promise was broken when we went to BB cemetary earlier this year which was more frightening..-_-</p>
