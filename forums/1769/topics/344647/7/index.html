              <p>Reminds me of "The Eye" movie. The actress was seated, trying to
              learn caligraphy from where she saw someone standing at the corner
              or the room. That "someone" said "why are you sitting in my chair!"
              Then suddenly the "someone" dart towards her with arm
              outstretched!</p>
              <p>I guess me quite lucky. Never had any serious encounters in any
              hospitals or army camps. The most spooky was having the feeling
              something else was around, and noises &amp; knockings in a hotel
              room.</p>

              <p>Than my colleague's friend had a dream that night. She dreamt of the house when it was newer and she saw 3 women in the garden having tea. she could not see their face but she asked them in her dream if they used to live here and if they were ghosts. They replied yes and she woke up.</p>
              <p>Nothing happened in Oz after that but when she came back to SG, she changed. She couldn't cook or bake anymore though she used to be an excellent cook and she feared the sun. She quit her job and stayed at home. She couldn't seem to take light at all.</p>

              <p>Ooh ooh..OCH..went there twice..once at Thursday morning at 4am...5 of my friends..just go there prowling through the wards, the lift, the connector, the morgue, the pharmacy and the infamous "waiting room" but nothing spooky on our first trip..only that the floor was littered with glass fragments..and happened to be it's a full moon..so everything was actually bright and "romantic" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>But the 2nd time, i went there..it was with 5 friends albeit different friends..we started from the entrance with the layout A-B-C-D-E..we made a headcount..heard 5 then we proceed...because C &amp; D were girls..we held hands la as we foraged..because I had been there before..I was A and B also been there before..then, we walked past the lift and the connector to the annex...then we went to the other building..the feeling was overwhelming..like so many pairs looking at u...then, from the lift there..we decided to go back..so we made a headcount..However, after the last person said "5", we heard a deep voice saying 6..it dark and just nice, the torchlight we happened to bring was an old L Torch which is god damn faulty..then, i told my friend "e" not to scare us la..got girls wat..but "E' insisted he didnt say "6" and the voice was in front..So, i decided to modify the headcount by counting your number and make a continous "hummmmm" so u cant say anything..and again, we heard the same voice saying "6" and hummm as well!!!</p>
              <p>Wah lau..in the darkness, we just clawed our way down the staircase and to the carpark because it was a linear pathway..Once on safe grounds, E told one of the girls "D" why she didnt follow the layout and tugged at his arm from behind...but the girl "D' told him she didn't and she was in front of him..and she suddenly was spooked when she looked at E because the hand she was holding was wearing a long sleeved shirt but E was wearing a t shirt..and that the hand she had been holding was very cold and wet...i hear that story and typing it now, already gives me goosebumps...after that, we ciao and promised to not go exploring again..but the promise was broken when we went to BB cemetary earlier this year which was more frightening..-_-</p>
