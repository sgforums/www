              <p>Oh that kind.....yah seen that in action.</p>
              <p>Man goes to do whatever on himself.  So he will always appears charming to the ladies.  Had several affairs and g/fs, in his forties and he is married with wife and kids.</p>
              <p>His kids was like 4 years my junior.</p>
              <p>Anyway, somehow, when he got a single christian woman pregnant, he somehow lost his allure.  He became skinnier, looks older and his age and the glamour was totally lost.</p>
              <p>And his skin developed skin problems which is very obvious on the hands, plus having to juggle between his actual family and his now 2nd family.</p>

              <p>Oh not that .. for the buddha wat i heard was .. That's different way in praying to that .. It gotta do with going clockwise or anti-clockwise praying.</p>
              <p>Yeah, my mum always tell mi if u were to make a wish to him, u gotta said "i will offer u fruits and stuff from singapore" and not "i will come back to buy u offerings"</p>

              <p>First case is when i was realli crazy all this stuff i went and get this amulet from a friend which i realli love alot.. Believe it or not on that very day i went into fits admitted in the hospital, my mum wan mi to give it away but being the sturborn mi i decided to keep it .. Within the week after discharge from hospital i went into fits at home again .. this time worst tho, my left shoulder sorta went out of place .. Whenever i move my shoulder a bit it will have those clenching fist sound and my jaw will have that sound too..</p>
              <p>So after i discharge i gave it back to my friend and i am all fine.</p>
              <p>Second case is there's once i injured the leg and went to a sinseh at Outram park .. and when i went home i discover the amulet i was wearing was gone.. the clip is still with mi no spoil ler.. zz went back and look for it .. Gone =.=</p>
