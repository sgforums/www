Therefore if you take that into consideration, the price of Calmex is not that expensive. In term of taste and texture, I think Calmex is the best.<br><br>Fake Calmex<br>I have seen a few Calmex look alike abalone before. Just take note, Calmex cans are printed, while fakes are using paper labels.<br><br></div>
