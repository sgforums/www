You are just unfortunate to work under a bit[b]</strong>ch.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> [/b]</blockquote>Maybe you're right.<br><br>Three days ago, my lady manager accused me of not going thru her on certain things.  She said that I didn't show her my press release and she only got to see it on the day of the event.  I explained to her that it was the same one sent to her which she has no time to look at it.  The same copy was amended by my Group Director which was directly sent to the media and cc to me and my manager.<br><br>I saw her email address on the cc list.  So I thought I didn't have to forward to her.<br><br>Now a few weeks later, she accused me of not showing to her.  She insisted that the Group Director didn't cc to her.  She refused to listen to what I said.<br><br>I went back to my desk and found in my inbox that the Group director did send to both of us.  And it's not only it one email, but two emails - one to SPH reporter, one to CNA.<br><br>I have the urge to forward this two to her and cc to the Group Director, telling her that I want to clear this misunderstanding.<br><br>But then, she is sensitive and petty.  If I do that, instead of clearing the misunderstanding, she might get more petty about it.  She will be embarassed and remember it forever.<br><br>What should I do, if I want to stay in this job?<br><br>This is not the first time and won't be the last time she is like that.  That time, she accused my staff for not following up on something.  When I checked with my staff (I also cannot remember so many things), my staff already email to her and cc to me, awaiting for her approval.<br><br>I have been angry at her every day and her voice, her footstep really zaps off my energy.  The other job offer is still open for me.  I guess I just hop over there.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've had about 5 lady bosses since I embarked on my career more than 10 years ago. 4 of them suck but my present one is marvellous, to say the least!<br><br>Lady bosses suck primarily because they tend to let their emotions dictate and thus become very wishy washy and lose the plot. This indecisiveness gives me endless headache as not having a common objective, it's impossible for me to produce the work that satisfies her.<br><br>Oso. lady bosses suck becoz they seem to pick on your short-comingsrather han your merits- no matter you have 100 merits and only 1 weakness, the lady boss will only see your flaw and disregard your strengths.<br><br>My present boss oso a lady is the exception from the norm. I can honestly say she's probably the best boss I've ever had to this day. Not only is she dynamite personified, she's oso very task-oriented: when there's work to do, do it to the best of your abilities and when it's time to relax and play, play hard! She's very flexible and fine with almost anything so long as you take care to get your work performed.<br><br>In addition, she is very easy going and associates with the staff as if we're one big family. She loves to share jokes and laughs loudly with us. She makes the staff feel very comfortable and our bond with her is very strong: She is us and we are she kind of thing.<br><br>Lasy but not least, she's got great looks to boot!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
