              <p>he swam.. if you want to pay &gt;50% taxes in order to have enough people to patrol the borders so much so that it becomes like a police state, then put your hand up...</p>
              <p>section 55 was talked about so much by the bleeding hearts.. so much so that i think the branch was actually disbanded...</p>
              <p>as for complacency, we have told people again and again that all it takes is one... civilians forget that when we refer everyone who has problems with passports to be checked thoroughly... and when we do, everyone rides the guys' ass about it.. from the goddamned CAS to the people who have problem passports.. that includes assholes who "lose" their passports, report it lost, find it again and continue to use the "lost" passport... at least 3 to 4 hours of everyone's time is wasted...</p>
              <p>as for the "fake passport"... do you know that the people over on the other side actually sell real passports? i'm betting the PRC side found him.. and he admitted it.. and they reported it as a "fake passport"</p>
              <p>we've seen way too many real passports held by people who have other identities.. because they "paid someone" to make one...</p>
              <p>what i question is TR's agenda... it doesn't matter to them if they get just one side of the story, mudraking is the be all and end all</p>
              <p>btw.. in order to handle the volume of travellers, the guys have been rostered about 2x the amount of OT this month... this is for all the people who kpkb about "why is this place that place not manned" and if it is, "why are the so many people when there is no traffic"</p>
