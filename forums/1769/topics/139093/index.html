            <div class='col-md body'>How do you know if it's time? I got a bit sad yesterday knowing that I'll only be his girlfriend for a few days more, because he is going to ask something sometime this week. I want to say yes, but I don't really want to change the status quo yet. I think he's asking it because we're moving in, and he doesn't want others to speak bad of me. He says it's because he wants to move on to another level with me. How can he be so sure that I'm the right person? I can be a damn b itch sometimes, and get into a war of words with people cutting queue on me. Why would he want to be with someone so bitc hy and gets excited so easily? What if he thinks I'm this angel whom I am not? Of course I believe he's seen the worst of me, but somehow am still convinced he''s not aware I can be a real b itch.<br><br>This is so self-indulgent. I would appreciate any comments and drops of wisdom from you kind souls here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well foxy, to be honest I was not ready to get married too because I relish the gf status. It is truly a leap of faith to change the status because people do get comfortable with what they are in now. It is obvious that you love him alot so that shouldn't be an issue.<br><br>I guess for your parents, it is up to you and him to change their mindset. You have to stand strong with each other and each have to exercise patience because the worst thing both of you can do is fight with each other over this. If he wants to marry you, he will persevere to change their minds about him.<br><br>Chris and I still joke to this day when we show each other our chao guan "I warned ya!!! You were the one who insisted on marrying me"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> It helped to lighten the situation, though he would grumble in a light hearted manner "Wo bei pian leh"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I don't think the romance bit has lessen. Guys do need reminding sometimes and when both are busy and tired from work, sometimes romance is the last thing on your minds. It is the little thoughts and actions that count.</div>

I want to say yes, but I don't really want to change the status quo yet. I think he's asking it because we're moving in, and he doesn't want others to speak bad of me. He says it's because he wants to move on to another level with me. How can he be so sure that I'm the right person? I can be a damn b itch sometimes, and get into a war of words with people cutting queue on me. Why would he want to be with someone so bitc hy and gets excited so easily?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi foxwalk, perhaps I can share.<br>You mentioned: "How do you know I'm not ready? When do you know you are ready?". The fact that you are asking these qns, which is a good thing, means you have many doubts and are not ready. You are ready when you know you won't and cannot imagine dating another guy, spending days and nights with any other guy but your bf. You'll know when you feel truly that he's the one.<br><br>You also mentioned something about "it's darn hard to say goodbye on Sun nites". This is not the reason to get married. Neither is living together the reason to get married. This is the time when you're so lovey-dovey over each other, passions run high when you see each other...very romantic and one of the best part of being in love, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but I don't think it's the time to get married yet.<br><br>Personally, I say: don't live togther before marriage. Not that I'm an old prude, but statistics and real life cases have shown that couples who live in together and then get married, tend not to have very lasting marriages. In the case of my friends - the couple lived together, and eventually did not get married. Reason: they got to know each other perhaps too well, and there was no commitment to stop them from dropping out. Dropping out is easy, the difficult part is staying together, in sickness and in health, blah blah...<br><br>All the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys, i was clearing old emails today and came across something i've kept and still find meaningful.<br><strong><br>A SOULFUL RELATIONSHIP by Rev. Ronald McFadden</strong><br><br>If you're not married yet, share this with a friend. If you are married, share it with your spouse or other married couples and reflect on it.<br><br>An African proverb states, "Before you get married, keep both eyes open, and after you marry, close one eye."<br><br>Before you get involved and make a commitment to someone, don't let lust, desperation, immaturity, ignorance, pressure from others or a low self-esteem, make you blind to warning signs. Keep your eyes open, and don't fool yourself that you can change someone or that what you see as faults aren't really important.<br><br>Once you decide to commit to someone, over time his or her flaws, vulnerabilities, pet peeves, and differences will become more obvious. If you love your mate and want the relationship to grow and evolve, you've got to learn to close one eye and not let every little thing bother you. You and your mate have many different expectations, emotional needs, values, dreams, weaknesses, and strengths. You are two unique individual children of God who have decided to share a life together.<br><br>Neither of you are perfect, but are you perfect for each other? Do you bring out the best in each other?<br><br>Do you compliment and compromise with each other, or do you compete, compare, and control? What do you bring to the relationship? Do you bring past relationships, past hurt, past mistrust, past pain? You can't take someone to the altar to alter him or her. You can't make someone love you or make someone stay.<br><br>If you develop self-esteem, spiritual discernment, and "a life", you won't find yourself making someone else responsible for your happiness or responsible for your pain.<br><br>Manipulation, control, jealousy, neediness, and selfishness are not the ingredients of a thriving, healthy, loving and lasting relationship! Seeking status, sex, wealth, and security are the wrong reasons to be in a relationship. What keeps a relationship strong?<br><br>Communication, intimacy, trust, a sense of humor, sharing household tasks, some getaway time without business or children and daily exchanges (a meal, shared activity, a hug, a call, a touch, a note).  Leave a nice message on the voicemail or send a nice email.<br><br>Sharing common goals and interests. Growth is important. Grow together, not<br>away from each other, giving each other space to grow without feeling insecure.<br><br>Allow your mate to have outside interest. You can't always be together. Give<br>each other a sense of belonging and assurances of commitment.<br><br>Don't try to control one another. Learn each other's family situation. Respect<br>his or her parents regardless.<br><br>Don't put pressure on each other for material goods. Remember for richer or for poorer. If these qualities are missing, the relationship will erode as resentment, withdrawal, abuse, neglect, dishonesty, and pain replace the passion.<br><br>The difference between 'United' and 'Untied' is where you put the "i".<br></div>
