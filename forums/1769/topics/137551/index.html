            <div class='col-md body'>The article below really touched me and in a way it is a little related to the shame article Eric posted.<br><br>Here are two women with almost nothing and yet are house-proud and takes pride in finding work to support themselves as they feel there are others worst off, and yet at the same time in society, we see and hear young able-bodied people complaining about hard work and reaching out their hands for handouts, which is really distastful.<br><br>I wonder what direction is Singapore, as a society headed towards as I see lots of young people go through their lives aimlessly, expecting handouts or just work enough to feed themselves through the week.<br><br>I know there are still people who are striving hard for the best but it seems to be a small minority to me and as a young working person, it is really disheartening to think how Singapore will end up in the future. Will the younger generation of Singapore have the fighting spirit of the 2 sisters below or will they just wallow in self-pity and complain that the hand-outs are not enough? I really wonder.<br><br><strong>Taken from The Electronic Newpaper:</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Surviving with quiet pride<br>By Low Ching Ling<br><br>June 17, 2005<br><br>THEIRS is a story many Singaporeans would be familiar with. Wanting a permanent roof over their head, the two sisters bought the two-room flat they were living in.<br><br>They drained their CPF and savings and even borrowed money to own the flat. They had moved into the flat more than two decades ago and bought it from the HDB for $40,000 in 2000.<br><br>The fully-paid-up flat is now worth about $90,000 on the open market. Yet, the two elderly women have no money for beds - or even for a proper meal. And now one of them is critically ill. They don't want to sell their flat because they feel insecure about renting one.<br><br>It's a problem many Singaporeans will face as the country greys: being asset-rich but cash-poor. According to the 2000 census, there are a total of 231,334 people aged 65 and above. Of this, 15,313 live alone and another 2,816 live with other elderly people.<br><br>Madam Ng rubbing medicated oil on her elder sister's chest after she collapsed on Saturday morning after a heart attack.<br>These figures are expected to increase as the population ages. But the stats don't mean much to these sisters at the moment.<br><br>It was surviving with quiet pride that was most on their minds. They refused to accept handouts. Life for them was about sieving through rubbish for newspapers and cardboard boxes and holding the odd job.<br><br>With that, they lived. The boxes they didn't sell were turned into beds. They wrapped the flattened boxes in plastic sheets so they would stay clean longer. This was the life they knew for nearly two decades - after the elder sister, Miss Ng Say Noy, had a stroke.<br><br>Their sad life got worse last week when Miss Ng, 72, suffered a heart attack. Doctors at Singapore General Hospital have told the younger sister, Miss K N Ng, 60, that there is no chance of recovery.<br><br>The younger Miss Ng is devastated. Choking back tears, she said: 'I'm very troubled. I don't want to be left alone. My sister and I have been together for so long.' She has been shuttling to and from the hospital every day since her sister suffered the heart attack on Saturday.<br><br>It was at 10.30am and the elder sister had just sold some cardboard boxes. All of a sudden she collapsed on the same trolley she depended on for her livelihood. The younger Miss Ng desperately rubbed medicated oil on her sister's chest.<br><br>Mr Joseph Tan, who owns the recycling company they sold their junk to, called an ambulance. By then, Miss Ng said, her sister was losing consciousness. Now she knows the older woman's life is ebbing away.<br><br>She said: 'The doctors said she couldn't be saved.' SGH declined to discuss the older woman's medical condition, citing patient confidentiality.<br><br>For many years, the sisters have relied on each other for support and comfort.<br><br>DIFFICULT LIFE<br>Life was okay until the elder sister suffered a stroke in 1987. Her speech became slurred and she could not use her right hand for work.<br><br>The older woman used part of her CPF savings, from her work as a cleaner, to pay her medical bills. When she ran out of money, she became a rag-and-bone woman, making between $2 and $5 a day.<br><br>The younger Miss Ng held several odd jobs over the years. Together, the sisters earned barely $1,000 a month. Miss Ng said her sister withdrew about $12,000 from her CPF account when she turned 55, but spent most of it on her medical expenses over the years.<br><br>Because of a heart problem, she needed medication every three months and that cost more than $100 each time. They knew they had no-one else to turn to, and decided to buy their Beach Road flat. Until then, they had been paying rent of $60 a month.<br><br>Miss Ng said she used most of her CPF savings, about $30,000, and another $1,000 from her sister's CPF savings, to pay for it. The rest, she borrowed from her friends.<br><br>'In the last few years, I gradually used my savings to pay them back,' she said. She said she has repaid all the debts. Early last month, she quit her mail-sorter job.<br><br>'They wanted me to work a 12-hour shift from 8pm to 8am,' she said. 'But I couldn't do it as I was worried my sister would get an attack while I was out (she had a heart attack last year), so I had no choice but to leave.' But bills had to be paid. So Miss Ng helped her sister collect junk instead. Until the second heart attack on Saturday.<br><br>Now, she worries about the hospital bills. She said: 'I have enough savings to support myself, but definitely not enough to pay the hospital bills. 'SGH said there's no more money in my sister's Medisave account, and I don't have much in mine. I hope I can find a job soon.'<br><br>An SGH spokesman said the hospital's medical social worker is discussing financial assistance with Miss Ng.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>'THERE ARE OTHERS WORSE OFF'<br>WHY not sell their two-room flat?<br><br>Such flats sell for $80,000 to $90,000 on the resale market, a property agent said. But Miss Ng, who received little formal education, knows only that she and her sister want a roof over their heads. So they lived modestly.<br><br>Most meals consist of a loaf of bread or a packet of economy rice. One packet for two sisters, she said on Monday. The furniture and household items in their two-room flat in Beach Road were either all discarded or given to them by ex-neighbours who had moved, Miss Ng said.<br><br>Their beds are plastic-covered cardboard boxes. Their pillows and bolsters, also wrapped in plastic, were gifts from neighbours years ago.<br><br>Miss Ng said: 'We try not spend more than $2 for the rice, so we usually order vegetables.' She said utilities cost about $50 a month, and conservancy fees over $20 a month.<br><br>HOUSE PROUD<br>The sisters are house-proud.<br><br>The junk they collected was stacked neatly.<br><br>Miss Ng offered us her last packet of green tea, insisting on being hospitable. And we had to insist before she finally accepted the biscuits, instant noodles and Milo that we had brought her.<br><br>A care centre for the elderly nearby offers free food, but she refuses to go there, saying: 'There are others worse off than me.'<br><br>The sisters lost their father when they were young women. Their mother died more than 10 years ago. Their brother moved out after he got married.<br><br>Miss Ng said her brother, a taxi driver, is unable to help them out as he has to raise three kids alone after his wife died of cancer some years ago.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SHE FOUND A JOB ON HER OWN<br><br>MS Kris Lee of the Central CDC said Miss K N Ng was referred to them last year by Mr Loh Meng See, MP for Jalan Besar GRC. Miss Ng told them she needed a job, not money. 'Our job placement officer subsequently gave her two job offers,' said Ms Lee. Miss Ng said she did not take them up as she had found a job by herself.<br><br>A social service officer visited Miss Ng last week. Again, Miss Ng insisted she needed 'only employment, not financial assistance'. When we asked if Miss Ng will get any financial help, Ms Lee said the CDC will work with SGH's medical social worker to help.<br><br>The CDC will also help her find a nursing home if she needs it and will help with the fees.<br><br></span></div>

What I like to call, the Oprah's Couch Mentality?  Y'know, it goes something like, 'I was abused as a kid, that's why I turned out like that!'<br><br>Well, a little knowledge is a good thing, but some end up wielding what little they know as a sort of shield to excuse them from taking responsibility for their actions.<br><br>Also, it could be that we live in good times and if you grow up without encountering any hardship whatsoever, you won't be able to withstand any when tough times come a-calling.<br><br>The fact that both parents could be too busy working to earn a good living to spend time with their kids and inculcate good values in them also means that the kids grow up without a lot of morals and good sense in them.  A few of them might even grow up as 'spoilt brats'.  There's this famous thing about working parents feeling guilty about not being able to spend quality time with their kids and they 'compensate' by giving them material things and indulging in them.<br><br>Do you think I will learn the value of working hard if I grow up in a household where all I had to do to get what I wanted was to ask for money from my parents?</div>
