With my current job, really no body tells me much WHAT I shd do, HOW MUCH time I shd spend on work. Yet ironically, I do spend much of my time in work preparation even during weekends simply cos I enjoy what I do, and I feel a duty towards my kids. I used to enjoy my previous job a lot too - but thanks to the above reason - the lack of gratification and opportunity to 're-fuel' the passion just ends up killing the entire interest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure there must be an internal memo somewhere in the ivory towers of the PAP that reads like this:<br><br>" - to ensure Singapore's attractiveness to foreign companies by banning strikes, getting rid of unions(except those we control directly), and showing that we do not give a damn about our workers. This will give companies the freedom to abuse employees so as to keep costs low. And higher profits by these companies means more tax income for us......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah.. the Chronicle of the Evil Cleaner<br><br>Once Upon A Time, in BoringOfficeLand... there resides an innocent and hopelessly overworked Admin Staff. She spends her day labouring over difficult menial tasks -  taking on StubbornSupervisors and VendorsWithVendettas - with nary a complaint. Only hoping.. that the Feudal Lord of the Land, ErraticBoss, will leave her alone and not assault her with more FiLing.<br><br>One day, after a particularly tiring night, she awoke to find a RAT in an old PIZZA BOX. Flabbergasted, she knew it was a sign. It was a sign from the Clan of Evil Cleaners that she will be the next in line to be assasinated by the deadly Chlorine.<br><br>She decided to call Management, but was appalled to find out that Management had been subdued. As she trembled at her desk, wondering what she could do, what route she could take... she remembered that there is always ONE department she could always rely on!! TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE!</div>
