              <p>Hello people</p>
              <p>Need advise pls.  I choose to ask here cuz ppl here more mature and are wiser.  Other forums (dun wan to say which one) will have trolls or shallow answers. </p>
              <p>Last year, we (the whole division) were told that the main office (aka headquarter) is lacking of space and we were to move out of the place to another office in Boon Lay (most of us live in the East :(  ) </p>
              <p>I always have waking up problem cuz of my personal/family commitment after work which causes me to reach home only after 8.30 pm every evening.  Hence, I have been taking taxi to work (the headquarter office is not near any MRT station and neither my home).</p>
              <p>Hence, with the annoucement, I forsee my taxi fare expenses going up by 100% (ie. I usually spend about $15.00 taxi fare, I will end up spending $30 each morning after we move to the new office).  Another divison director sounded me out my interest in doing something else which is jackpot operations, something that I thought of doing when I first joined the company.  I was keen so I spoke with my director back then.  I told him my distance problem and my eagerness in doing something new in the jackpot side. </p>
              <p>However, my director wasn't keen to transfer me there, but was willing to help me get a transfer or some other way to let me stay in the same office.  Then, suddenly he got a job offer and he left.  My division became kinda shaken without a director and now everyone reports to the 2nd highest boss in the organisation while waiting for the new head to come in (which will take god-knows-how-long).  Before my boss left, he told the big boss my concern about the distance but did not mention a word about my interest in jackpot operations.</p>
              <p>So after he left, I went to see the big boss and expressed my intention.  He said he was aware but putting me in jackpot will be a lower priority.  He offered to put me in one of the two other divisions which I am totally not keen.  He said I can contribute a lot more in those areas.  He also said my transferred will be put on hold while waiting for a new head.</p>
              <p>Recently, the head of a division (one of suggested division by the big boss) called to say that he is offering me the post cuz his staff just tendered and he's willing to groom me to the next level.  He's kinda pushy cuz he is not giving me a lot of time to think.  I ask him to give me one week, but he said only give me this weekend to think.  Which means that tomorrow I have to give him my reply.</p>
              <p>My concern is:</p>
              <p>My current division is really shaky.  There are only three heads in this divisions and I am one of them.  My big boss recently commented to me that the other two heads look very unstable.  It makes me feel like a traitor if I were to accept another offer.  Also I was hoping to settle this division and the new boss, before revisiting my transfer.  I feel this way is fairer to my current division. </p>
              <p>I have assessed the offer and so on.  Frankly, I do see pros in taking the offer.  Not so much the possible promotion, but I intend to take up courses and the schools are located in town (the division that offered me is located the headquarter and the HQ is nearer town). </p>
              <p>But I heard ppl saying that the division director who offered me the post is not easy person.  I also know that that division is very tough.  So many ppl resigned since I joined. </p>
              <p>So now, I dunno whether I should say yes or not.</p>
              <p>Should I say yes, do you think it's wise to request to take at least one of the existing capable staff from my current division?</p>
              <p>Pls give me advise.  Thank you very much in advance. </p>

              <p>i think you should wait a bit more. the current offer does not seem to be very promising, as you have already highlighted the cons in your future division. if things dont work out, you have no job. or have to crawl back to your old division. very paiseh.</p>
              <p>as you can still afford to wait, check what your company is doing about the relocation. some companies will begin to charter a bus for their employees (in fact, most companies located in jurong do this to some extent). and if there is a bus being planned for your area, you can probably skip the taxi and take the company bus.</p>
