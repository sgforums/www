I had a few friends who kenna this too. Agree that it is very difficult to make parents happy if they have fixed idea in their mind liao. A couple friends of mine agreed with both sides' parents that all angpows will be used to defray the cost but eventually after the wedding, the angpows given to the parents all they kept and gave reasons for 'keeping'.

            <div class='col-md body'>i remember there was once a very similar topic in club 30 with very similar sentiments expressed by the same people here. rather nostalgic... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>wish i can find what i posted originally so i dun have to repeat all that again but i think schrodingerscat puts it pretty well below.<br><br>when i was younger, i never relished the prospect of having a tradition chinese wedding dinner. it seems such a waste of money n time. now, i still dun relish it, but i'd do it for my parents and my s.o.'s parents if they want it. and i know my parents would definitely want it.<br><br>so what if most of the people there are virtual strangers to me? they're all here because they're celebrating MY wedding and being happy for ME. i know i always feel happy for the wedding couple, no matter how boring the dinner and/or the company is. and i'd like to think that's true of everyone, even if it may not be 100% true. but hey, i'm idealistic, at times and so long as that makes me happy... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>most importantly, i view the wedding as much my parents' as mine. because they've worked hard bringing me up, loving me and teaching me. when i get married, i'm sure it must be something very significant and important to them too, as much as it is to me. why shouldn't it be THEIR celebration too?<br><br>i'd think i'd be truly selfish if i say my wedding concerns only me and my husband-to-be.<br><br>of course, i'm not saying those of you who don't want chinese wedding dinners are selfish. definitely not. it really depends on each person's individual circumstances and points of view. there's no right or wrong. just a matter of perspective.<br><br>and so far, from what i heard of my friend's wedding dinners, seems like most of them break even. even my friend who had 80 tables at a 5-star hotel. even managed to earn bit after paying for the hotel AND beer from brewerkz. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>hmmm... seems like i ended up saying a lot again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> can't help it. it's a topic i feel rather strongly for... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShrodingersCat:</div><div class="quote_body">Mmm.. I used to think this way. Wanted to have a small getogether by the beach with just a few of my closer friends. My parents compromised by letting me do that for my ROM. We eventually had a buffet dinner by an open air site next to the sea for their friends/relatives. BUT in the event that they insist on holding  a dinner at a hotel/restaurant, even if it is not to my own 'taste,  it would be unfair to say that they have no right to have a say in the event at all.<br><br>Unless of course you are not very close to your parents or relatives but... Mmm.. I am glad I went through with the rigmarole. If you see the joy on your parents' face, welcoming the guests' 'congratulations' and feeling so happy that they are introducing their child's marriage, you know its pretty much worth it. I see many of my relatives who congratulate, and gave good wishes when we served tea.. and many of my parents' friends who watched me grow up come forward and tell me they are happy for me. It was fun going for table to table photography and having all the uncles and aunties giggle and make jokes. It was nice to be formally introduced to many of my husband's relatives. It was wonderful to see that some of parents' friends felt so happy for them they even wore coordinated outfits! It was wonderful to see them greeting friends from overseas who turned up specially for the wedding. It was hilarious to see my grandma almost dropping her false teeth into the sea from laughing too much.<br><br>I had my share of problem relatives during the wedding. But.. u know.. who cares?! It was for the people who came, and gave their sincere blessings that the dinner was for.<br><br>I won't force my own children to go through this if they don't want to, but I think I will be very sad if my children don't even give a damn what I think. Because a marriage isn't just about two people. It is about two families.. when his parents are old and sick, you take care of them too and vice versa.  And while the couple doesn't need anyone to formalise their marriage (except the law), if it means somethign to their parents who are older fashioned and brought up in a different way, then its just one night of inconvenience to make both sets of parents happy and find ease in their hearts.<br><br>And honestly, unless a couple really go and find those very expensive tables, most of the time the relatives and friends are kind enough to help offset a lot of the cost. So, I cut the cost off my bridal gown, cut the cost off some limo, cut the cost off my honeymoon - cos these all trappings what. But if a traditional wedding dinner really REALLY means a lot to your parents.. Mmm (not the way they eat and how many there are, but the fact that parents, friends, relatives all gathered together) I am sure there is a compromise that won't disappoint them. </div></blockquote></div>
