You know hallmark cards have a range of those.. nowadays.. with the money holder.<br><br>Or if the person give you a shopping voucher? Is it still consider bad to you?<br><br>How about the wedding gift registry customs common in the states where you just choose a gift within your budget from a list of items couples state they want?<br><br>What about repeated gifts? What would you do with gifts you do not want/already have one of/can't keep cos lack of space/don't fit in with decor? (I had a total of 3 bibles given to me for my wedding <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br>Asking cos I am wondering if the angpow custom is distasteful to you because<br><br>1. you feel that people 'expect' angpow so it is not very nice.<br>2. cash is involved so it is not nice.<br>3. you feel that people 'expect' a certain amount cos it is not nice<br>4. Because it is cash IN an angpow which has all of the above connotations.<br>5. None of the above...<br><br>How abt giving angpows during wedding? I gave my cousins, brothers etc angpows too during my customary. Do you think that should be abolished too and replace with something else?<br><br>A friend of mine sent me $50 cash with a thank you card for helping out after her  wedding. She said it was because most weddings the bride/grooms will give angpow to their jiemeis/brothers, but they didn't have a customary but still appreciate the help we gave for wrapping her favours etc. What do you all feel about that? </div></blockquote>It's tasteless because it intimidates those who come to at least come with one... and it's tasteless because it is NO longer given out of free will, but with much obligation. And the amount given is no longer given because that's what you think you can give but given to defray how much each table cost.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
