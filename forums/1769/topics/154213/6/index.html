It's more the... not keeping to the agreement than their intentions. They definitely didnt make any money worth talking about though.</div>

So that is a bonus after the wedding, not a requisite of whether you should hold it or not. it is not as if you KNOW they will be generous then you hold it.<br><br>But it is true that yes, I guess those who are positive abt chinese wedding dinners are probably closer to their families, relatives, and even parents' friends so don't consider doing it as much an ordeal compared to others. (even if we also have problems with relatives etc too)<br><br>Anyway I know it is difficult to hold a simple wedding dinner to compromise when parents. What I feel is not fair is to make a decision thinking that parents have absolutely no say in it. Of course.. (heh heh) you can ask and try to compromise and if eventually they demand ridiculous things that is really impossible for you to achieve...  then yes, I think you just have to do enough to make sure your heart feels good about it.<br><br>But of course, if your heart feels good about doing things your own way without asking them.. hehehe.. well that's up to the individual too.<br></div>

I had the shock of my life!!<br><br>- Mom says dad will have like 10 tables of guests, she will have 15, the in-laws wanted 10, and including my brother and his wife's guests, it's a grand total of 45 tables!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>At $800 per table, that makes it a grand total of... *gasp...

I mean afterall they are the ones getting married.<br><br>There is a limit to respecting your elders I think and unless they are paying for it I don't see why do you have to invite so many strangers.<br><br>In my case, Chris and I were pretty firm about the number of guests. Sure we did allow them to add but we said anything more and we are not paying for it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ....then again, that was our ROM because we are scrapping the wedding dinner because we think that it is a waste of time and money.<br><br>But that's us.

At the end of the day, what matters most is how both sets of parents feel. If a wedding banquet's going to make them happy and proud, whether or not it's a "face" issue, it seems such a small matter in comparison to the sacrifices they've very likely have had to make bringing us up and giving us the best that they can.  I couldn't possibly be happy on what is supposed to be the happiest day of my life if my parents weren't. And the man I chose to spend the rest of my life with would I'm sure value his parents' opinions as much.</div>
