(other than university graduation ... ) ... so why not indulge in them a bit ? .... I'll treat it as a debt of gratitude ... for bringing me up ..... think of it ... your big day will be their big day too eh .... it's a life cycle ritual ... a major life event .... not just for you .... ... their kid's grown up and getting married ! ... a milestone in their lives together ....  the circle of life is nearly complete ! .... (cue tears for the mother and mother in-law) .....<br><br>So I wouldn't want to be selfish and deprive them of this moment .... even if a boisterous 10 course dinner and yam sengs all around is not exactly to my taste .... if me and wifey want something simple, we can always have another little "do" on our own eh ....<br><br>We don't live our lives for ourselves alone .... afterall ......<br><br></div>
