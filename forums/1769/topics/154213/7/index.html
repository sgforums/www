Forced to alcoholic drinks when he had alcholic allergy he sipped a little from each glass and went back with rashes, (in the end i got so drunk helping him drink I could bearly keep myself straight.. yes my eldest brother has the same allergy.)

Yes, the happiness, the spirit was there, but the financial burden ended with my parents footing the difference. It's not like we had much savings to last for a long time... and that amount could have benefitted me in the long run if the money was spent on furthering my studies.<br><br>You could have compensated the happiness with some honeymoon trips to other countries.<br><br>We're ridden with debts... housing loans etc... we don't need additional expenses....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>dont worry lah. the dinner will pay for itself. all you need to do is to make sure send out your invitation early, get people to RSVP and dont invite too many muslims for chinese dinner.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what if someone doesn't give u an angpow, but cash inside a wedding card? You know hallmark cards have a range of those.. nowadays.. with the money holder.<br><br>Or if the person give you a shopping voucher? Is it still consider bad to you?<br><br>How about the wedding gift registry customs common in the states where you just choose a gift within your budget from a list of items couples state they want?<br><br>What about repeated gifts? What would you do with gifts you do not want/already have one of/can't keep cos lack of space/don't fit in with decor? (I had a total of 3 bibles given to me for my wedding <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br>Asking cos I am wondering if the angpow custom is distasteful to you because<br><br>1. you feel that people 'expect' angpow so it is not very nice.<br>2. cash is involved so it is not nice.<br>3. you feel that people 'expect' a certain amount cos it is not nice<br>4. Because it is cash IN an angpow which has all of the above connotations.<br>5. None of the above...<br><br>How abt giving angpows during wedding? I gave my cousins, brothers etc angpows too during my customary. Do you think that should be abolished too and replace with something else?<br><br>A friend of mine sent me $50 cash with a thank you card for helping out after her  wedding. She said it was because most weddings the bride/grooms will give angpow to their jiemeis/brothers, but they didn't have a customary but still appreciate the help we gave for wrapping her favours etc. What do you all feel about that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We've become enthused a couple of times over the years about getting married, but something has always come along that's a tad more urgent. Like a mortgage. The mortgage is retreating at a glacial pace as it should. My partner's ever patient mother is waiting for me to make an honest man of her son although she is far too tactful to say so. Of course, we are not planning to get hitched for her sakes.<br><br>We are adamant to keep the thing relatively intimate. So we set out to draft a list which proved to be unexpectedly, hideously tricky. Well meaning friends advised us to invite only the people we really wanted to share our day with. Great advice, if you don't mind sparking off 25 family feuds. Because nobody wants to spend an afternoon with their scary great aunt but your mother will disown you if you let her off the list. And so it goes on. You can't invite some cousins and not others. You can't throw ex-partners plus their respective new loves into the same confined space.<br><br>Then there is the budget. Our parents, generous souls keep offering to pay for the whole bleedy shebang. Which is very nice and all, but sort of unconscionable given that my partner and I are grown adults with dogs, mortgages and station wagons. We are not blushing youths taking that first tentatve step on the path to connubial bliss.<br><br>Meanwhile my bloke and I will flounder about marital possibilities for a bit longer. It's bound to put us off for another couple of years.</div>
