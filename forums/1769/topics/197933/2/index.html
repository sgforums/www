It's also near an Asian enclave where there are tons of Asian restaurants, grocery shops, butchers and seafood mongers and on Saturdays, there's an open-air farmers' market nearby too!<br><br>I'm snug as a bug in my cozy apartment cause I managed to furnish it during the great mid-year sales here and I managed to get some pretty good bargains on electrical appliances and furnishings.

I only buy the papers on weekends - The Age on Saturdays, and The Age, The Australian, and The Herald on Sundays.
