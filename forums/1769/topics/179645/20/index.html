And then, we got shoo'd to go up to the apartment before the bride because everyone who's already in the house has to be huddled into the kitchen to face the window, away from the bride, as she makes her entrance into the apartment.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I was kinda aghast that we had to do that and it wasn't easy cause grandma was on a wheelchair and the other grandma is old and feeble.  So after much struggling, we were all standing there, facing the window and wall.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There was much mumbling and grumbling from yours truly and a few cousins and relatives for the inconvenience and ridiculous superstition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Then another relative explained that it's to prevent antagonising horoscopes from 'clashing' with the bride.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Got such things, ah?<br><br>I think I got a bit pissed seeing the two grandma's being herded with much difficulty into the kitchen and all the other relatives looking kinda stunned to have to do that, so I kinda exclaimed loudly, "So superstitious!!" and shook my head in front of my bro's and sis-in-law's friends.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
