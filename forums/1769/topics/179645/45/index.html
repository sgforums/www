The stories follows... 2 life guards were beaten by a group of lebs. The local, majority anglo decided to sms all their friends and rally on the beach on a given date. Naturally everyone cried racist and such...<br><br>But the background story is that these bastards have come to the beach harrassed the locals with their large groups through intimidation and setting up close to girls who happened to be sun bathing and calling them "sluts" for wearing bikinis.<br><br>Naturally at the peak of this incident an anglican church got burnt down and on the same night my sister inlaws house that was being built also got burnt down, that was near the area.</div>
