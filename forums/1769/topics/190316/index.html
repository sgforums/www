            <div class='col-md body'>hmm..... i agree with what u r trying to say.... i dont think i would ever be able to be with someone just for the sake of money.... but then, i have skills and able to make a living myself.... so, i cannot say for others who may for some reasons not able to do so.... (though i really question that.... well, when there is a will, there's a way.... )....<br><br>someone told me this b4... it is easier not to do anything than putting in efforts to do something and then it fails.... so, mayb for some gals, it is easier to find a rich person than to try to work hard but then still slog and feel miserable....<br><br>i still believe in listening to my heart.... and be truly happy....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm........this is an interesting topic....<br><br>Reminds me of 2 years ago, I got to know this person during a holiday trip. Through long conversations quite a bit of mutual attraction developed....that was until I realised what she did for a living and just how much money she makes(without going into specifics, lets just say its a 6 figure annual income). I backed off and ran like speedy gonzales!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I guess my self-esteem is just not healthy enough to handle such a big disparity. Looking back now, perhaps that was a mistake. Oh well, que sara sara.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lots of women say that they do not mind, but in the long run, resentment will more often that not build up. I know of a couple of blokes who ended up divorced this way. One was laid off and could not find work for nearly a year, the wife got mad at having to bear the brunt of the finances and bailed out on him. so much for "for better or for worse, in sickness and in health" eh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at it from a Christian perspective... you have sin and immorality and hell thrown at you so maybe we don't go there.<br><br>If you look at it from a Buddhist perspective, slightly better but only just. They will still condemn you for your immorality but not because an almighty God is unhappy... and also, some teachings in Buddhism might help. OK pending.<br><br>If you look at it from the Hindu point of view... well it depends on which Hindu god you worship doesn't it? And to purify yourself you carry kavadis on Thaipusum. Not much help either.<br><br>If you look at it from evolutionary / anthropology perspective, you might have some inkling why you do certain things. That is, why you do it. Does not really tell you what to do about it.<br><br>If you discard religion and look at it from an atheist moralist view, then might as well look at it from a religious moral point of view since the material is so much more accessible.<br><br>If you don't look at morality at all and simply ask yourself; what should I do now that I am in this situation... just tell me what to do and don't give me any religious or moral grieve; well that is possible too. In which case you can either go for the winner takes all approach or win win win approach.<br><br>wow I am good at saying so much of nothing at all <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

"survival" is so much like "existence".. where you watch a drama on tv or read about it, where someone makes a decision in order that he/she/it is able to get by...<br><br>the situation mentioned, (pardon my choice of words) is a bit more mercenary... it wasn't for survival but to be able to "live it up"<br><br>can one say this is like "for sale" ? to the detractors in the other topic, what is so different between this one and the other if this one chooses one (again, pardon my lack of a better word) patron instead of many?<br><br>do we have the right to judge her?<br><br>but back to the "survival".. i've watched the documentaries about the tsunami survivors... one thai woman who lost her husband and has to bring up a child, lives with a man who is able to provide for her and her child... they may grow to love each other (they have said that it was more a common need for companionship than anything as he lost his wife to the waves) but for now, she is a housewife tending to his needs at home, while he tends to the financial needs of their little household with his employment... they live frugally because his wages are paltry..<br><br>theirs can be called survival...<br><br>myself, i don't think i'd choose this road, but it is easy for me to say because i do not have to face the kind of adversity the Thai couple faces..<br><br>however, in singapore, i would go with my heart <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOVE comes first. ALL the time.<br><br>I dont know and dont really care if other people do not agree. But this is the decision I would make each time, all the time.<br><br>Money...you can make it all the time. A little, a lot, enough, are choices you made, the lifestyle you lead, lapping in luxures or living spartanly.<br><br>But love, love is not a choice. Love is something that happens. That is a gift. Something that comes to you at times without warning. And passes you by just as quick. Something rare and precious.<br><br>How could I make another choice ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BabyRS:</div><div class="quote_body">A friend of mine just called... and she seems to be facing what she calls a 'dilemma'.<br><br>She's been living with a guy for the past 4 years or so, and she has been pretty much pampered by the easy lifestyle that money brings. Unfortunately, she hasn't been truly happy, it seems - because she mentioned that she has been seeing this other much younger guy whom she loves and totally enjoys being with.<br><br>When queried about the reason as to why she decided to stray, (I haven't spoken to her much, as she never seemed to have 'time' to be with her friends from the time she started going out with her present boyfriend) she mentioned that through time, she realised that they have very little in common and she found his lifestyle totally staid and 'boring'. She was also tired of the objection faced from both their families due to their religious differences. Perhaps its the wide age gap, am not entirely sure; but from the way she sounds, she may be totally at the end of her tethers.<br><br>Now her 'problem' is... she doesn't know if she wants to leave her current boyfriend and give up the material comforts that she is used to for this other guy who makes her happy BUT does not have much to his name. It would mean a complete lifestyle change for her, finding a job... and perhaps living hand to mouth. That may spark problems in the relationship in the future... knowing her as well as I do. She is a bright one - but a tad materialistic.<br><br>If it was me, it wouldn't even have to come to this impasse. If I found myself thinking of even straying, there IS something seriously wrong with my current relationship. Either I work it out... or if its a personality clash, I would go with whatever makes me happy.<br><br>It's a no-brainer decision, to me - but then again, I'm a sucker for love and romance. I wouldn't give a flying fluck if the one I love has money or otherwise... so long as I trust what I feel about him, we will find enough care and love between us to work it out somehow. What's the use of being with anyone for just the sake of the neverending stream of crisp bills in one's wallet when we aren't truly happy?<br><br>Is being practical in this perhaps 'ruthless' world - a form of survival?</div></blockquote>I have a guy who has liked me for about 7 years. His dad is filthy rich and he has always never failed to wonder why I never chose him when he could have given me all the comforts I required for an extravagant lifestyle most people can only dream of. The fact is, I don't love him. Although I felt absolutely sorry for him because despite me incessantly telling him it won't work, he continued his affections for me. I'm glad to say it has finally stopped.<br><br>Like the threadstarter, I do not give a hoot if my other half is rich or poor, or if I have to work three jobs to make ends meet. Happiness always begins from the heart, and to find someone whom you can meet life's REAL problems with and stick together and top each other off with happiness, is the real key to a successful relationship.<br><br>The girl who is seeing the younger guy is only caught up with her materialism. No matter whom she chooses, she will never find the happiness she seeks because she is simply difficult to satisfy due to her current lifestyle which has embedded her craving as a force of habit.<br><br>If she learns to  figure out what she really wants, money, or love, then no matter how much of a a s s h o l e she may seem to others, she cannot deny her own natural characteristic of being materialistic. Unless she learns to be content, and count her blessings, she'll probably realize that she has much more than she can handle.<br><br>My two cents worth. Cheers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
