I do understand that sometimes advertisements, donation appeals and charitable organisations do sugarcoat the reality. It is easy to just gloss over the fact - many would be none the wiser.<br><br>It's different when you know some of these individuals on a personal level. I may be slightly 'biased' in a sense toward their achievements, perhaps because I know that it isn't easy for even those who are of sound mind and body to go through life. Many times we are faced with problems and obstacles that may prove too much to handle for some - so much so that people who have less than most do and yet go on the best way they know how - earn my respect twice over.<br><br>Somehow they make me rethink my life, my problems, and my burdens... and suddenly what I may face isn't so bad, after all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It's vice versa, your words are too nice, like a speech of a politician who wants to get many voices in the election, or a speech of Miss Universe on the world peace or hunger in the world. Your attitudes are fine and you always present them polically correct, but sometimes , atleast from my view and I think the others will not agree with me, if the words are too nice and you make the article too touchy, it looks fake. I think it's only my view becasue I don't like anything mushy and I even hate women's magazines, so don't worry, it's only me who has a "problem" , not you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You should publish in magazines, if it already isn't your job.

I would never intentionally "manipulate" others into seeing my points of view - although on another level, it may seem inclined to be so.
