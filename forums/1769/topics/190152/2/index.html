Personally, if one were to be upset and full of anger about what life has dished out for them - the people around them who may genuinely care for their well being, WILL suffer. It's all about your outlook on life.<br><br>Be positive, and learn from past mistakes... or just keep on wallowing in self pity and moan about how unfair life has been to them - the choice is up to each and every one of you.<br><br>As for your question on 'harrassment' - resilience in this context may or may not apply. I think you may have taken my sentence wrongly. By resilience, in this instance, I mean being strong enough to perhaps stand for what they believe in and not bow down to societal pressures, and not get discouraged by a setback or two.<br><br>When one is harrassed - you either choose to grin and bear it, for fears only answerable to yourself, OR you fight for your rights NOT to subject yourself to such a situation, even if it means that your job or your family is at stake. It's about taking control of your own life against everything else - and THAT, on its own - can be viewed as a form of 'resilience'.</div>

Overall our service standard is not very good, but there ARE service personnel out there who go above and beyond their duties to ensure that customers are happy. I've been on the receiving end of such service. Not often, but enough to know that there are such people around. Like I mentioned in another thread, human interaction is 2 way. Sometimes how you behave also determines what kind of service you end up receiving.<br><br>Or..perhaps people cannot remember because they take it for granted?</div>
