              <p>string of bad luck with lunch today. conference call ran late, so zero food and i settled for curry puffs (potato curry puffs as labelled). it turned out to be sardine. it was still ok since i could pop by the stall to exchange. the second round turned out to be sardine as well.</p>

              <p><br>reminds me of this retirees gathering event I had at the station.</p>
              <p>I had this old malay retired officer.  I know him by face, since I've ever seen him on occasions since I joined the force 16 years back.</p>
              <p>He has his white cap on.  (Those they wear when they have been to Haj?)  And he wasnt eating at the buffet.</p>
              <p>I asked him why, and he cannot be sure that the Halal Buffet we catered is really cooked by a Malay chef.  I didnt dare to lie to him. So I told him I really not sure.</p>
              <p>But instead of the buffet, I have malaysian bought halal certified milk cereals at my cubicle and asked him whether he wouldnt mind one cup.</p>
              <p>His face lighted up, and I simply drop my chores/duties that night, rushed to get my real ceramic mugs and make him a mug of milk cereals and bring back to him.</p>
              <p>I forgot to tell him.  I am not halal certified cereal milk pourer and stirrer.  And my mug is also not halal.</p>
              <p>is it okay?</p>

              <p><br>Another event, where we got catering to cater vegetarian food for the event, because the main interviewer for the event is a high ranking office and he is vegetarian.</p>
              <p>The caterer was informed that we wanted vegetarian food and they came out 3 dishes for our little event.</p>
              <p>Fried bee hoon, stir fried veggies &amp; a vegetables curry.</p>
              <p>We little people that is working on that day, has to be there early, and we have to start eating first before the crowds comes in.</p>
              <p>So finally, I noticed that there is char siew in the fried bee hoon.  Called the caterer and they assured us that its vegetarian fake meat.</p>
              <p>Then much later, I found 'hae bee' in the stir fry veggies.</p>
              <p>Gave up calling the caterer to argue with them.</p>
              <p>When the interviewer came, I can only try to warn him that the stir fry veggies is dodgy, and the caterer swears by their neck that the bee hoon meat is fake meat.</p>
              <p>I cannot in good conscience tells him otherwise.  He ends up drinking milk tea for the whole of that day.</p>

              <p><br>Bus drivers are issued with a rule, that whoever is standing within the bus stop, they have to properly align the head of the bus to the line at at the bus park for passengers to embark.</p>
              <p>Failure to do so, will result in penalties for the bus driver.  Cannot say wan.</p>
