              <strong><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">
              <p>Foreign population growth slows down</p>
              </span></strong><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">
              <p>SINGAPORE: In A sign of things to come, the pace of growth of the foreign population in Singapore has hit the brakes.</p>
              <p>After two years of double-digit increase and five years of an acceleration in the influx of non-residents - since the last time the Singapore economy had stalled - their numbers grew by 4.8 per cent from June last year to this June.</p>
              <p>Still, it was enough to tip the total population to almost 5 million in a recession-hit Singapore.</p>
              <p>The biggest jump - looking at the growth trends in recent years - was among permanent residents (PRs). After averaging an annual increase of 9.9 per cent over the decade leading up to 2000 - and smaller annual growth rates in the new millennium - the number of PRs grew 11.5 per cent, as of this June, from the year before.</p>
              <p>The "period of uncertainty" that has clouded the world's economies - and by extension, has curbed the growth momentum in Singapore's non-resident population here of 14.9 per cent in 2007 and 19 per cent last year - is also the reason for the double-digit increase in the number of PRs here, said CIMB-GK economist Song Seng Wun.</p>
              <p>"It's not unexpected ... These people could have become PRs to stay in Singapore or Asia to look for jobs. They ... are using Singapore as a launching pad," he told Today.</p>
              <p>Singapore's population density is now 6,814 people per square kilometre, compared to 5,900 per sq km in 2000.</p>
              <p>Mr Song said: "For the moment, Singapore's infrastructure is adequate. The infrastructure is continually being upgraded."</p>
              <p>The Population Trends 2009 report published online yesterday by the Singapore Department of Statistics also showed that other trends in ageing and marriage in Singapore continue to hold steady.</p>
              <p>The proportion of persons living alone now stands at 10 per cent, from 8.2 per cent in 2000 and 5.2 per cent in 1990.</p>

              <p><br>what to do?</p>
              <p>the guy gets the PR because, there is no way for the immigration people to prove that it is a scam.. especially when the registrar of the university is corrupt..</p>
              <p>this would involve proving that the university is corrupt..</p>
              <p>loads of others who got their degrees through hard work would fight tooth and nail to uphold it...</p>
              <p>and if you just throw the guy out, some bleeding heart liberal will call this "unfair" and all kinds of other shit...</p>
              <p>just look at what happened in Calais... the authorities move in to clear out the illegal immigrant camps and the liberals move in to defend the illegals from the cops..</p>
