              <p><br>Nah.....I give up liao.</p>
              <p>Will still look, though not hurrying liao.  Its placing too much expectation and pressures on people around me.</p>
              <p>Am now going to relax, look slowly, reshuffle my plans to suit the pace of those around me.</p>
              <p>I already lost a lot of family and friends and I expect that with my kinda suay luck this year.  There is more to lose.</p>
              <p>But, thats in a good way.  At least I got my cynical humour back.  I aged a few years for it.  Buts its worth it.</p>
              <p>At least when I die, I know how much I repaid my debts.</p>

              <p>I'm not gonna poke fun of her command of English, because my own proficiency in it has been going downhill since my A Levels..... but I would recommend that she attend classes in diction and public speaking at the British Council.</p>
              <p>As for her crimes, really, it looks as though she's trying to downplay the severity of her crimes. She doesn't seem to get the point that:</p>
              <p>1. 65 charges of theft, fraud and impersonation over two months are not 'a moment of folly'.</p>
              <p>2. Yes, we all make mistakes, but few of us commit offences chargeable in court, let alone crimes of that magnitude. </p>
              <p>3. She should have declared her conviction at the point of registration and not only after winning the competition.</p>
              <p>For goodness' sake, beauty queens in the US have been stripped of their titles for less than this. She should just take the honourable way out and quit.</p>

              <p>According to the papers, she was convicted for five charges, with another 60 taken into consideration. So, yeah, she was faced with 65 charges.</p>
              <p>The papers didn't give a breakdown of the charges, but they were categorized under theft of the credit cards, credit card fraud, and impersonation.</p>
              <p>So I'm thinking.... probably she stole five cards (5 charges of theft), used the cards 30 times (30 charges of fraud), and faked the owners' signatures in all 30 times (another 30 charges of impersonation)? I don't know.</p>
              <p>Whatever the case, it ain't as simple as stealing a Snickers bar from a 7-Eleven. At least that would have been a true 'moment of folly'.</p>
