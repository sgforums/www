            <div class='col-md body'>this so-called some kind of "dry-reading-spell" of yours whatever u name it, hehee i also have sometimes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>to me if a sharp sentence or the titles of the books or the contents in them struck my curiosity or afinity that i could relate to and develope interest in finding out more, then i'll commit to finish reading. if not, not a second glance i would take. weird thing is sometimes the best part of the book is always in the middle not the beginning nor end not even reflected in the contents.<br><br>and i usually don't have the pattern of reading with the aim in mind that "oh i give myself 2 hours 5 hours or 1 day or 2 days to finish this book" i can take many days to finish one or just a matter of few hours or less if i want. i don't want to read just for the sake of reading. i want to understand and know what i am really doing.<br><br>so..... patience is the attitude.</div>

No matter how many times I try to kick-start the reading habit again by starting to read a book, it's like wallowing through thick mud and it takes me forever to go beyond the first few chapters!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I've tried reading several books but just can't seem to proceed to anywhere near mid-point.  I get restless, I lose interest, and I just can't seem to proceed!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   It's almost as if I cannot 'settle down' to enjoy reading!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>This is very worrisome cause I used to be a very avid reader who would keep a list of the books I read every year.  I remember one year, I even managed to read more than 50 books in one year!<br><br>But last year, I didn't even read more than five books!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Just wondering, does anyone else out there get affected by this as well?  </div></blockquote>*nodz* I completely understand what ur going thru.  I am like that too, this year, feel like it's a very 'sluggish' point of my life where reading is concerned.  Don't have the mood to read anything longer than a magazine article.. and I don't know why! I used to look forward to reading a book &amp; can usually get thru' a pretty thick book in 3-5 days! Now.. it takes me much longer to finish a book (if ever cos other things seem to catch my attention nowadays, like TV, forum, etc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> )<br><br>Oh well we go thru' stages I guess, but don't worry too much about it, cos I reckon once u get here, u'll pick up the reading habit again, cos all everyone seems to do here on their way to/from work on public transport is read, read, read! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Once in a while, you discover the rare author who writes so beautifully that the scene just unfolds in your mind, and you're totally mesmerised and absorbed in it!  It's akin to watching the petals of a flower unfold slowly until the full splendour of its bloom is shown.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>When you pick up a book by such talented writers, tired or not, the panorama just unfurls in your mind's eye!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
