            <div class='col-md body'>I seem to have been experiencing one for the past few months.  No matter how many times I try to kick-start the reading habit again by starting to read a book, it's like wallowing through thick mud and it takes me forever to go beyond the first few chapters!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I've tried reading several books but just can't seem to proceed to anywhere near mid-point.

I remember one year, I even managed to read more than 50 books in one year!<br><br>But last year, I didn't even read more than five books!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Just wondering, does anyone else out there get affected by this as well?</div>
