            <div class='col-md body'>Like the rest, I don't see how the birth-rate is tied in with feminism. It's more of a choice now for a couple these days on whether they want to give up the current lifestyle to have a kid, or not. The thing is that everyone wants it good these days and having a kid means that you have to sacrifice your time, money, privacy etc etc and alot of people are not willing to give that up. That's the reason why we are seeing a rise in abortions for married couples.<br><br>What I think it's not so much of feminism as well on the changes in roles for the males these days but on what is happening in our society. It is difficult and almost impossible for most familes to just survive on the paycheck of a sole breadwinner, resulting in the sharing of housework between 2 parties and also making the woman less reliant on the man. Having said that, by contributing to the household income, the woman will more often than not, want to have more say in the family, that's why there is no definate 'Head' of the family and decisions are shared if not fought over.<br><br>I would think the upbringing instilled in the kids played a part too. You know how parents go on about saying that the guy is always the head of the family blah blah blah (thank goodness my parents don't do that) and that the girl have to be the one doing all the housework blah blah blah.... and the shock I think most guys face is that, that is really not the case now. If their wife works they have to help out or there might be some unhappiness and at the same time, most women are daddy's little princess so they hardly do any housework and I think most of you know the story and how it goes..... (though not wanting to learn is a problem with most women)<br><br>I believe that the Women's Charter serves it's purpose on protecting those who are not as educated or is not able to support themselves. However, I do think that some things have to be changed as I do agree that it is being abused.<br><br>Well, there will almost be women complaining that the guys are marrying foreign brides and there will always be guys complaining that we women only want a rich angmoh boyfriend/husband. Either way, both see it as getting someone better or suitable for them so I don't see why not.<br><br>Anyway with regards to power, there is no win-win situation. When one goes into power, the other loses it. The only way is to 'evolve' and learn to live in the world. Basically I would think that what we're facing is rapid social changes than feminism itself. I should think for the majority of women, they would still have the romantic notion of marrying the guy of their dreams and being happy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
