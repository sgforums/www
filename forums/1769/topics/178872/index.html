            <div class='col-md body'>naturally this is a very complicated topic of discussion being so broad in general doesnt help much either.<br><br>It is definately true the gender roles of men and women are changing, and before peace will come some turmoil.<br><br>The confusion is largely due to women not knowing what they want a man to be. We see so many classifications of men by women.... first it was the snag then metrosexual and now i have no clue. These little tags are not defined by men so how can you expect men to accept such tags. ANd if it keeps changing then there is no way for a man to keep up.<br><br>Many woman still loves the old gentlemen... opening doors for them and doing things that a traditional man would do. But some women would find such things offensive. So how can a man win?<br><br>The other problem that women seems to believe is that if they had power over the world it would be such a peaceful loving world, and they will treat men with dignity and fairness and etc .<br>POWER is POWER, u gain power through someone losing power. We can not all be KINGS. So if the power shifts from men to women, do you honestly believe that women would be kind in their use of power?<br><br>Do not misunderstand my stance here... i am for women having euqality... but at the same time a relationship if u choose to have one requires commitment from both. You can not sit there and complain about men taking overseas wives, when you will not give these guys the time of day. Remember snags, metrosexual and what ever have you is your classification and not ours.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I came from a family where the only lady of the house (my mum) is sort of a feminist.  So I'm quite used to it.<br><br>Feminism is OK and doesn't threaten me, provided it doesn't go to unreasonable limits.  Sometimes the line will be crossed, but in life, gotta give and take lah....<br><br>And I think the reduced birth rate is not due to feminism leh (I know its sometimes used as an excuse, but I think its just an excuse).  I think low birth rates are due to lifestyle, low sperm count, weak egg production....and not going early enough to see a Chinese sinseh about this problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at the other posts, mine seems out of place.<span style="color: white;">Women don't need men to support them now. They can afford to be fussy with shallow material details or ditch a partner whom they're no longer satisfied with, and men who don't have what they want will naturally lament the state of things.<br><br>However, it's part of a bigger picture, one of which self-gratification is the holy grail these days. We're victims of fashion and the power of peer pressure. We put on a facade, one of party-going and trendy clothing, just to seem cool.<br><br>And people, both men and women, want a trophy partner or three while they're still young (because that's the message they get from friends who have lots of stories and gain everyone's attention, and the saucier sections of the media), not neccessarily someone they can be intimate with.<br><br>As for the ones who are left behind, they can't do much except hold out for the rare gem who hasn't been swayed by the tide of hedonism. Or they have to get in touch with one another. Either way it won't be easy.</span></div>
