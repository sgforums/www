            <div class='col-md body'>Have you seen the TV ad where a couple sit in front of the girl's parents and the guy says something like,<br><br>''Uncle, I have been going out with Lynn (sorry, can't remember the girl's name <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) for a long time already, and we... ''<br><br>Then the Uncle put out his hand to mean ''STOP!'', and then he whips out a cloth-covered manual - a Marriage Instruction Manual!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Apparently, a few govt organisations are organising Marriage preparation courses for couples who are intending to get married.<br><br>This isn't a new idea - for donkey years now, churches have been offering such courses to those in their congregation who are contemplating marriage.  In the US, back in the late '90's, such courses were introduced in the South and a debate was going on on whether they should be made 'compulsory' as a preventive measure in the face of the rising divorce rates.<br><br>Would you go through such a course when the time comes for you to consider it?  Do you think such a course would help somewhat in stemming the rising divorce rates?<br><br>If you're already married, what do you think of this?  Most interestingly, share with us what you wish you'd known before marriage.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who are interested, here's the short intro to the Marriage Preparation Courses on ROM's website :<br><br>''You are about to enter into a marriage and you desire that this impending union is life-long and fulfilling. Knowing that a good and sustaining marriage does not just happen, you will need to put in effort and get prepared.<br><br>Participate in a Marriage Preparation Course to prepare yourself and your partner for the journey ahead. The duration of a course is usually between 8 and 16 hours. Both of you can expect to learn about the following interesting and enriching topics:<br><br>marriage roles and responsibilities<br><br>finance management<br><br>sexuality/intimacy<br><br>conflict management<br><br>communication with in-laws and<br><br>individual differences/family-of-origin issues<br><br>You may also take an optional personality test such as Taylor-Johnson Temperament Analysis (T-JTA), Myer-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), PREPARE Inventory.<br><br>Visit Family &amp; Community @ eCitizen for a detailed listing of Marriage Preparation Courses coordinated and supported by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.<br><br>Please contact the organisers directly if you have any enquiry, or want to obtain details about the rebates for the course(s) attended.<br><br>The above was extracted from : <a href="http://app.rom.gov.sg/internet/reg_info/rom_info.asp" rel="nofollow">http://app.rom.gov.sg/internet/reg_info/rom_info.asp</a></div>
