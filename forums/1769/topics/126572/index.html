            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... an oft-discussed topic but i can't resist adding my two-pence...<br><br><strong>Female Bosses</strong> - I've worked with both female and male bosses. I actually got pretty close to my ex-boss, a female. In fact, we just had lunch today! I find her a good boss for a fresh graduate (what I was at the time when I worked with her) - she was patient, willing to teach and more affable. But as my career progressed, those same attributes showed another side which proved not as beneficial for my career - she was not assertive enough and failed to fight for me and my benefits. Conversely, I've seen female bosses at my current place who are real chilli padis and fight all the way for what they want. To the extent of "terrorising" some of the other male counterparts. So, who's the stereotype here?<br><br>I don't think it's fair to stereotype according to gender. C'mon, my boss behaves like an auntie at times and he's a he! *looks frantically around to make sure boss not around* :p He's a pretty fair boss and tries his best to stand up for us but hey, he has his faults too (of which I won't go into) - but these are individual-specific, NOT gender-specific.<br><br>Hey, I'm female. If I were to say anything against female bosses, wouldn't I be speaking against myself here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Hahaaa... I'd be very hurt if my team members were to pass judgement on how I work or how I lead based on the pure fact that I'm female. Personally, I never focus on the fact that I'm female and think I've any advantages or disadvantages. In this day and age, I see as many female bosses as male bosses around, if not more. So why should it matter so much to me whether my boss is male or female? All I care is he/she is a good boss. Similarly, all that matters to me is I do good work, living up to my occupation, as a <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">professional</span></strong>, NOT as a male or female.<br><br><strong>Female-Dominated Workplaces</strong> - All my workplaces so far have been pretty female-dominated, probably due to the nature of my profession. I get on famously with all my female colleagues. I enjoy the camaderie, the gossiping (nothing vile and malicious <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ), the mutual understanding we have... We do b1tch when we're upset with the organisation or other colleagues, but that's all. We b1tch to each other to get the stuff off our chests so we'll feel better. So far, I've yet to seen malicious backstabbing or gang bullying where I've been. Maybe I've been lucky... I also have affable relationships with my male colleagues. We tease, joke and generally have fun. But I must admit, I'm much closer to my female colleagues - some of them have become pretty close confidants of mine.<br><br>Again, I believe what've been said are but stereotypes. I do not deny there are definitely environments / workplaces in which a group of females exhibit certain attributes such as cattiness etc but hey, they're exhibiting these characteristics as a group of PERSONs with these similar tendencies, NOT simply because they're female.<br><br>Gender has little to do with it. It might render some of us more susceptible to certain behavioural tendencies but it does not prescribe the way we act. It is certainly not a prerequisite to allow judgement without prior first-hand understanding of a person or situation.<br><br>wow... turns out i've said a lot afterall without meaning to. oh well...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/i][/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>female bosses are definitely bad.... esp when she gets bad mood for no reason.... or maybe there are reasons why she just dun want to talk to us.... like what happened today.... she woke up on the wrong side of the bed and just pulled long face at us... but she was ok with the rest of the staff.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>
