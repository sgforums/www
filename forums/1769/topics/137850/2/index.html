            <div class='col-md body'>I know too well firsthand, the true benefits of exercise.<br><br>Right after college, I slowly became a couch potato as I dived head-on into establishing my career.  All that overtime, all that social eating, and all that additional weight!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>What first encouraged me to reverse the cycle was, let's see, more than 10 years out of college, in my last year in nursing school in Nanyang Poly.  Damn SUAY!!  My batch was the first batch that had to do the IPPT!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   I didn't know the range of my cursing vocabulary until then!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I tried to weasel my way out of it.  First, I asked the coach if there was an 'age limit' to IPPT.  But DRATS!!!  He said that there were different ranges for different age groups!  Doubly SUAY man!!!<br><br>Next, I conjured up imaginary ills and made excuses to the coach, hoping I could be excused from IPPT totally.  Drats... have to produce valid certification from a GP to be excused.<br><br>There goes all my hopes.<br><br>I really had to drrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaag my feet to the IPPT.  Worse, half the nursing school population appeared to be there at the same time!!  That means, if you do the Standing Broad Jump and landed SPLAT! like some malformed duck, EVERYONE would be talking about it!!!  If you attempted Sit And Reach and aiyoh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  cannot even touch your toes, people will giggle and laugh at you!  If you did the Shuttle Run and skid and fall on your fat arse, oh glory, you will be the poster child of clumsiness and the new mascot for the unfit the next day!  DREADFUL!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>BUT...<br><br>Though I didn't train for it, I did pretty ok.  Failed overall but there were much younger peeps who did much worse than me.  Hey, I failed my 2.5km run by just a wee 3 mins!  Not too bad for someone who had been a couch po-tah-to for donkey years!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  At least, I didn't give up 1/4 way through, like a few young 'uns did!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>That made me think... I'm not THAT unfit afterall!!  My general fitness level is pretty good.  I ought to take advantage of that and start working on getting fit again.<br><br>So, there you go!  There were times when I failed and wandered far far far away from my goal, but slow and steady wins the race!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Now, I'm injured and all exercise plans have to be shelved until full recovery, and I'm really upset that I have to miss all my exercise classes.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Exercise changed me from a sluggish, drowsy person to a livelier, more energetic, confident and a tad less moody than I used to be.  (Yes, excess fat does predispose one to depression and moodiness.)  I cannot imagine NOT exercising now... well, not for too long a period anyways!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  I love that 'I'm on Top of the World' feeling after every workout, that flush in the cheeks, that 'We are the Champions' kind of ooomph!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The benefits of exercise?  You bet!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

People will always tell you to 'challenge yourself', to 'push yourself', 'you can do it!' but how would we know when is really enough?<br><br>I've seen quite a few folks who ended up in hospital because they over-exerted themselves and ended up bursting an aneurysm and stroking out.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   And then there are those who over-estimate or over-push themselves and end up with various injuries that ends up taking lots of time to heal completely.<br><br>Basically, if you have pre-existing medical conditions like hypertension, hypotension, irregular heartbeat, heart problems, etc.  you might need to seek your doc's advice before embarking on an exercise regimen.  If you do have a medical history, be aware of it and do not try to be a 'hero' and show off and push yourself because you might just push yourself into the Accident &amp; Emergency Dept of the nearest hospital.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Not worth it.<br><br>Everything in moderation!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, I'm also recovering from a fractured leg.. can't wait to start  running again.<br><br>For me, i started exercising about a year ago.. then i was about 10 kg heavier.. To me, those things about weight loss, better health, etc.. are just by-products. somehow, i din purposely set out to get these benefits, but once you start to exercise regularly, they just come to u naturally. After about 3 months, I started to feel different, both mentally and physically. after 6mths, ppl ard me also started to notice a big difference.<br><br>It started one year ago when i decided to go downstairs for a 10 min slow jog every Mon, Wed and Fri, instead of slouching in front of the tv when i get home. I mean, What's 10 min rite? Soon, I started running further and faster. Eventually, I grew more confident about my fitness, and completed the Navy Biathlon in Mar. Now I'm training for the Half marathon in Sept.. and my ultimate prize for the year: my 1st marathon in Dec. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I believe the most important abt exercising is that you have to think of it as a change in lifestyle. start small, like doing 10 min brisk walking, but do it regularly. If you start with a large step, u may be demoralised if you dun succeed. Slowly increase it as you feel more confident. (In fact, this is also how i approach a lot of situations in life, when i have to do things that are out of my comfort zone.)<br><br>hope this will motivate those on the dark side to join the light. haha..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
