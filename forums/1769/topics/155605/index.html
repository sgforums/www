            <div class='col-md body'>i extracted this from the straits times forum.<br><br>I had been a loyal employee of McDonald's Singapore for the past 22 years and had risen from a Trainee Manager to Senior Restaurateur.<br><br>I had a reasonably good performance record over these years. In the past 12 months, my performance rating was excellent.<br><br>Recently, I was shocked to find myself given a Notice of Termination and was told to leave the company immediately without being given any reason.<br><br>I was given one month's pay in lieu of notice. I have to admit I had been naive to believe that a company needs to have reasonable cause to ask an employee to leave.<br><br>I subsequently wrote to the company to find out the reason for my termination, whether it was due to non-performance or something that I might have done that warranted such an action.<br><br>The reply I received was that 'contractually for termination of service or resignation from employment, either party is required to give one month's notice in writing or make payment of one month's salary in lieu thereof'.<br><br>So it had complied with the contractual obligations. This means that legally, it can terminate any employee's service anytime without having to give any reason.<br><br>In the past when McDonald's Singapore was a franchise, it showed compassion when it retrenched its employees, unless it was a case of dismissal.<br><br>It appears that McDonald's Singapore today, now owned by McDonald's Corporation in USA, would not hesitate to make use of a termination notice to remove its employees.<br><br>Employees are regarded as valuable assets for a company but if this is how valuable assets are treated, employees need to be wary of their vulnerability. This serves as a wakeup call.<br><br>I write to find out if this has become a common practice in other companies in Singapore, whether they have used this method to terminate the services of their old employees.<br><br>If there are others who face a similar predicament, perhaps they can write to share their experience. We can approach the Ministry of Manpower together to see if management employees can be given protection from companies which abuse the use of the termination notice.<br><br>Boon Geok Poh (Ms)<br></div>
