You have no need for<br>make-up or accessories that most others do. In fact you most likely find them a<br>nuisance. You are probably a little tom-boyish in your jeans and tees with a<br>great love for nature. You probably know more about plants and animals than most<br>people and you'd rather spend your times outdoors and in the sun, independent<br>and free. You can be a bit distant with people, preferring the company of<br>animals over people, which isn't always the best thing. You can be kind and<br>sweet, but not many see that side of you as you often have misunderstandings<br>with people. You are very go-with-the-flow sort of person and usually try to<br>avoid fights even if it means changing your opinion or belief. Still, you are<br>you look your best actually without make-up and in casual clothes. Very few can<br>say that.

Controversial, unpredictable, and never what anyone expects.<br>You appearance and your personality are two opposite things. Even your<br>appearance sends different signals to different people. To some you may look<br>innocent and sweet, to others you look mysterious and intimidating at the same<br>time. No one ever knows what to expect with you. You are a little bit of<br>everything all mixed together. You can be watching the football game with the<br>guys one minute and the next out shopping at the mall. You seem to be almost a<br>different person every time you meet someone, but at the same time you know<br>exactly who you are and there is always that one thing that makes you you. You<br>enjoy keeping people guessing and people love how completely unpredictable you<br>are.<br><br>Some Things<br>That Represent You:<br><br>Element:<br>Fire, Water Animal: Chameleon Color: Dark Tones, Light<br>Tones Song: Everything by Alanis Morriesette Expression:<br>Half-smile<br><br>Gemstone:<br>Opal Mythological Creature: Gryphon, Half-breeds Planet: Mars Hair Color: Red Eye Color:<br>Brown<br><br>Quote:<br>"Appearances can be deceiving."<br><br>kns la why so many people same as me.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Down to earth, laid back and a natural beauty. You have no need for<br>make-up or accessories that most others do. In fact you most likely find them a<br>nuisance. You are probably a little tom-boyish in your jeans and tees with a<br>great love for nature. You probably know more about plants and animals than most<br>people and you'd rather spend your times outdoors and in the sun, independent<br>and free. You can be a bit distant with people, preferring the company of<br>animals over people, which isn't always the best thing. You can be kind and<br>sweet, but not many see that side of you as you often have misunderstandings<br>with people. You are very go-with-the-flow sort of person and usually try to<br>avoid fights even if it means changing your opinion or belief. Still, you are<br>you look your best actually without make-up and in casual clothes. Very few can<br>say that.

You have a mature beauty and look that shows how smart you are. You rely solely on your logic to solve all your or anyone else's problems, which is a bit of a two-sided coin. The fact makes you seem rather emotionless and cold to some people. Not everything can be solved with logic. Despite it, many come to you for advice and love how smart you are, wondering if there is anything you don't know. You probably don't wear much make-up as it distracts you from your studies, but you may wear a pair of glasses just because you like how you look in them, whether you need them or not. For the most part, your looks mean little to you, which makes all the more attractive, especially when you're concentrated on something. Good for you.
