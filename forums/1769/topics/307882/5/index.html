              <p>Good thing you didn't. Otherwise, you would have been immediately tackled by an Air Marshal, hog-tied and held at gunpoint until the plane landed, whereupon you would be handed over to the police while the airline pressed charges against you for aggravated assault against one of their employees. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Actually, if you think about it, haven't you ever wondered how those people who are rude and unreasonably demanding can sleep at night?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I mean, won't they feel guilt-stricken for making someone else's life tough? </p>
              <p>Whenever I have to call the dreaded service lines here, I always make sure that a fair deal is made, but I always tell the person that I know it's not their fault, it's the company's method of mishandling things that I'm upset with. </p>
              <p>All said, I have, on occasion, lost my temper.  Come to think of it, times when I have lost it is usually when some Indian call-service staff didn't quite understand English and kept on repeating some standard phrase like some robot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  It's like they don't even bother to listen to what you're trying to say, and they just read out Response # 16A on some Call Response Sheet that they probably have in front of them.  THAT gets me boiling mad!  (Especially since phone calls don't come cheaply in Australia!)</p>

              <p>they were really nice to us. could be due to the fact that we had one real cute kiddy with us. haha. the air stewardesses showered quite a lot of attention on my cousin's dotter. until the kiddy got annoyed and rolled her eyes and pretended to be asleep. heehee =p the kid's quite a character =p.</p>
              <p>but no, i had no issues with qantas. in fact, it's one which i wont mind taking again actually. lol....=\</p>
