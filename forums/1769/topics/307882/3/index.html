              <p>What it should be is retailer is always right. If a customer abuses his power and he's always right, he'll always get away with it.</p>

              <p>Actually, I dislike the way they have handled this issue, but I'm still flying SQ.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>I did consider other airlines, but I'm actually happy with SQ's service thus far, and the food is pretty alright, and I have no complaints, really, as far as the in-flight entertainment and service is concerned.    To be honest, I feel quite miserable thinking that I have to fly on other airlines on my Melbourne-Singapore routes.  Already, I hate spending all those hours cramped up on board an aircraft in cattle class, as Fatum puts it, I'd feel worse if I had to be in cattle class on board a plane where the in-flight entertainment is not as good, and where the food is yuckier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"> </p>
              <p>If there's a better and cheaper alternative, I would switch.  But so far, the cheaper alternatives aren't better. </p>
              <p>I heard of Asians experiencing poor service in cases where the stewardesses are Caucasians.  I'm really not keen to pay for a flight where that's going to happen to me.</p>

              <p>my friend encountered this many years ago on quantas.</p>
              <p>He was doing a paid specialist sound technical job at australia, and he was flown buiness class. Those time, smoking is allowed on plane, only at one side of the section.  My friend seat was at the smoking section.   He wore bermuda and he looked round and very chinese. </p>
              <p>A ang-moh came over and politely requested if he can sit on his seat so that he would like to smoke (he din have the smoking seat).  My friend was kind enough to stand up and let the angmoh sit down to smoke.  My friend was thus standing and chatting happily with the ang-moh.</p>
              <p>In come along a quantas auzzy airstewardess from other section, and she saw my chinese friend.  Walk straight to him and said rudely, "HEy, you dun belong here, go back to where you belong", pointing the economy seats.  My friend and the ang-moh had a shock of their lives. The ang-moh stood up for my friend and explained that my friend "lent" him the seat.  The air stewardess seems not convinced and was rude.  The ang-moh then wipped out his card.  He was the Airport Master (the top guy at the sidney airport).   He told the air stewardess "see me at my office!" very fiercely. He apologised to my friend.</p>
              <p>My friend heard that the air-stewardess was sacked immediately.</p>

              <p>well ... I don't really mind people from different backgrounds being racist towards me .... okie, rather, I can understand it and try to rationalize it .... </p>
              <p>but what I cannot stand, is for people from my own race being racist towards me too ! ... I mean, what the fark ! .... and this has happened to me more often than run ins with rednecks ..... in Singapore too ! ...</p>

              <p>My mom and her tour group encountered discrimination on board Quantas.  And I've heard of other accounts about poor service on board Quantas too.  That's why unless I'm heading to a domestic location, I will still stick to SQ.</p>

              <p>And all along. I felt that SIA is rather Safe compare to the others. SO die die travel also must Take SIA. Their staffs are all right to me but maybe there are just some blacksheeps around that pull down the service standard? So let's be fair to some of the crews. I've met some really nice stewardess too. As for the management of SIA, i guess they need to do something to their staffs welfares.. SUPER CHUI. no wonder so many ppl jump to emirate la.. </p>

              <p>Singapore
              Airlines has encountered its first major technical glitch with its
              four-month-old A380 super jumbo, which forced it to cancel a flight
              from Singapore to Sydney last night leaving 70 passengers stranded
              without a hotel room.<br> <br> The airline has confirmed it was forced to ground the Airbus jet overnight due to a problem with a fuel pump.<br> <br> "It was a difficult delay.  A problem presented with a fuel pump, and
              this is the sort of problem that doesn't show till engine start-up,''
              said the airline's head of corporate affairs Stephen Forshaw.</p>
              <p>But Mr Forshaw said the problem which does "occur from time to time
              with aircraft generally'' was exacerbated when a replacement pump did
              not solve the glitch.<br> <br> Given the Singapore Air's second A380 was undergoing maintenance, Mr
              Forshaw said the flight had to be replaced with a Boeing 747-400.<br> <br> "Obviously, a 747-400 can't carry as many passengers as an A380, so
              we've had to transfer around 70 passengers to alternative flights
              today,'' he confirmed via an email.<br> <br> According to Changi Airport's web site the 747 replacement flight  left nine hours late.<br>  <br> "We're very sorry for the inconvenience caused to customers by the long
              delay, and especially the nature of it, with a lack of certain
              departure time,'' said Mr Forshaw.<br> <br> "Given the time of night, we explored transferring all customers to
              hotels till the defect was repaired, to allow them to get some rest.<br> <br> "Unfortunately, with the Singapore Airshow on this week, there were not
              sufficient hotel rooms to be able to accommodate those affected,'' he
              said.<br> <br> Mr Forshaw was the delay was ``most unfortunate'' given the high
              reliability of the world's largest passenger jet since its entry into
              service last October.<br> <br> Last month, Airbus boasted the A380 delivered to Singapore Air last
              October had been operating between Sydney and Singapore ``around 15
              hours per day with a 100 per cent technical reliability''.<br> <br> Singapore Air introduced its second A380 on the route in mid-January.
              Singapore Air's morning departure from Sydney left only 20 minutes late
              this morning, given the replacement 747 had enough seats to carry the
              ``booked load''.<br> <br> The jet encountered its first mishap last month when it rolled off the
              tarmac onto a grass verge at Singapore's Changi Airport after coming
              loose from a tow truck.</p>
