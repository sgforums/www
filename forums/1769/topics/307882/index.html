              <p>I am appalled by how the stewardess slapping incident has turned out ..... Singapore Airlines does not stand up for her employees ..... I don't suppose anyone would have been able to get away with that kind of behaviour on any other airline and avoid a criminal charge .....</p>
              <p>Well done SQ .....</p>
              <p>you know, now things are starting to fall into place for me .. that partially explains the lousy service I've experienced on SQ flights .... if you're working for a company which doesn't stand up for you, and will hang you out to dry instead, would you give your best for it ? .....</p>
              <p>and crew members I know tell me that the young lady is a lot braver than we know .... they say that chances are, she'll soon find herself out of a job ... cos she's already been branded as a trouble maker by management for bringing this civil suit against a (business class) customer ....</p>
              <p>nope .... I won't be patronizing the company for a long long time ....</p>

              <p>I remember taking an SQ flight a few years back when my coy was flying back from Ex Lancer.</p>
              <p>The stewardess asked me what I wanted for breakfast.... she asked (I quote), 'Do you want the chicken or the egg?' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I thought that was a dumb way to ask what kind of breakfast I wanted.... but I was hungry, so I just asked for the 'chicken' because I felt that it would be more filling than the 'egg'.</p>
              <p>As it turns out.... those who asked for the 'chicken' got lousy chicken bee hoon.... and those who asked for the egg got a really nice Western breakfast.</p>
              <p>Kaoz.... the standards have really dropped.</p>

              <p>Truth is, they are still the benchmark in the industry. And the supply of stewardesses are there. It may be a shrewed way of running a organisation, but something must be working for them to remain there at the top for so long.</p>

              <p>NOBODY, no matter how rich, how prominent, how 'high' their status in society, should ever be allowed to get away with slapping a service staff!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png">  SIA should be ashamed that they are not doing more to protect their staff!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p>Whatever happened to being a gracious society?  That lady obviously has anger management issues as well as a thwarted sense of superiority.   If it was British Airways or Northwest Airlines or Air France, the company will probably back the employee, and bring charges against the offender for physical assualt!  They will do so not just because it is an obvious violation of the unwritten code of good behaviour, but there is strong Union backing for employees who seek redress.  On top of that, the general public will be very vocal in expressing their support for the employee and disdain for the offender.</p>
              <p>Service staff are not there for people to abuse, vent their frustrations on, throw tantrums on!  But in Singapore, they seem to be treated that way.   I've actually seen Aussies in public, standing up for poor service staff who were being shouted at, or treated unreasonably by some irate customer.  Either that, or the employees here will stand up for themselves and for each other.  I have seen service staff here refuse to serve someone, and the manager comes, realises the situation, and actually ask the offensive person to please leave the premises, they do not want their patronage.  THAT is the root of good customer service - assure your employees that you're backing them, and not telling them to stick out their necks to be bitten off by any Tom, Dick or Harry on a crazy rampage, and you WILL get happy, motivated employees who will go all out to excel in their jobs.  Everyone knows how to please someone... the thing is, how to get them to WANT to do it.</p>
              <p>I can't resist saying this - looks like massive wealth cannot mask the Ah Lian in some tai tai's!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
