              <p>now the pilot thingy is a totally different thing all together ... he had child porn in his lappie .... it's a vile, sickening, criminal thing to have ... he broke the law .... he should face the consequences, and he ought to be ashamed of himself too, indulging in kiddy porn, HE IS SICK ! .... if he, (a foreign talent no less), or the other SQ pilot find themselves back in their jobs with no recriminations at all ... I think something is seriously, seriously wrong with Singapore Airlines' management ....</p>

              <p>If such a thing happens in my hospital, we can immediately pull a cord that triggers a Code alarm and all the nursing staff in the ward will run to our aid.  We can also call a duress no. and an announcement for Code Gray will be called immediately, with Head of Security and the Nurse Unit Managers and Coordinators and etc etc running up to assist.  See how they protect us at work here?</p>
