            <div class='col-md body'>Have any of you seen it?? Its really GOOD!!!  was released last year but I missed it. Just watched it on DVD.....and it took my breathe away....I loved it!!!<br>Any other fans out there?<br>If you havent seen it yet, heres some pics and info for you..<br><br><img src="http://www.themoviebox.net/movies/2004/0-9ABC/Casshern/photos/thumb-casshern_pic001.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.themoviebox.net/movies/2004/0-9ABC/Casshern/photos/casshern_pic004.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.themoviebox.net/movies/2004/0-9ABC/Casshern/photos/thumb-casshern_pic006.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.themoviebox.net/movies/2004/0-9ABC/Casshern/photos/thumb-casshern_pic0016.jpg"><br><br>Made for 5 billion yen, "Casshern" tries to address the idealistic question proposed in Shakespear's "Hamlet" (Why do people fight with each other?) It is also a continuation of the Japanese animation, "Shinzou Ningen Casshern" which was broadcasted back in 1973. A riot occurs within the robots that were made to clean up environmental pollution. As a result, a professor of robotic engineering revised his "son" Casshern to calm the riot.<br>This movie is a sumptuos visual fantasy....<br><br>Story: (from the Official Site)<br>An alternate world with an alternate history.<br>The entire planet was divided between two opposing alliances.<br>After fifty years of bitter warfare, the Greater Eastern Federation triumphs over the forces of Europa and gains dominion over the Eurasian continent.<br><br>However, this is an empty victory. Years of chemical, biological and nuclear war have poisoned the land and left an exhausted population at the mercy of every pestilence and newly-mutated disease.<br><br>It seems that there's little hope for humanity's future. Debate rages over the chances of finding some way to stave off the seemingly-inevitable decline of civilization.<br><br>One man comes forward with a possible solution. Dr. Azuma is a geneticist who proposes a "neo-cell" treatment that can rejuvenate the body and regenerate humankind. He's driven in his studies by a desire to save his beloved wife, Midori, from the ravages of pollution-related disease.<br><br>He appeals for funding to the government but the politicians in the Health Ministry turn him down, fearing that the new technology will threaten their entrenched powers.<br><br>However, a sinister faction in the powerful military makes a secret offer to provide the support he needs to further his research.<br><br>When an incident occurs in the lab that sends the Professor's "neo-cell" cloning experiment haywire, a race of mutant human beings (Shinzo Ningen) is unleashed upon the world.<br><br>Instead of being the savior of mankind, the Professor's miraculous technology looks set to threaten its very existence...<br><br>more info from the official website...<br><a href="http://www.casshern.com/&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">http://www.casshern.com/<br></a></div>

He hopes one day he can create a race of pollution free androids that can assist humankind with tasks that are too hazardous, strenuous or dangerous for normal humans. Higashi finishes work on a set of four androids, the most intelligent and capable being the one designated BK-1.<br><br>One evening a violent storm hits the region where HigashiÂ’s family home and laboratory resides. A stray lightening bolt hits BK-1, activating its circuitry. The android comes online and immediately sets up its own warped agenda. Calling itself Burai King Boss (sometimes referred to also as Black King), he rebels against Dr. Higashi and nearly kills him and his family. Higashi, along with his young son Tetsuya, escape down into the basement of the home. Burai King Boss soon activates his three other brethren, and departs to raise an army of robots and androids to conquer humanity.<br><br>Burai King BossÂ’ first target is a nearby village, where TetsuyaÂ’s girlfriend Kozuki Runa lives. During the attack Runa is nearly killed. She is saved by TetsuyaÂ’s Great Dane, Lucky who heroically saves her, however Lucky is fatally wounded in the process.<br><br>Runa brings Lucky back to TetsuyaÂ’s home where Dr. Higashi and Tetsuya have been watching the events. Wracked with guilt Dr. Higashi is tormented by all the destruction his creation is causing.<br><br>Dr. Higashi decides to test out an experimental process he has been working on to bring Lucky back to life. Using a Mind Transferring Machine, Dr. Higashi is able to transfer the conscious (or Â“Life DataÂ”) of Lucky from his damaged body and into a new mechanical body. The transfer is successful and Lucky becomes the Android Dog named Friender.<br><br>Tetsuya suggests to his father that he use the machine on him to turn him into a Neo-Roid (New Android) so that he can destroy BK-1 and his legions. After much debate, Dr. Higashi gives in and Tetsuya willingly gives up his humanity to become the Android known as Casshan.<br><br>With his new Neoroid Body and his new found abilities and Tetsuya wages a one-man war against the Andro Army of Burai King Boss.</div>
