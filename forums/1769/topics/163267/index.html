            <div class='col-md body'>For those of you who get Discovery Travel &amp; Living, 'Jamie's School Dinners' is on Tuesday nights. I watched the second episode yesterday and it was fascinating.<br><br>Put simply, almost all the children at the Durham school Jamie Oliver visited in yesterday's episode were eating complete processed junk during their growing years. Those who eat free meals get spam and fries...or turkey twisters and alien face chicken patties (70% of this is just fat, salt and preservatives) from the canteen, whose food is supplied by some big corporation.<br><br>Those who brought lunch from home weren't faring any better...they have cheese and crackers (not the gourmet style but the Kraft-like stuff), or tomato ketchup sandwiches (<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">!). And even meals at home weren't very different. The kids get terrible mood swings and some of them even constipated for up to 6 weeks!<br><br>Jamie managed (with lots of difficulty) to get the children to eat healthy food, and in the end they wolfed down the lunch he cooked on the last day (roast marinated chicken, salad with olive oil and pasta with a 7-vegetable sauce) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> And these were children who didn't even know what onions, beets, asparagus, celery, etc looked like a few months before! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Oh, and there was a segment where Bill Clinton turned up at his restaurant in London...and then wanted the menu that was approved 2 weeks before changed! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> All the food that had been readied went to waste and Oliver understandably didn't want to meet him. Wankers!<br><br>Now this is reality TV, not a bunch of unshaved people backstabbing each other in a jungle <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
