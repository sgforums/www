I understand that to those who are by nature jealous or insecure, having a flirtatious partner can be extremely damaging to your own self esteem. If you do not want to lose your partner but do not like the flirting, then you need to make a choice to either learn to accept this side of his or her personality, or exit the relationship and find someone who will not arouse any suspicions in you.<br><br>Either ways, it's your call.<br><br>What's your views?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have mixed feelings about this - I've been in relationships where I was so secure that my partner and I would do a li'l harmless flirting here and there and we wouldn't feel any jealousy about it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   It's just us being friendly but at the end of the day, the bottom line is, we loved each other.<br><br>I've also been in relationships where I wasn't assured enough of the guy's affections for me and so every little hint of flirting on his part would cause me anguish and confusion and suffering, etc... I'm sure some of you would be able to empathise with the agony!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So I guess for me, my reactions towards my SO doing a li'l flirting would depend on his character and how confident I am that he's wholesome and doesn't have any other intentions except to be friendly.<br><br>I remember one of my ex's declaring before, "A gentleman would never give his girlfriend cause to get jealous."<br><br>I guess each of us have different levels of what we deem 'acceptable' when it comes to flirting.  As long as our SO understands our comfort level and does not keep pushing our limits, all will be well.<br><br>In any case, if you really love someone, and you know that your behaviour irritates the heck out of him/her, wouldn't you wanna modify and change so that they would be happier?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It's about how comfortable you are with your partner and the understanding that both of you share.<br><br>It basically lies in the character of each individual - and how secure we are in the relationship. Changing / modifying oneself would have to come from one's personal 'want', for example... because you love your partner and you know it'd hurt her for you to be flirtatious, you don't do it anymore. Not because she asks you not to, but because you <span style="font-style: italic;">want</span> to.<br><br>I think therein lies the difference.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I think women can be rather 'ultra-sensitive' when it comes to men showing them a little attention. Maybe the guy in question IS naturally caring, chivalrous, and part of the dying (if not already dead) breed.  Maybe they genuinely are helpful by nature, regardless of who the person in question is. I've known some women who completely take it for granted that they are being 'sien-ned'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Not shy...<br><br>To some men, it can be an ego boosting therapy. They flirt to see a reaction, to feel good about having someone reciprocate their 'advances'. It does wonders to have the most sought after woman hanging on to your every word. A sense of accomplishment, in that sense. That's probably why the women end up with the suave glib talkers. I've long stopped wondering: "What the hell does he / she see in him / her?" whenever I see a couple that's not run of the mill.<br><br>Most flirting done IS basically harmless. When the serious stuff happens - you get tongue tied, you become a klutz in front of the person, fumble and say the wrong things while unknowingly sporting this geeky vacant grin. Don't even hope for a witty pick up line! Thinking of a sentence to say to that person can take you the whole night before the date!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think therein lies the HUGE difference.</div>
