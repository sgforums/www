            <div class='col-md body'>ahem!<br><br>from MSN Lifestyle:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Here are 10 uncheesy pickup lines to get you started. Be creative -- and see which icebreaking approach suits you. </strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Hi."</strong></span> It seems obvious, but if you make a habit of being friendly across the board, you'll find it easier to start a conversation with someone that really interests you. Sure, you might end up chit-chatting with some random guy you have no interest in, but meeting someone you like is equally possible. And why not hone your conversation skills in the meantime?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Can you close my bracelet for me?" Or "Can you help with this crossword puzzle answer?"</strong></span> or any other plea for assistance. "A guy wants to feel like a provider," says Copeland. "If he can be a hero in your eyes, even for a moment, it'll make his day." And that's sure to ratchet up his interest in you, the one who made him feel that way.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"That's a cool pocket-watch. Where'd you get it?"</strong></span> Ask an open-ended question (one that requires more than a grunt for an answer) that makes him get talkin' -- and keep the conversation going from there. (Did he tell you his girlfriend gave him the pocket watch? Keep talking anyway -- he might have a cute brother!)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Don't you think Batman's cooler than Superman because he doesn't have super-powers to fall back on?"</strong></span> Let him be an expert. If a guy is reading something that you know about -- a newspaper story, a novel, or a comic book you remember fondly -- comment on it and let him show you how much he knows.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"You've got an iPod. Should I get the Nano or the 30 gig?"</strong></span> "Guys are gearheads," says Copeland. "They love to talk about mechanical things."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Do you think that couple over there is on their first date, or what?"</strong></span> Commenting on something nearby can make a guy feel like he's in the cool crowd with you. But try to be careful about making fun of someone -- that might be his best buddy puffing on that stinky cigar.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"Can I sit with you so I won't get hit on?"</span></strong> Not only are you asking for help, you're hammering home the fact that you're desirable. Once you've enlisted his services, you've got a captive audience and can even offer him a "thank you" drink without appearing too forward.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"This new Snickers bar is fabulous. You've got to try it."</strong></span> Not only do you seem generous by sharing your candy/cocktail/mixed nuts, you're also awakening his senses -- very sexy indeed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"So, what are you doing here?"</strong></span> When you meet at an event where you're bound to know someone in common -- whether it's a wedding or just a backyard barbecue -- you can use the old so-who-do-you-know game to pave the way to a real conversation.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"I never do this, but I think you're cute and I got tired of waiting for you to talk to me."</strong></span> When all else fails, there's nothing wrong with the direct approach. In fact, it's Copeland's favorite. "The drawback is that you're more vulnerable to rejection," he admits. But we're strong, capable women, right? Next fish in the sea, please!<br><br>i like the last one best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

For example, sometimes it's easier to get work / deals done when we 'say the right things' or are 'subtly suggestive' whilst keeping it to socially acceptable polite levels. It depends on your nature of work as well - this modus operandi is usually practised by the people in the sales line... as well as public relations and / or marketing.   It also has a lot to do with the way you are as a person... some people are naturally effusive, friendly and open - which may just be his personality, but can be misconstrued by some as being flirtatious.<br><br>I think your partner should respect and accept the person whom they originally fell in love and are attracted to, for example - if you are a friendly person by nature, and you have no qualms about complimenting the gorgeous girl the way you see her, your partner, upon entering the relationship with you... should know and understand that this is the way you are. It would be silly for him / her to demand that you change your personality simply because you're supposed to be a devoted, committed soul thereafter. Commitment is never measured or gauged by how a person behaves - rather it's whether it's in you, or otherwise. If you deem to change naturally - then all is good and fine.<br><br>As for 'keeping your options open' when you are already in the relationship... there is only one question that you have to pose, and can only answer yourself.<br><br>"Am I sure I want to be in this relationship with him / her?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
