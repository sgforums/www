            <div class='col-md body'>The other day, hubby &amp; I were in our car on our way back from grocery shopping.  It was a little wet on the roads, and we noticed that a car in the left lane next to us suddenly jammed their brakes.  The car behind it was travelling at quite a high speed, and would've langa the car in front, if not for the driver's quick thinking - he swerved into our lane (middle) and onto the next lane (right) (luckily there was no car behind us or on the right lane! else sure kena accident) and hit the curb.<br><br>Wah... that was quick thinking, man!  If it was me behind the wheel, dunno whether I'd be so quick to react or not.<br><br>Those of you who are drivers, share some of your defensive driving skills in here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  I wanna learn!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>defensive riding i know, driving... ehhhhh i learnt a little only.<br><br>1) Basics, keep your safety distance.<br>2) I know it doesn't sound really logical but prepare for the unexpected.<br>3) If your wheel locks when you brake to hard, release and depress the brakes again.<br>4) You're not a drifter, so when you jam your brakes and start sliding on wet ground you'll slide in that direction, nothing can stop you.  Turning the wheel like Initial D isn't going to help much since its wet ground.<br><br>Then again when I went through the defensive riding course, we were told to put our bikes into a slide and maintain our balance.  The instructors there said to us, no slide no cert.</div>

(health issues apart)... and besides, only an idiot will tailgate someone when it's raining or road is wet.<br><br>You are supposed to be at least 4 car lengths away if it's really a wet road.<br>IF you think it's ridiculous, then tell me that again after you skidded and smash another car's backside. remember, ego don't save lives and money.<br><br><blockquote><br>Ok this is what i experienced when i was going through the lesson.

I would suggest people not familiar with defensive driving, is to prevent such skidding situations in the first place.. i.e. don't be an idiot and speed towards bends / make sudden lane changes when your tyre can't hold ground.  If you are running on silent/comfort tyres, chances are, you WILL skid too on dry days - even at relatively low speed.<br><br></div>

It was a little wet on the roads, and we noticed that a car in the left lane next to us suddenly jammed their brakes.  The car behind it was travelling at quite a high speed, and would've langa the car in front, if not for the driver's quick thinking - he swerved into our lane (middle) and onto the next lane (right) (luckily there was no car behind us or on the right lane! else sure kena accident) and hit the curb.<br><br>Wah... that was quick thinking, man!  If it was me behind the wheel, dunno whether I'd be so quick to react or not.<br><br>Those of you who are drivers, share some of your defensive driving skills in here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  I wanna learn!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>tat is not defensive driving, tat is reactive driving <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, reactive driving (whatever you called it)... where you swerve your car to avoid the car infront.. can be fatal.<br><br>just imagine you are lucky enough to have 2 morons on the same highway (on both sides of the 3-lane road) doing the same thing (e-brake) but one of them is just 1 lane adjacent to you...<br><br>both drivers tailing the cars (morons) will 'react' and swerve to the 'open' lane in the center..... and you know.... banging human heads together at a small distance is already very painful... try that at 90km/hr with steel monsters.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm with ronnie on this one - common sense and maintaining awareness of your environment is the best form of defensive driving.<br><br>I'm no fan of either auto or ABS.  In my earlier days when I was stupid enough to take 50 km/h curves at 150, the ability to lock the front wheels was definitely an appreciated feature when the back snapped out.<br><br>Besides, the function of ABS is to prevent yawing when the wheels are locked up in the wet.  If your suspension isn't in top shape, especially the bushings, the car's going to go all funny anyway.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow... thanks, everyone, for your interesting contributions! Can learn alot from ppl in this thread <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yo MG, I'm female, but I understand what you mean about women drivers, some of them are just the <span style="font-style: italic;">worst </span>I have met on the roads!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Once, there was a long traffic jam on our way home.  Caused by... you guessed it... a woman driver who was doing 40km in an 80 zone!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Having said that, though, I think my mum's the best female driver I've ever met... better than quite alot of people I know!<br><br>Old men drivers can sometimes be dangerous as well... once, I had to literally pull a friend away from a car as the driver wasn't looking at where he was reversing... nearly knocked my friend over!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Still on the topic of cars, though, does anyone know the correct tyre pressure for a toyota corolla? Am confused whether front tyres should pump higher than back tyres or not... some people say front should be more (e.g. 32 for front, 30 for back), but some say otherwise.  I'm so confused till I pump all the same pressure!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
