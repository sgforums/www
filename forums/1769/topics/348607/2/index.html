              <p>k) buy bottles of water there, put in car, service apartment or carry in your backpack or fanny pouch.</p>
              <p>f) Do not attempt to buy cooking oil, soy sauce and whatever sauce while you are in service apartments.  You will never be able to finish them, even if they are small family size bottles.</p>

              <p>Hey you could start a little p/t business by befriending Singaporeans who go over &amp; work for hospitals there, and show them around the area a little / help them get over their homesickness a bit ;)  hehe!</p>
              <p>foxwalk, trust Rhonda's food recommendations, coz they are ze best! :D  Yum, can't wait to go to Melbourne again to try all these yummy places AND spend more time with you, Rhonda!</p>

              <p>Singapore car licence is recoginsed in Aust. The only think is the hook turn - which is uquie in melbourne city which you may want to read up on 1st, if you driving in the city.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My recommendation is you really put throughts into it before you go book anything. Booking a full week in the city may not be the best. You should be planning stay along the way.</p>

The coastline is famous for the imposing beauty of the Twelve Apostles, whale watching near Warrnambool and history of ships being wrecked in its treacherous waters. Turn inland to the walking trails, waterfalls, and wildflowers of the Grampians National Park. The final leg of the journey heads east to Ballarat, home to Sovereign Hill, where you can experience what life was like on the goldfields in the 1800s</span></p>

You sure to visit great ocean road, grampian &amp; Ballarat - look at the map they are all way out there, are you </span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana;">sure you want to keep driving out and back to city to everytime and out the great distance again the next morning ? 1st is time a lot of time wasted, 2nd unneeded repeating of long distance of driving out and back. 3rd dangerous - you doing a lot of long distance driving rush out and back everyday !!!  4th you spend so much on petrol doing those extra rushing out and back !!!</span></p>

              <p>Erm... I must caution you that although the Singapore driving licence is recognised in Victoria, I think there is a stipulation that you have to register online with VicRoads or something within 48 hours of your arrival or something.  foxwalk, you have to explore that website I gave you earlier on to make sure you don't run foul of the law and to learn the driving tips there for foreigners.  I know when my bro came last month, he mentioned something about that registration. </p>
              <p>Which Room # is Robert assigning you?  I've made friends with a Singapore nurse who's there right now and will still be there when you arrive and she has the corner unit on the upper level.  We spent one leisurely Saturday night sitting out at the balcony enjoying the cool night air, chatting, putting our feet up and waiting for any possums to do their balancing act on the electricity wires just outside the balcony.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              Is the area affected by fires? I read that the fires are really bad and there is a state wide ban today and tomorrow?? 
              
              Apprehensive to book any day tours as we don't know how the weather may change..
              
              Is the Great Ocean Road affected by the fires? I hope to at least go there.. it's so beautiful!!
              
              We've decided to rely on public transport for the city and book day tours for the nature trips out of town. Is that ok?
              
              What's the weather there really like? Everywhere I see online there seems to be a big variation in temperatures... I want to wear dresses leh (no need to iron) and thinking if I should bring my bikini. :)

              <p>Following is the website for the weather forcast in Melbourne:</p>
              <p><a href="http://weather.theage.com.au/local.jsp">Weather in Melbourne</a></p>
              <p>Moomba is held in the Melbourne city, which is not affected by bush fires.  Great Ocean Road should be pretty all right.  I think that's a good idea to book day tours for the nature trips out of town so you don't have to worry about driving etc.  There are few spots you can book your daytour in the city on Swanston St.</p>

              <p>The current areas affected by bush fires are:</p>
              <p>Kinglake, Victoria (all town wiped out)</p>
              <p>Marysville, Victoria (all town wiped out)</p>
              <p>Healesville, Victoria (high risk)</p>
              <p>Warburton, Victoria (high risk)</p>
              <p>Wilsons Prom, Victoria (high risk)</p>
              <p>So if you want to know where these towns are, you can plot it out on <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl">Google Map</a>.</p>

              <p>If you’re a visitor and hold a valid driver’s licence (in English) from your own country, fine, you’re allowed to drive throughout all of Australia. (But an international driver's licence, if you have one, does not by itself give you the right to drive in Australia.)</p>
              <p>If your driver's licence is not in English, a translation may be necessary and you may also need to have an international driver's licence.</p>

              <p>We’ll be getting the “Floor Plan 2”. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>
              <p>Yup I went to the Moomba website and the festival will end
              before we arrive! So that’s too bad.</p>
              <p>Is the area affected by fires? I read that the fires are really
              bad and there is a state wide ban today and tomorrow??</p>
              <p>Apprehensive to book any day tours as we don’t know how the
              weather may change..</p>
              <p>Is the Great Ocean Road affected by the fires? I hope to at
              least go there.. it’s so beautiful!!</p>
              <p>We’ve decided to rely on public transport for the city and book
              day tours for the nature trips out of town. Is that ok?</p>
              <p>What’s the weather there really like? Everywhere I see online
              there seems to be a big variation in temperatures… I want to wear
              dresses leh (no need to iron) and thinking if I should bring my
              bikini. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>Public transport in the city area is totally ok!  In fact, it's harder and more expensive to drive in the city because in certain areas, it will be a challenge getting a parking spot.  I'd say leave the car behind when in the city.  From Richmond Lodge, it's just a 6-10 minute stroll to the tram stop that brings you to the city.  If you have a map, tram 109 travels down Victoria St - Victoria Parade - Collins St - Port Melbourne.  It's really convenient! </p>
              <p>Do bring comfortable walking shoes because you'll find yourself doing a lot more walking here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>My Singaporean friend will still be in Richmond Lodge when you arrive.  I'm sure we can have dinner together and then head to one of the parks nearby where we can watch people and laugh at the happy dogs running about freely in the huge football field.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  My friend and I love to head there after dinner to just relax and unwind and you can't help laughing at the dogs' antics!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm not sure which nature trips you are referring to but they will be pretty costly.  For instance, a coach tour out to the Great Ocean Road costs more than AUD 150.00 per person!  It's really better to get your GPS loaded with the Melbourne Street Directory and then use it to drive around. </p>

              Yeah we can do dinner together!!
              
              Why do I have this feeling I will put on weight in Australia?
              
              The day tour to Great Ocean Rd is so ex?! Is driving really a cheaper alternative? I read about indonesian tourists driving right into the forest fires, and I dun wanna end up like that! I guess we'll be there to soak up the city sights and smells, the museums, the parks, and "live like a local" there, and the rest of the time, take a couple of day tours to complete our trip :)
