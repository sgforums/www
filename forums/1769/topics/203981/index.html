Like it or not, you have to bring it up. We're talking 18% compounded interest p.a. for a 5 figure sum. Even credit card debt of as little as 3k can become more than 10k in very little time after all the interest.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

I've seen it before - someone gets a bad deal, and then he keeps getting into it and losing money over and over again to prove to his wife that the idea was sound.  It doesn't matter how many times he loses money, as long as he gets it right once, so that he can prove it's theoretically sound.  Over twenty years, the house goes, the bills are unpaid and the debt stacks up even higher.  Evetually the pressure reaches a point where the inevitable breakup takes place, and the wife would have been better off walking away twenty years prior instead of being stuck, broke and single at 55 with no chance to recover from the disaster.<br><br>All for a little ego.</div>

This is not because I'm with a guy because of his money nor not wanting to share his burden but because I know a few years down the road I will start to feel really resentful and stupid. How do I know? Because I have experienced something similar before.<br><br>I chose the "I pay for him option" The end result? To make himself feel better and more superior, he ended up putting me down all the time and blackmailing me emotionally till I was a total mess. It took me a year to be myself again. Anyway, I told myself never again will I get into a relationship like this again. The fortunate thing was that it happened to me when I was still young. I'm still young but it was a lesson which I was fortunate enough to learn early.<br><br>Just say I was young and stupid then and I was fortunate enough to be from an above average income family though it basically wiped me out of my savings then which was about 5k and it's alot considering that I was not working and was still in school. I am treating the money as school fees for a lesson in life.<br><br>Don't forget that the debt won't disappear even if he were to continue paying for interest and he is just making himself the slave to the bank and this amount will increase if you guys are going to buy a new house etc etc and you will have problems getting loans too due to this outstanding debt.<br><br>Anyway, ignorance is not really bliss you know. Don't blame yourself for knowing something which you should know rightfully as his gf. I'm assuming that you guys are not married.<br><br>Seriously this is a compounding problem and there will be no winners unless it is nip in the butt no matter how awful it is and I certainly hope that you will not regret it years down the road.<br><br>I'm sorry to say that if he is my bf now I would leave him. Easier said than done but with my past experience no way am I repeating my same mistake. If he is my husband I might just go counseling with him if settling it amongst ourselves will not help. I would pay his debts but I think I will make him cancel all his credit cards and stick to a debit card. At the same time open a joint account whereby money can only be withdrawn with 2 signatures and every mth he has to put money in it.<br><br>Seriously try to drum into his head it is either a short term 'loss of face' or a lifetime of misery.</div>

Hmmm - well, it's not that there's too much choice then.<br><br>E's right - the car is a luxury rather than a necessity in Singapore, and to put it bluntly he's got higher priorities than its upkeep right now (assuming that he doesn't need, and I mean absolutely NEED, it for business).<br><br>Look, if you're going to be married, there's no space for fragile egos here - like it or not, it's the both of you in it for better or worse.  I literally tell my fiancÃ©e everything, whether she likes it or not (and quite often she doesn't), so that she knows exactly what our current situation is.  Sure as hell she wasn't happy when I wrote off a $40,000 contract that was in dispute last year, but she needs to know exactly where we're at because the finances can affect both of us (although I was able to absorb the hit without too much pain) - I've moved on since then and knowing what's taken place, I've earned her trust in my ability to recover from that sort of thing and learn from my mistakes.<br><br>I suppose I'm in a reverse situation to yours.  My fiancÃ©e often doesn't <span style="text-decoration: underline;">want </span>to know what's going on but I make sure she does because, God forbid, if I ever get run over by a truck she'd better know where everything is and exactly what needs to be done.  Fact of the matter is that once we get married, everything's intertwined and everything that I do affects her.  That's why there's no space for fragile egos - you simply can't afford it.<br><br>Botttom line, girlfriend, is simply that whether or not he takes it badly, this matter MUST be taken care of for both your sakes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Touchy issue. Still I am with the heart to heart talk as well. Perhaps you can tell him you feel that something is bothering him, is there something he wishes to talk to you about? And perhaps instead of giving him the solution, ask him what his plans are.<br><br>Thing is, first off, without you paying for him, can you think about what he can do to solve the problem himself? He's a grown man and should learn to handle his own problems - and if it means learning to swallow that ego and change his own lifestyle - that's too bad for him. Doesn't mean you dont be compassionate - just that unless it is completely hopeless for him to solve the problem on his own, I dont suggest you offer your help immediately.<br><br>For a simple reason that if he doesnt learn, it might jolly well happen again. Secondly, if he can't save, then you got to be the one to take the responsibility to save for the both of you. Alternatively, if you know his friends well, perhaps you can 'loan' him the money through a good mutual friend who he is able to confide in.<br><br>If the only solution is for you to pay for him - its gets a bit .... calculative if it becomes a clear cut loan. perhaps you can tell him in view of the future,  both of you can open a joint saving account where he giros in a certain amount for saving every month or something.<br></div>
