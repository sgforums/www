              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">The inquest into the death last year of electronics engineer Shane Todd took an emotional turn on its third day after police staged a detailed re-enactment of his apparent suicide using an improvised noose in his own bedroom.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">"What we have been discovering is evidence that we cannot rely on. It has been moved, it has not been preserved," his father Rick Todd, 58, an airline pilot, told reporters.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">The session was abruptly halted for the day after the late scientist's mother Mary Todd, 57, broke down at the end of two hours of testimony by a Singapore forensic scientist who did extensive simulations of the hanging.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">The couple are in Singapore to testify at the inquest. They allege their 31-year-old son was murdered because of his work for a Singapore institute with alleged links to a Chinese telecom firm accused of involvement in espionage.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">Mary Todd, a Christian pastor, told reporters that Singapore authorities were neglecting evidence the family had gathered to show that there were multiple DNA strains on a towel and strap found around Shane's neck.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">"Why are they not looking into the fact that all these things add up to murder and not suicide?" she said, sobbing outside a courthouse.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">She also took issue with the fact that the noose suspending her son's body from a bathroom door was cut and the body laid out on the floor before forensic experts arrived.

              year in Singapore accused local police on Wednesday of failing to
              preserve evidence and insisted their son was murdered.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">The inquest into the death last year of electronics engineer Shane
              Todd took an emotional turn on its third day after police staged a
              detailed re-enactment of his apparent suicide using an improvised
              noose in his own bedroom.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">"What we have been discovering is evidence that we cannot rely on.
              It has been moved, it has not been preserved," his father Rick
              Todd, 58, an airline pilot, told reporters.</p>

              scientist's mother Mary Todd, 57, broke down at the end of two
              hours of testimony by a Singapore forensic scientist who did
              extensive simulations of the hanging.</p>

              their 31-year-old son was murdered because of his work for a
              Singapore institute with alleged links to a Chinese telecom firm
              accused of involvement in espionage.</p>

              authorities were neglecting evidence the family had gathered to
              show that there were multiple DNA strains on a towel and strap
              found around Shane's neck.</p>

              that the noose suspending her son's body from a bathroom door was
              cut and the body laid out on the floor before forensic experts
              arrived. Police said it was standard procedure.</span></p>
