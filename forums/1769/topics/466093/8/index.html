              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">the Fire Brigade was required. He used the “red phone” which provided a </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">direct connection to the OCC. He called about three to four times but there </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">was no response. As a precautionary measure, he despatched a Fire Brigade </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">to Orchard station. He continued calling and after 15 minutes, someone from the OCC answered the call. He asked the person if SMRT needed assistance </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">with regard to the information that a person had fainted in a train. <strong>The OCC </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>personnel replied that no assistance from the SCDF was required.</strong></span></p>

              SMRT was still using 1980s era software to do their track worthiness  analysis..
              
              The worst is the divd payout... they need the cash for replacement needs i.e. cyclic business cycle..
