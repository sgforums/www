                              <p>the NSwhatever thing? it was a scam which backfired to
              hell..</p>
              <p>most people didn't know about it until everyone started to tell
              everyone who was willing to listen to go claim their due...<br>
              <br>
              and most found out the last few days...</p>
              <p>the gabrament says they're "giving out $Xmillion dollars" and
              puts it so in the books.. but since a few people know, the actual
              amount given out is way way lower than $Xmillion.. what happens to
              the rest?</p>
              <p>so being part of the scam they probably didn't print enough
              vouchers... i mean what was so hard about just mailing them to all
              who are eligible instead of making them go click on something in
              the internet..</p>
              <p>which begs the question of those who are left out.. like the few
              in my unit who were totally illiterate... my unit was the first to
              go "paperless" so they called us back for a briefing on a saturday
              morning... the CO was generally gloating and telling us we'd get
              SMS and email and whatnot.. when one of the illiterate hokkien peng
              put up his hand and said in hokkien: "ah sir, what are you talking
              about?" because the guy didn't understand a single word the CO was
              saying.. much less emails and e-call-ups..</p>

              <p>Okay, I've called SAFRA hotline again.</p>
              <p>I gave the operator my address, and she confirmed that it was correct. Then -whoops- she said that there had been a glitch or something, and the unit number in my address was '#00-00'.</p>
              <p>Here's the thing - I live in landed property (my in-laws), so I left the unit number blank, simply because there is no unit number. So how the hell did #00-00 appear? And even if it did, they could just send out the mail, and SingPost could very easily deliver it!</p>
              <p>Whatever the case, I had to resubmit my address <em>again</em>, through the NS45 website. ANd I would have to <em>wait an additional four weeks!</em></p>
              <p>What, they really hate me for something, is it? They really hated the fact that in my capacity as a combat medic specialist, I have saved many of our brothers and sons from death and injury over the years?</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;">When I first moved to Bangkok,Thailand I needed to do a visa run (leave Thailand to get a new visa, then come back) and a friend recommended Singapore. I'd never been to Singapore, heard it had good English bookstores and, with a two hour flight from Thailand it was convenient, so I booked a trip. But, two days after arriving in this 'island state', I couldn't wait to leave Singapore and, since then, I've never been back. In fact, if you're thinking of traveling to Singapore on business or vacation, these five big reasons might make you think, like I do, Singapore is definitely a country to avoid.</span>
              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;"><strong>1. Singapore Is The World's Most Boring Country</strong> - One of the smallest countries on the planet, Singapore has little to do to keep you entertained. Sure, if you like shopping malls, or sitting in restaurants, Singapore has many of them. But other than tacky Sentosa Island with its <a class="link interlink" style="color: #666666;" title="Universal Studios" rel="&amp;content_type=topic&amp;content_type_id=1107" href="http://voices.yahoo.com/topic/1107/universal_studios.html">Universal Studios</a> Theme Park, there's little else to do except shop and eat.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;">Half the fun of being in Asia is its lively streets, smells, sounds, street nightlife, food stalls and cities that never sleep. Singapore, on the other hand, is one of the world's most sterile countries, with all the outdoor food in 'hawker areas' (dull, compared to Bangkok), and with none of the street life of most Asian cities. After being in Bangkok, Hanoi, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong, I felt like I was sleepwalking in Singapore - it really was that dull. After my second day in Singapore, and a 'city tour' that took all of three hours, I was so bored I booked a flight back to <a class="link interlink" style="color: #666666;" title="Bangkok" rel="&amp;content_type=topic&amp;content_type_id=12091" href="http://voices.yahoo.com/topic/12091/bangkok.html">Bangkok</a> two days early as I couldn't stomach one more day in the world's most boring country. Singapore is a country to avoid.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;"><strong>2. Singapore Is Expensive</strong> - Compared to most other Asian countries, Singapore is expensive. With things like taxis, hotels, shopping and eating on a par with America, I saw no point in visiting an Asian country, then spending as much as I would in America, if not more. For cheap yet amazing places to travel in Asia, avoid Singapore completely, and try Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, Ho Chi Minh - basically anywhere but Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;"><strong>3. Everything in Singapore Is Regulated</strong> - A society gone mad with rules, you hardly dare breath in Singapore, in case you do something that's against the law. Chewing gum is against the law and bubble gum and chewing gum are not allowed to be sold in the country. Forgetting to flush the toilet could get you a fine of $500, if you're a gay man and discovered kissing another man you could end up receiving a jail sentence, and don't forget people are still caned in Singapore for some crimes, including that really serious one of chewing gum.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;"><strong>4. Singaporean Culture is Conformist</strong> - In other Asian countries like South Korea, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia, the culture of the country is fascinating as, with less rules, citizens are free to experiment with ideas. In Singapore, due to the restrictive laws, the Singaporean art scene practically non-existent. Not surprising really as, if you stifle a people's creativity and imagination as the Singaporean government does, then people are socialized to conform and think within the box and not outside it. Not a catalyst for great artwork, literature or any other cultural experimentation.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;"><strong>5. Singapore Is One of the World's Most Censored Countries</strong> - Censorship in Singapore is rampant. Political, racial, sexual and religious issues are frequently censored, with most TV programs, movies, magazines and newspapers censored by the Singaporean government. Movies have scenes cut from them, certain books are not allowed to be sold, some music can't be played, cable TV has some shows banned, and newspapers and magazines have to be careful what they publish in case the government shuts them down.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;">Many people think Singapore's intense censorship is to keep the People's Action Party in power, which is done by stopping political dissention and discussion. But, to a tourist or business person thinking of visiting Singapore, why would you want to give your hard-earned money to a country that practices that much censorship and control over its citizens?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;">The final straw for me though, as a writer, was to hear about the arrest of British journalist Alan Shandrake. Shandrake, who lives in both the UK and Malaysia, was arrested during a book signing in Singapore because of his book "<em>Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore's Justice in the Dock"</em>, a critique about Singapore's legal system. Now stuck in Singapore awaiting trial, Shandrake will probably be found guilty, if Singapore's censorship court cases in the past are anything to go by, and could receive a fine and a jail term. All for criticizing a long-outdated legal system and one which has the world's highest per capita rate of executions.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;">As a writer, and as someone who travels around Asia often, for the above five reasons plus many others, Singapore is the last place in the world I would ever go back to. Censored, conformist, bogged down with rules, and the dullest place on the planet - Singapore? You can keep it.</p>

              <p>Will agree that Singapore can be pretty boring. But try going to North Korea and see how exciting it is there.</p>
              <p><strong style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px; color: #333333;">2. Singapore Is Expensive</strong></p>
              <p>Will agree it's expensive. But I was in Melbourne last year, and a simple meal there costs AUD$8, and a even a can of Coke cost AUD$2.</p>
              <p>Hell, I didn't even want to have breakfast at the hotel, for that would have set me back AUD$18/pax/day. FS and I ended up buying croissants and bagels from Coles for breakfast.</p>
              <p><strong style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px; color: #333333;">3. Everything in Singapore Is Regulated</strong></p>
              <p>Sure, some regulations here are dumb. But at least I don't have to worry about things like getting shot dead in school by a madman. Or having a bunch of madmen claim that to protect my child from an armed madman, I have to arm someone else.</p>
              <p>Besides, chewing gum is not against the law. Selling it is. The writer should get her facts right.</p>
              <p><strong style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px; color: #333333;">4. Singaporean Culture is Conformist</strong><span style="color: #333333; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px;"> </span></p>
              <p>I will say that the conformist culture is more a product of our education system than the law. And before anyone talks about the Sticker Lady, let me just say that she's a vandal who defaced public property. You do the same to my front door, and I'll stick your head up your own rear end.</p>
              <p><strong style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.09375px; color: #333333;">5. Singapore Is One of the World's Most Censored Countries</strong></p>
              <p>Yeah, our censorship sucks, but it ain't the worst, or even among the worst. Else, we wouldn't even be able to read her article.</p>

              <p>Boring? Only if you don't venture out of the mall areas.</p>
              <p>Expensive? Agreed - compared to the rest of Asia. Accomodation here is probably on par with New York in prices.</p>
              <p>Regulated? Yeah, but those things you listed are blatant exaggerations.</p>
              <p>Conformist? Again, look harder.</p>
              <p>Highly-censored? How does that even affect your short visit? Tourism enriches people with families to feed, not just The Man. We're not commies, dumbass.</p>

              <p>
              </p><p class="MsoPlainText">1. Singapore Is The World's Most Boring Country</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">Most Boring? Really? I think being small have its
              advantages.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">You don't have to travel far to the mall or cinema or
              clubs.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">You don't have to travel far to restaurants. Sports
              facilities are easily accessible and so are the museums, theaters for the arts
              etc.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">You don't have to worry about your safety going out late
              with your friends and family. Maybe it's boring because there is no excitement of
              the chance of being robbed/murdered/raped. If so, that I agree.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">If you're talking about being with nature, there are also
              many accessible parks and reserves you can go to. Hobby groups etc are also
              accessible and easy to meet up . The local library is well-stocked and again
              very accessible. Maybe the writer can define 'fun'.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"> </p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">It's interesting to note that the writer travelled all
              the way to Singapore to see a similar street life as Bangkok -_-" Kuala
              Lumpur is exactly the same as Singapore except chance of being
              robbed/murdered/raped is very high. Seriously from what it sounds like to me,
              the writer is expecting all Asian cities to be the same.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"> </p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">2. Singapore Is Expensive</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"> Compared to most
              other Asian countries, Yes. But if you talk about hawker food and food prices. Talking
              $ to $ value based on income, it is still acceptable. I'm talking about a
              comparison with the income and prices in Malaysia without bringing in the
              exchange rate.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">Taxis are way cheaper than America. Food is way cheaper than
              America and even the Hotels are cheaper! With the same $ value you get a much
              better hotel room here. Btw Bangkok hotel rates are on par with Singapore. Why
              is she not bitching about it? Of course shopping is more expensive than America.
              Americans are marketing their brands as a premium product here in Asia. Of
              course it is more expensive.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"> </p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">3. Everything in Singapore Is Regulated</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">I think for 2 days and she feels stifled coz of this is
              total bull.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">And FYR, chewing gum is not against the law. You just
              cannot buy or sell it here legally.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"> </p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">4. Singaporean Culture is Conformist</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">Again she can find that out in 2 days? Total BS. The
              scene here is changing and definitely not conformist.</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"> </p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">5. Singapore Is One of the World's Most Censored
              Countries</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText">I think she should just talk about censorship in other
              Asian countries too. We're not the most heavily censored. Plus in just 2 days??
              How does that affect her stay???</p>
              <p class="MsoPlainText"> </p>
