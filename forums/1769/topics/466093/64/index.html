              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">They couldn't even be bothered to pay 40 cents for use of the locker. </span>Do these retards even know what a 'tort' is, or do they really need a 'Textbook on Torts' to help them define it?</p>

              <p>Like I said in the homework forum..... kids for the most part do NOT need tuition. If they can just pay attention in class and do their homework conscientiously, they are already 80% on their way to academic success.</p>
              <p>And tuition is totally wasted on some students. My student keeps doing badly for his Science and Maths subjects because he keeps disobeying my i<span style="line-height: 1.231;">nstruction to always give proper workings and statements
              wherever possible. I have been insisting on that ever since I started teaching
              in January last year, but to no avail. He seems to think that I’m trying to
              stifle his thinking and tekan him unnecessarily.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In the last mid-year exams, the kid failed his E Maths paper with
              a D7. I went through the whole paper and showed him that if he had just shown proper workings and statements, he could have gotten a B3.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">And that was me being conservative. A2 would have been very
              possible.</p>
