              and killed by her 5-year-old brother <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>with a rifle he received as a
              birthday gift</strong></span></span>, Kentucky authorities said on
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">The shooting occurred on Tuesday afternoon in Burkesville,
              Kentucky, a community in the south-central part of the state, when
              the boy was playing with the .22-caliber rifle and accidentally
              shot his sister in the chest, state police said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">The boy had received the Crickett "youth model" gun for his
              birthday in November, Cumberland County Coroner Gary White said.
              White said these guns have child safety locks, but "evidently when
              the gun was put up, there was a live round in it."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">He said no one realized the gun, which was kept in a corner, was
              loaded until the fatal gunshot.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">White said the children's mother was home cleaning the house at the
              time of the shooting.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">"She had just come out of the kitchen and went to the porch to
              throw out some grease from the skillet," White said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">Kentucky State Trooper Billy Gregory said police were investigating
              and it was "a little early" to talk about possible charges in
              connection with the shooting.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">White called the shooting "a tragic accident."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">"I've been the county coroner for 15 years and I think this is the
              first time I've had a case like this," White said. "I'm hoping that
              parents will realize that if you have kids, you need to put the
              guns out of harm's way."</p>

              <p>This reminds me...... I remember reading about how increased gun control can dramatically reduce the rate of successful suicides.</p>
              <p>When you think about it, it makes sense. If someone wants to die by sticking their heads in the oven or tossing themselves into Bedok Reservoir, it takes effort to do it. It takes time for the gas to build up, and it takes time and effort to take the bus to the reservoir..... all sufficient time and opportunity for the would-be suicidal fella to reconsider his decision.</p>
              <p>Also, there would still be a chance for intervention. A neighbour could smell the gas, call 999, and have the police break in. A certified lifeguard could jump in and perform CPR on a drowning victim. Not all suicide attempts lead directly to death.</p>
              <p>In the case of firearms, though, it's a different story. One headshot, and that's it. No time to reconsider your actions once the bullet leaves the barrel. The paramedics can't shove your brain matter back in in order to resuscitate you, either.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">The world faces a dangerous shortage of phosphate, which could slash global crop yields and send food prices soaring within a generation if nothing is done to control its use in chemical fertilisers, according to two of Australia’s leading sustainability researchers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">The use of phosphate rock as a fertiliser has significantly boosted crop yields in the past 50 years and it will become increasingly important as the world’s population grows and living standards rise.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">But without action and at current increasing rates of consumption, global supplies of phosphate will likely peak this century, possibly in as little as 20 years, say University of Technology, Sydney researchers at the <a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #484848;" href="http://isf.uts.edu.au/">Institute for Sustainable Futures</a>, Dr Dana Cordell and Professor Stuart White.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">The looming shortage has been described by some experts as the next peak oil or the new “inconvenient truth”, a reference to former US Vice President Al Gore’s 2006 documentary about climate change.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">Dr Cordell and Professor White, who last year <a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #484848;" href="http://eureka.australianmuseum.net.au/6C9577A0-88F7-11E1-8A69005056B06558?DISPLAYENTRY=true">won a prestigious Eureka Prize</a> for Environmental Research for their phosphate work, warn there is virtually no management of phosphate supplies by any national or international agency to ensure their long-term availability. Inefficient farming practises and food waste, among other things, have exacerbated the pressure on existing supplies, they say.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">Australia, which is the fifth-largest consumer of phosphate fertiliser in the world, is in a particularly precarious position, says Dr Cordell: it is completely addicted to phosphate but imports about half of its supply from overseas.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">“While we have naturally phosphorus-deficient soils, the food we grow and export is phosphorus-intensive and feeds about 60 to 70 million people, mostly in the Asia Pacific region,” she says. “What that means is we need a lot of phosphorus. Even if we recycle 100 per cent of it, it would nowhere near meet our demand.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">“We might need to rethink the profiles of our agriculture and export industries in the future, which is not an easy thing to do.” </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">Phosphorus is an element found in the earth’s crust and in all living things. It is needed for plant growth and basic human functions – it’s in human cell walls and helps transport energy to the brain. Without it, animals can’t be fed, food can’t be produced and life on earth can’t survive.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;"> “Phosphorus is an essential element, an essential building block for all life,” says Dr Cordell.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">“A world without phosphorus is like a world without oxygen, or carbon or water – life wouldn’t exist as we know it.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">The two researchers began looking at global phosphorus stocks in 2005 and soon realised there was no co-ordinated management of them. In 2008, they pulled together a small group of researchers with an interest in phosphorus to form the <a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #484848;" href="http://phosphorusfutures.net/">Global Phosphorus Research Initiative</a> (GPRI).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">The standard of the group's science and the urgency of its concerns prompted Nobel Prize laureate Professor Paul Crutzen, who first drew the world's attention to ozone depletion, to become the GPRI's first ambassador.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px;">Made up of researchers from Australia, Sweden, Canada and the Netherlands, the GPRI is researching the key issues underpinning the rapid depletion of phosphorus stocks as well as establishing sustainable phosphorus management guidelines.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">The world faces a dangerous shortage of phosphate, which could slash global crop yields and send food prices soaring within a generation if nothing is done to control its use in chemical fertilisers, according to two of Australia’s leading sustainability researchers.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">The use of phosphate rock as a fertiliser has significantly boosted crop yields in the past 50 years and it will become increasingly important as the world’s population grows and living standards rise.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">But without action and at current increasing rates of consumption, global supplies of phosphate will likely peak this century, possibly in as little as 20 years, say University of Technology, Sydney researchers at the <a style="margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #484848; font-family: inherit; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://isf.uts.edu.au/">Institute for Sustainable Futures</a>, Dr Dana Cordell and Professor Stuart White.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">The looming shortage has been described by some experts as the next peak oil or the new “inconvenient truth”, a reference to former US Vice President Al Gore’s 2006 documentary about climate change.</p>
              <div style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 20px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: center; border: 0px;"><br></div>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">Dr Cordell and Professor White, who last year <a style="margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #484848; font-family: inherit; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://eureka.australianmuseum.net.au/6C9577A0-88F7-11E1-8A69005056B06558?DISPLAYENTRY=true">won a prestigious Eureka Prize</a> for Environmental Research for their phosphate work, warn there is virtually no management of phosphate supplies by any national or international agency to ensure their long-term availability. Inefficient farming practises and food waste, among other things, have exacerbated the pressure on existing supplies, they say.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">Australia, which is the fifth-largest consumer of phosphate fertiliser in the world, is in a particularly precarious position, says Dr Cordell: it is completely addicted to phosphate but imports about half of its supply from overseas.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">“While we have naturally phosphorus-deficient soils, the food we grow and export is phosphorus-intensive and feeds about 60 to 70 million people, mostly in the Asia Pacific region,” she says. “What that means is we need a lot of phosphorus. Even if we recycle 100 per cent of it, it would nowhere near meet our demand.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">“We might need to rethink the profiles of our agriculture and export industries in the future, which is not an easy thing to do.” </p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">Phosphorus is an element found in the earth’s crust and in all living things. It is needed for plant growth and basic human functions – it’s in human cell walls and helps transport energy to the brain. Without it, animals can’t be fed, food can’t be produced and life on earth can’t survive.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;"> “Phosphorus is an essential element, an essential building block for all life,” says Dr Cordell.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">“A world without phosphorus is like a world without oxygen, or carbon or water – life wouldn’t exist as we know it.”</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">The two researchers began looking at global phosphorus stocks in 2005 and soon realised there was no co-ordinated management of them. In 2008, they pulled together a small group of researchers with an interest in phosphorus to form the <a style="margin: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #484848; font-family: inherit; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://phosphorusfutures.net/">Global Phosphorus Research Initiative</a> (GPRI).</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">The standard of the group's science and the urgency of its concerns prompted Nobel Prize laureate Professor Paul Crutzen, who first drew the world's attention to ozone depletion, to become the GPRI's first ambassador.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">Made up of researchers from Australia, Sweden, Canada and the Netherlands, the GPRI is researching the key issues underpinning the rapid depletion of phosphorus stocks as well as establishing sustainable phosphorus management guidelines.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">These include controlling phosphate use, says Professor White. “Improving crop productivity with less phosphorus input, helping people to change their diets and produce less food waste, and developing recycling initiatives to recover and reuse phosphorus will all reduce the risks associated with a dependence on increasing imports,” he says.</p>

The average US dollar price that year was four times that of 2004.  Phosphate is now trading at about $US185 a tonne but that is still well above the pre-peak level of $US50 a tonne.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">Dr Cordell and Professor White are confidant the looming shortage can be solved. Solutions include recovering phosphorus from all organic sources such as human excrement, food waste, crop waste, manure and possibly even algae. Phosphorus can also be used much more efficiently, for example, ensuring it is not lost along the way from mine to field through leaks and spillages. Changes in human diet would also make a difference – less meat and more fruit, vegetables and grains.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 17px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border: 0px;">“The very actions that we would take to improve agriculture, change dietary habits, improve soils, will positively impact the phosphorus issue,” says Professor White. “But they will also improve agricultural water use, greenhouse gas emissions – every single one of those is correlated.

              <p>You might want to read about phosphate mining on the Pacific
                  island nation of Nauru.</p>
              <p>They grew rich and fat (quite literally) when they mined the
                  stuff like nobody's business. Practically everyone was involved in
                  the phosphate mining industry, and nothing else.</p>
              <p>Now that their phosphate resource is running out, their country
                  is in serious, serious trouble.</p>

              <p>You might also find this relevant for yourself, at least then:</p>
              <p>One reason why its only now that someone told us that phosphate is running out was because the scientific community blocked studies on it.</p>

              <p>Good morning.</p>
              <p>BN has all but won the general elections, and accusations of fraud have been flying around.</p>
              <p>The most intriguing accusation was the one where the opposition was in the lead until a power blackout suddenly hit many polling stations. After power was restored, BN was suddenly in the lead.</p>
              <p>Of course, it could all just be a coincidence, but I must say that the blackout was just too..... convenient.</p>

              <p>There are parallels between their politics and ours.</p>
              <p>For one thing, BN narrowly lost the popular vote yesterday but still retained a parliamentary majority. In our system, the contrast is even more stark: winning 60% of the vote could still make the ruling party gain the vast majority of parliamentary seats.</p>
              <p>Also, the BN appears to be less popular with urbanites and the younger populace..... which is pretty much the case here with the MIW.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I can agree that a degree is not everything, but I still find it pretty irresponsible for a minister to say that it is not vital for success.</p>
              <p>This was especially more so as he had been responding to a guy who asked if the government could help set aside more university places for ITE and poly graduates.</p>
