              <p>Grrrrrrrr........... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>At a computer lab now. My laptop's toast.</p>
              <p>Last night when I shut it down it installed some automatic updates. Then this morning, when I booted it up, I got multiple BSoDs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>I tried to go into Safe Mode to do System Restore, but it failed. The stupid system wouldn't let me reformat in Safe Mode either.</p>
              <p>So I took it down to the NUS Computer Centre, but they couldn't resolve the issue even after wrestling with it for half an hour. They said that Windows 8 was preventing access to the system restore partition.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Windows 8 doesn't come with a repair disk, the logic being that it was 
              already on the hard disk. In my case, though, glitches in the system were preventing
               access to that area! If I had been using Windows 7, they could have easily just slotted in a repair disk and be done with it.</p>
              <p>DAFUG, BILL! WHY AM I CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR MULTIBILLION DOLLAR FORTUNE IF YOU ARE GIVING ME THIS PIECE OF CRAP?!?!?</p>

              <p>Wow, I wasn't watching that. But I stayed up for the IndyCar opener in St Petersburg, FL. Quite a thriller with a few mishaps, and this year's Firestone tyres are very easy to overcook. Every safety car period they'd sweep up the marbles on the track but they build up very quickly again.</p>
              <p>Franchitti came a-cropper with the wall 3 turns after his first pitstop, and Hinchcliff made the most of a mistake by Castroneves to win. So nearly had a woman on a podium with them but de Silvestro's tyres were over the cliff and she dropped to 6th in a 3-wide dash to the line.</p>

              <p>So much news now on Red Bull's Multi-21 fail last Sunday.</p>
              <p>And it isn't just Red Bull "considering" punishment now.</p>
              <p>Over at WTCC, it seems Aleksei's spectacular clattering with James at qualifying which wrecked both cars to the point of no-show for both races, made the team boss so angry that <a href="http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/106380">Aleksei could lose his job</a>.....without even racing 1 race!</p>
              <p>Jame's roll-cage was badly compromised beyond repair for the race day. So you can imagine how big the impact was.</p>

              <p>I can agree that she has been punished enough by having lost her job and having to go into self-imposed exile.</p>
              <p>She should count herself lucky. People have been jailed for this sort of thing.</p>

              <p>What I can say is this: the debate over whether her work is can be considered as 'artistic' or not is just dumb.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This is all about basic manners and good behaviour. </span>I don't give a sh*t about artistic value if you don't have the good sense to get proper permission. </p>
              <p>If you don't have permission, then it counts as vandalism, plain and simple. </p>
              <p>If some moron were to spray-paint my front door without permission and claim it as a '<em>work of art</em>', I'll beat him so bad, his momma would have to put a brown paper bag over his head before she can kiss him good night.</p>
