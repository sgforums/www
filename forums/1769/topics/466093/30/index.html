              <p>I was once taking a bus going from Bedok to go to Parkway Parade.</p>
              <p>Instead of turning into Marine Parade Road, it drove straight onto the ECP. We, the passengers, had to guide the driver to exit at Still Road South.</p>
              <p>Half the passengers were p*ssed at having bypassed two-thirds of Marine Parade. The others (myself included) were glad to have reached Parkway Parade faster.</p>

              <p>I just wanna ask: have you guys received your NS45 vouchers yet?</p>
              <p>I see lots of people already having received it, and I appear to be one of the few schmucks who didn't.</p>
              <p>I called up the hotline (it took three attempts just to get through), and the operator told me that it would be delayed until at least next week due to 'over-registration'.</p>
              <p>What the hell is 'over-registration', anyway?!?!? I thought they keep a list of NSFs, regulars, and NSmen?</p>
              <p>So isn't that just an excuse for '<em>whoops, sorry, we didn't plan for this properly</em>'?</p>

              <p>I mean, seriously, they should know that they have about 350,000 NSmen.</p>
              <p>So..... they only planned for only a portion of them to bother applying for the vouchers? Anything more than that is 'over-registration'?</p>
              <p>I sure would like to meet face to face with the sucker who didn't plan this properly.</p>

              <p>the NSwhatever thing? it was a scam which backfired to hell..</p>
              <p>most people didn't know about it until everyone started to tell everyone who was willing to listen to go claim their due...<br><br>and most found out the last few days...</p>
              <p>the gabrament says they're "giving out $Xmillion dollars" and puts it so in the books.. but since a few people know, the actual amount given out is way way lower than $Xmillion.. what happens to the rest?</p>
              <p>so being part of the scam they probably didn't print enough vouchers... i mean what was so hard about just mailing them to all who are eligible instead of making them go click on something in the internet..</p>
              <p>which begs the question of those who are left out.. like the few in my unit who were totally illiterate... my unit was the first to go "paperless" so they called us back for a briefing on a saturday morning... the CO was generally gloating and telling us we'd get SMS and email and whatnot.. when one of the illiterate hokkien peng put up his hand and said in hokkien: "ah sir, what are you talking about?" because the guy didn't understand a single word the CO was saying.. much less emails and e-call-ups..</p>
