              <p>I did not say we must put on some fake-ass accent.  Just speak proper English.  We have our own Singaporean accent that is distinguishable. </p>
              <p>It's alright... not everyone will understand what I'm trying to get at until they encounter foreigners mocking Singaporeans for the really horrible and lousy standards of English.  And when they say our neighbours have 'better English' than we do, and it's not even our neighbours' 1st Language, it sucks... royally!</p>

              <p>mebbe =P cos i have not really met people who have mocked people in singapore for their singlish...</p>
              <p>but most of the people i know who mock 'singlish' are....singaporeans and ohhh! remember that taiwanese (or japanese) show? hehe.</p>
              <p>i dont consider singlish to be a bad thing. neither does my linguistics class. and the foreigners i know who come to singapore  usually try to learn singlish. and 10 years later, i still get people saying 'so how are you lah'. (cos all they learn is the 'lah' &gt;.&lt; ) but they mean well!</p>
              <p>then again, there was also this huge discussion in class on what 'proper' english is....</p>

              <p>TMD WBD!  I cannot stand that bloody arrogant b!tch!  She talks with this horrible accent, but she thinks she's got the Aussie accent <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">, and she's learnt to imitate the ways of the Aussies, and she's weaseled herself into their culture.  When she first came over to work, she was apparently warned that she'll be sent back to PRC if she doesn't improve her language skills cause no one could understand her, so for survival's sake, she has to catch on fast. </p>
              <p>She managed to hook herself an Indian Cardiac surgeon and is forever boasting about it to all who'd listen, and even all who won't listen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  She loves to boast about her big house in this expensive neighbourhood, how it costs more than AUD 1 million, blah blah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  And she won't stop talking because I think she's so vain she loves the sound of her voice and her accent.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>But  you know what, people like that will be very successful here, because they know how to milk the cow for what it's worth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Put on a fakey front, impress the Aussies, ingratiate yourself to them, and pile on the PR charms, and you've got it made!</p>

              <p>Bingo!  Good analogy!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On my last shift, one of my patients asked, "Pardon me for asking, but are you from Singapore?" because she has a close friend who's Singaporean and she could pick out the accent.  That is our unique Singaporean accent. </p>
              <p>When I meet fellow Singaporeans here, we break out into Singlish phrases.  I'm not so hoity-toity that I'm above Singlish.  My main grouse is when foreigners THINK that Singlish is all we speak and then proceed to treat us with condescension like we're some under-developed country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
