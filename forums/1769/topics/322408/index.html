              <p>A holiday long overdue.  Didn't get to do much as we didn't have much time and winter isn't the best time to go running to the major places, so we did the touristy thing within the city of both Melbourne and Sydney with the knowledge that we will visit again, and in future, with more time dedicated to each place. </p>
              <p>In the meantime, we did the zoo and aquarium circuit. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>These are my pics.  I'll sort out hers later.  They're not processed, just resized.  Sorry for the lousy photography.</p>
              <p>I think I'll start with Melbourne Street Shots.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v111/kensimthebear/Melbourne%20and%20Sydney%202008/DSC01717.jpg" alt="Flinders Street Station" width="800" height="600"><br>Flinders Street Station</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Then we have other various street shots..</p>
              <p><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v111/kensimthebear/Melbourne%20and%20Sydney%202008/DSC01730.jpg" alt=""><br>Along Swanston Street</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Then we walked into a protest/demonstration going on at the City Library.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Walking around the city, we saw lots of things to take pictures of.... different views of the same building...</p>

              <p>... and just outside this building, a touch of whimsical on the sidewalk with this cute sculpture</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v111/kensimthebear/Melbourne%20and%20Sydney%202008/DSC01908.jpg" alt=""><br>Giant Stone Purse</p>

              <p>There were buskers too... this was the best of the lot.. The Megahorns!</p>

              <p>Even the streetlamps there look wonderful...</p>

              <p>Dusk fell so we took a few more shots of Parliament House.  The lighting gave it a different mood...</p>

              <p>We visited Melbourne Zoo on a cold day.  But the animals seemed to be acclimatised to the cold winds in Melbourne and we took quite a bunch of pics.</p>
              <p>What was nice about the zoo there was that there were lots of free-range animals.. they were allowed to walk wherever the heck they wanted to.</p>
              <p>like ducks</p>

              <p>Sydney Wildlife World was loads of fun!</p>
              <p>Granted it was in the city, it was all enclosed, but it's like bringing the animals to the people instead of the other way around <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>First thing we walked into was this:</p>

              <p>Sydney Aquarium was very nice too.. it had three "annexes" housing seals, sharks and reef.. due to the curvature of the tanks and the darkness, we took only a few pictures...</p>
              <p>the seals were naturals... on land.. under water, they moved really really fast <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              Very nicely-composed pics, Bear!  Glad to hear you had a good time :)
              
              Did you stay in one of the hotels overlooking the Darling Harbour? It's a beautiful place to stroll around &amp; watch the world go by, isn't it?

              <p>very near Darling Harbour.. it was at the Holiday Inn...</p>
              <p>it's a wonderful place to watch the world go by...</p>
              <p>heck! anywhere is good to watch the world go by as long as you're on leave and don't have to work.. even in Singapore.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>we always take our own country for granted because we have to work.. and never take the time to stop and smell the roses...</p>
              <p>i've taken time off to do nothing but hang out in the city in Singapore before.. it's also pretty nice <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>That's so true... what you just said! Singapore has some very beautiful places to hang out in.  Adding to that, the security, ease of getting around (plus cheaper transportation costs!), and more efficient customer service.... Hmm... <em>why</em> did I leave Singapore again? lol!</p>
