One boy was like 3 or something (or maybe he looked 3 cuz he's undernourished?). But in Singapore, there are govt bodies to help. Since they got pissed at you, most likely they're just trying to "do business" which I think is totally wrong, cuz selling tissue papers at those prices is basically like begging. If people are buying something from you not because they ened it or want it, but because they pity you, then it's begging.</div>
