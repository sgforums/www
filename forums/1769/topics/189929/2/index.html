I do not believe that many if any prostitute would openly admit to being such at a dinner party of "normal" working people.<br><br>LOL revered?<br>Paint a prostitute any colour and i am sorry she still is a prostitute, whom are at the mercy of paying clients. It is true that prostitutes have social classes to whom they may serve. But to paint them to be "empowered" is what i disagree with.<br><br>Geishas? lol i love it when people think that these girls are more than prostitutes believing how romanatic such a life may be... so powerful. Utter crap, they are call girls to the lords above. If a man with power and money wants these girls they can command it at their pleasure. Dont think for a momement that they can say no.<br><br>People forget that a lot of people whom venture into this 'line of work' are usually abused as children, homeless or drug addicted to begin with. And we all know about imported and people smuggled from foreign countries.<br>Some may start also as innocent fun. The money is good, the clients are respectable and so the excuses make it easy to justify that they are filling a need and that it is harmless.<br><br>I do agree that it should be legalised for control. But to accept it as 'society norm' and to glorify it, is another matter.<br><br>I would be interested to know from that book why she became a prostitute in the first place.</div>

And perhaps that's what the world needs - more empathy and less judgement.<br><br></div></blockquote>I do agree with you that "dignity" is pretty much subjective... and as you said, yes - there are many 'jobs' which can compromise one's dignity to a certain level. Even those that do not involve the sale of one's body can also be 'undignified' in many ways.<br><br>Having said that, I do question this: regardless of the reasons that would make a person choose / get into this line of work, I can't help but wonder - isn't there a better option for them? Does the lure of easily obtained earnings tempt them so much so that they are able to just view what they do in a 'detached' manner? Would it be entirely out of the question for them to earn their keep in the most menial way as compared to their current choice?<br><br>I have never believed that a person has "no choice" when it comes to matters and choices pertaining to their life. "No choice", the way I see it, sounds more like: "This may not please many people, but I think it's the most workable option for me".<br><br>In certain circles and societies, there are many levels to the "common prostitute". There are those who only would answer a call for a certain amount of money, and there are those who are specially trained as 'entertainers'. As far as I understand it, geishas are the glamourised versions of perhaps the ladies you may meet at Club Kabuki or Orchard KTV... they entertain, drink with you, sing along - and are trained to say the right things to the right people. They are all performers in their own way... and perhaps play mind games better than the suspicious wife. BUT - they are not obliged to have sex with their clients. It is their call, at the end of the day, much like the geishas of yore.<br><br>Isn't it also a slight nudge to their dignity - to have to mollycoddle, tease and stroke the egos of men whom they barely know? Perhaps to some, it may be better to have to do that, than to be caught at the dishwashing area of some decrepit coffeeshop. It's all really a matter of perspective.<br><br>I have yet to read the book - but I will most definitely get it when I next visit a bookstore... but coincidentally, I have just finished reading "In The Company of the Courtesan" by Sarah Dunant. That was what sparked the thought for this topic... it made me realize that the job scope, throughout the ages - remain very much the same; but the attitude of society <strong>has</strong> evolved somewhat. For example, it is considered a public secret and perfectly natural for a high ranking official to visit the most sought after courtesans in 15th Century Rome, and these are ladies who aren't only able to satisfy their carnal desires; but also women who are well versed enough to hold a conversation with them. "Revered" may be a strong word, but an appropriate one, in this context, I'd say... when the most well known ladies are visited by the most powerful men, and envied by the common folk.<br><br>At the end of the day - no matter how we choose to view the profession, there may be certain aspects that may elude us somewhat.<br><br>Just like most everything else in life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i've a little bit more to add..<br><br>for those who use "morality" into this debate.. consider these:<br><br>in ancient Sumer of Babylonia, they had the Goddess Ishtar, who was known as the Mother of Harlots, Har or Hora... every woman in Babylonia was expected to go to the temple and become "ishtaritu" (if i remember correctly) and offer themselves to male worshippers... it was considered a sacred rite which was thought to help attain union with the divine...<br><br>then there is Aphrodite of Greek mythology... whose temples had priestesses who were pretty much like the ishtaritu of Babylonia<br><br>in Hinduism, there is also worship of Shiva, the Lord of the Dance... in the temples, there are devadasis of "servants of god" who not only performed the dances as a tribute to Shiva, the women honor the deities and convey their divine female energy to male worshippers through ritual sex... this has since been outlawed in India but it is known that this law remains almost unenforced..<br><br>so.. what is morality to us, may not be morality to others.. and what is morality to others, may be outright immoral to us...<br><br>morality is personal.. so, if a person chooses to be a streetwalker and has no qualms about it, should we judge them?  and if morality is about answering to a Higher Power or our conscience, do we have any right to be theirs?<br><br></div>

You can't rob dignity from someone simply cos of their choices.<br><br>There are many different levels of prostitution since historic times - from 'holy' prostitutes that belong in the temple, the geishas who sell their sexual favours very selectively, the courtesans who entertain and often gain political powers in many arenas - these were ALL prostitutes to some level or another. You can't say they have been undignified - instead they have been revered.<br><br>MANY other jobs that doesn't involve selling oneself and yet at the same time, compromises one's dignity much more.<br><br>Recommend a book <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> 'Eleven Minutes' by Paulo Coelho - about how a girl becomes a prostitute.

I'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, always cleared the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? While thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff Leo McGarry insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really important because we've got a lot of sports fans in this town: touching the skin of a dead pig makes one unclean. Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town really have to be together to stone my brother John for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different threads? Think about those questions, would you? One last thing: while you may be mistaking this for your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tight-Ass Club, in this building, when the President stands, nobody sits.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i went for a community project trip to a very poor village in northern thailand. Most people are in agriculture - however, the land is no longer sufficient to provide income for the people in the community. Many of the men either come to Singapore to work as construction workers, or those who can't manage to find jobs, simply waste their time drinking during non harvesting seasons.<br><br>I was surprised to find that its the women who support their families in this village. Although they have primary education, it isn't enough for them to find good jobs in the nearby town or city. Each family can have 10, 15 members all depending on the mother, or perhaps the eldest sister. Can a salesgirl job support the entire family? I doubt it.<br><br>One of the houses who hosted us has an 'auntie' who has a Singapore 'husband'. He supports her and visits her occasionally. In the time he is not around, she has a real Thai husband. Whenever her Singaporean 'husband' visits, the real husband moves out. Its basically an open secret that only the Singaporean husband doesn't know about. Is she prostituting herself for her material needs?<br><br>Another family has a mother who work as a 'masseur', though really it is a euphemism for a prostitute. Her husband is an alcoholic. Rural families rarely practice contraception, and they have quite a few children, plus aged parents waiting for support. She is the only bread winner of the family - but no education, from farming community - really limits her job choices.<br><br>A thai social worker friend told me sadly many of the young girls who worked with in the school will eventually gravitate to the sex industry - because of lack of other reasonable choices and opportunities, and familial responsibilities.<br><br>If the definition of dignity is a quality that is deemed worthy of respect. Can anyone say these women does not deserve that respect and do not have a dignity? Between starvation and prostitution - who is going to argue the standards of morality??<br><br>Sure - there are some who chose prostitution in search of the easy life, the LV bag. But there are many paths that lead someone down to prostitution - and unless one have been at that cross roads where you have been hard pressed to make a choice - who has the right to judge them?<br><br>As for powerful courtesans in history - we have many men in history that people revere but who have sold their soul for success and power - is selling your soul for success and power any more or less than selling your body?</div>
