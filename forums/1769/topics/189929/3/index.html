I am aware of the hazards that come with the job. ..... But I also believe that it goes with the territory as an occupational hazard, just as someone who handles dangerous animals is likely to suffer a bite at least once during their careers. When one enters a certain mode of employment, undoubtedly the perks as well as the negative aspects comes as a package along with it.<br><br></div></blockquote>Honestly there is no need to get personal in discussing this thread. I realy think we should leave out of the discussion the notion that prostitutes are evil people. I havent read anyone claiming that, just peole claiming others of saying such things.<br><br>ok to get personal myself.... what disturbs me here is that some people actually believe that prostitution has always been a woman's choice and that it is a "normal" career path.<br><br>I am horrified that the plites of many innocent woman who are forced into this line of work is snubbed off as "well its your choice" as if these women had choices to begin with. Shrodingercat has posted good examples. These women are forced into prostitution to feed their famly and village. This is not a  "choice" that all you people claim it to be.<br><br>But what realy horrifies me which i have not bothered to respond to, is the term is "Occupational hazzard"<br>Ask a victum of rape whether it was occupational hazzard to walk home adbucted and raped after working at a cafe at night...<br><br>How quickly we forget that once upon a time women were "sexually harrased at work" is this too occupational hazzard? part of your expected duties?<br>Please rethink what you claim to be true when sitting at the comforts of your PC typing these ideas.<br><br>Walk the life of a prostitute and then come back and tell me how fantastic life was.<br><br>You all joke that there are less dignified jobs out there. But remember there is no dignity if there is no choice.<br><br>Prostitution has been legalised to try and accomplish. Safety, Public Health, stem people smugglers and to collect taxes.<br><br>No politician will ever stand up and say..

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a distinction between different types of prostitutes mentioned in many posts - free will prostitutes who become sex workers by choice and forced prostitution where women and children were abducted and forced to become sex workers. We are not talking about the second type here - I think all of us agree it is truly horrifying to be forced into prostitution.<br><br>I think when someone says.. 'its a choice' it isn't necessarily a snub. Can't remember much about the book Sphere.. but I do remember what it said about Choice - that even choosing to die is a choice.<br><br>These women could have chosen to forsake their families, they could have chosen to die rather than to live a difficult life for the people they love, they could have chosen some easier simpler lives than to undertake this responsibility. And it is for this choice, that we should not let moral judgement take away the dignity they deserve.<br><br>And in saying this, I am NOT trying to glorify prostitution but that a person is made up of MORE than the value of her body - so that selling it does not make her so much less of a human.</div>

Being aware, and viewing it with an open mind - is surely the closest one can get to most things in life.<br><br>We are constantly learning. I have learnt from your views, and have been made aware of certain incidences that Shrodinger has brought up, which I may be totally oblivious to, otherwise. Through it all, I have kept an open mind.<br><br>I do not claim that my views are right - and everyone should perceive things as such. Neither would I say that yours is the correct one, either. BUT these are OUR own personal views - it would serve us well to read and understand what people from different walks of life tell us, and in so doing, broaden our straight and narrow viewscope. However, it is ultimately our choice.<br><br>You have your own set way of thinking,<br>and I have mine.<br><br>I respect yours, because as another being who has taken the trouble to explain to us your stand on the matter - you are due the respect you deserve.<br>If you cannot agree with mine, I am not expecting you to.<br>In any way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>watching CNA now about Anna Nicole Smith...<br><br>and this topic came to my mind..<br><br>so, she married the dude about a century older than her... and then he kicked the bucket and they're contesting her claim to the estate..<br><br>now he knew, she knew..<br><br>so, it's never a matter of who deserves what, or any morality... if he promised her a pile of cash for her hand in marriage, who are we, or the court to say different?<br><br>and seriously, how different is this from sex for sale?<br><br>to those who would want to impose their morality on others, remember, you do not have a right.. you may look down on those who choose this way and judge them harshly, but that is your way... do not seek to force those who see differently to come to the same conclusion as you...<br><br>and don't condemn those who see things from a different perspective.. i have said it and i'll say it again, these are the beginnings of fascism..</div>
