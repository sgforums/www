            <div class='col-md body'>I'll be the first to admit that it can be pretty tempting to want to go to red-light districts to indulge in pleasures of the flesh.<br><br>At the same time, though, what stops me is the belief that first and formost, sex is an act of love between a man and his wife. By having sex for sale, it cheapens a priceless act of love into something which can be paid for with money.<br><br>In addition, as much as the sex workers do have regular checkups to certify that they are free of disease, it is by no means absolutely fool-proof. While she may have had a check-up the previous week, for instance, there's still no telling whether the guy before you who did it with her had a bad case of gonorrhoea or syphillis.<br><br>There are condoms and spermicides, but condoms can leak and spermicides have expiry dates as well.<br><br>As a former army medic I once had a guy come up to me complaining about pain upon urinating. Upon further questioning, it transpired that he would discharge pus along with his urine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>He initially denied that he had had unprotected casual sex, but upon my telling him that I won't be able to help him unless he told me the whole truth, he said that he had had a one-night stand two weeks before.<br><br>I had to commandeer a land rover to take the guy and myself to the nearest medical center even though we were in an exercise at 1am in the middle of the jungle. My CSM was pissed off over it, but he was forced to agree with my explanation that gonorrhoea isn't something to be taken very lightly.<br><br>Needless to say, that incident made me swear off casual sex - be it with a prostitute or anyone else. I can wait for my wedding night to lose my virginity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore does license her prostitutes. That is why there is a thriving business model in Geylang after all. The occasional sweeps and raids are meant to remove "independents" who have not registered themselves with the appropriate authortities and thus have not gone through the required medical screening. This nation has a very practical approach to the normal vices, such as gambling and prostititution, so it has made it available through limited channels.<br><br>However, you'll note that this is not the usual custom throughout the global community. Most take a moral and at least publicly intolerant stand against what is coined as the "oldest profession in the world." This results an incredible discrepancy between law and reality. Take a gander at the US of A. Street prostitution is illegal and its an everyday occurence to have a lady of the night arrested or at least fined. However, in a hypocritical manner, the government condones the pornography industry, where women are sometimes subjected to worst degradations to their bodies for the almighty dollar. They've even made public heroes of not just Hugh Hefner, known for as the creator of Playboy who can at least lay some tenous claim to artistic value, but have also feted Larry Flynt, owner of Hustler and other subsidiaries that cater to a baser desire in his audiences.<br><br>Going back to the reason why prostitution will never be legalized, it is because there is a essential need for the government to take a morally superior stance. In order to protect its legitimacy, it has to be viewed as a stalwart of morals, security, and economic prosperity. Otherwise it loses it mandates to govern. Furthermore, legalization is usually only popular among the intelligentsia, and academics who view this problem in a purely cost/benefit analysis. This neglects the moral and innate biasness that have been introduced by religion, upbringing, and the media. After all, if you legalize prositution, then you would have to make allowances for the drug trade (another highly debated topic) and the list would never stop.</div>

Infidelity, Adultery, Stealing, Cheating, Not Being Filial, Abusing Children and Others, etc.  You can talk till the cows come home and invent all sorts of fanciful excuses for them all but at the end of the day, there are values that are moral and those that are just plain immoral.<br><br>It is not being a fascist to uphold those morals.  If we are all so permissive and lax, society will sooner or later crumble.  We are, each of us, a small nucleas that together, make up society.  What you do will have an effect on a few people other than yourself because your actions, be they good or bad, will have repurcussions.  That's a well-known ripple effect.<br><br>Sadly, with more people getting 'educated' and more eloquent, they can make light of immorality and make their misdeeds sound like something so trivial.  Also, with immorality being so rampant, it has slowly become 'normal' and no one bats an eye anymore when they hear accounts of adultery and promiscuity amongst their friends.<br><br>Is this a good thing?  I definitely do not think so!  Back then, when values were upheld more rampantly, the fact that stigmas were attached to certain immoral doings meant that there was a sort of societal 'check' and people think twice about committing such acts because of the sheer fear of being stigmatised.  That in itself was a sort of self-check and societal 'preventive measure'.<br><br>It's folly to think that one's actions will only affect the doer alone.  In certain situations, what's black is black, and what's white is white... gray areas should be the exception rather than the rule in certain issues.<br><br></div>

What would be perfectly acceptable to one, may not hold any grounds with another.<br><br>Of course... cast all rational sense to the wind, and without any doubt, faster than we would even think possible, the society and its inhabitants will decay. There always has to be a measure of control... because when human beings are given a free reign over their choices and options, they WILL, to varying degrees, exploit that freedom.<br><br>Prostitution is not the best job option for anyone, in fact - any other job which does not involve the selling of oneself and one's dignity is better than it. It is often viewed as 'taking the easy way out' - many who are hard pressed cannot resist the temptation and lure of easy money without much effort and hard work. But it still does serve a purpose in life... there are many men who may have to pay for sex in order to sate their sexual desires, for only reasons that they are aware of.<br><br></div>
