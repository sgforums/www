            <div class='col-md body'>It was file closing day, and they tried to make it staff cooking day too.<br><br>Most of us liti gals was very sucky at it cos a lot of files that was closed or shouldnt be closed wasnt ours, and there was lots of mixed up on its closing.<br><br>So frankly, we are all kinda disappointed with how things was happening at the office today.<br><br>The cooks did up a great job on the food.  But I was frankly beyond caring too much.  Bozz gave the go ahead for the alcohol to be served. I serve it and some of us was happier working with alcohol instead of food in our system.<br><br>Anyway, I swear I wont let this happen again.  Am going to talk to bozz to reshuffle me around instead and take on a more relax role.<br><br>Let the 'office manger' be the 'PA' she wanted so much.  She was even hinting to be quitting to go off somewhere to work as a PA.  Subconsiously, we all knew that its my job she wanted.  I have all the heart to let her have it.<br><br>I am going to request to take over a junior lady's position instead and be spared all that headache or showing off of 'capabilities'.<br><br>I intend to learn from the best, even if its a junior position.  I never fancied myself someone that fights over soemthings as simple as 'power' in the office.<br><br>Heck. If I can let my ex hub go.  Whats the big deal about a job's 'power'?<br><br>I now officially have a glass of white wine, 1/2 bottle of red wine and 2 cups of VSOP in me right now and surprisingly sober.<br><br>The pupil did made a comment that I must be drunk and I questioned him further.  He just said I sounded funny.<br><br>as it turns out, i was not slurring.  Its just that I was relaxed and speaking with a accent, the kind I do when I gone off deep or just woke up.  Its not technically British or even american....but there is always that stupid twang there which comes on like an Irish Brogue....and I was seriously not trying to sound like a SPG!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, the file closing was a mess.<br><br>There isnt a real decent centralised filing system, and its made worse by the fact that the bozzes does not try to practise handing over one file and let one secretary follow it thru.<br><br>We move the file around so much, its hard to track its progresses and what is necessary to be done so most of them has been sitting there until a client got fed up and called and chased us new secretaries which have totally no idea what the heck it was!<br><br>I love this new workplace to bits, and I foresee it growing into one heck of a major corporation, even involving in politics and so on, since my bozzes are fairly charismatic fellas.<br><br>But please.......we need to really get staffs that isnt so civil service types!  They will be perfect to run the office, but heck...they arent the materials to convince the members of public that our bozzes are great political leaders!<br><br></div>
