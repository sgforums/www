              <p>Single over 35, can buy own flat, decorate it to own needs and style, not have to fight for the use of the toliets and facilities.</p>
              <p>Can always pick up skills which other people insist you shouldnt.</p>
              <p>Can go visit places, which spouses usually will not want to go, for comofrt or whatever reasons.</p>

              <p>Its all about personal choices.  And if you regret your own life.  Then its your private matter.</p>
              <p>For others to comment about it.  Is frankly they being kaypoh and insecure about themselves.</p>

              <p>If I have a career which I like and I am earning more than I spent and I have a nice and cosy living place as well as a car, and travelling to other countries at least once a year, then I would probably be fine.</p>
              <p>If I am jobless or working in a very stressful environment which I dont like and I get paid very little, and I go work early come home late, no car take bus and mrt, no money to eat, house no cosy, then i would probably enter depression and then end my life away rotting in a corner..</p>

              <p>Over 35 and single is ok mah.....again this depends on whether u are a guy or gal la.....for a gal....usually means G_G....coz girls after 30 not easy to find partner....and if they go for younger guys they will be branded as "Cougar"....</p>
              <p>On the other hand if u are a guy and u are 35 and holding a good career and have everthing going in life for u....it is definitely much better to be single then attached.....coz guys who are highly successful at 30++ can easily looks for girls who are in the 20s.......there will definitely be a lot of girls queuing up for u.......Better wait till 40++ then to even consider settling down lol.....</p>

              <p>pros and cons la....35 and having a great career with a few good friends of both gender here and there....ok what.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>35, single, no money no career.....kind of depressing. Marriage does not mean one is happy too. A lot of couples todays are getting sick of each other very early on and tolerating for the sake of kids.....a far cry from the old mentality of tolerating and enjoying each other's company till death.</p>

              <p>I do believe deep inside us, our asian values still exists, and most of us do want a happy marriage &amp; a family of our own.</p>
              <p>however, due to society pursuits, times do go by fast, and if U are struck @ work most times, not able to interact much. One day, U may wake up and realised, hey, I am 40 and I am still single.</p>
              <p>There are pros/cons of being in a marriage and not. While, some may feel the pressure of being single, I think it is all up to expectations and confidence.</p>
