              <p>I agree women lose looks and is harder to find relationship than for men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it's not easy for men either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Decent women who see a single man who is over 40-50 usually think there's something wrong with him, and stay away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's only easy for men if they go to a poor country to meet poor women.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Educated single SG women in their 30's and beyond will never "lower" themselves and go to 3rd world country to find poor man for husband.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This si the main difference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even then, if a man "buys" a wife, there is also the stigma the man wasnt good enough to get a girl in his own country.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>hmmm... interesting topic.</p>
              <p>i do not think that being single at 35 (and above) is pathetic or anything that's close to degrading. some of my guy friends, they know their priorities in life and many would prefer to build up their career first. i can perfectly understand how they think: once your career is stable and bringing in big bucks, women in their mid-20s and above will have one more point to be attracted to you. of course, whether you put in effort to make it happen and develop into a happy ending depends on yourself.</p>
              <p>FYI, divorce rates going up and average age is 40+ for guys (men). Doesn't mean that you get hitched early, you will live happily ever after. Most of the guys I see who are married have this constant frown on their faces when they are out with their kids. Most of the married guys look like they have aged 5years when they have kids. So tell me, why fret being single at whatever age?</p>
              <p>if i may, i would advice guys who are &gt;35 years of age and still single but looking out for the right lady to: take care of yourself physically (stay healthy, exercise, avoid having a beer belly, go for facial, take care of your hair), learn to socialize (learn to dance, etc), and stop behaving/dressing like an uncle. No offence to anyone here.</p>
              <p>I'm 32 this year, married, but people think I look like 26 and still have a tiny bit of luck with the ladies in their mid-20s. My point? Age is not a factor unless you think it really is or you make it a problem.</p>
              <p>Cheers, people.</p>

              <p>this is a national problem...ministers are seen to cajole and pushy on even TCS actresses to quickly get married as part of their campaign to produce more babies in view of pushing beyond the productivity frontier..</p>
              <p>but the crux is to review on marital laws - to also make it more balanced for the males, and not just keep favouring women....taking males' interests at heart as well..now that women are financially independent...</p>
              <p>the govt has already done a lot to squeeze our pocket monies....they also further aggravate it by squeezing the already dried pocket until torn with our 2 balls hanging out...</p>

              <p>Man you sound sceptical. Be an optimist. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> You are a guy and 35 isn't bad for a guy. You can still make children. I feel sorry for the women. I have two women friends, they are retired and age 62, yet I do not see a hint of sadness in them because they lost the opportunity to have children or get married. I am not going to say what this two woman is involve in, but they get involve in activities that make they joyous and give their life a sense of purpose.</p>
              <p>It is not the end of the world, dude. I have known some of my guy friends who get married at 37, 38 and even 40. And their wifes are like 31 years old. Singapore is extending the retirement age to 65 so you sort of get a life extension.</p>
              <p>Don't get depressed. Make new friends. Try make friends with younger people. Don't care if they look at you like an uncle. Look - there are hot women at their 40s and they are single - Jennifer Aniston.</p>

              <p>hmmm... interesting topic.</p>
              <p>i do not think that being single at 35 (and above) is pathetic or anything that's close to degrading. some of my guy friends, they know their priorities in life and many would prefer to build up their career first. i can perfectly understand how they think: once your career is stable and bringing in big bucks, women in their mid-20s and above will have one more point to be attracted to you. of course, whether you put in effort to make it happen and develop into a happy ending depends on yourself.</p>
              <p>FYI, divorce rates going up and average age is 40+ for guys (men). Doesn't mean that you get hitched early, you will live happily ever after. Most of the guys I see who are married have this constant frown on their faces when they are out with their kids. Most of the married guys look like they have aged 5years when they have kids. So tell me, why fret being single at whatever age?</p>

              <p>Great point ! Well, I think marriage is also a good thing. But just because a person is single and above 35 doesn't mean its a crime being single. Some people in their 30s just haven't found the rite person. If anyone above 35 is depressed with their singularity, go watch "My Greek Wedding". Its an excellent show.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, there are things about the asian culture in which i dislike. One of my friends - who divorced, he tells me how his relatives look down on him because of that. I think he is a nice person but sometimes it is the asian culture that I really dislike. And then there is my cousin who is 33 and unmarried. Everytime we go to family gathering, the uncles and aunties would make jokes to him asking him when he is going to get married. And some of my other cousins don't treat him so well. These are some of the things I don't like about asian culture pressure on singles to get married.</p>

              <p>see guys....then we have to ask the most basic question of all: what is marraige and what to the couple say during their wedding vows? It's all in the name of LOVE!</p>
              <p>so i totally agree that u get bcoz for the sake of getting married or juz not to feel lonely. that are many things in live then marrying and having children...i think the world is populated enuff.</p>
              <p>of course if u happen to find the right person and u want to be with that special person forever (or for him/her to stick with u n not to be with other candidates), n most importantly love, then it is not supprising to hear wedding bells for the couple.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Yes i'd rather remain single if i don't find the right man.</p>
              <p>Dating agencies only want to make money. I just turned 30, well-educated, successful career, good income, good shape, looks not stunning but ok.  Joined a dating agency to see if i can meet eligible men.  First date i got was with a guy in late 30s (but looked older than that), ITE dropout, in between jobs, not comfortable speaking english. I don't want to be mean, but really it was a waste of time for both of us. Sigh.</p>

              <p>Bcuz i always think that no matter what, if girls can get married and have someone to rely on and someone taking care of you or even have your own children is a very blissful things.</p>
              <p>Especially someone like me who wish to have a simple, comfortable yet meaningful life with my partner. Than being a workaholic or someone lonely. As i myself also a rather quiet person so don't wish till than i am still like what i am now. :)</p>
