              <p>When these rich people adopt, they are like doing a social service, help the poor and under privilege of society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Madonna also adopts lots of African children, but seriously is it her own child?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why is it that these celebrity couples adopt children from 3rd world countries?</p>
              <p>But seriously, these adopted children, are they carrying the parents genetic material?</p>
