              <p>I only need a space to jot down these thoughts:</p>
              <p>I was talking to some schoolmates about my exchange today, and mentioned that most of my housemates are still travelling, as are a few others I know in the States and Europe. And those schoolmates asked why I didn't visit more cities. "You never know when you'll get to do this again," they said.</p>
              <p>It seems that young people think differently these days. We'd rather seize the opportunity NOW at whatever cost. Somehow my housemates managed to convince their parents. My folks are older and would rather see me save up to travel again. And I feel for them. S$14K in 5 months is a massive amount, and the others are easily spending much more by now.</p>
              <p>Any thoughts are welcome.</p>

              <p>I thought of going for overseas exchange, but the S$25k uni loan that was waiting for me after graduation loomed large. I felt that there was no sense in adding another $15k to my liabilities just to bum around a little in Europe.</p>
              <p>If those fellas are so damned privileged that they can burn their parents' hard-earned money, so be it. You know what you can afford, and spending within your means is a time-honoured virtue.</p>
              <p>I mean, come on, the FS and I aren't even going for a honeymoon after our wedding next year. We figured that it would make more sense to spend that money on things like our flat downpayment and furniture.</p>

              <p>I feel that I gained a lot from working with art students from abroad, talking to grads and seeing how other cultures work (a bit of Mexico and Canada too). It's stuff that I feel I can use in my work. I know you're not referring to me but if anyone else accused me of bumming around, I'd never stand for it.</p>
              <p>I'm glad that you're with me on this.</p>
              <p>P.S. Even if I didn't make the tips to Mexico and Canada, I would've shaved off only 2.5K at most. That how much living expenses cost.</p>

              <p>one of my biggest regret was not going on that road trip I had told the whole world about .... cos I started my pluto job before I could do so .....</p>
              <p>you should fatten up the kitty and do it after your graduation, before you get a job ... cos definitely, once you step into the working world, you probably would never get the opportunity again, not without cost to your career.</p>

              <p>you should fatten up the kitty and do it after your graduation,

              <p>end of the day, i guess it's whether you can afford it. In a sense it's better to do it now than to only think about doing it when you are rich but too old to do a lot of things. Trade-offs and opportunity costs I guess.</p>
