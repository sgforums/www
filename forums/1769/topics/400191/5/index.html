              <p>He went for a specialist appointment in the morning, collapsed in the waiting room, got admitted into ICU, never woke up again, and expired at night.... all this inside of maybe 12 hours.</p>
              <p>And frankly, I can't help but bear in mind that he had been smoking for as long as I can remember.....</p>
