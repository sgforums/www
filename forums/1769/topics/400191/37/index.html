              <p>At the very least, I see a serious case of groupthink. Every single one of 'em just rushes in blindly into making a decision in an effort to not appear like a wet blanket.</p>
              <p>For instance, there was the time when it was decided to raise GST to 7%.</p>
              <p>All the PAP MPs turned into glorified cheerleaders cheering the GST offset package.</p>
              <p>Only the opposition and NCMPs voiced concerns about the rise in GST.</p>
