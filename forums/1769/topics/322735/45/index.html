              <p><strong>Sodomy Allegation is Just 'Backdoor Attack'</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Sunday, June 29, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=41&amp;author=">International News</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=41"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-intl.gif" border="0" alt="International News" align="right"></a><br><em>by Ayam Whatayam</em><br><br> Malaysia’s de facto opposition leader Anal Ibuggerhim has hit back at those alleging he has once again indulged in sodomy.<br><br>Former
              Malaysian deputy premier and finance minister Datuk Anal was sentenced
              in 1999 to six years in prison on corruption charges, and in 2000, to
              another nine years for alleged sodomy. In 2004, however, the Federal
              Court reversed the sodomy conviction, and he was released. Datuk Anal
              has always characterized his convictions as an attempted political
              assassination. Just yesterday, it was reported that one of Datuk Anal’s
              aides had lodged a police report claiming that his boss sodomised him. <br> <br> Datuk Anal is attacking the entire affair as an attempt to frustrate
              his political comeback, after he led the opposition to win a third of
              Malaysia’ parliamentary seats and five states, and as public anger is
              growing against the government.<br> <br> “BUMNO can’t take Datuk Anal on with a full frontal attack, so they’re
              trying to screw him by the backdoor,” said Mr. Mohd Belakang bin Mari,
              a spokesman for opposition party, Parti Kedi Rabak-rabak (PKR),
              referring to the ruling party. “We demand a full probe!”<br> <br> Meanwhile, the Malaysian police have pledged their cooperation. <br> <br> “You want us to probe your anal case? No problem!” said Chief Inspector
              Mohd Shaiful bin Malu, “Maybe all this is just a big prank, you know,
              jiggery-pokery done by people with itchy backside.”<br> <br> When asked who might such people with itchy backsides be, Chief Inspector Shaiful replied, “Donno. Go and ask a doctor, lah!”<br> <br> When asked which doctor one should see about people with itchy backsides, he rolled his eyes. “A <a href="http://www.chedet.com/">doctor</a> in this country who knows a lot about being an asshole, lah!”<br> <br> There were no further questions.<br> <br> Such a doctor was quickly found and he rendered his medical opinion on
              the matter, saying, "It's terrible that Datuk Anwar is still engaged in
              sodomy. I mean, the man has aides!"<br> <br> Meanwhile, across the Causeway, Singaporeans believe that the turmoil
              in Malaysia could be beneficial in the long run. Said a civil servant
              who did not wish to be named, "Maybe they'll be so focused on this
              controversy, that we can take a few more of their islands without them
              knowing."</p>

              <p>anyway i received quite a few phone calls from friends who are on the road. i'll reach home and they'll call and ask if its me on the road just now. because they see me flash past and since my bike isn't that common in SG and i only travel on fixed routes, they guess that its me.</p>
