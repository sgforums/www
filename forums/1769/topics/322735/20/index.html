              i walked from home to office. veryvery tiring and it takes me 48 mins.  its so irritating.
              
              anyway, i was late and the office is even later, i had to go over to a canteen and meet my papa and have breakfast.
              
              i am today in shorts,  t shirt &amp; nike running shoes and refusing to change into my dress.  its still so freaking hot! applying a wet small towel to my face and neck now.

              <p>I don't like CSI: Miami.</p>
              <p>The Chief CSI (played by David Caruso) is so damn cocky and aloof. He seems to have an annoying habit of posing under the sun with his sunglasses and his head tilted to one side.</p>
              <p>William Petersen in the original CSI is so much better.</p>

              <p>This is the dumbest thing I read about the black sheep of the Muslim religion</p>
              <p><img src="http://c.imagehost.org/0178/aas.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Muslims have complained over a police advert featuring a puppy sitting in an officer's hat.<br><br>A police force has apologised to Islamic leaders for the "offensive" postcard advertising a new non-emergency telephone number, which shows a six-month-old trainee police dog named Rebel.</p>
              <p>The German shepherd puppy has proved hugely popular with the public, hundreds of who have logged on to the force's website to read his online training diary.<br><br>But some Muslims in the Dundee area have reportedly been upset by the image because they consider dogs to be "ritually unclean", while shopkeepers have refused to display the advert.<br><br>Tayside Police have admitted they should have consulted their 'diversity' officers before issuing the cards, but critics argued their apology was unnecessary.<br><br>Richard Cook, director of the Campaign Against Political Correctness in Scotland, said: "Britain is the greatest dog-loving country in the world.<br><br>"In our culture, dogs are a man's best friend. I don't think Andrex are likely to be dropping the puppy dog from their adverts and for the police to apologise is ludicrous."<br><br>Rebel has proved a popular recruit for Tayside Police and is about to venture out onto the streets, having just completed his course of inoculations.<br><br>He was given his name after visiting St Ninians Primary School in Dundee where pupils put forward hundreds of ideas of what he should be called.<br><br>But some Islamic scholars believe that dogs are impure and therefore 'haraam' - or forbidden - except for use in hunting or farming, and that it is not hygienic to keep a dog in the house.<br><br>They say that the "impurity of dogs is the greatest of animal impurities", and anyone who touches one must wash the body part that has come into contact with the animal seven times.<br><br>Mohammed Asif, a Dundee City councillor who sits on the Tayside Joint Police Board, said the postcards had been raised this week with John Vine, the chief constable.<br><br>He said: "My concern was that it is not welcomed by all communities, with the dog on the cards. It was probably a waste of resources going to these communities. The police should have understood.<br><br>"Since then the police have explained that it was an oversight on their part and that if they had seen it was going to cause upset they would not have done it.<br><br>"People who have shops just will not put up the postcard. But the police have said to me that it was simply an oversight and they did not seek to offend or upset."<br><br>A spokesman for Tayside Police said that Rebel had proved "extremely popular" with children and adults since he joined the force aged six weeks.<br><br>He added: "His incredible world-wide popularity - he has attracted record visitor numbers to our website - led us to believe Rebel could play a starring role in the promotion of our non-emergency number.<br><br>"However, we did not seek advice from the force's diversity adviser prior to publishing and distributing the postcards. That was an oversight and we apologise for any offence caused."<br><br>AFP/01/07/2008</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I don't even think the police need to apologise to those idiots</p>
              <p>It's a bloody picture not like they are asking them to touch the puppy</p>
              <p>Plus if they expect to force their culture down everyone's throat, they should just go back to which ever godforsaken hell hole they crawled out from</p>

              <p><strong>Exercises to Empathise With Our Policemen</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Monday, June 30, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=47&amp;author=">We, The Citizens</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=47"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-wecitizens.gif" border="0" alt="We, The Citizens" align="right"></a><br><em>by Nyonya Kway</em><br><br> Apparently, 20 teams of JC kids played mock detective at a competition
              organized by the Singapore Police Force to give them the chance to
              “experience for themselves the challenges and difficulties faced by
              police officers in uncovering the truth.”<br> <br> Wah lau, if our police officers find it tough to uncover the truth,
              then we all how? We only got the State’s Times and Loo Paper to rely
              on, mah!<br> <br> Anyway, here are some <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=2593">exercises we think will help all of us feel what it's like to be a valued member of our security forces</a>:<br><br>1.	Leave a terrorist alone in an unmonitored toilet<br> <br> 2.	Keep 24/7 surveillance on certain opposition politicians<br> <br> 3.	Arrest and detain bloggers<br> <br> 4.	While cruising around on patrol, note down all the solid places to makan<br> <br> 5.	Hang kucing kurap drug mules while <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/singapore-a-friend-indeed-to-burma/2007/09/30/1191090945019.html">not doing much to the big guns</a><br> <br> 6. Call your friends - the construction worker, the red Indian, the
              cowboy and the guy in the leather with the big moustache – to do the
              YMCA dance with you<br> <br> 7.	Get special member discounts to watch Andy Summers, Stewart Copeland and Sting in concert<br> <br> 8.	Kena compulsory watching of ‘Police &amp; Thief’<br> <br> 9.	At every Home Team Fambly Day, kena listen to Wong Kan Seng sing “I Will Survive”<br> <br> 10. Kena sit for hours in station listening to condemn sob stories from

              <p><strong>Oldest Bus Stop to Be ‘Bus Stop Mentor’</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Thursday, June 26, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=30&amp;author=">Local News</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=30"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-localnews.gif" border="0" alt="Local News" align="right"></a><br><em>by Kway Kah Chng</em><br><br> The Gahmen has decided not to discard a bus stop from the 1970s,
              claiming it should be retitled ‘Bus Stop Mentor’ and give guidance to
              junior bus stops.<br><br>“We think the bus stop will be able to share
              its wisdom and experience,” said Lame Transport Authority (LTA)
              spokesperson Goh Wor Kheng. “It’s not going to just sit there and be a
              nuisance or obstacle.”<br> <br> To cement its importance, the LTA will confer upon the bus stop the title of ‘Bus Stop Mentor’ or ‘BM’ for short.<br> <br> However, some bus stops from the younger generation do not seem to appreciate the status of the BM.<br> <br> At a recent seminar, a bus stop from the late 90s asked the BM, “Do you
              really think Singapore would have been worse off if you had been built
              with a bay for buses to pull into, rather than just stopping parallel
              to the curb and blocking traffic in the travel lane?”<br> <br> Outraged, the BM’s pillars shook, the ‘ong-ong-ong’ sound reverberating through the hall. <br> <br> “What road were you built on?” he demanded of the impertinent youngster. “What buses ply your route?”<br> <br> The 90s bus stop replied, “What has that got to do with anything?” but the BM launched into a lecture.<br> <br> “Singapore has done very well for itself without the luxury of bus
              bays. You in the younger generation, with your bus bays, your lighting,
              your large advertisement panels and your electronic sign boards, you
              don’t know what hardship is like,” he thundered. “You’re all
              complacent. You watch. If passengers start demanding all sorts of other
              frills, it’ll take only 5 years to ruin this country.”<br> <br> In the remainder of his speech, the BM also justified the importing of
              more foreign buses into the economy, why the Gahmen should spend
              millions of dollars maintaining his poles, and why the bus stops in
              Singapore are so much better than those in Malaysia.<br> <br> In unrelated news, coffee shops nationwide reported higher clean up
              costs after a sudden outbreak of customers spewing coffee out of their
              mouths. The cause of this phenomena is believed to be the State’s Times
              report on a dinner forum at the Shangri-La, where MM Lee described how
              Singapore’s leaders “have not got richer, Singapore has.”</p>
