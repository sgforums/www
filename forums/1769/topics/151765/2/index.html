But of course, peak biting is during dawn and dusk. So, it is more beneficial to fog during these periods because you have a bigger abundance of mosquitoes around," explained Christina Liew, a medical entomologist at the National Environment Agency (NEA).<br><br>So is fogging as it is currently done just a smokescreen?<br><br>"The end user insists that fogging be done because he is being harassed by mosquitoes. So when he sees that there is lots of smoke going on, he is happy that something is being done. The pest company knows it is ineffective doing it. I have heard stories. Some just add kerosene to water so that when you fog, you still get white smoke coming out. In fact, it's all for show, " said G. Surajan, president of Singapore Pest Management Association.<br><br>Responding to Channel NewsAsia's query, NEA says it does not know of any pest control companies which have been adding kerosene to water. And it will take action against any who has done so.<br><br>So why don't pest companies carry out fogging at dawn or dusk?<br><br>They say cost is an issue. Pest companies have to pay their workers one and a half times more in overtime pay if fogging is done outside the standard nine to five work day.<br><br>And most town councils, private condominiums and construction companies will only award fogging contracts to the lowest bidder.<br><br>There is another reason why fogging is done when the sun is high - pest management companies say Singaporeans complain of noise pollution from fogging at dawn.<br><br>Biologists have also warned that fogging, if conducted at sub-lethal dosages, will cause mosquitoes to develop resistance to the pesticides used.<br><br>But it is not known if all fogging carried out here is at the appropriate lethal dosages.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/050911/5/singapore167626.html" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Singapore News</a>)</div>

But if you are unlucky enough to catch dengue for subsequent times, the danger of it being the deadly Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is higher.<br><br>It's kinda like if you catch flu, you'll be immune to the particular strain, but it doesn't mean you'll never catch flu again ever, because there are too many different strains of flu and new ones are coming up every year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
