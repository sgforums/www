              <p><strong> By <em>ACA</em> staff</strong></p>
              <p><strong>American author Paula Begoun says women shouldn't shop for beauty
              products without knowing more about the tricks cosmetics companies use.
              Here's a selection of her best beauty-myth-busting tips.</strong></p>
              <p>The "beauty cop"  who has authored several volumes of her best selling beauty bible <em> Don't go to the cosmetics counter without me"</em> says  <em><strong>product marketing is used to bamboozle consumers into buying beauty products they do not need</strong></em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="body">She says price isn't a useful measure of quality either.</div>
              <div class="body"><br></div>
              <div class="body"><strong>Best beauty buys - Paula's tips</strong><br></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Moisturisers</em>:
              Spending up big on that tub of designer cream may make you feel better,
              <em><strong>but it doesn't always have that effect on your skin</strong></em>. A pump action
              moisturiser is best. Dove, Olay and Clinique's moisturisers get Paula's
              personal tick of approval.</p>
              <p><em>Eye cream</em>: While more expensive than regular moisturiser,
              over the counter creams for under-eye areas have the same formulation
              as face cream. Experts say this is because the windows to your soul
              don't need anything you can find in a face cream.</p>
              <p><em>Price</em>: Sure it might seem better to buy the top-shelf skin products, but as  Paula's review of commonly available products demonstrates, <em><strong>spending  more may achieve little for your complexion</strong></em>.</p>
              <p><em>Science sells </em>: There's a reason the ads for some skin care
              products includes lots of complex-sounding terms along with diagrams
              and charts, it sells consumers the idea the goods have scientific
              merit. This may not be the case. For example, if you are applying a
              cream to your face, could it really fix the "damage" shown to have
              taken place in much deeper layers of the skin?</p>
              <p><em>What you really need</em>: The skin needs a lot less product than
              you'd think. A gentle cleanser, sunscreen and a pump-action moisturiser
              are what you really need. Your face needs sunscreen every day of the
              year too as UV rays on even a cloudy day can be damaging over time.</p>
              <p><em>Foundation</em>: DON'T apply a moisturiser underneath as this
              means it will sink into the pores and lines which doesn't look so
              great. Instead, apply a light poweder on top of a liquid foundation.
              This makes make-up stay on as the powder "sets" the base.</p>

                  supposed to be studying now but I can't settle down, so instead of
                  being totally unproductive, I shall be partially unproductive, and

              <p>Notice that in all four moisturisers, irregardless of price, there are a few common ingredients, one of them being Glycerin, and all other Glyceryl's and Glycerin derivatives, are more-or-less similar. </p>
              <p>Glycerin is a natural fat (lipid) and can be of either plant or animal origin.  Its purpose is to attract and retain the right amount of water into the skin to maintain suppleness and keep dehydration at bay.  Its presence apparently helps other skin lipids to work better as well, and for that reason, glycerin is an essential ingredient in moisturisers. </p>
              <p>Glycerols and Glyceryls are emollients and thickening agents.  They contribute to the overall texture of the moisturiser. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, Cetyl Alcohol.  "<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span class="clsHomeText">Fatty

              <p>Branded skincare is not necessarily expensive because of the ingredients used.  That's why I'm doing this mini investigation. </p>
              <p>As for R&amp;D, there are labs that exist which are not exactly owned by particular cosmetics and skincare companies but rather, these companies pay the labs a certain amount for the privilege of using the new formulas and what-not first.  It kinda works like the drug system where any company that comes up with a new drug is allowed to have exclusive rights to be the sole producer for a certain no. of years, afterwhich any and all other drug companies can then produce the same drug and market it under their own brand name. </p>
              <p>And you're right about the marketing, packaging, and the staff.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              this mean you should stop buying products that contain parabens? That’s
              a good question, but the answer is neither simple nor conclusive, even
              by the standards of the study itself. <strong>This is a potentially serious
              issue</strong> </span></span><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span class="clsHomeText">and the FDA is conducting its own research to determine what this
              means for human health (Source: <em>The Endocrine Disruptor Knowledge Base</em> (EDKB), http://edkb.fda.gov/index.html). To keep the concern in
              perspective, it is important to realize that parabens are hardly the
              only substances that may have estrogenic effects on the body.</span></span></p>
              <p class="bodytext-hangingindent2nd"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span class="clsHomeText">Any
              estrogen, including the estrogen our bodies produce, may bind to
              receptor sites on cells either strongly or weakly. So, parabens can
              either stimulate the receptor to imitate the effect of our own estrogen
              in a positive way, or <strong>they can generate an abnormal estrogen response</strong>.
              Ironically, plant estrogens, or phytoestrogens (such as those found in
              soy), also produce chemicals that mimic estrogen. It is possible that a
              weak plant estrogen can help the body, but it can also be possible that
              a strong plant estrogen can make matters worse. For example, there is
              research that shows coffee to be a problem for fibrocystic breast
              disease. The reason for this is thought to be because coffee exerts
              estrogenic effects on breast cells (Sources: <em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em>, October 1996, pages 642–644; <em>Journal of the American Medical Women’s Association</em>, spring 2002, pages 85–90; and <a href="http://www.som.tulane.edu/ecme/eehome/newsviews/whatsnew/archive/jan_dec2002.html">www.som.tulane.edu/ecme/eehome/newsviews/whatsnew/archive/jan_dec2002.html</a>).</span></span></p>

              “although recent reports of the oestrogenic properties of parabens have
              challenged current concepts of their toxicity in these consumer
              products, the question remains as to whether any of the parabens can
              accumulate intact in the body from the long-term, low-dose levels to
              which humans are exposed.” The study discussed the fact that </span></span><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"><span class="clsHomeText">, but was quick
              to point out that it is unknown if this would be the same in healthy
              breast tissue. Parabens present in tumors may not be the causative
              factor, but rather a result, of finding parabens when cancer cells are
              examined. It is also important to realize that <strong>parabens are used in

              yet, no one has any idea (or has evaluated) whether it is the
              consumption of parabens or their application to the skin that is
              responsible for their presence in human tissue. And no one knows what

              <p>Got a lot more to analyse, but my quick verdict - of the four moisturisers, #2 performed the worst.  The texture was oily and it wasn't absorbed quickly, and I didn't see any marked improvements in my skin from using it.  #2 felt like I had applied liquid wax on my skin... awful sensation!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>#1 did help to prevent further dryness, but it seemed to perform better at preventing moisture being lost from the skin than in replenishing moisture. </p>
              <p>#3 is a brand that is sold in pharmacies for use on sensitive skin.  There are dermatologists and GP's who'd recommend this as one of the brands that generally do not aggravate current skin ailments and irritate sensitive skin.  However, I found that whilst it does feel good and it does perform well to a certain extent, it wasn't my favourite.</p>
              <p>And, the top performer in this mini-test... #4!!!  L'Occitane's 20% Shea Butter Dry Skin Hand Cream!  Bloody expensive, but if you scrutinise the ingredients list, it's full of natural products sourced from different parts of the world.  That has to make it expensive!  I love this moisturiser because it really does make the skin feel softer and smoother without feeling overly-greasy and uncomfortable. </p>
              <p>In this case, the more expensive one DID win, but only because it was expensive due to the ingredients, not due to fanciful marketing and packaging. </p>

              <p>And I love their perfumes much better than the popular over the counter brands</p>

              <p>but i never had pimple problems... at most blackheads... that's why i just go for facials to relax and let them press it out. but i haven't gone for facial for some time already, colleagues too busy.</p>

              <p>High humidity does tend to cause breakouts, but on the flip side, you won't need moisturisers as badly as you do over here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
