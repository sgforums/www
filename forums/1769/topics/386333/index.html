              <p>Accident victim of Bukit Panjang hit-and-run accident cremated today; SPF still “investigating” the case</p>
              <p>December 28, 2009 by admin   <br>Filed under Headlines - Written by Our Correspondent</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Tong Kok Wai, the victim of a hit and run accident in the early hours of 15 December 2009 at Bukit Panjang, was cremated today. He was sent off by about 40 relatives and friends at the Mandai crematorium.</p>
              <p>His newly-wed wife of only one month Madam Yenni Young cried all the way from the wake to the crematorium. Mr Tong’s mother said she hope the police will catch the driver who did this to her son.</p>
              <p>30 year old Mr Tong, a Malaysian and Singapore PR, was crossing a road with his friend, Mr Bong Hwee Haw, 24, when they were struck by a black Audi A6.</p>
              <p>The car ploughed into another victim, 18-year-old Muhamad Haris Abu Talib, about 100m down the road.</p>
              <p>Mr Tong suffered severe brain damage from the accident and was declared brain dead by NUH doctors. His wife made the fateful decision to take him off life support at 2pm on Christmas Day. Mr Tong’s family agreed to donate his organs.</p>
              <p>The car was traced back to the Romanian Embassy. It was reported to be stolen at the time of the accident by Dr Silviu Ionescu, the embassy’s charge d’affaires.</p>
              <p>According to the state media, Dr Ionescu is currently overseas while the car’s regular driver is still in Singapore.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For some strange reason, the usually efficient Singapore Police are still investigating the case after two weeks and no arrests have been made.</span></p>
              <p>Due to the intense public interest in this case, the Singapore Police has to be more forthcoming with their information and updates on it instead of the customary reply – “investigations are still ongoing.”</p>

              <p>Think NTUC must read. By keeping prices low instead of gradually increase prices, this is wat happens. It can just happen to us</p>

              <p>I don't think it's a "big case" in police terms.</p>
              <p>My feel is big cases are things like robbery, serial murders, mas selamat escaping and such.</p>
              <p>Diplomatic immunity is a pain in the behind. Anyway I don't think boycotting the romanian imports is the way to go. Although pressure should be put on the Romanian govt. to revoke the immunity. And also if possible to reviewing giving of these diplomatic immunity.</p>
