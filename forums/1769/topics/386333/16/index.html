              believe most girls don’t get molested there which is why they still

              in previous years they groped at non-drunk females and were

              there should be some form of personal responsibility factored in as

              <p>I was told by a swiss boyfriend of a friend that in switzerland, a little old lady can walk around at 2am at night with her pension in a clear plastic bag and be perfectly safe. In Singapore everyone padlock their doors, spike their fences with broken glass, and live behind the grill, in seattle chaps like MG would pack a gun. He was most likely stretching it of course, must have been heavily laced with salt.</p>
              <p>But the distinction is there, cos the swiss made a decision about what sort of society they wanted. We as a society can simply write it off as "these things happen", and watch our society's safe spaces disappear, or we can draw a line somewhere. I want my female loved ones to be able to go out and have a bit of fun and let loose a bit without having to worry about her personal vulnerabilities, or suffer dire consequences for a temporary laspe of judgement or vigilance. This is not the banglas' home, but ours, isn't it ridiculous that we are drawing boundaries against them in our own societal space ?</p>
              <p>We have to take a stand, and bite down on such things, hard, instead of simply writing it off as the girl's own fault. We all have ladies we love and cherish too, don't we ? Now imagine one of them was that girl, up there. As a man, would you just roll your eyes and say "stupid cow, it's basically your own fault" ?</p>

              <p>I don't go around telling every faggot he'll burn in hell for being gay, I just want that he keeps his pecker and hands away from my ass and not sneak up from behind when I accidently drop my soap in a public swimming pool's shower hall, that's the difference.</p>
