              <p>I know this young malaysian couple, PRs here, technician level people, not really raking in that much by singapore's standards. They've been renting all the time, and because they haven't been here long, there's not much in their CPF. A friend intro'ed me to help them out.</p>
              <p>On top of that they can only buy resale. A standard three room is already asking for at least 30k over valuation, even if it's on the second floor beside the rubbish dump, how to buy ? They are not even eligible for those HDB reclaimed flat auctions.</p>

              They've been renting all the time, and because they haven't been
              here long, there's not much in their CPF. A friend intro'ed me to
              help them out.</p>
              <p>On top of that they can only buy resale. A standard three room
              is already asking for at least 30k over valuation, even if it's on
              the second floor beside the rubbish dump, how to buy ? They are not
              even eligible for those HDB reclaimed flat auctions.</p>
