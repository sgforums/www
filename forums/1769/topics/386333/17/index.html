              <p>Well, of course, the world is getting smaller and smaller, but don't every society expect new comers and guests to conform to the host's social code ?</p>
              <p>We may have to wait for a crime to happen, like in this case, before doing something, but we can send a strong message and deter others from doing the same thing, and prevent further victims. Criminal punishments is as much to deter other criminals as to punish the perpetrators. Wouldn't it be a deterrent if the pricks get caught and jailed and caned and the times of india or the hindustan times splash it on their front page back in their home ?</p>
              <p>If we would want the ah tiongs to queue up and not spit here, why shouldn't we expect the banglas to keep their hands to themselves and not rub against every girl on the train who's wearing a mini-skirt or a spaghetti top ?</p>

              <p>but then I was telling fatumnette, not to stretch too much for our first house, no need a huge one for starters, with this segar one, she can choose to be a housewife and we'll still manage very comfortably, can pay it off even before little fatums reach primary one, and we can build up our family capital for other long term stuff.</p>

              <p>I would say, go queue for a new HDB flat no matter what, treat it as a citizenship entitlement. HDB flats are still very heavily subsidized, get any flat, anywhere, and once the few years are up and you are eligible to sell them, sure make money even in a flat market.</p>
              <p>with resale prices the way they are now, it's still not worth it to get resale, even for the $30k $ 10k grant, unless one is in a hurry to get a place, I would say always go for a new flat and stay for a couple of years at least.</p>
