              <p>you'd have to pay for the upgrading if you hold the deeds to the
              flat when the bill comes around (actually, that means that the new
              owners of a newly bought flat may be hit by the bill when it comes
              around, so keep that in mind when shopping for newly upgraded
              flats, must ask if the upgrading bill comes around already)</p>
              <p>case in point, there's a three bedroom I knew recently that just
              went through upgrading, owned by a malaysian PR, he needed to sell
              urgently, cos there's going to be lift upgrading soon, singaporeans
              have to pay something like 1 or 2k for lifts on everyfloor, he had
              to fork out something like 11k if I remember.</p>
              <p>when upgrading comes around, PRs sweat.</p>

              <p>the thing is still how many people need topay for the upgrading. It isn't that many. I still remember last GE there were planned upgrades and what not in the plans PAP was distributing. Except for my block (not even a covered walk-way). Wanted to interogate the mp when he/she came around but I think they smartly avoided my block</p>
              <p>So perhaps some singaporeans benefit a little more *shrugs* </p>

              <p>key is over the years. which sort of makes sense because you
              also stay in the house for a number of year. So assuming you stay
              in the house for maybe 10 years, your grant is really only 3K a
              year. Not to mention that it's only a once off grant (I think) and
              so should really be evened out across the years in sg. assuming you
              live in sg for 50 years and you get that figure.</p>
              <p>And for males, note ns = 2.5 years. 1 year income for graduates
              - ns allowance = more about 30K or more.</p>

              <p>if you want to attach a monetary value to such things, then to be fair, the distinction between PRs and Non-citizens and Citizens in other countries is pretty much negligible too.</p>
              <p>tell you a story. After I graduated and got a job back in pluto, I was flummoxed to get a small cheque payment from the state gov. It's cos I had a social sec number issued together with my work permit, and since I did not report any taxes for the previous year, they thought I was unemployed, and so sent me regular redundancy checks which I collected and sent back .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>imagine that, I was not even a PR. If I were canadian paying 40% taxes I'd be spitting mad too.</p>
              <p>Here's something you chaps don't know. PRs are not eligible for the hardship funds given out for extremely poor families. PRs pay more for healthcare, even at the poly clinics, they are charged more for hospital stays and treatments, they get less subsidies for universities and no edusave grants.And that's on top of the housing benefits I listed above. It's interesting you know, before I took the real estate course, I never knew about the stark difference between PRs and citizens when it comes to housing. Do go read up on that, it's very interesting.</p>
              <p>look guys, our goverment is not perfect, but do give credit where it's due, at least we are not living in some third world shithole out there, we just have to compare ourselves to our neighbours north and south. And really, why such pessimism ?</p>
