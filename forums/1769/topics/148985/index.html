            <div class='col-md body'>A very interesting article in today's TODAY newspaper <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>What makes a job satisfying</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">by John Bittleston, TODAY newspaper, 22/8/05</span><br><br>The most important criterion is to deal with people using normal, face-to-face contact<br><br>THERE will soon be a shortage of companies<br>offering satisfying jobs. There is<br>already a shortage of companies that manage<br>people well. Unsatisfactory jobs turn<br>people off. They cease to operate well.<br>They opt out. Bad management does the<br>same.<br><br>What is a satisfying job?<br>You could help me define<br>it. Here is what I think matters.<br><br>Of all the criteria, I put<br>dealing with people in a normal,<br>face-to-face situation at<br>the top of the list. Lives deprived<br>of human contact are<br>dreary, dull and frustrating.<br><br>The people you deal with<br>can be suppliers, customers,<br>shareholders and colleagues.<br><br>The few people who prefer to work alone<br>have little difficulty satisfying their wish.<br>Human contact is not confined to one-onone<br>meetings. You can have a great relationship<br>using your computer or the phone.<br><br>It will not give you quite as much satisfaction<br>but it can work very well. (I do all my<br>mentoring by email and it has many advantages<br>for both my mentees and me.)<br><br>They say that the most Â“completeÂ” job<br>in the world is that of an airline pilot but I<br>would not want to be one. I understand that<br>before a flight, a pilot has a clearly defined<br>mission and at his destination he files his report<br>and goes to bed with the satisfaction that<br>he has completed the task he was set.<br>same.<br><br>There is no doubt that a Â“completeÂ” job<br>done well is very satisfying. I rate this as the<br>second most important aspect of a good job.<br><br>My next criteria, in order<br>of importance, are:<br>1) being well rewarded;<br>2) having a real chance<br>of promotion;<br>3) working for a good boss<br>Â— one who is considerate,<br>helpful, fair and thoughtful<br>but who lets you get on with<br>the job;<br>4) bright and cooperative<br>colleagues/working in a good<br>team;<br>5) being free from office politics;<br>6) feeling that the product or service<br>you are providing is needed, useful, enjoyed<br>and helpful;<br>7) working in reasonable conditions,<br>pleasant surroundings Â— light, airy and clean.<br><br>....<br><br>Do you guys share these aspects when thinking about job satisfaction, too?</div>

Pilots take home so much, 'drive' and seldom get punished. Ground crew take home less than 2-3 times their pay, make sure the aircraft fly and always kena shoot.  And after shooting us they still expect the best from us?<br><br><strong>"we have to give and take a little"</strong> - Yeah... we give, you take.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just had a recent transfer to a new work area at the start of this month.<br><br>At first, I was apprehensive, because for the past three years, since I graduated, I've been in my old ward.  I didn't like it there much but I had settled into a comfortable routine, and things were predictable.  Well, except for the Sisters' moods, which were highly volatile!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I guess I was in my 'comfort zone'.<br><br>My sudden transfer stunned me.  Inside, I could feel a sort of resistance against this change.  However, at the same time, I thought that maybe, this change would do me good because I had stagnated at my previous workplace already.  It was probably high time to go somewhere new, learn new things, broaden my experience and yes, make the good ol' resume look even better!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So, I went with an open mind.  And guess what?  I now  have more job satisfaction!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Here are the factors that makes my job satisfying :<br><br>- Great Teamwork!  Here, everyone, including the seniors and the management, roll up their sleeves to pitch in.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   It really boosts your morale when you know that if you're busy and stuck with a 'bad' case, your colleagues will willingly come over to help you without being asked even.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Here, they adopt a macro view - they run the entire ICU and they don't just think that they only care for the patients they are in charge of.  That really really helps!  I was really impressed!  Now, even when we're busy, I'm happy and I work with a spring in my step.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>- Enlightened Management!  The sisters not only help us a lot, they stand up for us and fight for us when need be.  They talk to us like we're equals, unlike my previous workplace, where the 'Wong Ah Mah' (Empress Dowager) or the military style was used.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  The sisters don't look at us with suspicion and they also don't talk to us with sarcasm and keep making accusations and hurtful comments at us.  This makes the working environment really pleasant!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   I no longer dread interaction with the Sisters like I used to.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I still work the same hours, and my pay remains the same, but my job satisfaction is much higher and I'm happier!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Things aren't perfect, but they're better and it makes a hell lotta difference to staff morale!  Now, I'm motivated!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
