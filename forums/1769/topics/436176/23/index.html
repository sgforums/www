              <p>I don't see why there is even a stigma attached to eating alone.</p>
              <p>If anything, I find eating out with colleagues to be a massive waste of time. You have to wait for everyone to get ready, you have to wait for a table that can fit everyone, you have to wait for everyone to order, you have to wait for the slowest person to finish eating before you can leave..... you get the point.</p>
              <p>More often than not I just eat alone at the canteen.</p>
              <p>If people give me strange looks because of that, then that's their problem..... I am simply being more time-efficient than they are.</p>

              <p>tat's just stupid... i totally dun see the link between eating
              alone and coming out of comfort zone...</p>
              <p>and instead of a table of 4 serving 4 person, u eat alone and
              chope the whole table to urself...</p>

              <p>When I eat alone, I don't see it as me occupying the whole table to myself.</p>
              <p>If you want to sit at my table, then go ahead and do so. Just ask me first as to whether or not the other seats are occupied. People have asked me that countless times, and I've always accommodated them.</p>
              <p>As acid has said, eating alone and eating in a group are personal choices. There should be no stigma attached to either choice.</p>
              <p>If I choose to spend more time with friends at the canteen, then that's my choice. If I choose to eat alone because I want to get back to work quickly, then no one can diss me for making that choice.</p>
