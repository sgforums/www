              <p>My attempt to guess what really happened:</p>
              <p>gay sees thread on penny low and decided to support her.</p>
              <p>gay remembers that being a teacher, it might not look good to
              post such comments using his account</p>
              <p>gay decides to post as his wife. whether he told her he was
              going to do so is anyone's guess.</p>
              <p>gay totally underestimated the shitstorm that will
              follow. </p>

              <p>That's most probably true.</p>
              <p>I guess he didn't realize that people could actually look at his wife's FB wall and find out her workplace. He certainly didn't count on NHC getting involved and disciplining her.</p>
              <p>So, in remorse over the trouble he got his wife into, he dived straight into the sh*tstorm without considering that he might get into an even bigger sh*tstorm.</p>
              <p>Seriously, he's looking at the very real possibility of jail time and the loss of his job. I expect that he will have a lot of sleepless nights in the days to come.</p>

              <p>For his sake, I hope not. He can explain the 10 year old comments as a young and stupid phase he went through. If they dig up similiar recent comments by him, he's screwed.</p>
