              <p>More foreigners <em>and</em> locals.</p>
              <p>On my part, I have been noticing a general decline in quality of the students over the years. I have to say that's just anecdotal evidence on my part. But I do know that my earlier students tend to request more consultation sessions, pay closer attention in class, and are less likely to do stupid things.</p>
              <p>The PM's call to allow more locals into uni may sound great, but if that's at the cost of granting admission to yahoos, then I'm not so sure about that at all.</p>

              <p>I know a bunch of people up north who supplies birds nest ... the same bunch also builds birds nest houses for people there ....</p>
              <p>basically the birds nest scam is like the shark's fin scam .... you know almost all of the bird's nest you see on display in the sinseh tonic shops are all reconstituted stuff eh ? ... they soak the raw bird's nest to get rid of the bird shit and slime and feathers, mash up everything, and then mould them back into the shape of a nest again before drying it. Raw birds' nest is a solid, rubbery piece that is a horrifying mass of bird poo and slime on the inside and grey underneath ....</p>
              <p>only a gourmet or a food science lab would be able to tell the difference between the "cave" nests or the "house" nests ... the "birds nests" are whatever the sellers calls it.</p>

              <p>red cave nests are actually just nests with iron oxide leeched into it ..... you can simulate that in a bird house too ... think rusting iron ...</p>
              <p>the ultra rare one, and one that's so super expensive you almost never see it in ordinary sinseh shops ... most people probably haven't even heard of it ....</p>
              <p>is the blue nest .....found only in the most ulu corners of irian jaya and the eastern ulus of indonesia ...</p>
              <p>now that one ... I think they haven't been able to simulate yet ...</p>
