              <p>I have it on good authority that many rich tai tais down south would commission grade A pirate goods modelled after the really expensive brands, like hermes or fendi ... instead of buying the real article .... </p>
              <p>the finished product .... while costing less than a real fendi or hermes .... would still cost around an LV .... go figure ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>someone showed off a real hermes birkin and a "hermes" birkin side by side to me once .... frankly they have pretty similar stuff for 199 baht at chatuchat too ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>A Chinese national woman criticised Singaporean men as short on looks but says that she intends to marry a Singaporean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to a report in The New Paper, singer Zhang Miao Yu, who comes from Xi'an, China is here to look for a husband.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Zhang is 26 years old, 1.69m, has a boxomy figure and looks like Hong Kong star Sammi Cheng. She is confident with her looks and currently sings at the nightspot, Shanghai Dolly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Zhang said that she hopes to develop her singing career in Singapore, and at the same time, find a husband.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I have nothing to lose in coming here. I am young and I want to see where my singing can take me. But my ultimate goal is to find a good husband," she said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While she hopes to marry a Singaporean, she also said that Singaporean men are arrogant and chauvinistic, short, and not as good looking as the men in China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporean women interviewed say that local men constitute a long term meal ticket for Chinese national women like Zhang.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Huang Ting Ting, 38, said that Singaporean women have a life to pursue and "not just a husband". She feels that to women like Zhang, Singaporean men are their meal tickets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Huang added, "If Singaporean men, especially the married ones, are so easily charmed by the Chinese women, they certainly do not deserve to be with Singaporean women."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms May Yee (37, beautician) said that she expects divorce rates to rise with the influx of these Chinese women here looking for husbands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ms Jenevieve Lee (40, designer) said, "With more Chinese women coming here, there will surely be more social problems. We are already facing problems like a rise in divorce rates, young people not getting married and the married ones not having children. Shouldn't our government do something to control these social problems?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She continued, "Singaporean women are already marrying later because they put more emphasis on their careers, the last thing we want is to fight with a Chinese woman over a husband. For me, I will just focus on my career."</p>
