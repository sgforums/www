              <p>105 will ply straight to Int from S'goon Ave 3. Sv 109 will be amended to replace Sv 105 along the deleted sector.</p>
              <p>315 will make 1 round via Town Centre &amp; NEL Station before entering Bus Int.</p>

              <p>Bus 81 &amp; 82 will not terminate at new Int (It's too cramped), so they'll loop at Town Centre &amp; Serangoon Stadium bus stop before heading back to Tampines &amp; Punggol Int. 82 will no longer head to Punggol Rd End.</p>
