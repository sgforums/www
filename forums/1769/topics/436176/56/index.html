              <p>Yeah, well, I suppose they're mechanical analogues of electric motors.</p>
              <p>You need reels that can provide high torque to handle heavier and more violent breeds of fish. You also need reels that are more refined with high RPMs to handle smaller breeds of fish to make sure you catch them before they can shake themselves loose.</p>
              <p>Does that sound about right?</p>

              <p>You mean if she don't allow you to fish you will go to the lup sup bars? :O</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's always healthy in a relationship to be able to do the things you like and also some free time away from each other</p>

              <p>my thought is that the kid din get any trouble as they are able to spend more time with doggy as they brought them to the vet early in the morning... school time somemore :D</p>
