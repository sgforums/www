Before I got married, I was living alone in a 3-room flat. I have a circle of friends and enjoyed the freedom tremendously. Well, at that age, we do hope to be able to find a partner, but my well-being was never dependent on that. Meeting someone and getting married is nice, but I do miss those carefree days when I lived alone.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
