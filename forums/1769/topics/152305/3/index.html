The MIL asked and so I gave my views about these test kits is not always correct and she need to get tested by a doc. She dragged her feet for 3-4 months before going and all the while  vomitting due to morning sickness. Everyone was all worried for her wondering what's wrong. All the food and cooking were all geared towards making her feel good and etc. She also used the excuse to avoid all work and just lie down there like a whale. So one time I was making wanton soup for their family. She happened to come by with earlier. The MIL treated me like a maid and started making loud noise I was slow and shove me aside and serve up the half cooked pot of soup where they drank until not much left and I had to start cooking all over again. Was trapped in the kitchen for hours serving everyone.  At the end I was so fed up I quickly ate and go home. This is the kind of thing I am going to get, then really I see no point. Anyways, the SIL stayed in their house for 7 years sleeping with her BF (oldest brother) free loading off them all this time and the MIL always pity her cause she's m'sian and she think she had a difficult time with the previous rental. I paid for my rental and still get sh!t from her and she give me the attitude that I am "using" her son. Actually I paid the down payment for his car. I paid for his last trip to US and sometimes I paid for his petrol where he would go ferry everyone around. I had to put up with his temper and such. Seriously. At this point. I am happy to remain single.<br><br></div>
