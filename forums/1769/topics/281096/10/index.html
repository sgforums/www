She is in pain and has lost a lot of blood. They pick up severed limb<br>A Caucasian woman was standing outside the McDonald's outlet near Far East Flora at Queensway, when a car suddenly swerved and hit her.<br><br>Seconds later, she was on the ground with her right leg severed below her knee. Her left leg was also broken.<br><br>The woman, who is in her 30s, is now at National University Hospital (NUH).<br><br>The accident occurred at 7.30am last Tuesday.<br><br>Police said a car and a bus collided along Queensway outside the fastfood outlet at Ridout Tea Garden.<br><br>The car then skidded into the carpark at the tea garden and hit a stationary car. It then hit the woman and another parked car before finally stopping.<br><br>Mr Andy Gun, 28, a foreman at nursery Far East Flora, was about to start his shift when he heard a loud noise.<br><br>His workplace and the McDonald's outlet are at the Ridout Tea Garden.<br><br>Mr Gun said: 'It was 7.30am and I had just changed into my work uniform. Suddenly, I heard a loud bang.<br><br>'I thought the McDonald's outlet was on fire and rushed out to see what happened.'<br><br>There was no fire, but what Mr Gun saw next shocked him.<br><br>Lying on the ground in front of him was the woman's severed leg.<br><br>Mr Gun said: 'That was the worst thing I have seen in my life. When I saw it, I was so scared that I was shaking. I ran back to my workplace.<br><br>'After that, I lost my appetite for lunch and dinner. I kept thinking about the accident and could not sleep.'<br><br>LOUD CRASH<br><br>An employee at the McDonald's outlet, Mr AL Jeffry, 25, said he was waiting to deliver some takeaway meals that morning when he heard a loud crash coming from the carpark.<br><br>'When I went there, a Caucasian woman was lying on the ground,' he said. 'One of her legs looked like it was chopped off and the other leg was badly broken.<br><br>'Moments before, one of my colleagues had served her. She bought a takeaway meal and was leaving the place when she was hit by the car.<br><br>Video grabs of a camera phone clip taken by The New Paper reader.<br>'There was a lot of blood and she was in pain, but I did not hear any screaming. A woman was cradling and consoling her.<br><br>'I ran into the outlet, got some water and gave it to the woman helping the victim.'<br><br>Mr Jeffry saw an empty bus by the main road and three damaged cars in the carpark. He said one of the cars had hit the woman.<br><br>A Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) spokesman said they were informed of the accident at about 7.30am. An ambulance arrived within 10 minutes.<br><br>The spokesman said: 'The woman was in pain and had lost a lot of blood. She was in a confused state when the paramedics reached her, but she did not become hysterical.<br><br>'We retrieved the severed limb, placed it in ice, and rushed it and the woman to hospital.'<br><br>RUSHING TO SAVE LIMB<br><br>Mr Jeffry said his friend, who was with him, used a camera phone to capture a video clip of the accident scene. The clip shows SCDF paramedics attending to the injured woman.<br><br>There is also footage of one of the paramedics picking up what looks like the severed leg and rushing to put it into the waiting ambulance.<br><br>The woman is now at NUH's Surgical Intensive Care Unit.<br><br>Paramedics place severed limb in ice, and rush it and woman to hospital<br>A hospital spokesman said she was alive, but could not say more as her family declined to comment on her condition or give any interviews to the press.<br><br>It is not known if her leg has been re-attached.<br><br>Police said that investigations into the accident are ongoing and no arrests have been made to date.<br><br>Anyone with information on the accident can call the Traffic Police hotline at 1800-547-1818.<br></div>
