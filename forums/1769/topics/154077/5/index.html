He directs the baking program at New York City's Institute of Culinary Education, so he knows the questions before they are asked--a neat trick when you sit down to write a cookbook for a general audience. With A Baker's Tour Malgieri presents over 100 recipes for breads, cookies, cakes, pies and tarts, puff, savory, and fried pastry, even dim sum from around the world. What might normally be an alarming proposition, baking the unfamiliar in an American kitchen, becomes a journey of discovery in Malgieri's capable hands. He answers the questions before they are asked.<br><br>A Baker's Tour is divided into chapters based on the kind of baking, not the country of origin. After brief words on ingredients and equipment that will come in handy, Malgieri opens with Breads followed by Yeast-Risen Cakes, Cookies, Cakes, Pies and Tarts, Savory Pastries, Puff Pastry, Strudel and Filo Dough, and finally Fried Pastries.<br><br>You'll find Ligurian Focaccia you can bake in your oven, not a wood-fired brick behomoth, or Naan for the oven or grill for those who don't have a tandoori oven at home. Prune-Filled Buns, kolache, from eastern Europe and Honey Cakes from western Europe shouldn't be overlooked. Norway's Princess Cream Cake demands an exercise regimen all its own. Egypt's Spicy Meat Pie in a Filo Crust with Yogurt Sauce is as captivating as China's Barbecue Pork Buns (cha shao bao).<br><br>There's a world of baking between the covers of A Baker's Tour. Your tastebud-driven curiosity is your passport. Let Nick Malgieri be your guide. --Schuyler Ingle<br><br>Sounds like a really good cookbook!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It's been here for months liao but it's a really beautiful book!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Not that I'm going to make my own chocs anytime in the near future  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ... but this book makes a good read and it's pretty fun flipping through it.<br><br>"Yockelson (Baking with Flavor) has produced a book that is both encyclopedic and deeply personal, combining detailed information, clear instructions and engaging anecdotes. Even the most seasoned cacao bean lover will find surprises among the 200-plus recipes, while bakers at every level of expertise will appreciate the meticulous guide to techniques and ingredients (which includes a chart showing the relative strengths and uses of 180 different chocolates, from powders to Milky Way bars and imported brands). Recipes are organized around flavors, textures and themes, like "Back-to-Basics Chocolate Cakes," "Chocolate Pancakes" and "Mudslide." Whether explaining the family history of Chocolate Chip Cracks or Grandma Lily's Marble Cake, or the technical challenges of Bittersweet Chocolate Creams or Sweet Chocolate Streusel Tea Biscuits, Yockelson expands the reader's stereotypes about chocolate. It's a complex and seductive ingredient for grown-up eaters and the most sophisticated cooks. With 150 color photographs in a lush, oversized format, this work is destined for a long life on every serious baker's shelf.<br>Copyright Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
