I grew up without a mum so I don't have a role model.  As for dad, he is usually not home.  The TV sort of was my guardian.  I took in a lot of "cho lang eh toh li" from there.  But back in the early 60s, the HKG drama always the "cham cham" one.  Always grievance type and then got to bear in silence type.  I became like that.  About pre-teen, my neighbour noticed these group of children "boh lang kuan" took us to church.  From then on, I have only God to thank that I didn't turn out to be some "sam seng", which I mean anything is a possibility.<br><br>So, yes, the Bible and God was then, my parents (and spiritually still is).  But pai seh....now, not church goer but I don't feel any less inferior.  Maybe my bible knowledge sucks but FAITH.....no way!!!  He is with me....all along.<br><br>Okay, change directions.  I don't know if my hubby is like my dad.  But certainly, hubby is strong, in will, mind and I guess physical strength too.  So, he is our rock.  And I belong to the category who look up to the man.  I mean I can be "strong" in the office but then at home, sing a different tune.  I guess everything is comfort level, whatever we are comfortable doing and also peace in the family.<br><br>Am I out of sync with topic already?  I think I go get a tea.
