The flooding might have been traumatic for you, but the important thing now is to get those responsible for it (i.e., the contractor) to make amends. Tell them what you want done; be firm, perhaps even forceful. But don't go flying off the handle with expletives and the whole nine yards, as it may diminish the contractor's resolve to make things right with you.<br><br>I've found that, in dealing with others, <span style="font-style: italic;">even if they have done you wrong</span>, a little diplomacy goes a long way.<br><br>Just a thought.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
