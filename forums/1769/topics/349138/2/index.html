              <p>Whoa... what a predicament!! </p>
              <p>My first thought was - two troubled people getting together for
              comfort and companionship. </p>
              <p>I'm pretty surprised that the man is willing to take on so much
              responsibility.  Perhaps, he's trying to get what he couldn't
              in his failed marriage?  Men do think differently and they
              seem to get themselves busy in work or other activities to take
              their minds off their grief and sorrow.  Maybe that's what
              he's doing - make himself the breadwinner of an instant family so
              he'll feel that he's worth something again.  Maybe he thinks
              that will erase the sense of failure and disappointment in his
              divorce or something.  I'm just guessing here...</p>
              <p>I can tell you now that the typical Club 30 answer will be :
              It's their lives, they can do whatever they want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>firstly, even guessing, what made you think it is the guy's failure? In a divorce, both parties lose.. "worth something again", I don't think that is kind to a guy who is willing to take up the yolk and support the gal thru her pregnancy.</p>

              <p>the 7 times one - i dunno who the hell she is, but i heard is
              diff father.. *zips*</p>
              <p>Anyway, i went wif my fren for one of her abortion.... watched
              the video wif her..</p>
              <p>and yes, there is the option of cuttin the unborn and not fully
              formed baby to bits and vacuum it out</p>
              <p>There is also the option of inducing birth and lettin the baby
              die.</p>
              <p>My mama seemed disturbed yest aft hearin all these... (I dun
              really tell her wad sort of friends I have out there, you
              see..)</p>
              <p>And err... my gf wise.... 3 times... 1st was accident the guy
              shot inside, 2nd time was she kena forced upon by the den BF, 3rd
              was they thought it was "safe" period.</p>
              <p>And err... rape can be by BF one lor... some guys dunno wad is
              called NO and USE RUBBER</p>

              better. Show them the damn video of the babies' leftover aft gettin
              sucked out of the womb.</p>
