              <p>Whoa... what a predicament!! </p>
              <p>My first thought was - two troubled people getting together for comfort and companionship. </p>
              <p>I'm pretty surprised that the man is willing to take on so much responsibility.  Perhaps, he's trying to get what he couldn't in his failed marriage?  Men do think differently and they seem to get themselves busy in work or other activities to take their minds off their grief and sorrow.  Maybe that's what he's doing - make himself the breadwinner of an instant family so he'll feel that he's worth something again.  Maybe he thinks that will erase the sense of failure and disappointment in his divorce or something.  I'm just guessing here...</p>
              <p>I can tell you now that the typical Club 30 answer will be : It's their lives, they can do whatever they want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I'm just postin this coz I just realised last nite...</p>
              <p>To me it seem like a common occurance.</p>
              <p>but to my mum and sis... it's like sooooo exciting <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>My suggestion was tat the baby will b better off given away for adoption for a better life.</p>
              <p>i'm not sure what you guys think.. but the girl is preggy wif prev bf's baby..... so tat means she's with this current guy for less den 6 mths?</p>
              <p>And the guy is already sayin he wans her and the kid?</p>
              <p>Even thou he's old enuff to be her father, if he was "lucky"?</p>
              <p>But in a marriage... havin a kid frm a prev r/s is hard on the kid, IMO...</p>
              <p>and wad if the guy's parents disapprove of the "grand kid"?</p>
              <p>I dunno.. but there's always the risk of mental abuse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(darn... u need 4 mths to know you're preggy??!!)</p>

              <p>best solution is probably give birth then offer for adopt.Don't marry. if want marry, later then say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but then mentally once give birth, unlikely to give up one since she wants the baby.......... the girl also abit no brain so late then want to do anything.</p>
              <p>The guy also like something wrong. don't know how long he know the girl. she 4 mths pregnant but not his means either she go and sleep around while they were together or they only got together less than 4 months (assuming they are even together)</p>

              <p>They always say grandparents talk differently when the baby is out</p>
              <p>But seriously if she can't decide I think it's better to give the baby up for adoption</p>
              <p>No point getting married hastily to a man who wants to take responsibility....it's easy to say ...you never know what he thinks later....</p>

              <p>Btw Fatum, not all men want to take responsibility. From what I see a lot of them like to fuck around but disappear faster than David Copperfield when a child is created.</p>

              <p>personally, i'll suggest to birth and give up for adoption...but the few mths carryin the child... and watchin the BB grow... is something not all woman can give up.</p>
              <p>heck, a fren of mine have a few dolls in her closets - 1 for each she aborted.</p>
              <p>Cant imagine how much worst if you actually watch the bb grow day by day.....</p>
