            <div class='col-md body'>1. Do you think that you're living a healthy lifestyle?  Why or why not?  Have you taken any recent medical tests / check-up's?<br><strong><span style="color: #483D8B;">Yes, when I'm in Melbourne - it's a relatively healthy lifestyle.  I walk a lot on a daily basis, I have to move about a lot and exert myself physically on the job, I eat healthily and my portions are controlled.<br><br>Yes, my last full medical check-up was done just a year ago.  Everything's in order and under control.  Clean bill of health!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></strong><br><br>2. What lifestyle habits do you think you will have to change in order to become healthier?<br><strong><span style="color: #483D8B;">Think I'll have to incorporate regular exercises more.  I hate cardio exercises but think that for the health benefits, I just have to somehow force myself to do it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Also, I have to continue watching my daily dietary intake.  If not careful, my tendency is to over-eat.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Other than that, I don't smoke and have never bothered to even try, and I very rarely drink and when I do drink, I prefer CHOYA.  No other bad lifestyle habits except having a tendency to over-eat and being too lazy to exercise much.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </span></strong><br><br>3. How often do you exercise?  What's your favourite activity?  What new sports / activity would you love to try?<br><strong><span style="color: #483D8B;">Daily walks.<br><br>Favourite exercise would be the BodyBalance, BodyPump, and Spinning classes in the gym.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   I love 'em cause the modules incorporate really great music to exercise to and I NEED that musical distraction!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I'd love to try Rowing.  I'd also love to learn how to ride a bicycle.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  And oh, instead of BodyBalance, enroll in a proper Yoga and/or Pilates class.</span></strong><br><br>4. Imagine that you've just been given an entire week off!  What would be your preferred way of spending that time-off?<br><strong><span style="color: #483D8B;">Either spend that time lazing around at home, and making plans to go out for shopping / movies, or travel to some leisurely resort to veg out in scenic surroundings.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></strong><br><br>5. What is your opinion on diets?<br><strong><span style="color: #483D8B;"></span>Diets, esp fad diets, are stupid.  They often do more harm than good and the effects are usually only temporary.  Some diets might even endanger you in the long run.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></strong><br><br>6. Would you rather be slim and forever hungry and craving for food, or would you rather satisfy your urges and live with being plump / fat?  Elaborate.<br><strong><span style="color: #483D8B;">Depends, I go through phases.  Right now, I'm torturing myself, trying to make sure I don't eat as much as I used to because one thing I've learnt is that we don't really need to eat that much to survive and that Singaporeans are forever over-eating.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></strong><br><br>7. What sports / activities do you consider to be dangerous and which you'll never ever embark on?<br><strong><span style="color: #483D8B;">Hmm... bungee jumping can injure you really badly and give you an effect akin to whiplash and you could end up with serious spinal injuries.  Not worth that risk.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Surfing's dangerous... can get hit by the board and get concussed or a serious brain hemorrhage if you fall off; can get bitten by hungry sealions or sharks, as is the case in Australia; etc.<br><br>Attempting daredevil acts is dangerous.  Jumping off a cliff to dive is also dangerous.  Hmm... can't think of anything else atm.</span></strong><br><br>8. Have you ever spent time worrying about your health?  Do you fear falling ill or being diagnosed with chronic ailments?  What worries you?<br><strong><span style="color: #483D8B;">Yes.  I'm quite a worrier, as are most nurses and docs.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   We tend to over-diagnose ourselves each time we experience some symptoms!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I worry about falling ill with no family nor close friends to rally around me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I worry about being ill and forgotten and poor...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I also worry about getting chronic debilitating illnesses like cancer, kidney failure, leukemia...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </span></strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unhealthy and quite blase about it LOL<br><br>1. Do you think that you're living a healthy lifestyle? Why or why not? Have you taken any recent medical tests / check-up's?<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I lead an unhealthy lifestyle, too much food intake and too little exercise.<br>I've been to the Gynae early this year.</span></span><br><br>2. What lifestyle habits do you think you will have to change in order to become healthier?<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Eat moderately, more healthily and exercise more.</span></span><br><br>3. How often do you exercise? What's your favourite activity? What new sports / activity would you love to try? <span style="color: green;"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Once a month if lucky - I usually swim.   I enjoy dancing, it is probably the only exercise that doesn't feel like work ; would love to learn more new styles.  Pilates on the rack . </span></span><br><br>4. Imagine that you've just been given an entire week off! What would be your preferred way of spending that time-off?<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mostly on R&amp;R.</span></span><br><br>5. What is your opinion on diets?<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bad ones are painful LOL.  Often wrongfully directly associated with starving models and eating disorders - technically any eating plan is a diet, even a forgiving, expansive one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></span></span><br><br>6. Would you rather be slim and forever hungry and craving for food, or would you rather satisfy your urges and live with being plump / fat? Elaborate.<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I could only choose one or the other, I would eat and grow fat.  Life is too short to live in constant denial of enjoyment. </span></span><br><br>7. What sports / activities do you consider to be dangerous and which you'll never ever embark on?<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mountain climbing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Too heavy and center of gravity is too low... need arms of steel &amp; stamina of mountain goat to hoist my mass upwards...</span></span><br><br>8. Have you ever spent time worrying about your health? Do you fear falling ill or being diagnosed with chronic ailments? What worries you?<br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Only enough to buy insurance.   I do worry sometimes about my lifestyle habits, it is difficult to eat healthily when you have moved on from mummy's (ok la maid's ) home-cooked meals.  Should do something about it....</span></span><br></div>
