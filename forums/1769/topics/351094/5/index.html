              <p>You see, we Muslims count days from sunset to sunset. So
              Thursday night is actually a holy day for Muslims (since it
              actually counts as Friday, which is a holy day).</p>
              <p>Long ago, Malay parents would tell their children unholy stories
              about demons and ghosts lurking around on Thursday nights. They
              would do so in a bid to prevent the kids from playing around on
              such a holy night and to instead spend it in prayer. </p>
              <p>These stories became oft-repeated and the myth of Thursday
              nights being haunted arose. </p>
              <p>And somehow this myth got into the SAF. I guess that's how that
              stuff about the recruit being killed specifically on a Thursday
              night came about.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And yes, I find it dumb to use unholy stories to scare kids into
              respecting a holy night. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It
              is a well-known fact that Pulau Tekong has a number of ghosts. Some of
              you readers may have read or heard about the ghost at Charlie Company
              at the old basic military camp 1. Unfortunately, some versions that I
              read or heard have been distorted over the years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Here,
              I hope to set the record straight. Instructors and trainees of Charlie
              Company, Infantry Training Depot during the March-June 1983 period can
              vouch for my version of the story. It is NOT my intention to revive
              hurtful memories especially for the bereaved family or to blame anyone,
              but purely to narrate facts as they had happened.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The
              starting point of this true story should be the 16 Km route march about
              18 years ago. Before the march, the Officer Commanding of the company
              asked the trainees whether anyone was sick or not feeling well. No one
              put up his hand. But there was a trainee among the company, Recruit
              Tham W.K., who was down with flu but did not put up his hand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Then
              the route march started. The platoons took turns to lead the company
              after each break during the route march. Sometimes, the pace of the
              march became too hot for some trainees, who could not keep pace and had
              to fall out. They became stragglers and had to be picked up by a few
              instructors walking at the rear of the company. The landrover with the
              medical orderly was also supposed to be at the rear.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Somehow, Tham fell out and managed to slip out of view by taking cover in the forest. He was not to be seen alive again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">During
              subsequent rest breaks, there were head-counts. He was presumed to be
              with the medical orderly. It was only in the evening after the route
              march, when the the rifles were due to be returned to the armoury, that
              they realised Tham was missing. They went to the medical centre but he
              was not there. The instructors feared the worst. Overnight, they
              organised a night-search party for him, re-tracing the 16-Km route
              taken earlier in the day. They could not find him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The
              next day, the entire Camp I ceased training and batches of instructors
              and trainees were dispatched to find Tham. It was only about 5 p.m.
              that his own platoon commander (PC) found his corpse. Near a forest
              track junction, the PC noticed a half-pictched tent. He called out but
              there was no response. As he neared the tent, he noticed many flies
              buzzing around and detected a foul stench. There lay before him his
              dead trainee, lying with one hand holding his rifle and the other hand
              outstretched with a water bottle, with its cover opened. The PC broke
              down in tears and wept openly.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(A
              subsequent post-mortem showed that Tham had apparently died of stomach
              rupture. When his body system was still hot from the heat of the route
              march, against the advice of instructors, he had apparently gulped down
              massive amounts of water suddenly. It was like pouring ice cubes into a
              thin glass of hot water, which can cause the glass to crack. But the
              post mortem also found puncture marks on his body, which could not be
              satisfactorily explained to this day.)</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It
              was left to the Company Sergeant Major and his landrover driver to
              drive the corpse back to camp for transfer to the mortuary. It was
              twilight at that time. Inexplicably, the engine could not start. The
              thought of the two of them spending the night with the corpse unnerved
              them. But eventually, they somehow had the engine started and returned
              safely to base.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The
              late Tham was promoted to NCO and cremated at Mount Vernon with full
              military honours. As the company trainees lined the road snaking up to
              the crematorium to salute our late comrade, it was a heart-breaking
              sight to see a distraught mother being supported by two daughters
              following the hearse.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">A
              few instructors returned to the site where he departed from this world,
              to offer incense and prayers. One instructor asked the late Tham not to
              come back and haunt us, but rather to express his last wishes in a
              dream so that his soul could rest in peace after his wishes were
              fulfilled.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But Tham did not listen.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What I need now was someone who was there between 1986 and 1984.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As luck would have it. I found such a man.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">He
              is 1st Sgt Phua, currently from the same platoon as I am, serving as a
              NSman in 27 SIB. Sgt Phua was a recruit in Bravo Company, in the year
              1986.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">He
              was aware of the 3rd door, but he wasn’t aware of the route march
              death. Sgt Phua said that he heard that a recruit hung himself in that
              bunk, and after a bout of strange disturbances, a Priest was called in,
              who after a ritual declared that a 3rd door have to be made in order
              for the aggrieved spirit to leave the bunk.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Sgt
              Phua thus provided the missing link that I was looking for. Though
              certain facts could never be ascertained to a high degree of accuracy,
              we could deduce the following conclusion from our interviews and
              research.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Our Conclusion</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">1.  
              It is very possible that at the time of the death of the recruit in
              1983, the 3rd door was not built yet. That would explain why people I
              interviewed belonging to that period was not aware of any 3rd door
              mystery.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">2.  
              It is very possible that there was a transition period in which for
              reasons as yet unknown; a 3rd door was built in a Charlie bunk. It is
              possible that supernatural events occurred in that bunk, including a
              suicide, that led to a Priest being called in, and a 3rd door created.
              Sgt Phua knew about the suicide in the bunk with the 3rd door.   </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">3.  
              Over a year or so, someone realise the connection, or created the
              connection between the route march death and the 3rd door.</span></p>

              <p>The guy supposedly died on a Thursday night.</p>
              <p>The thing is, this 'no night training on Thursdays' predates the
              story, going back to the 60s. At least, that's what I've heard from
              my Encik and a couple of other sources.</p>
              <p>I'm thinking that whoever came up with the story of the third
              door extrapolated it to the 'no night training on Thursdays'
              rule.</p>

              <p>Well, the third door may be real.....</p>
              <p>But as kopi's source stated, the circumstances behind it are not entirely clear. Someone may have hanged himself, and maybe not.</p>
              <p>It also may well be true that that person died on a Thursday night, but that may well be a coincidence. From what I know, the 'no night training on Thursdays' rule predates the story, and someone may have simply put two and two together.</p>
              <p>I think I gotta ask the older generation about this 'no night training on Thursdays' rule..... my Encik wasn't old enough to be in the previous generation.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In
              one special session, which I unfortunately missed, but my fellow
              officers told me, <strong>it involved a Mindef Directives on not conducting
              training on Thursday nights</strong>. <strong>The reasons cited included an increased
              risk in accidents, injuries and incidents occurring in Thursday

              a mysterious death of an army recruit. The incident supposedly occurred

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Basically
              it involved the incident of a recruit who went missing halfway through
              a route march. First the platoon, then the company, then the camp, and
              eventually the entire island was mobilized to look for him. They found
              him the next day, with his body disemboweled, along the route of the
              route march. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- but this is where the timings don't match up. because the route march incident was 1983, the investigator isn't sure about the validity of  "no training on thursdays" rule.</p>

              <p>Regardless of whatever your beliefs may be, some things are simply not meant to be messed around with.</p>
              <p>Like that Malay kid I bumped into during SAF ward duty, who was in a near-catatonic state after asking a bomoh to put a hex on his former poly lecturer (I kid you not).... whether it's self-suggested psychosis or not, I don't really want to know.</p>
              <p>I can still remember my dad sending me off at the ferry terminal at Tekong on the first day of BMT..</p>
              <p>As religious as he may be, and as much as he doesn't believe in all this spirit stuff, he gave me a stern look and told me to recite a short blessing every time before entering the jungle.</p>
              <p>Oh well.... I gotta go now. Experiments to do.</p>
