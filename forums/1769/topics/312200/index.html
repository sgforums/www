              <h1 class="clr">Investing in marriage pays rich dividends</h1>
              <p>Is marriage a ticket to happiness or an investment opportunity?</p>
              <p>For marriage counsellors Chan Hon Shek and Chan—Lai Fung Ling, it is the latter.</p>
              <p>The
              business of marriage requires plenty of time, love and conflict
              resolution skills before it can pay off in terms of happiness and
              bliss, they say.</p>
              <p>"Many people take courses to upgrade their
              skills in their careers but very few take courses to better their love
              relationships," said Mr Chan, 55, who, together with his wife, have
              been marriage counsellors with Touch Family Services for 15 years.</p>
              <p>To
              improve the quality of marriages here and arrest the rising divorce
              rate which hit a record 7,061 cases in 2006 the National Family Council
              has organised the third annual "We Are Married!" campaign, which runs
              until Sunday. The highlight is the Marriage Convention at Suntec
              Convention Centre on March 29 and 30.</p>
              <p>The Chans, who have been married for 25 years, will be conducting two sessions in Mandarin at the convention.</p>
              <p>While
              counselling others makes them more vigilant of how they communicate
              with each other, they admit sometimes "(losing) control like any other
              normal couple". The important difference is never to mention divorce in
              the heat of anger and to apologise to each other afterwards.</p>
              <p>"We always remind ourselves not to make the common mistakes that unhappy couples face," said Ms Chan—Lai, 49.</p>
              <p>Interestingly,
              almost all the 20—odd cases they see each month are couples struggling
              with children who are rebellious or who lack interest in their studies.</p>
              <p>The
              problem usually stems from cracks in the couple’s own relationship,
              which may be caused by extra—marital affairs, a lack of sexual
              intimacy, problems with in—laws or other issues. The Chans would focus
              on ironing these out, after which "their children’s problems would
              usually be resolved as well".</p>
              <p>Another husband—and—wife team said
              they have learnt, after almost 26 years together, to fight fairly. For
              Mr Patrick Chew and his wife Hazel, this means handling the issue at
              hand, instead of "reacting against each other".</p>
              <p>The Chews, who
              met at a Port Dickson church retreat in 1978, said they are no
              different from other couples. "We are neither saints or angels. As
              human beings, we are selfish by nature," said Mr Chew, 48. "But perhaps
              we have aged and over 25 years of ’fighting’, learned not to take
              offence easily."</p>
              <p>Besides conducting marriage preparation courses for Touch Family Services, they also counsel about three couples each month.</p>
              <p>Apart
              from helping others, they have also learnt from others’ problems. For
              instance, counselling couples on the verge of divorce has made them
              more sensitive to each other’s emotional needs. And meeting partners
              who are disrespectful of each other reminds Ms Chew, 50, "not to speak
              rudely to Patrick".</p>
              <p>Best of all, there are the happy endings. One
              couple had gone to see the Chews when they had all but given up on a
              troubled marriage, in which one partner had had an affair. The Chews
              helped them work out their issues, helped them to "forgive and receive
              forgiveness from each other". That marriage is now back on track, and
              the couple is expecting their second child, said Mr Chew with pride.</p>
              <p>The
              Touch Family Festival on tomorrow and Wednesday consists of a series of
              lunchtime talks on strengthening marriages. Mr Patrick Chew will be
              speaking at ABN Amro’s Li Bai Room on level 22 of One Raffles Quay
              tomorrow at 12.20pm. The talks are open to the public. No registration
              is required and seats are filled on a first—come—first—served basis.
              Those interested should call 6317 9988. — TODAY/ra</p>
