              <p>I was tortured with piano lessons from 7 to 15. Tortured! Didn't help that I lived right behind my piano teacher and he could hear me *not* practising my pieces. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>When I entered secondary school, we had to pick one of three instruments - pianica, recorder or guitar. The pianica reminded me too much of the piano so I stayed clear from that choice. I had played the recorder till death in primary school and pooh-pooh'ed at that. My initial excitment with learning to play the guitar turned to dread. While I enjoyed the instrument, having to endure pain while stretching to reach the right chords was, well, a pain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> Has anyone here played in a band? I love listening and watching bands play. Especially Tania at Anywhere. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> Zul's my fave.</p>

              <p>From Pri 3 or 4 onwards, I had Organ lessons.  Mom bought a Yamaha Electone Organ from her boss for a really good price 2nd hand so she decided to send me to Yamaha Music School.  I really loved the lessons, loved to 'play by ear' and loved the improvisation module.  I used to watch Hong Kong TV series with my parents, and then play the theme songs on the organ.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  Everything I heard that I liked, I would play it on the organ.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I had to stop lessons cause when I reached the 2nd last grade, I needed to purchase a better organ because mine was the basic model and I couldn't pass my music exams on it.  However, mom couldn't afford an organ so there went my lessons.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p>Yeah I play the piano</p>
              <p>Took the tests till Grade 5</p>
              <p>I hated it and dreaded it till I got this piano teacher who instead of just making me play the typical classics, let me try Jazz, Pop and what not and I actually started to enjoy it.</p>
              <p>No she did not force me to take the exams too :P</p>
              <p>I was playing pieces past Grade 5 but didn't go further because what I hated more than practising the piano was doing the theory work!!!</p>
              <p>My Piano is still at my parents place, speaking of which, I should send someone down to maintain it. It's those old fashion type made of really solid wood.</p>
              <p>Though it is not some famous brand but at least it is made in England and definately sound much  better than the cheapo Japanese brands out there made of light wood.</p>

              <p>well I played the piano since 3, the harp since 10, and self taught the guitar and violin. Hated it at first but eventually learnt to love music. I've got an LRSM and LTCL for the piano, and a grade 7 after teaching myself how to play the violin. As for the harp, I didn't take exams cos it was troublesome shifting harps around...</p>

              <p>I've always wanted to learn to play wind instruments tho. Like the piccolo :)</p>

              <p>I am in a band but I am playing vocals haha! But I can play the guit and bass and suck at the drums.</p>
              <p>Music has always been my passion. To some, its a hobby. But to me, music is an escapade where I can retreat to. I have always sang KARAOKE haha with my relatives since young, but the first time I decided I wanted to take music seriously was when, beileve it or not, i saw the November Rain MTV. I wanted Those PVC tight pants and girls screaming at me when i am singing on stage haha. But I started only seriously writing songs and getting in a band when I was 17, in the first year of polytechnic. Since then, music has accompanied in difficult times, when I fractured my legs, out of action for 4 months and having to "learn" to walk, when I failed my exams, when I faced difficulties with my parents, when I faced disappointments in work and recently when my father passed away. Its amazing the healing power of a voice singing to a simple song on a guitar.</p>
              <p>I thank God for the gift of music and so everyone, be thankful you have the gift to be able to play and feel music!</p>
