Can you be displaced easily?<br><br>My contention is that if it is too easily attainable, it cheapens the entire value of studying for it.<br><br>Oh well, obviously there are others who think that a degree is just a degree.

Most professional courses whittle down their numbers in university by taking in the best students in JC. Unfair, but effective.<br><br>If they allow anybody to simply take, say the bar exams in the law society and skip the elimination process altogether, then law wouldn't be as exclusive as it is now, would it? never mind that it may be difficult and all, but by opening up another group of people another shot at it makes the profession a lot less exclusive then it really ought to be.</div>
