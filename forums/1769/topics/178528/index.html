            <div class='col-md body'>A friend told me that it is possible to love a person with all your heart..... and then get to know another and love him /her with all your heart too .  Without loving the first person any less . (Confused yet?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">)<br><br>The friend likens it to having a second child; you don't love your first child lesser.<br><br>If one believes in the above theory, that a person's capacity to love can be increased and expanded to more than one person... then I guess polygamy is rational.<br><br>Personally, I cannot accept my husband loving or marrying another, and I don't agree with the above rationale...... but I can't come up with any concrete reason to reject it, other than the fact that the love for a child is not the same as the love for your partner.<br><br>Maybe it could be pure simple seslfishness, wanting to possess your partner solely and entirely.</div>
