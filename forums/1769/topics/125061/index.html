            <div class='col-md body'>I let my mind wander back more than a decade ago, where I was but a child.<br>A world of wonder captivated me, with sweet drinks in plastic tubes and bus conductors that had brown vinyl bags.I remember him punching holes in these colorful tickets along a bumpy bus ride.I remember the wind in my hair, where glasses were black and thick.People smiled more and were more forgiving.I remember running around in school, and watching fire engines speed pass the junction from the Methodist Book Room.<br><br>I recall watching cartoons in the evenings after school on RTM 2, my first tast of flying space robots and heroic pilots of toys that talk.I remember the coolness of the grass after my mum had watered the garden, and I just walked on it..letting the cool blades of grass tickle my sole.I still see the koi swimming around and I remember the way they swam to me as I fed them.Sometimes lunch would be a meal from the hawker centre down the hill, with a nice drinks seller who sold fabulous otah.<br><br>I look back, and the sky had a pretty blue air to it, a sense of hope and anticipation of growing up.I remember the brick walls of the National Library, and gazed at couples walking down Fort Canning in suits and gowns as we rested after a softball match.It was there that I realised that God existed , and that He gave me the strength to run just that bit faster than my friend.Ah, the innocent wants of a kid.<br><br>Yesterday I hear of men and women who calmly watched a man die on a track, not even lifting a finger to halt the train or even attempted to do so.<br><br>Now all that is gone, and even though my world looks more glitzy and pulsating.I can't help but wonder if that heartbeat is mechanical and that the real world has died a long time ago, and we are but batteries keeping this falseness alive.And our charge is slowly dying day by day, unless we find the socket that gives us our power.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Anyone feels the same way?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
