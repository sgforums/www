              <p>What do you guys think of the latest Indiana Jones offering? I thought it was okay until we got to the ET part. What gives? Looks like Spielberg recycled one of his old ET props into the crystal skull. Maybe I was expecting too much from Karen Allen's role repraisal, given her spunky character from the first installment. She was so unlike her old pistol self. A big disconnect for me.</p>
              <p>Also caught Iron Man. I have to say that I enjoyed this more than the above. It held my interest from start to end. If you haven't seen it yet, stay till after the credits.</p>
              <p>Narnia was kinda fun. I just wonder where he got the name Aslan from. Everytime I hear the name, I think of an old co-worker I had.  A nice Malay boy named Haslan. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>These are the three that I managed to catch. These days with movie prices so high, one has to be selective about where you dump your cash.</p>

              <p>I have not seen the new Indiana Jones movie yet. Given Harrison Ford's current age, I'm half expecting him to appear onscreen in a wheelchair sporting a bottle of Geritol. If I really need to watch the movie, I'll probably just wait until it's released on DVD, then download it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I actually did watch Iron Man a few weeks ago. In my opinion, it was pure eye candy, and nothing more.</p>

              <p>I enjoyed Indiana Jones.  It was kinda sentimental for me, watching him come alive on screen again... transported me back to the '80's, when Indiana Jones was like THE big action movie.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Darnit... I was much younger... and also much sweeter then!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>I thought Cate Blanchett did a really good job in her role!  She's got awesome acting skills to be able to pull off a role like that, complete with that accent!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>OK, the alien bit was a bit too OTT, but I loved the adventure, the scenery, and the action.  However, when Indiana Jones had to do stunts like running over the tops of the cartons in the warehouse, I found myself thinking, "Gee, I hope he doesn't have rheumatic joint pains!" Harharharhar!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>I think before Indiana Jones, the last time I watched a movie in the cinema was more than a year ago.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  It just doesn't make sense to pay so much to watch a movie over here.  Besides, if one's patient and waits for the DVD releases, and then to wait for the subsequent price drops, one can actually get original DVD's here at a price that's either equivalent to, or lower than, the cost of a cinema ticket! </p>

              <p>Interestingly.... the choice of Samuel L Jackson came from the Ultimate Marvel universe.</p>
              <p>In the mainstream universe, the appearance of Nick Fury that was created was based on James Dean.... the 1940s version of 'cool'.</p>
              <p>When they created the Ultimate Universe, they wanted to create a Nick Fury with a 21st century version of 'cool'. As such, they asked Samuel L Jackson for permission to use his likeness.</p>

              <p>So how much does a movie ticket in Sg cost now? I go to the drive in, $8 for two movies, kids under 12 are $4. Theatre prices are $8 during the matinee and $11 outside of matinee hours.</p>
              <p>Has anyone caught the Sex and the City movie?</p>

              <p>Sooo many movies, so little time (and money).</p>
              <p>What do you guys think of the latest Indiana Jones offering? I thought it was okay until we got to the ET part. What gives? Looks like Spielberg recycled one of his old ET props into the crystal skull. Maybe I was expecting too much from Karen Allen's role repraisal, given her spunky character from the first installment. She was so unlike her old pistol self. A big disconnect for me.</p>
              <p>Also caught Iron Man. I have to say that I enjoyed this more than the above. It held my interest from start to end. If you haven't seen it yet, stay till after the credits.</p>
              <p>Narnia was kinda fun. I just wonder where he got the name Aslan from. Everytime I hear the name, I think of an old co-worker I had.  A nice Malay boy named Haslan. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>These are the three that I managed to catch. These days with movie prices so high, one has to be selective about where you dump your cash.</p>

              <p><br>Haven't been to the movies since... gosh, October/Nov last year, and that was coz I was given 2 free tix to watch Juno!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>With ticket prices ever-rising in Sydney, it's not worth it paying $15 per tix to watch a movie! (it's $8 on Tuesdays, but still, I'd rather wait for the DVD release)</p>
