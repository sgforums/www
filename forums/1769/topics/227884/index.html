            <div class='col-md body'>Let me share this... I'll quote the whole thing, verbatim...<br><br>------------------<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Two Phrases That Destroyed American Culture</span></strong><br><br>December 13th, 2006<br><br>Every time I promise myself that I will work on controlling my temper, I always end up making a scene.<br><br>This time, it wasn't my fault. All I wanted was a bagel. A bagel, a cup of coffee, and perhaps a spot near a window where I could idly watch the traffic go by as I browsed through the newspaper and licked cream cheese from my fingers. But apparently the Gods were not on my side.<br><br>Today I got in line behind a middle aged woman in a fur coat who was barking orders at the poor bagel girl like she was a dumb misbehaving dog. Fur Coat was ordering multiple bagel sandwiches from a list, but instead of ordering them in such a way that would make sense, she was attempting to order them all at the same time. The Bagel Girl was obviously confused and you could tell by her shaking hands that Fur Coat's harsh tone was intimidating her. Finally, Fur Coat snapped, "I said light butter on that bagel! Light butter! Jesus!"<br><br>I couldn't stand it anymore. I cut in, "You don't have to be such a bit<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ch about it."<br><br>Fur Coat glared daggers at me and stated, "I'm not."<br><br>"Well, I beg to differ."<br><br>With a disgusted 'Hrmph,' Fur Coat went back to her overly complicated order, but she did so quietly and even managed to begrudge the poor girl a 'Thank you' after she was finished.<br><br>I have a theory about asshole customers: I think they only act that way because no one ever calls them on their bulls<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>hit. The poor kids behind the counter canÂ’t stand up for themselves lest they lose their jobs and other patrons look the other way claiming 'it's none of my business.'<br><br>Fuc<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>k that. When I see some self important asshole verbally degrading a teenaged kid with dead eyes behind a counter, it ruins my day. So, I say some sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it. Besides, I feel that if I stay silent, I am almost giving an abuser permission to act like a raging asshole. Ignoring their behavior suggests to them on some sick level that what they're doing is Ok.<br><br>It's not OK.<br><br>The phrase 'The Customer is Always Right' is the single worst philosophy that has ever been adopted by American culture. It gave an entire generation of people the green light to be as impolite, unreasonable, and demanding as their little hearts desired because they were always going to be considered right. It destroyed the entire concept of courtesy and rendered manners obsolete. People began to treat their peers in the service industry like incompetent morons, lacking in feelings or human dignity, who deserved to be browbeaten and abused for no other reason than they had the audacity to run out of a particular brand of coffee. Furthermore, instead of suffering negative repercussions for their appallingly disrespectful behavior, they are awarded with free coupons and plenty of ass kissing. In reality, they should be shunned and humiliated for behaving like such self absorbed little children.<br><br>Speaking of respect, another idea that has ruined American culture is the one that states, 'I donÂ’t give respect freely. You have to earn my respect.' This one is most often uttered by punk kids with bad attitudes and black fingernail polish.<br><br>Fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cking gag me.<br><br>I mean, how egotistical does one have to be to automatically assume that their respect is so fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cking important that one must jump through multiples hoops in order to earn it? How about we give people respect because they are humans with lives and feelings just as important as our own? Why not give people a default level of respect and more or less can either be won or lost based on the behavior of the individual? The loss of respect is something that should be based on actions. The idea that that one must win basic respect in the first place is incredibly belittling. How narcissistic can you be to embrace that ideology?<br><br>(continued next post)<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><br>(continued from above post)<br><br>A few Sundays ago, my husband and I went out to breakfast. If anyone has ever attempted to go out to breakfast on a Sunday morning, they know that restaurants are usually packed around then. We were finally seated and our server was not only very busy, but also a new employee according to her 'Hi! IÂ’m new!' nametag.<br><br>I'd like to say that everyone in her section was very understanding. The place was a madhouse and she was obviously out of her element. I wish I could say that the patrons in that restaurant were mannerly and polite and treated her with even an ounce of dignity and consideration. But, if I did, I'd be fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cking lying.<br><br>Nearly everyone yelled at her or condescended to her like she was a stupid little child. One guy ordered a side of 'home fries' and reamed her ass when she brought him French fries. Had he looked at the menu a little closer, he would have seen that 'home fries' werenÂ’t listed. This particular restaurant only served French fries or hash browns. Her mistake was understandable and he was basically yelling at her because she didnÂ’t read his mind accurately enough.<br><br>But let's all forget about that for just a moment. Instead, I want to point out that there are a multitude of things that can go wrong in one's life. Death, illness, and poverty just to name a few. Yet, here I was watching a grown man lose his fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cking sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it because he was going to have to wait 5 minutes for a side of hash browns. Suddenly, I lost my appetite.<br><br>At this point, the angry little man demanded to speak to a manager and a kowtowing corporate wh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ore scuttled over with free coupons and many apologies. The angry man furiously demanded that his waitress be fired right that instant.<br><br>Over hash browns.<br><br>I couldn't take it anymore. I leaned over and interrupted, "When you're finished talking to this man, I'd like to speak to you. I have the same server."<br><br>The angry man smiled smugly, no doubt convinced that I was going to back him up on his quest to get a new girl fired because he had to wait 5 fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cking minutes.<br><br>The manager finished with him and moped over to my table ready for his second tongue lashing of the day. I surprised him by loudly saying, "I just want you to know that our server is doing the best that she can. She's been trying very hard and has been very sweet to us even though that asshole has treated her so poorly."<br><br>The manager suddenly looked panicked and started shooting terrified looks at the table that just finished reaming him out. "I know," he whispered fearfully, "Don't worry, I'm not going to fire her."<br><br>And while I was pleased to learn that this particular manager wasn't going to fire the new girl based on the whim of some fat ass piece of trailer trash, I was disappointed that he rewarded said trash's temper tantrum with free food. I long for the day a manager walks up to a table and says, "How dare you treat my employee this way. Get out now."<br><br>I'm sure they want to, but that ridiculous policy 'The Customer is Always Right' silences them. So until we banish that phrase from American culture forever, I suggest we quit looking the other way when people behave like scumbags.<br><br>After all, technicalities may suggest that they are always right, but that doesn't make them any less an asshole.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess it goes both ways. there r rude customers and rude servers. recently i complained (i was pretty fierce) to a manager at a jap resturant about his waiter.<br><br>Our table had ran out of saucers and my dining companions asked the waiter to get some. they were asking nicely, using words like "please" and with a smile. he rolled his eyes at us and walked off. 10mins later still no saucer. so we asked again. this time we got rolling eyes and a "wat the fuck" look. this was way too much so I called the manager and told him that his staff was rolling eyes at us and what was his problem. The manager was very apologetic and got the waiter to come over to apologize. Guess wat was the waiter's excuse for not bring us the saucers? "Sorry sir, I'm not assigned to serve this station". OMGGGG, even if he was not assigned to serve this station, it would not kill him to get us some saucers right? even if he din wan to do that, he could have informed his colleague who was in charge of serving our section.<br><br>Good service goes both ways, if the server is being rude, you can't expect the customer to swallow it and enjoy their dining experience. if the customer is being unreasonable, the manager would need to know how to pacify the customer. i too use to think that singaporeans r bad customers, but this recent experience showed that they are bad servers too. resturants with bad servers dun deserve to have my money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reminds me of an incident at, of all places, Econ minimart.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The cashier had accidentally given this middle-aged woman short of $2 in change. The woman had already left the minimart when she realised the mistake. She then came barging right into the minimart and screamed at the poor cashier as though she had been planning to mug her from the start.<br><br>The cashier apologised profusely and gave her an extra $2 note. But that wasn't enough - the blardy woman kept screaming at the top of her voice at how 'my rights have been infringed!!!' and that 'I should sue the shopkeeper!!!' and how the cashier 'should go to jail!!!!'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Some of the other customers tried to reason with her, saying that there was no need to get so worked up and that the poor cashier had apologised and given her the correct change. Even her husband (who was with her) tried to calm her down.<br><br>In the end, she left after more than five minutes of non-stop ranting.... and only because her husband pulled her away from the place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It annoys me when I see people abuse the "Customers are always right" policy.  Afterall, the person who provides the customer service is also human and the customers shouldn't treat them like they are slaves.<br><br>Nowadays there are too many people who only know how to blame others for their mistakes and fail to take responsibility for their own actions.  One of these examples is:  A woman sued the department store after she tripped over in the store.  The worst thing about this is that she tripped over her own child!!!!  What is it to do with the department store??  Guess what?  She won the law suit.  This happened in America.  How sad!<br><br></div>

They state that it is limited to 10 wrappers per customer.<br>I'm not surprised they did that because they provide the wrapping service as well and during the peak season, there should be alot of people queuing up for the wrappers and free wrapping service.<br><br>I think they are afraid that run out of wrappers too (and make other customers unhappy) and the other reason they refused could be so that they will be fair to other customers.
