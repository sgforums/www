              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Tonight, I had dinner at cafeteria il lido .. </p>
              <p>It wasn't good ..</p>
              <p>First when we got there, this waiter told us, there is a special pasta of the day which is not listed in the menu .. and its bla bla bla ..</p>
              <p>we ordered our food ..</p>
              <p>i had a 4 cheese pizza (timbre's 4 cheese pizza is WAY better)</p>
              <p>Others had Roast beef, chicken, pork dishes .. they were alright. The roast beef was raw at some places..</p>
              <p>Ferret had the creamy salmon pasta .. according to her, the pasta looked like a "level 5 dish" .. it tasted alright .. the portion is relatively big but the salmon is not fresh ..</p>
              <p>After our food, which we thought it was mediocre, the waiter asked us if we would like desserts. When we said we didn't want any, 1 minute later, the bill was thrown on our table.</p>
              <p>Fine.. so we paid .. I said UOB card got 15% discount .. so ah gui used the UOB card. AFter that, the bill came, then he signed .. after that then i rememberd to check if the discount was given. It wasn't. So I asked the waiter.</p>
              <p>The waiter said "not applicable on fridays" but i told him to check, coz i saw it on today's TODAY. He took the card. went to check. came back to say they will need to reverse the 15% discount out. so we waited ..</p>
              <p>After a really long time, I asked that same waiter where is the bill? the waiter said repeatedly, that the bill is coming. It took so long because they need to do the reversing and we should have told them about the discount BEFORE we got the bill</p>
              <p>We were really pissed by then .. as if its our fault for not telling them that there should be a discount!!</p>
              <p>so, pls, if u all want to go and try .. just remember the food is quite mediocre .. u probably get more satisfaction going to Astons ..</p>

              <p>oh. and they talked about the food being authentic Italian. I'm
              absolutely sure that there is NO cream cheese in 4 cheese pizza ok.
              Their's did. haha. Their food is still edible. But even with that
              kind of price, I'd rather go eat something else at a food
              court...</p>
              <p>I'll give it a few more weeks. I will consider going again just
              to see if it's still there. (yes, i believe in giving people
              chances ok!)</p>
