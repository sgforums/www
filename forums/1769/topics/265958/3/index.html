            <div class='col-md body'>I remember doing the following:<br><br>1. Being the cause of a chair topple which saw my younger brother ending up in hospital for surgery to remove a broken toe nail. He was like only 2 years old and was crying all the way.<br><br>2. Used to scream out of my house window for no reason...<br><br>3. use to take chopsticks and use them on tupperware just imitate drumming on them..<br><br>4. had a very run down guitar and a very kiddy speaker with a microphone set. but at certain volume settings, having the mike inserted into the acoustic guitar allows one to create a "distortion" feel through the speaker.. this served as my electric guitar for quite a while..<br><br>5. My father bought quite a cool hi-fi set.. i think i abused it by using it as the amp for an electric guitar.. the amp has blown since..<br><br>6. I use to blackmail my brother for foul words he says.. just to get him to do things for me..<br><br>7. used to compete with my brother in a game to recap interesting things that we had been through in the past.. the game went all the way into our early teens...<br><br>8. challenge my brother to name things related to almost anything.. names of countries, names of toys, names of transformers ..<br><br>9. just go to OG every week to just stare at the size of the fortress maximus toy box.. which was almost the same height..<br><br>10. bought a airplane model (those that requires glue and assembly) and threw away the box which had instructions... so in the end the plane never got off the plastic bag..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>11. played with paper bullets and staple bullets too. almost blinded someone.. hit lower left eye.. but was nv caught cos no one own up and everyone was punished..<br><br>12. there is also this little thing you can do by twisting the individual staplets together to create some thorns that you can put on seats during class.<br><br>13. i used to throw tantrums by banging my head on the wall.. i recalled this incident when i couldn't draw trees and leaves the way my mom did... haha.. and i just got up and banged my head on the wall just to express my frustration.. haha<br><br>I also remember some of my brother's pranks:<br><br>1. We were at my grandma's kampong and he rubbed medicated oil onto the nose of cats just to see them react. Its really cruel but the expression from the cats are quite funny. He did the same to chickens.. but the chickens simply just ran and ran..<br><br>2. He was angry at my mom once, he just took out her ic and threw it out of the window.. to this day. my mom nv knew how she lost the ic..<br><br>3. This next one happened quite recently.. so not so much of a childhood thing for him. This time he was angry with my dad and suspected him of breaking some of the stuff that belonged to him. In retaliation, he threw away my dad's MP3 charger and USB cable..<br><br>Memories..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
