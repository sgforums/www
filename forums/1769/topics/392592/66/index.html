              <p>done liao.. 2nd time with a help of a friend.....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>went to pump petrol yesterday.  went into the kisok and
              remember, huh. the tank left side or right side.  park at a
              side and take a look.  then all pumps were occupied. so i took
              my time..  saw one pump suddenly empty.  drove up and
              erhem..with the help of the very helpful prc pump attendance (very
              nice chap).. we started chatting while he did the job for me..
               </p>
              <p>suddenly one lady from the cashier side runs up to us.. 
              where is the car..?</p>
              <p>me and pump attendance went <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">.</p>
              <p>cashier said the car before pumped $75 worth and ran off... i
              vaguely remember it is dark colour (cos it is pretty far where i
              stop just now)..</p>
              <p>poor pump attendance kana scolding.. but not his fault wat.. the
              bloody esso got about 10 pumps all occupied, only 2 staffs outside,
              how to notice and grab the idiot from running... moreover, this
              pump attendance was helping about 4 pumps away.. how he can see
              wat....  I have to tell the cashier not his fault wat...</p>
              <p>cashier was very nice to me after that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>then when i drive off, the KNN driver block the exit ..i was
              waiting behind him to move, as i have highbeam to signal him, he is
              blocking everybody going out.. he even dare to switch off engine
              and got off and ready to go to the mart buy things.</p>
              <p>The same pump attendance and the customers (the nearest pump to
              him), scolded him and ask him to move!</p>
              <p>Me and Mom (inside car) was grinning away...and other customers
              were laughing too.. </p>

              <p>They have "drive offs" in Singapore too? Surprising. I thought people there were universally law abiding. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Over here,  the gas station pumps are almost always monitored with CCTVs set up to have the cars' license plates in view, so a "drive off" will usually result in the car's number being traced and the perp arrested. Drive-offs were really bad around here when gas prices were pushing US$4/gal. a few years back.</p>
