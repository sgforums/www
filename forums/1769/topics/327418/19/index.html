              <p>wah shiok ! .... I love this girl's blog ....Â <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">I have started to date someone. He is however a tramp. Let me explain.<br><br>Joe is the quintessential HDB heartlander who grew up in a typical peasant household with good hardworking, honest parents who unfortunately were dealt a bad hand by fate. Joe however was lucky - he was born with a good brain. Having attended all the best schools in Singapore, he went off to Stanford on a scholarship and now holds a respectable job with the Government with a respectable wage. Joe is driving a BMW he bought himself and is very proud of it. Joe is intelligent, holds a good conversation and is very interesting. I enjoy his company tremendously one-on-one.<br><br>However, Joe cannot escape his roots. You can take the heartlander out of an HDB but you can't take the HDB out of a heartlander. There will always be a rough edge to him. Although I enjoy his company greatly one-on-one, Joe does not fit in well with my friends. He is uncomfortable at our socialite parties, and finds it hard to be himself at our dinner parties, Tatler gatherings and the like. It is also obvious that he will never truly get along with my parents.<br><br>My parents prefer me to date Jonathan, a blue-blood like me. Coming from old money, Jonathan is urbane, suave, dresses well and moves in the right circles. He is however not the sharpest tool in the shed, although his social charm covers this up well enough. Like many thick rich kids, he attended USC and does not need to work. He parties all the time, jets around with friends like him; he drives an Aston Martin his dad gave him as a present. Jonathan fits my social circle like a glove on my manicured hand - however whenever I am with him, it all feels rather contrived. Most of all, I don't find him interesting, being exactly like the boys I grew up with.<br><br>I am in such a dilemma. Joe or Jonathan? Should the Lady be with the Tramp who makes her happy, a simple man, a peasantboy made good but who will never be friends with her friends? Or should the Lady be with the Prince Charming, a thoroughbred like her, an aristocrat who will unfortunately never achieve anything in his life other than being born into the right family?<br><br>The Lady and The Tramp has always been a film that fascinated me.</span></p>

              <p>take a load of this .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">Â .... a couple of chaps are engaged in a cock fight in the original thread over this, so I guess I'll reproduce it here ...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Village Graduates <br>I have been engaging a half-educated person in a semblance of intellectual debate under the comment pages of "A Good Christian Girl" and "A Refutation of Sorts".<br><br>As everyone knows, I did not go to a local university; whenever I come into contact with a local graduate, their intellectual paucity always astounds me .<br><br>The worse people to debate with are the badly educated. The uneducated are easy to dismiss. The well-educated are a joy to debate with, even if sometimes disagreements can get quite heated - you nevertheless go away mentally stimulated and satisfied. The badly educated on the other hand (like this person who more or less admitted to be an NUS Arts and Social Science graduate) are painful to debate with.<br><br>These people have read the right books, memorised the right key words and phrases, but have no real understanding of the issues. Worse, they lack to intellect to analyse these topics properly. In these cases, what happens is that you get verbal diarrhoea spewed at you and you don't even know where to begin to argue back, because even though all the paragraphs are correctly stringed together, the sentences are grammatical, the spelling is almost always right, the right names and phrases are dropped, BUT the person does not make any sense. This leaves you intellectually frustrated because unlike uneducated people, you have to unteach before you teach. It's like a gadfly, albeit without the intelligence of Socrates, which you have to swat away, because this person talks your language ostensibly, and you feel a compulsion to correct her.<br><br>The local universities cannot be good until the government stops sending the brightest overseas on scholarships; however, the local universities will fail to attract them until they can draw the best thinkers and dons on all levels, rather than second-rate teachers from India and China. It is a vicious cycle and until this cycle is broken, local university undergraduates (with the exception of Law and Medicine) will always be second-rate, so much so that some foreign (mainland Chinese) undergraduates have said that Singaporeans are stupid. If their experience is only at the local universities, it is no wonder they say that, since our most brilliant have all gone overseas to Oxbridge and the Ivies, Stanford or MIT. What these mainland Chinese have not experienced are these students who have not only gone to the best universities in the world, but consistently top these universities. I honestly think that the mainland Chinese and Indians who top NUS/NTU/SMU would be easily trounced if they came up against our true best and brightest.<br><br>Singapore needs to put more resources into universities if it wants to be taken seriously as a First World Nation. The vicious cycle needs to be broken somewhere - they need to hire the best professors and get some of the brightest to stay at home. These may lead to fewer places at the local universities so some people will not qualify. But some people don't belong at universities - they would probably serve society better by getting technical proficiency at a polytechnic, then joining the workforce.<br><br>Afterall, it's better to be a non-graduate than a half-educated village graduate.</span></p>

              <p>Sad to say that to some extent I have got to agree with her post on 'Village Graduates'.</p>
              <p>From my experience, it is true that too many local undergrads study but don't learn. They mistake the scoring of marks with getting a real education. They engage in so-called 'smart studying skills' like spotting questions, memorising a few key phrases and such....</p>
              <p>Hell, I've been mocked for studying like sh*t for my exams and for not wanting to spot topics.</p>
              <p>But hey, to me spotting topics is like Russian roulette. You spot properly, you score well. You spot wrongly, and you're royally screwed from behind. Such people get as many Cs as they get As.</p>
              <p>What I disagree with this spoilt brat of a 'lady' is how she tars everyone with the same brush. I guess to her, all local undergrads are the same, eh?</p>
