I feel bad seeing these old folks still working hard because they've probably worked hard all their lives already and ought to be enjoying their retirement years.

I grew up with a majie and a maid. My cousins grew up with maids as well, and I don't see us turning into horrible snobs!<br><br><span style="color: orange;">I think education by parents play a part as well. Any domestic help was always treated as part of the family and we were always taught to address the maid as 'jie jie' or 'auntie', depending on the age. We were punished if there was any disrespect to the maid as well, so I guess if the parents treat the maid as a slave and not even the basic respect given to a human being, their kids will just follow suit.</span></div></blockquote>YES!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>It's not wrong to be born into a rich family with domestic help.  BUT, it's wrong to treat the domestic help with disrespect.<br><br>Just go to any food court these days during peak periods and observe the families with children and their maid.  A lot of times, the kids are really spoilt, obnoxious brats who talk down to their maids.  I've even seen kids shouting at their maid 'So stupid!' and the parents didn't even do a thing about it.  In fact, they probably are guilty of saying the same themselves.<br><br>I believe that there's a kind of multiplier effect too when it comes to stuff like that - if the parents were themselves rude, obnoxious spoilt brats, then their kids would most likely be like that too, if not worse.  Unless, of course, the kids get exposed to situations that effect a change on them, otherwise, kids learn what they observe from their parents.  It's a vicious cycle that tends to worsen with each generation.<br><br>Well, just a hypothesis, albeit an extremely disturbing one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, one fine day, I walked up to my neighbour's door, holding the glass bottle his grandson had just happily tossed in the corridor in front of my flat.  Right in front of him, I rebuked his grandson for littering, sternly told the old chow ah pek that he should stop spitting along the corridor, asked him to stop being a bad example to his grandson, warned them if they persist in these habits I will definitely take further action with the authorities, and then walked off.<br><br>Well, I censored off a lot of erm... 'details' re. the incident but suffice to say that it was totally justified because I had tolerated their gruesome behaviour for the past year or so and enough is enough!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">   Besides, I had nicely warned them about their anti-social and unhygienic behaviour twice prior to this.<br><br>All said, it's sad, isn't it, that it takes a stranger to warn the grandson about not littering.  And he's in Upper Primary now, it's not like he's ignorant about things like that.  It's just that his grandfather condones the behaviour and is even guilty of it himself and therefore, his behaviour goes uncorrected.<br><br>And oooh... I love it when I rise up to the occasion when I need to be an absolute bitch!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   I live up to my favourite quote - Just because I choose to keep my claws sheathed, does not mean I have no claws!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
