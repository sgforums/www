They complain a lot, that's why cats can't be kept in HDB flats.<br><br>Maybe your keykey ever dirtied the corridor and some neighbour of yours couldn't stand the sight of it?  So maybe keykey was 'released'.. it wouldn't be bad if keykey is kept by a kind soul.  What I'm afraid is keykey being abused or straying around looking for food and shelter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I duno whether u have tried... but If I were u, I would have walked around the neighbourhood to look for it.. even if I have to walk a few streets.  It really pains my heart if I lose my pet.<br><br>I remember that time I walked around, I asked those people who feed cats...whether they saw my brownie.. and I was scolded by a woman in her 50s.. she asked me how come I can lose my pet?  What kind of owner am I?  I almost cried out.<br><br>Sorry, I'm not trying to sadden you further, but my ex colleague ever told me that cats will leave their owner when it knows that it is dying.. How old is keykey?  Is it healthy?<br><br>Sorry, I used 'it' because I duno is keykey a boy or girl.  I would have used he/she if I know.. coz I understand that if u love ur pet, u wouldn't call your pet 'it'. </span></div>

I don't think u would be able to spare enough time for a constant watch so why not get a PI? It wouldn't be just getting yr cat back. If the person is someone who has something against animals, it'd be a great thing to suss him/her out too. And with surveillance tapes, maybe SPCA can bring a case against him/her.</div>
