            <div class='col-md body'>I got to qualify this..<br><br>strictly no description of people.. i.e. nice looking guys/ gorgeous ladies..<br><br>what i am talking about is to describe the best scene that you have seen and can recall til this day even though it could have happened ages ago.. perhaps let me start first..<br><br>this happened when i was back in jc. was pretty hooked onto going to this study room.. cos usually there will be this girl that walks by haha but its not her i am talking about here.. so its like a routine for me to go to this study place after normal lessons and whe ni was slogging for the A's in the A's.. so it just happened that this one fine sunny afternoon.. i was looking out.. and then it was like some leaves were dropping.. cant quite recall the month.. but i believe its a seasonal thing.<br><br>so it jut happened that it was bright and sunny around 4-5pm.. i decided to go out for a breather.. then it happened..<br><br>there was a breeze.. quite common cos my jc quite near the beach .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> then the leaves that had turned yellow just fell.. and combining that with the glare of the sun, it was as if a million coins fell down from the sky at once.. i was so taken aback that i just stood there and froze and the sight.. MAGNIFICIENT!!<br><br>yup.. its been almost ten years.. and i can still recall that very day it happened.. was always telling myself that if i have to bring one beautiful memory to my urn.. this would be it..<br><br>so what abt yours?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most beautiful sight in my life? It was a sight I saw in Japan, Hokkaido. I was in the Lavender Farm.  They had this viewing balcony so I climbed to the top most level and I stood there for a while and suddenly the wind blew and in front of me, the patch of flowers blue, yellow and red and yellow leaves flying across the whole patch of flowers. Wow!!! There was this Japanese lady beside me too and she kept clapping her hands and kept saying something. But I was too dumfounded by the scene to do anything. Words just could not describe what I felt, itÂ’s when times like that when you just don't know what to do.</div>

It was a sight I saw in Japan, Hokkaido. I was in the Lavender Farm. They had this viewing balcony so I climbed to the top most level and I stood there for a while and suddenly the wind blew and in front of me, the patch of flowers blue, yellow and red and yellow leaves flying across the whole patch of flowers. Wow!!! There was this Japanese lady beside me too and she kept clapping her hands and kept saying something. But I was too dumfounded by the scene to do anything. Words just could not describe what I felt, itÂ’s when times like that when you just don't know what to do.</blockquote>yah.. these are the things i m talking abt.. makes u just lose all ur knowledge of words and just be there an embrace the moment.. its like a time and place that you can nv go back.. and even if you try to re-create it or it just happens again.. there will be some elements of the original scene missing.. and these are the things that nothing can capture.. no film.. no digi cam.. a good photgrapher can be at this perfect moment and capture it on film.. but somehow cant translate it beauty in all that dimension than if you were to embrace and experience it yourself there and then..</div>
