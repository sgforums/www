            <div class='col-md body'>thought about this last night... just thought i'd share it here and solicit opinions...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>disclaimer: some of it might sound familiar. dun remember whether i read it before or i wrote it before. hahaa...<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Ever heard it being said... When God made human, he split the soul in two, putting half of it in Man and the other half in Woman. That is why we all go through life trying to find our other half. And only when we find him/her will we be truly complete.<br><br>Going by this logic, we all have only ONE significant other. Surely this cannot be right.<br><br>What if he is married (to someone else's S.O.!)?<br><br>What if he met with an accident and died before we found each other?<br><br>What if we passed each other by and never knew?<br><br>What if he's gay???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>So, I don't believe in this. I believe we meet a lot of different people at different times in our lives. Right guys, wrong guys, right timing, wrong timing.<br><br>The perfect one, undoubtedly, is the Right One at the Right Time.<br><br>The question is: will it ever happen?</div>

There are some things that can only be enjoyed by couples in an exclusive relationship, bound by love and trust and fidelity.  It does feel awesome to know that whatever you do, whatever happens, there'll be someone standing by your side, giving you their full support.  When you return from work frustrated or upset, they'll be there to lend a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on.  When he is in a rough patch, you can hug him and pamper him and do nice things to him to cheer him up.  You can spend time together in activities that one or both love or you can just spend time enjoying each other's company and not doing anything at all!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>There's happiness in being able to do whatever you want whenever you want and however you want when you're single.  There's also happiness in doing things with someone, for someone and together with someone when you're in a relationship.  I don't think one can replace the other, we'll just have to make the most of our current situation, whatever it is.</div>
