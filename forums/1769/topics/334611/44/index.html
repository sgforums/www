              <p>But you know what, sometimes, we end up with the kind of
              partners that we unconsciously seek.  I know lots of men who
              go for women they consider a 'challenge', a 'trophy', because
              outwardly, they are swee-swee, appear polished and 'friendly' 
              to all, etc but they are actually manipulative with the notorious
              princess syndrome and they WILL make you buy them expensive gifts
              and make you feel like you have to keep working hard to continue
              being their boyfriend.  Some men just go for this kinda
              'challenge', whether consciously or not.</p>

              <p>men and women seek the thrill and excitment of "bad" women/men .. but ultimately when they marry, they want a very guai partner ..</p>
              <p>hey, come to think of it.. i vaguely recall this in my psychology course!! there were even experiments .. men are more prone to this.. they want to date hot, sexy women but when they marry, they want a women who's not so hot and sexy..</p>

              <p>I look at the construction workers around my neighbourhood... very manly and young, virile, rippling muscles with sweat glistening under the sun... I walk past, they look up at me, give me that awesome sweet smile and a wink and I almost get a cardiac arrest but have to look kewl, walk on, BREATHE, girl!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>But then you think about it, you start a relationship with them, 'some' aspect of the relationship is bound to be sizzling hot, but then, WHAT do you talk about afterwards?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  I know myself and I know how pai si I can be when I feel that the men do not match up intellectually and pai seh... I've been pretty nasty in my younger days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  Like basically, if you put yourself out there for me to trample on, it was hard to resist the urge to trample, esp in my hot-headed, hot-blooded younger days...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>So yeah... nice to look at, will be a hot fling, but won't be everlasting. </p>
              <p>Worse, maybe you pass by the REAL man of your dreams in the neighbourhood whilst you're hopelessly flirting with the object of your lust, and that man goes tsk tsk... another slut, thus destroying all hopes of future communication with him. </p>

              <p>Fair enough. I agree with everything you say here, but my beef is with those old fuckers in their 50s and above who still want to marry 20 something year olds. And they make up a significant portion of those who buy MOBs.</p>

              <p><br>believe you me I have given the subject a lot of thought, esp after meeting my friend's hot eastern european wife. but end of the day, what kind of marriage is that going to be. ok, assuming we have hot sex often, but how long will that last? and looks don't last either. what else are we going to do with each other then?</p>

              <p>and life can be quite funny, the worst case scenario is that you 'settle' just to get out of singlehood and then later meet the person you really want to spend the rest of your life with. that would be far more tragic than never getting married, in my book.</p>
