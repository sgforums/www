              <p>If the food poisoning is caused by the 'usual suspects', it will resolve by itself with the medication prescribed by the doc.</p>
              <p>However, if the toxin is much stronger, you will see signs other than just plain ol' diarrhoea.  A stool specimen will have to be taken to diagnose that and prescribe the appropriate type of antibiotics.  In severe cases, hospitalisation might be necessary for I/V Antibiotics and to monitor the person's fluid balance to ensure that they don't become dehydrated. </p>

              <p>Yeah... with the new Automatic Defibrillators these days, you can't go wrong because the screen will show you step-by-step what to do and there will be a voice instructing you as well. </p>
              <p>All you need to do is to place the pads on the positions indicated and the machine does the rest.  SGH trained us using all the different types of defibrillators we had and you'd really have to be a dinosaur to screw it up!</p>

              <p>It's like the Parable of the Lost Sheep where the shepherd left his herd to look for his one missing sheep.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png">  So, sorry hor... as long as you stay in the motherland, you are of no value but the minute you step overseas, your value increases drastically!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Doesn't that sound like many relationships we know of?  One partner takes the other for granted until the other disappears or shows signs of leaving and than, waaaaah... suddenly, the behaviour improves!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
