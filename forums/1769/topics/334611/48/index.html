              <p>The thing is I always ask my brother how come your friend married her</p>
              <p>Because she was a mental bitch even when they were dating....</p>
              <p>His friend is a very  nice guy and handsome too</p>
              <p>I dunno maybe he loves her in his own way *shrugs*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's hard for an outsider to know how the things click for a couple</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean like Rhonda have always commented that I'm married but it seems like I'm single. Some of my friends think I give MPB too much freedom allowing him to go out alone with his female friend etc but I don't think there is anything wrong in trusting him.</p>
              <p>I always tell him that it's up to him to  break the trust and what not :P</p>
              <p>I don't think I'm flirting with danger because if he really wants to cheat, he can still do so without you knowing</p>

              <p>i think even after marriage, partners should still set aside a day to be together - only them, minus the kids, in-laws etc and zero discussion about kids, family. which is my thinking of why people should stay together for what they have/share. not the kids. if you're only yapping about the kids...means what??? nothing else in common?</p>

              <p>I actually want a relationship where we can have our own separate bedrooms and study rooms. </p>
              <p>I quite like what a few young couples have to do here... because their workplaces are far apart, they keep one house and rent one apartment so during workdays, they are separate but they come together on weekends and public holidays. </p>
              <p>I really like arrangements like that.  I loved it best when my b/f's will go off once in a while for business or by themselves.  My ex had a job like MPB's except he had to travel a lot more and I was always very happy to have the house to myself.  (The cats were too cause Beng would tease them too much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> )</p>

              <p>i think even after marriage, partners should still set aside a
              day to be together - only them, minus the kids, in-laws etc and
              zero discussion about kids, family. which is my thinking of why
              people should stay together for what they have/share. not the kids.
              if you're only yapping about the kids...means what??? nothing else
              in common?</p>

              <p>That's why I don't want kids... they kill the spontaneity and sizzle in a marriage and I marry a guy because I love him and not because I want to start a family.  Anyways, in sociology class, I was one of three who put up my hand when the lecturer ask, "A husband and wife with no kids, are they considered a family?"  To me, YES! </p>
              <p>It's nice to have kiddos but I want to be in an 'er ren shi jie'.  I don't want to have to argue over how to discipline the kids, etc.  It can get pretty nasty and in a lot of couples, once they have kids, OMG... they let everything else fall by the wayside.</p>
              <p>I'll just have kittens and maybe a dog or two and my aquarium(s).</p>
