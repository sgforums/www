              <p>I agree!  Being attracted to each other is different from being able to live with each other under one roof!  The initial honeymoon period is always sweet and lovey-dovey but after the initial gloss wears off, the real grind starts and that's when we see how compatible a couple truly is.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't want to live with someone who bores the bejesus out of me!  I also cannot live with a neat freak nor someone who's not curious about the world we live in.  And forget about being with a partner with allergies to cats and dogs and all other furry creatures!  Also, forget perpetual dieters, grazers, and those with strict dietary restrictions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>A couple needs to find out if they are sexually compatible or not.  Imagine if one wants to have sex at least four times a week but the other only wants it once in two months!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Like that you'll always see one of them squirming in their seat!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I was talking to an agency nurse during my last night shift about this phenomenon and I told her that I love money, but I don't love it THAT much to sell my body and soul to a wrinkled, lao kok kokz man who needs to pop Viagra to make things happen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Your friend sounds really sweet. </p>
              <p>But you know what, sometimes, we end up with the kind of partners that we unconsciously seek.  I know lots of men who go for women they consider a 'challenge', a 'trophy', because outwardly, they are swee-swee, appear polished and 'friendly'  to all, etc but they are actually manipulative with the notorious princess syndrome and they WILL make you buy them expensive gifts and make you feel like you have to keep working hard to continue being their boyfriend.  Some men just go for this kinda 'challenge', whether consciously or not.</p>
              <p>So, you never know... he may be putting himself out there to be trampled upon...</p>

              <p>What makes him think that his MOB won't run away with another man and what not?</p>
              <p>Those happen quite frequently it seems or they get home sick and wanna go home and what not</p>
              <p>And from what I read in Sammyboy, most MOBs try to milk their husband as much as possible to send money back home and you must know how to deal with it.</p>
              <p>Apparently a lot of guys on Sammyboy have MOBs so maybe go read if he is interested.</p>
