              <p>Gosh... my Greek neighbour is one such woman who gives her husband and kids grief day in and day out!</p>
              <p>I was THIS close to yelling out my window, SHUT THE FUCK UP, BITCH! because she started SHOUTING and SCREAMING at  her husband, then her kids at about 7:30am this morning.  She was indoors, but so loud that I could hear them arguing over some chores that weren't done!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  I feel so sorry for her poor husband, having to live with such a boorish woman!  She never gives him face and I feel embarrassed when I see him because I feel so bad for him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>Whenever I see her, I always think, "Tank" because she's short and stout, very stocky like a man, walks like she's going to bulldoze anything or anyone in her way down, and yells like a platoon commander.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  I'm surprised they even have kids... WHICH part of her is sexy?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p>Mom and dad, despite being in the 'older generation', give each
              other lots of freedom.  Dad gets to go out with his friends
              once or twice a week, as he desires, and he doesn't stop mom from
              going out to gai gai with her friends either. </p>
              <p>When I was with the ah beng, he went on a few trips now and then
              either by himself or with his kaki's.  I didn't even bother to
              ask him much except, where are you going?  what will you be
              doing?  who are you going with?  where are you staying?
              ... answers I need to know in case he goes MIA and kena murdered or
              something.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Other than that, I just let him be and
              relished the solitude when he wasn't around.  Hehehe!</p>
