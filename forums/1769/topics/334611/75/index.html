              <p>For almost one whole semester I've been waiting for the higher-ups to give me desk space in the postgraduate students' admin room. The reasons for the delay range from 'technical difficulties', 'access codes got problem', etc etc.....</p>
              <p>Then last Friday my lab clerk finally told me that I could move in today.</p>
              <p>Then when I tried to move in today, guess what? Some jokers who have overstayed their welcome have not moved out yet..... I still have to wait a few more days!</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I get stuck doing studying and admin work at my workbench in my lab!</p>

              <p>Total change of project and supervisor.</p>
              <p>In fact, my new project has one supervisor and three collaborators. So even if my new supervisor were to uproot himself and go off, one of the other collaborators can take over.</p>
              <p>As for my old project, I'm forced to totally forfeit three months worth of research.</p>
              <p>Okay, maybe not totally. I was originally working on using bubbles to mix water. In my new project I'm using bubbles to remove sludge. So I can reuse perhaps 25% of my previous research on bubble dynamics.</p>
              <p>That's still not too bad - a friend of mine told me of a friend of his at NTU who had to forfeit one whole year of research when his supervisor took off.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial;">By Kimberly Spykerman</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FOREIGNERS were the hot topic at a community dialogue session chaired by Law Minister K. Shanmugam at the Queenstown Community Centre yesterday together with five other Members of Parliament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the dialogue, which drew a crowd of about 250, comprising grassroots leaders, residents and students, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans must have 'a certain broad-mindedness and spirit of humanity' to welcome foreigners here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This came as a response to a member of the audience who asked if the Government was too focused on economic growth which may compromise opportunities for locals here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such policies could only work to benefit Singaporeans, the minister said, citing major banks and multinational corporations as examples. 'As a major bank or corporation, you would want to put the best man possible. If Singapore says that man must be a Singaporean, what's going to happen? Either they won't come, or they will limit their operations.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Emphasising the importance of 'symbiosis', Mr Shanmugam, who was on his first community walk-about outside his constituency since becoming Law Minister in May, said that Singaporeans stood to gain in terms of employment opportunities if these companies succeeded in their operations here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He also tackled the prickly issue of the foreign worker dormitories in Serangoon Gardens, saying that Singaporeans needed to 'get real, and get practical', for the sake of national interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Who builds our HDB flats? Who builds our roads? Can we even have our basic infrastructure without foreign workers? Which Singaporean wants to do it? Some jobs Singaporeans won't and can't do,' he quipped.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another grouse brought up by the audience was the perception that local students were being denied places in the local universities due to the influx of foreign students and were being forced to go overseas instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam said the problem lies with the fact that Singaporean students all want to study certain courses such as law and medicine which have limited vacancies here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Senior Minister of State for Education Lui Tuck Yew told the audience: 'They are actually offered places and their results are good enough, but it's not something they wish to pursue.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When they do not get to study what they want to, they head abroad to do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, Mr Shanmugam pointed to how local law schools offer only 250 places but receive over 2,000 applications each year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have plenty of places in engineering, but those who want to do law, medicine, architecture or business don't want to do engineering,' Mr Shanmugam said. 'So what happens? Our engineering places are then offered to the foreigners.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other bread-and-butter issues such as the hike in electricity tariffs and Electronic Road Pricing issues were also raised.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam said the ERP gantries were a 'necessary evil' and also said that electricity tariffs will be re-looked in next year's Budget</p>

              <p>OK, I'm agreeable to what he said about companies hiring foreigners for the most part. However, he really needs to just try living and travelling like the average singaporean for a week to experience for himself exactly what the situation is like. Its all very well to talk about national interest when you're fully isolated from the unwashed masses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not sure if tharman realised it but he just highlighted the reasons why singapore is losing good people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its like....WTF should I decide to be an engineer just because I can't get into the course of my choice? If I can't do what I want with my life here I jolly well do it overseas. Who is the government to decide what I want to do with my life?</p>
