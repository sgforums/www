Can't remember what it's called but you just grip on to the metal handles firmly and hold the machine out in front of you and it'll give you your fat percentage reading.<br><br>I asked a doc before how the machine works and whether it works and he says it's very accurate.  It works by sending some sort of mild impulse (ions) through your arms and then it measures the amount of resistance it faces in its path.  Apparently, the more lipids (fat cells) it encounters, the slower the conduction rate and thus, the higher the fat percentage.<br><br>I have my reservations about the test where they use callipers to measure your fat by pinching it.  That's because at the gym I went to, they used to give all newcomers a free fat test using that method and I was pinched till it hurt and I felt like yelling, 'Hey!  Play cheat!!'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And BTW kops, could you please share the revised BMI here?  I wanna know the details.

Muscles are heavier than fat and it would definitely skew the BMI results.<br><br>Another factor most folks fail to consider is body frame.  There are folks who are 70kg and small-boned and those who are 70kg but large-boned.  As we all know, bones are heavy too.<br><br>There's actually a method of determining if you're small / medium / large-boned.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SINGAPORE (Reuters)</strong> - More Singaporeans risk suffering stroke, diabetes and other diseases as obesity levels rise in the affluent Southeast Asian city-state, a new government system of measuring body fat shows.<br>Singapore's collective waistline is bulging, a trend some researchers attribute to a gradual shift in diet on the predominantly ethnic-Chinese island toward Western fast foods.<br><br>The Health Promotion Board said it was lowering a scale which correlates an individual's body mass index (BMI) to health risks after new findings from local studies and recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO).<br><br>Recent studies have shown that many Asians, widely envied for their slim waists, actually have more fat as a proportion of total body weight than Caucasians of the same age, sex and BMI.<br><br>Asians also run an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus at relatively low BMI levels, the board said in a statement. "According to the WHO, obesity is fast becoming a global epidemic and Singapore is following a similar trend as that of developed countries," said Dr. Lam Sian Lian, the board's chief executive.<br><br>"With the new guidelines, about half of the adult population will be at moderate-high risk. Previously we were looking at about a third, going by the WHO international cut-offs for overweight and obese," Lam said.<br><br>Singapore's last national health survey in 1998 showed that the proportion of its population listed as overweight had risen in six years from 21 to 24 percent, while those categorized as obese had increased from 5 to 6 percent.<br><br>The WHO has recommended body weight classifications -- underweight and gradations of excess weight or overweight -- that are associated with increased risk of some diseases.<br><br>Obesity is usually defined as having a body mass index -- a measure of weight relative to height -- of 30 or above, while a healthy weight is an index of less than 25.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Under Singapore's new system, people with a BMI of 27.5 and above are considered at high risk of disease, while 23 to 27.4 signals moderate risk and 18.5 to 22.9 is healthy. </span><br><br></div>

Can't remember what it's called but you just grip on to the metal handles firmly and hold the machine out in front of you and it'll give you your fat percentage reading.<br><br>I asked a doc before how the machine works and whether it works and he says it's very accurate.  It works by sending some sort of mild impulse (ions) through your arms and then it measures the amount of resistance it faces in its path.  Apparently, the more lipids (fat cells) it encounters, the slower the conduction rate and thus, the higher the fat percentage.<br><br>I have my reservations about the test where they use callipers to measure your fat by pinching it.  That's because at the gym I went to, they used to give all newcomers a free fat test using that method and I was pinched till it hurt and I felt like yelling, 'Hey!  Play cheat!!'   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And BTW kops, could you please share the revised BMI here?  I wanna know the details.  I missed that article.<br><br></div></blockquote>that machine that sends electric impulse thru ur body rite? its not really accurate...if u drink alot of water, u can mess the results up....water pass thru water, etc etc...probably most accurate way is measure fat layer near ur hipbone area..</div>
