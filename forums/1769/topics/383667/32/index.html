              <p>Well true, 2D animation went to hell, firstly, after the best of the best got lazy, that's why I mentioned the golden age till the 90's, and secondly, 3D technology and Pixar picked up. Yay for John Lasseter and Brad Bird. I've heard that the animation industry's starting to pick up on 2D again, to do it right like the good old days.</p>

              <p>Well, Pixar stuck to their beliefs, the exact same ones that Disney's nine old men were pushing for. Either way, I hope Disney picks up more on 2D, it'll be very healthy for the industry. Rather than skiving off earnings from Disneyland, Marvel, Pixar and royalties.</p>
              <p>The only good, recent, 2D Disney films I can remember off the top of my head right now is Treasure Planet, Atlantis, Brother Bear and The Emperor's New Groove. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And I see your point about direct-to-video/DVD, they did the same with The Emperor's New Groove's sequel, Kronk's New Groove. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>the other guys knew my situation and the things i had to do, so when the neutered one walked up to us and said to me "looks like all our late nights has gone down the drain", all the guys looked at me and could see that i was totally fed up</p>
              <p>none of them agreed that i should fork out half for the printer drum which i didn't need in the first place.</p>

              <p>nabei, the idiot called and ask me where i am.</p>
              <p>i tell him i'm going out for football already</p>
              <p>nabei CB, i told him to come over at 8am to collect his DVD</p>
              <p>when i tell him i'm going out for football, he sounds so surprise</p>
              <p>CB thinks that just because i do freelance work, doesn't mean i am so free all the time.  there are periods where i have to actually work and earn money, i'm not around to help all the friggin time.</p>
              <p>and i also have my own life, i have football on weekends and i can't cater to him just because he's around.  he should be settling his own wedding, not getting people to help when there is no need for it.</p>

              <p>ok time to go out</p>
