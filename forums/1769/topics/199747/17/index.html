They've done it this way for years. What gets me is that some parents will buy the absolutely cheapest stuff they can find. My kids are in the higher grades now and so the common pool thing is no more for them. Still, school supplies aren't cheap so I'm always on the lookout for coupons or stuff on sale.</div>
