            <div class='col-md body'>Steph, I remembered you had pretty expensive tastes, going by the clutch bag thread you started in here, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And then now, like what some folks here mentioned earlier, you kept harping on how 'poor' your guy is.<br><br>That does sound like it bothers you a lot, perhaps, more than you would care to admit.  Maybe, you're scared of being labelled 'shallow' or 'materialistic'?  However, you do have a lifestyle that you're comfortable with, and standards that you would expect and if you do not feel confident that he will meet your expectations, you might slowly start to dislike or even, resent that very fact.<br><br>Maybe, you want to believe in an ideal love, and so, you're struggling with your concept of a perfect love, and the reality?<br><br>How serious are you both in the relationship?  Seems as if your 2nd Anniversary is very important to you but from the way he acted, it looks like he has different ideas on it.<br><br>Maybe, it's time to sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk.  Or, maybe, because most guys will shudder at the thought of having such a talk, it might be best to be honest, and look at the entire situation without prejudice and see it objectively.  A lot of times, when we're in love, the world is viewed through rose-tinted glasses and everything the guy says is interpreted positively, even if he's subtly trying to tell us 'No'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I'm guilty of it myself!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   We all are, because it's human to hope.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>These are just my honest thoughts on this matter!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

There should be an attitude of wanting to roll up your sleeves and work together to build a better future for both, not just one promising the other a better life.  Then, what's your role?<br><br>I know you feel like you've been long-suffering cause it comes out a lot in your posts.  But, hey, in a relationship, one shouldn't be keeping tally of things as if one 'qian4's the other, like that.  That will result in a very lop-sided and unhealthy relationship.<br><br>Sure, we don't know why he forgot about your meeting, and neither do we know what might have caused him to 'hold back'.  That's something only he can tell you, IF he wants to tell you.<br><br>Steph, don't mind our posts.  It's good that at least, we care enough to respond to you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
