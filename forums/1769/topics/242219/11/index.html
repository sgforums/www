That doesn't bode well. Which model laptop do you have?<br><br>I bought a Toshiba Satellite A105-S4384 last December, and it's been running like a top. Don't know about the battery, though--I replaced the stock 4400mAh battery with an aftermarket 8800mAh one right after I purchased the laptop, and haven't noticed any battery life issues... yet.</div>

The graphics card's VRAM and VPU should offload almost all of the video processing from the CPU.<br><br>I'll bet it's the 256MB of memory that's causing the slowdown. Is there a great deal of disk I/O going on when you're running several concurrent applications?</div>
