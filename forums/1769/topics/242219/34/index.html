            <div class='col-md body'>You must understand that while they try to tweak and finetune a long term solution, they must have a medium term solution in place to mitigate nearer effects.<br><br>To actually wait and see if longer term solution actually works might throw Singapore into a tailspin. You need something in the meantime to fill in gaps as and when they occur. Foreign import of talents can be managed and measured and adjusted on a year-to-year basis. The Australian system is one that can be considered and a good example.<br><br>Any situation regarding birth rates takes a long long time to tweak and figure out. Our government is always extremely cautious towards anything regarded as social welfare (many say too conservative, but you can never accurately measure).<br><br>Actually, what Singapore is facing is nothing new. There were many studies showing the correlation of developed countries against birth rates. Typically, the higher the standard (and cost) of living, then birth rates would suffer. This is observed across many parts of Europe, Japan and parts of America.<br><br>There is no true solution. This is a social cost that typically comes with a higher standard of living. I haven't seen any recent studies, what I have noted previously is at least 5 years old.</div>

If the government only allows Singaporean blue collar workers, our competitiveness (which is already badly hit over the past 10 years) will simply decline between 20-30%.

This is not desirable but a phenomena that cannot be controlled.<br><br>This is simply a strong relation between population growth rates and standard of living. Many studies have been done to show this, and many countries have attempted to introduce 'baby bonus' to try to combat this. However, these are only marginally effective.<br><br>We're not talking about a one time population decrease, but a declining population. We're afraid of an increasingly shrinking working population to support a growing aged population.<br><br>It is hard to imagine for productivity growth to increase indefinitely to 'cover' up the decline attributed to population. We're not even talking about GDP growth, but just to maintain GDP year on year. A shrinking population is what every government is worried about.<br><br>It is true that you expect to see diminishing returns on GDP when population growth is too high. However, we need to see at least a renewal on the workforce to support our current GDP levels.<br></div>
