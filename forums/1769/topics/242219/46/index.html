(although she was nor murdered by him)<br><br>then he's Freddy Krueger... he went after littlel children.. he started stalking Christine Daae when she was a little girl! (the Michael Jackson wannabe paedophile!) maybe he's got a Lolita complex? a bit of Humbert Humbert in him?<br><br>then, he's Jason.. for that mask he wears... and his disfigurement..<br><br>so.. there you have it... The Phantom.. is actually a mish-mash.. an unholy trinity of celluloid's most infamous psychopaths... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>the only semi-sane man in the whole story was the Viscount, Raoul... but he started to show his insanity and stupidity by exposing his loved one to "lure The Phantom" out of his lair... i mean, hey! you're the fricken Viscount! get the cops and storm the place.. go into his damned underground labyrinth and hunt the maniac! cut him down in a hail of gunfire! but the guy lets the maniac go after defeating him in a swordfight!<br><br>Madame Giry is another nutcase... she knows he's been murdering people, yet she keeps quiet and exposes her daughter and ward to The Phantom's lunacy... i guess she imbibed in too much absinthe or something.. messed up her brain??<br><br>THEN.. you have Christine... now.. was she thinking of two-timing the Viscount or something? who knows? "you're asking me to go out there and become vulnerable to that maniac? you must be jerkin' my chain!! i'm outta here, Viscount or not!"<br><br>heh heh heh! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>the only memorable part was by Minnie Driver.. who played the part of the prima donna diva Carlotta... it was way over the top as it was meant to be... and she did it so well!<br><br>all in all, i had to stifle giggles throughout the movie because it was so fricken hilarious! and i know it wasn't meant to be... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>enjoyable.. but not as Joel Schumacher meant it to be <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>(i can't rate this.. at all.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True Romance is a romantic story with a lot of insane violence, maniacs, cops, a psychotic white rastafarian drug dealer (played to perfection by Gary Oldman)<br><br>but in there, is a tender love story of a shy guy who falls for a prostitute and sets about to help her get away from her past.. Tarantino wrote this so, hey.. expect the mess but it's a really tender tale between the both of them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lost in Translation is a tour-de-force of a movie which i would say that no one else but Bill Murray could do.. his deadpan face which says more than mere words.. finding a kindred soul in a faraway place like Japan... where the romance was in their platonic friendship <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>as for Regarding Henry.. uhh... some bits.. amnesia and all that.. rediscovering himself and how low he was before being shot... maybe i'm jaded in terms of movies.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
