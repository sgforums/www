              <p>Hi guys....</p>
              <p>I've been buying and reading an average of one book per month lately. I've picked up a few rather good books, and I felt like sharing my personal reviews of those books. I'll be starting with the month of May (since this is May, after all).</p>

              <p><strong>Book of the Month for May:</strong> <em>Stalingrad</em> by Antony Beevor</p>
              <p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414ABVT4YDL._SS500_.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stalingrad-Antony-Beevor/dp/0140249850">Amazon Review:</a></p>
              <p>Hitler made two fundamental and crippling mistakes during the Second
              World War. The first was his whimsical belief that the United Kingdom
              would eventually become his ally, which delayed his decision to launch
              a major invasion of Britain, whose army was unprepared for the force of
              blitzkrieg warfare. The second was the ill-conceived Operation
              Barbarossa--an invasion of Russia that was supposed to take the German
              army to the gates of Moscow. Antony Beevor's thoughtfully researched
              compendium recalls this epic struggle for Stalingrad. No-one, least of
              all the Germans, could foretell the deep well of Soviet resolve that
              would become the foundation of the Red Army; Russia, the Germans
              believed, would fall as swiftly as France and Poland. The ill-prepared
              Nazi forces were trapped in a bloody war of attrition against the
              Russian behemoth, which held them in the pit of Stalingrad for nearly
              two years. Beevor points out that the Russians were by no means ready
              for the war either, making their stand even more remarkable; Soviet
              intelligence spent as much time spying on its own forces--in fear of
              desertion, treachery and incompetence--as they did on the Nazis. Due
              attention is also given to the points of view of the soldiers and
              generals of both forces, from the sickening battles to life in the
              gulags.</p>
              <p>Many
              believe Stalingrad to be the turning point of the war. The Nazi war
              machine proved to be fallible as it spread itself too thin for a cause
              that was born more from arrogance than practicality. The Germans never
              recovered, and its weakened defences were no match for the Allied
              invasion of 1944. We know little of what took place in Stalingrad or
              its overall significance, leading Beevor to humbly admit that "[t]he
              Battle of Stalingrad remains such an ideologically charged and
              symbolically important subject that the last word will not be heard for
              many years". This is true. But this gripping account should become the
              standard work against which all others should measure themselves. --<em>Jeremy Storey</em></p>

              <p><strong>My personal review:</strong></p>
              <p>This is one brilliantly-written book. It doesn't just focus on Stalingrad - Antony Beevor also does a good job in giving an overview of the events leading up to the Battle of Stalingrad, from when the Germans declared war on the Soviet Union. He also gave a pretty good narrative about what happened to the surviving German POWs after their capture and their life in Soviet hands.</p>
              <p>If you think you know everything there is to know about the Battle of Stalingrad, then this book may give you a whole new perspective. For one thing, I always thought that Field Marshal Erich von Manstein was trying his very best to save the trapped Sixth Army in Stalingrad. However, Beevor claims (with quite a bit of justification) that Manstein also saw the advantage of having the Sixth Army tie up seven Soviet armies in Stalingrad while he was trying to pull out the rest of Army Group South out of the Caucasus.</p>
              <p>And in spite of this being a non-fiction history book, Beevor writes it (and paces the narrative) almost as though it were some high-powered Tom Clancy novel.</p>
              <p>Very highly recommended.</p>

              <p>I kinda enjoy reading up on past wars.</p>
              <p>WWI and WWII particularly.</p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that WWI was basically one of the most stupid wars of all time. It was a tragic, tragic case of 'You play punk with my brudder, you play punk with me' syndrome.</p>
