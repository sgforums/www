But as soon as females hit menopause, we don't have the hormones to regulate the fat in us and hence resulting a higher risk of getting heart problem.<br><br></div>

Very often, the lubricant that exists in our joints deplete and don't get replaced enough.  Or, the ligaments become less supple, etc.  Lots of reasons why our joints will start to be problematic.<br><br>It's a good idea to start taking enough calcium.  Doctors recommend that we should have started taking calcium at the RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) from our teenage years onwards, but now is not too late.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Better late than never!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Glucosamine might provide you with some relief.  I understand that it helps to augment the joints.  I've asked a Pharmacist before if it was necessary to take Glucosamine with Chondroitin pills or would plain ol' Glucosamine suffice and I was told that the latter is good enough.  (There's apparently a difference in cost).<br><br>Start taking Glucosamine now!  It will not cure, but it might improve the situation a wee bit.  </div></blockquote>Re: calcium supplements. I hear you. I've been popping them for a few years now. Just so others know, Vitamin D helps in the absorbtion of calcium so make sure your calcium supplements include Vitamin D. If it doesn't, you can pop Vitamin D separately. To further maximise absorbtion, space your intake out. Once in the AM and once in the PM.<br><br>Rhonda: I've been thinking about adding glocosamine to my "menu" but wanted to ask my OB about it when I see him this December.<br><br>Boy do I know about wear and tear. After you've had kids, undergone a surgery or two....<br><br>Anyway, I recently went for a Dexa scan (bone density test) and was told that no amount of walking would help me increase bone density. The tech told me that I'd have to march in place 20~30 minutes each day to do that. (Treadmill for sale. Any takers?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) So now, I do that in front of the tube most mornings before I get ready for work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Recent studies done right here in Australia shows that post-CABG (pronounced 'cabbage' and it stands for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ), doctors used to caution the patients from strenuous exercises.<br><br>Now, under a pilot study, the preliminary results show that strength training has discernable benefits for post-CABG's.
