            <div class='col-md body'>I frequent library for books pertaining to my profession cuz it gets updated every 1 -2 years or so so it doesn't make sense for me to purchase them. I think Spore libraries are very good compared to say our northern neighbour cuz whenever I go there there isn't any library maybe it is a small town.<br><br>The only complain I have is it's mandatory stand to pay for any services or fines using Cashcard. I wonder why NETs cannot. Some hidden agenda? And for at least my area the books get updated quite fast. Say if I wan some books published in early 1990s they are now no longer available. Although it is always good to have the latest updated books sometimes we wanna borrow old books for some special reasons.<br><br>In general, Spore have one of the best library systems I have seen so far. Maybe it fit our gahmen policy to get as many as our citizens educated? Hahhahahaha.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Borrows a wide range of books from comics, to fiction, to hard-core computer stuff like SQL, Java etc, investment, self-improvement, Lonely planet, Health, sports, yoga etc etc....<br><br>Also had made book reservation somethings when I heard of a good book and NLB actually has it already! This way, even if the book is not in my nearest library, I can collect it there for just a price of 50 cents. Also had made book extension online when I was abroad and unable to return book in time.<br><br>And yes, the payment is the one glaring ineffeciency that I guess everyone notices. I had to top up my cashcard with nets follow by payment with cashcard to make a payment of $6 accumulated over x years, which if I do not pay up prevents me from borrowing further.</div>
