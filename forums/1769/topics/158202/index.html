            <div class='col-md body'>It's really odd.<br><br>Previously, I wanted to work overseas because I couldn't tolerate the working conditions locally and I couldn't envision the idea of myself staying put in the same job with the same organisation for longer than necessary, as stipulated by my bond.<br><br>However, lately, I think and feel differently about this issue.<br><br>I now feel that I can actually see myself working in my current environment and somehow, adapting to it and carving a niche for myself.  I've also been wondering if I might be leaving too soon because there's just so much for me to learn in my new workplace.<br><br>Then again, something tells me that when your primary reasons for leaving aren't so much the 'Push-Pull' factors ('Push' factors = disadvantageous signs that 'push' one towards migration; 'Pull' factors = the attractive things about the target country that 'pulls' one towards it), therefore meaning that you aren't escaping anything here nor having unrealistic expectations and hopes of the destination, but rather, they are reasons like career development and planning, it means that you are more or less ready to leave, and with the 'right' mindset.<br><br>Would appreciate advice, comments and if you're a Singaporean who chose to work overseas, I'd really love to hear from you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Thanks in advance!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rhonda.........what you are feeling is normal, natural.  I think maybe most if not all of us feel this way as DDD draws near.<br><br>I agree with DG, rainee and MG.<br><br>Just do it and give it your best shot.  The world is now a global village.  There is no "The End" or "This is it".  You can always move, re-locate, blah, blah, blah.<br><br>It is not a matter of making a decision and then wondering if it was right or if we will regret or if we will make it.  It's a matter of living it.  Experience your new world.  Get enriched by it.  There may/will be some adjustments but all the more, it builds us.<br><br>You know you have ALL our blessings and best wishes.  Look forward and remember to pack your sambals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>All the very best, Rhonda.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rhonda, I think it's natural to feel the way you do... I experienced this as well... just when I was coming to Sydney, and most recently, when I changed job.  Reluctant to leave my 'comfort zone'.  But sometimes, we have to step out of the box to see the bigger picture, experience more that life (God) has to offer us, meet new people / new cultures!  I think you'll not regret moving here, and sooner is always better than later <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  All the best, don't worry too much, as God will smooth the path for you!  When it's time to go, He'll let you know  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

There'll most likely still be the same shit and worse, I'm a foreigner!  But one thing is for certain, I'll get paid much much more than I do over here, and I can finally get to further my studies."<br><br>Main reasons why I'm leaving, $$$ and career development plans.<br><br>Sounds like you didn't have a good experience working there.

            <div class='col-md body'>When you're overseas as a foreigner, I guess whatever happens, positive or not so positive, it will still be an experience. And there is still the choice to come back. Whereas if you don't do it, never try, you'll never know...and may live to regret not trying later.</div>
