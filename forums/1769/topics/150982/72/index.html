Didn't really care much for it, as the equipment rental and lift tickets were terribly expensive (I don't own any of my own ski equipment). Plus, I' m not exactly the epitome of grace on skis--if you see an Asian guy tumbling down the 'bunny' slope with his skis and poles following not far behind, that'll most likely be me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>There's probably enough of an Asian community here to be able to find mooncakes at some of the Asian grocery stores, but I haven't looked.
