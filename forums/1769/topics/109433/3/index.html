            <div class='col-md body'>It might be a ploy to win your sympathy. of course just a wild guess, like u say, the details you've given hardly justify wat's been going on all these years.<br><br>anywayz, i'm with most of the views here.. think he just wants to move on and perhaps he thinks that's the best way for him. whether it is or not i guess no one knows, but some/most guys do that, they just have a clean break and leave "no mess" behind. if only we were that tidy about our rooms.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>ok sorree for the tactless joke, but i think u are doing the right thing by leaving the decision up to him. i guess (again being tactless) u dun have much of a choice. but perhaps you could feel better in knowing and remembering the fun you had and smile each time u remember how he made u feel so at ease with being yourself.<br><br>and, one last comment, perhaps you too have something for him, but u can't admit it, becos u're married (or watever else reason) and to do so would be to open a can or worms. no need to respond to this last paragraph.. it started with a PERHAPS... probably just a poke in the wrong direction.<br><br>take care.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Every year, during the Christmas and New Year season, we get lots of admissions due to drunk driving resulting in Road Traffic Accidents, bad falls due to intoxication, fights and assaults also due to drunkenness, and of course, there are those folks who drank so much, they needed their stomachs pumped.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Give us poor nurses some peace this year!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
