            <div class='col-md body'>If my memory does not fail me, this friendship started on a boring night in late 1994. It was past 11.30pm and I was bored. I have already played Diablo till I was sick of the game. I decided to log on mIRC to find someone to chat with since I have not logged on there for some time. As usual, the crowd was the usual A/S/L peeps who were totally boring and unimaginative or they just wanted cybersex. As I was about to log off at 12.30am, someone messaged me.<br><br>"Hey there! Did you get your nick from Dragonlance?"<br><br>Now, I was surprised that someone recognized the nick I was going by. At that time, I was going by the name of Alhana. She is a very small character in Dragonlance (for those of you who read Dragonlance) and easily forgettable.<br><br>Anyways, we hit it off immediately and I can't remember when we both logged off. We had so many things in common, interests, sense of humor etc.<br><br>Suprise suprise. He turned out to be my neighbour. Not the kind of neighbour next door but he was living in the same neighbourhood as I am. We talked for a few times in mIRC then he gave me his number to call for a chat. Gosh, we must have talked for hours. Please note that we were talking as friends only and he knew that I have a boyfriend at that time.<br><br>We started talking about writing a book and on how the both of us wanted to write one but never got to it. He suggested meeting up at the McDonald's near our place to co-write and how fun it will be. The first thing he did when we met up was apologize for his appearance due to a birth defect, he had to have a major surgery done on his face resulting in a huge scar. But, it didn't bother me because for the first time in my life, I met someone with so many common interests as me.<br><br>Anyways, to cut things short, we met up really often as we were living so close to each other and had lots of fun sessions at his place playing AD&amp;D with other friends and Playstation games. Or we will just talk till we fall asleep (Please clean the dirt of your minds if you guys have any, because we never had any physical relationship before) Or we will do stupid things like scare ourselves silly with horror movies and ghost stories. (It is super scary in a dark big empty house) We even went on holiday together (with my then bf knowledge of course) because to me, we were just really good friends, soul mates.<br><br>I never once suspected that he was interested in me, because he never showed it in anyway. I dunno is it because I have a bf or what. Anyways, I broke up with my ex as our relationship was on the rocks. He knew about that. But, he didn't know about my hubby. I really screwed up his birthday. Because on the day I told him about my hubby (then bf) he was devastated.<br><br>We stopped talking for 2 years plus. During that period, he had his share of gfs (I learnt this from mutual friends) and suddenly out of the blue, he called me. I figured he has gotten over it all (that's what our mutual friends said as well) but apparently he has not and he is taking it very badly that I got married.<br><br>He told me that he needs to break off the friendship in order to forget. I guess I can't say it very well in words here but his email really broke my heart. He is more than a good friend to me. He is literally my soulmate.<br><br>Anyway, I replied that if he ever changed his mind one day, I'll be there as always.<br><br>Brief summary of what happened. *sigh* Doesn't paint a very clear picture but I guess I can only leave it up to him to sort it out.</div>
