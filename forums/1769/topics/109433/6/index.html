But, after you've had time to think through what went wrong, you may not feel as bad as you did when you initially found out he wanted to cut all ties.<br><br>This friend of yours seems to be acting very childishly! And did you say that he's ignored you for a period of time before?  If so, he is acting very emotionally and illogically.   Good friends should not do this to each other!  Sounds like some kind of emotional blackmail to me.<br><br>Yea, just leave the ball in his court - and if he contacts you again someday, then fine, if not then it's his loss!<br><br>Most importantly, try not to let this episode affect you when you make other friends - do not shy away from people who can be potentially good friends! Don't EVER think that any of this is your fault, cos it sure isn't.  Be strong <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Take care.</div>
