            <div class='col-md body'>Elindra, I think he just needs some space to try and forget you because apparently, for all those years, you weren't strictly just a platonic friend.  He had been entertaining all those hopes and wishes and yearnings of the two of you being a couple and now, he's feeling totally depressed because of the outcome.<br><br>Give him some time.  He might just get over it.  Expect to see him jump into relationships in the meantime because some folks do get into relationships quickly when they're 'on the rebound'.  Not quite fair to the other party involved but not everyone understands the need to mourn losses instead of trying to fill that vacuum.<br><br>I have this bus analogy I often tell friends : Consider your life as a bus ride.  Some folks get up at one stop and stay with you for the entire journey, till you finally reach your bus depot.  Others get on at one stop, and then alight at the next.  Yet others would board and stay with you for quite a few stops before alighting.  Not everyone would complete the bus journey with you.<br><br>It's hard to face the death of a friendship that lasted so long but maybe, he's acting in the only way he knows of forgetting you and thinking of you in 'that' manner.  He might finally come to his senses, the pain might no longer be acute, and he might just contact you again in the future.  Or, he might never get over it, we don't know.  I understand how you feel though and if I were to lose a friend like that, I would be  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>You know how to get hold of me if you need to talk.<br></div>
