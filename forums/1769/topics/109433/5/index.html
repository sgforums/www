He's extremely rude on a number of counts.<br><br>First, and most obviously, he used email to tell you that he doesn't want to be friends with you anymore.  That's just shockingly poor form - for something of that importance, the least he could have done is to deliver the message over the phone, if not face-to face.<br><br>Then again, it doesn't seem to be his style.  He sat back for years with some silly expectation that you could read his mind and tell how he felt about you.  That's childish, but that's still all right.  On the other hand, throwing his toys out of the pram when he obviously shot himself in the foot is just plain silly, on top of being unfair to you.<br><br>The bottom line is that this guy's childish, and he thinks the world owes him a living.  I assume that if you've been friends for so long, he's old enough to know that fortune favours the bold, and if he loses out for sitting around like a bump on a log, well, tough luck for him.  If he expects you, instead of himself, to bear the cost of his screw up, it doesn't measure up to the most rudimentary standards of friendship.<br><br>In your place, I wouldn't put any particular effort in mourning his departure.  People like that can't even be good to themselves, so what capacity do they have to be friends?  You've just offloaded a liability, and congratulations for it.</div></blockquote>Ahh Geddy, you hit the nail on the head. I'm also upset that he chose email. He won't even answer my calls or smses. Yes like in the post above, I know that he has changed his number but I have his new number.<br><br>I guess the problem with him is that he can get wayy too emotional at times and it really impairs his thinking. Anyway, like I said, I will leave it up to him to contact me again.<br><br>I have cried it out enough and have thought through it enough. I've already reached the acceptance of the situation stage.</div>

I respect his wishes and I know him wayyy too well that he will not contact people whom he thinks will mention my name and it is not fair to the rest.<br><br>I know not all friends last forever, I have lost my fair share of friends, except this one really hurt because of the way he wanted to cut me off like discarding some unwanted rubbish and also because we shared wayyyy too much in interests, thoughts etc<br><br>One thing though, he has shattered my thoughts that a guy and a girl can just be friends *sigh* ... looks like this will apply only if the guy is gay.</div></blockquote>wah... dun mind me saying this, but he's more woman than man! throwing away gifts and changing hp numbers hmm.. ok i better not get sexist here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>with regard to your last statement, yeah.. i believe a guy and a girl cannot just be friends, IF one party has liked the other b4, particularly if the person holding a torch is the male. otherwise, a boy, and a girl, who have no romantic feelings for each other, it's great! can one lar...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
