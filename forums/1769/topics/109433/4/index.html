He's extremely rude on a number of counts.<br><br>First, and most obviously, he used email to tell you that he doesn't want to be friends with you anymore.  That's just shockingly poor form - for something of that importance, the least he could have done is to deliver the message over the phone, if not face-to face.<br><br>Then again, it doesn't seem to be his style.  He sat back for years with some silly expectation that you could read his mind and tell how he felt about you.  That's childish, but that's still all right.

Well, he told me he has already gotten rid of the gifts I gave him and whatever contacts. Btw, he changed his cellphone number as well!!! I figured that if this is what he wants, so be it. I respect his wishes and I know him wayyy too well that he will not contact people whom he thinks will mention my name and it is not fair to the rest.<br><br>I know not all friends last forever, I have lost my fair share of friends, except this one really hurt because of the way he wanted to cut me off like discarding some unwanted rubbish and also because we shared wayyyy too much in interests, thoughts etc<br><br>One thing though, he has shattered my thoughts that a guy and a girl can just be friends *sigh* ... looks like this will apply only if the guy is gay.</div>
