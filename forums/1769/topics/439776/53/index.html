              <p>Thing is, firstly can you even get the drivers.</p>
              <p>Even the wages?</p>
              <p>In the first place, I've no idea abt the 800 buses and tat
              $1.1bn, because the problem with the tpt routing system has to be
              reviewed, and use of bigger buses than single decks for most bus
              svs.</p>
              <p>Also I've this to say, is SBS's bus ops making profit in the
              past 2 years?</p>
              <p>The MRT profit is all because the gabrament spents the heafty
              upfront, else think why MTR is forced to develop properties at
              their MTR station in order to keep upfloat in the starting years in
              particular.</p>
              <p>av, you also kena played with the system until you've no idea
              with what's going on elsewhere around the world.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;">The additional buses, equivalent to 20 years’ worth of fleet growth, will bump up the public bus fleet by 20 per cent. Their arrival depends on how quickly bus manufacturers can supply the fleet, and – more crucially – how quickly drivers can be hired.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;">All in, the Government is handing out a $1.1 billion aid package meant to cover the operating costs of the vehicles over 10 years. It is understood to include salaries for drivers.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;">Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam had announced the measure in his Budget speech last Friday, and had said the $1.1billion was a ‘one-off’ measure.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-bottom: 13px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 21px; text-align: justify;">For the bus operators, it will not be a case of generating additional revenue out of capital assets they will have obtained for free. Sources reckon the operators will be ‘persuaded’ to increase service frequency and raise drivers’ salaries, so the net effect may well be revenue-neutral to the operators.</p>

              <p>The pre-SBS era, it all failed terribly. And funny thing was, how come double decks and wat's not appeared after the monopoly merger?</p>
              <p>The Changi Airport buses weren't really operated by SBS initially, it was by the Scheme B &amp; CSS buses. Latter later gave up for some reasons, SBS ended up took over in 1983. I guess one issue was considering back then where the new towns or estates like Ang Mo Kio, Queenstown were located and location of the Airport, the distance is way too long to be covered, a lot of buses would be required.</p>
              <p>Nationalising isn't right either. For, put it this way, you'll still be sandwiched. Either raise wages or raise the fare in direct govt's name.</p>
