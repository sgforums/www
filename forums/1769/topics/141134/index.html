            <div class='col-md body'>Lau, you're right on that.<br><br>Sometimes, we see real-life proof that education makes one choose a roundabout way of solving problems.  Instead of rolling up one's sleeves and diving right into the waters, the more educated folks would sit down, plan, strategise, come up with a nice-sounding and very confusing and bombastic mission plan, vision, etc etc, then come up with some fanciful sounding 5-step plan or 10-step action plan whatever, then talk about their long-term strategy, where do we want to be 1, 2, 5, 10 years from now, marketing strategies, etc etc etc... but lo and behold, there are plenty of folks who have already dived headlong into the waters like, donkey years ago, and their swimming gear have already dried to a crisp already!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Sometimes, action is what's needed, afterall, action speaks louder than words!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Of course the execution part (action) has to be in place. The job of a manager is to think and analyse and plot the course on where the ship is to go. The manager is not there to barge around charging in without thinking!!! The manager have executives to carry out the course of action but at the same time, the manager must have the responsibility to know that the ship is sailing in the right direction and that it is moving!<br><br>However, if you are talking about thinking about striking it rich, worrying if the sky will fall down tomorrow, that is totally unacceptable and waste of your grey matter. Anyway, a lot of great men, are thinkers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Reading too much into things.....I don't think that is unique only to Singaporeans. I believe most city dwellers read alot into things because they need to protect themselves, be it physically or emotionally or even mentally. You  never know who has a knife behind their back. Of course, this makes one more cautious and skeptical and think morefor themselves and their family but SERIOUSLY, do you really believe everything in the papers? I have encountered the censorship of facts first hand  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and the salary BS which Geddy pointed out is one shining example.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh...speaking of "over educated", I'm puzzled as to why 2 letters to the ST Forum yesterday mentioned about "an educated person.....(sthg to the effect that) would think that $990 tap is too expensive...". What's being educated got to do with it? And it seems to imply that if you're not well educated (whatever that means, if you think about the University of Life), you won't be able to make such a conclusion (abt the expense)?  (sorry mods, this is not about nkf, thx  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ).<br><br>Thinking/reading too much into things is not nec bad...I've always believe in a woman's instincts - e.g. it's how I first knew an ex of mine was two-timing me, which was later confirmed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
