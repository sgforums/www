              <p>I remember when I was a teen, I got a couple of professional cooking mags from a 2nd-hand bookstore.  A lot of the featured cuisine very atas type, like Terrines, Rabbit, Poached Fish that's first cooked in that fish-shaped metal container and then decorated to the nines, Rack of Lamb nicely arranged in a ring...</p>
              <p>I was sooo fascinated with a particular recipe that showed how to make REAL mayo!  Ooooh!!</p>

              <p>Depends.  If already lao a lot in a short period of time, will definitely take Lomotil or Activated Charcoal or Dhamotil to stop it. How many times liao?  Over how long a period?</p>
              <p>I don't know if it's available OTC in Singapore pharmacies but there is a powder that one can mix into a drink to replace the electrolytes and minerals lost during continuous bouts of diarrhoea.</p>

              <p>ok ok Rhonda....my inklish sucked nowadays.</p>
              <p>But yah. its irritating talking to people who must insist they are of certain nationality.</p>
              <p>Like a indian boy telling me he is british citizen.</p>
              <p>i did made a boo boo about it because he is not actually indian.  he is actually sri lankanian.</p>
              <p>And sri lankanian is british citizen.</p>
              <p>then there is also another chap who claims to be a angmoh.  I even asked him specifically if he is caucasian and he replied yes.  Turns out, he is a indian boy in NS trying to get his citizenship.</p>
              <p>I do not mind different races of people, but I do mind when they lie.</p>

              <p>Last night, a Singaporean nurse and I worked side-by-side.  We had the corner of the ICU to ourselves because our patients, both confused, were side-by-side.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It was exasperating, but also quite hilarious!  Our patients were restless, agitated, confused... you said it, they were it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  They fidgeted non-stop, had to be restrained cause they tried to pull out lines and their oxygen masks. </p>
              <p>At one stage, my colleague's patient yelled at her, "You PSYCHOTIC BITCH!!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  because she was trying to suction him and he was struggling.</p>
              <p>Then when he calmed down and the ICU Doc was there asking about whether he slept during the night, I told him that "This patient has burnt many calories with his mouth!" because he talked non-stop and was an absolute motor mouth the whole night!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>When one is sedated or confused, one often leaks out secrets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  One minute, he was yelling out for "Jenny!  Jenny!!" (his Filipino girlfriend 30 years his junior <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">).  The next, he was yelling out for "Amy!!" (his recent ex-wife, think he has a few ex-wives <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">).  Then when my colleague went to restrain him, he stroked her arm and I said, "Eeeeee-yerrrrh!!  Look at the way he's stroking your arm!!" and she suddenly realised it and quickly swiped his hand away!</p>
              <p>Worse, I didn't tell her that prior to her returning to his bedside, I caught him erm... doing the self-service in full view with all blankets kicked asunder.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>and yeah. we used to make our own mayo. but it was such a waste of effort (have you ever tried hand-beating all that stuff for such a long period of time &gt;.&lt; ). and they don't keep very long. and once you make, it's not possible to make a tiny bit. because you had to have SOMETHING in the bowl to beat. not worth it imo. i'd rather just buy the stuff. haha. and i love mayo =P</p>

              <p>i liked rice mixed with mayo and ketchup.</p>
              <p>mayo makes it stickier. more like jap-type rice. and mayo is sweet. makes the rice taste good.</p>

              <p>THREE DAYS?!!!  You have got to be kidding me!!!</p>
              <p>If one has diarrhoea more than five times in one day, one had better go see the doctor because one will be at risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance!!</p>
              <p>That's kinda what happened to my stubborn dad once.  Had diarrhoea more than seven times in half a day, refused to see a doc, in the end, legs became so weak mom had to drag him to A&amp;E where he was put on a drip, then sent home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Activated Charcoal is good because if the diarrhoea is due to food poisoning, the charcoal acts to detoxify the digestive system as well.  I wouldn't pop anti-diarrhoea tablets without first finding out the cause of the diarrhoea.  That would be masking the symptom, but not solving the root cause of the problem.</p>

              <p>THREE DAYS?!!!  You have got to be kidding me!!!</p>
              <p>If one has diarrhoea more than five times in one day, one had better go see the doctor because one will be at risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance!!</p>
              <p>That's kinda what happened to my stubborn dad once.  Had diarrhoea more than seven times in half a day, refused to see a doc, in the end, legs became so weak mom had to drag him to A&amp;E where he was put on a drip, then sent home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Activated Charcoal is good because if the diarrhoea is due to food poisoning, the charcoal acts to detoxify the digestive system as well.  I wouldn't pop anti-diarrhoea tablets without first finding out the cause of the diarrhoea.  That would be masking the symptom, but not solving the root cause of the problem.</p>

              <p>he reported sick in camp at first, got MC... but I realised by Wed he was still having diahorrea and stomach discomfort hence decided to take him to A&amp;E</p>
              <p>but they prescribed him two pills... I got e names and found out 1 lengthen stomach movement which might length diahorrea, another though relaxes stomach but it can still cause abdominal pain or discomfort</p>
              <p>I think he's feeling better aft taking e charcoal pills instead</p>
