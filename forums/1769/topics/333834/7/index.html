              <p>Well, when I was in Brunei..... the senior medic there gave me a whole bunch of chemical icepacks to be distributed to my company for outfield training....</p>
              <p>When I returned the icepacks to him, several were missing and/or damaged.... he raised a huge outburst and talked about charging me and about how I had 'betrayed the nation'...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Nothing happened.... and I remember cursing that bugger about how what goes round comes round.....</p>
              <p>A few weeks later, back in Singapore, I was doing duty medic at my medical center. I was opening the medical center for the day when suddenly that senior medic showed up and said hi to me. His head was shaved.</p>
              <p>Apparently he was caught - for embezzling medical center funds for his own use. He was sent back to SG to be charged.</p>
              <p>SO WHO'S THE BETRAYER NOW, YOU F**KING HYPOCRITE!?!?! WAHAHAHA!!!!</p>
              <p>Oh, and what goes round comes round - he was tossed into DB and demoted from 1SG to 3SG. In the meantime, I got promoted to 3SG.... in short, we ended up at the same rank! Wahahahaha!!!!</p>
