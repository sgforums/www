In some cases they have a shortened life span too - they spark off, peak and die off relatively quickly.  It's easy to feel close and familiar to someone over a short period of time, much quicker than a friendship that develops in real life.  That's perhaps due to the level and frequency of interaction online, compared to in real life when many external factors come into play.<br><br>Thus while I do feel close to people online, if the period of interaction has been quite short and mostly via online interaction only - in real life I will still tend to put up my guard.  Because I know that what goes on online will never translate exactly into real life.<br><br>But I'm more of a reserved person by nature anyway, so that may influence the way I develop online friendships, offfline.<br></div></blockquote>Choco, you have expressed very eloquently what I had in mind.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   It's kinda odd... I'm so guarded in real life and yet, over the net, I'm much less reserved.  I have no idea why but it happens.   And yes, you do feel close to someone much faster when you interact online.

They'll stay as online friends till we meet up. Techonology and the internet has made it easier for all to make new friends, especially the introverted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Of course there are the dangers of making friends this way.You never know who's behind the screen on the other side.

            <div class='col-md body'>Missed the ICQ boat altogether, and only really started using MSN when I started working at a place where my sys admin had cerebral palsy and needed to use it to talk to the rest of the staff.<br><br>I started getting into forums in 1998 - it was a Formula 1 forum that turned into a real zoo, with some jerks spamming the whole site with porn, so a few of the guys from the forum set up a private forum.  That was a good experience, and through the three main forums I'm on at the moment, I should know someone in any continent I visit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Started going to IRC when I was just a mere pri 6 student. Fortunately, did not go all naive and get conned by lechers/rapists who want to arrange to meet up, cos' was aware of that. I still remember people going to the main channel of channels like #teens and typing what they want in a girlfriend/boyfriend. Lots of desperate people and lechers.<br><br>Nowadays, I don't go to IRC at all cos' I chat on MSN Messenger instead. Much better cos' you know it's your real friend on the other side, instead of an old man pretending to be a 'hot hunk'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
