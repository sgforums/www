              <p>Hi Rhonda, Pacific House along Victoria street also increase their price for steamed rice. I used to go there often. Now, I tabao dishes home and boil my own rice. Was at KFL supermarket in Flemington. Those big sacks of rice you mentioned went from AUD25 to AUD 38.</p>
              <p>Luckily I am not a rice person...</p>

              <p>Hi Rhonda, Pacific House along Victoria street also increase
              their price for steamed rice. I used to go there often. Now, I
              tabao dishes home and boil my own rice. Was at KFL supermarket in
              Flemington. Those big sacks of rice you mentioned went from AUD25
              to AUD 38.</p>
              <p>Luckily I am not a rice person...</p>

              <p>I used to frequent Pacific House when I first arrived in Melbourne, not anymore, cause their Victoria St branch is too crammed, and even if you're waiting for takeaways, it's plain uncomfortable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  It's not too bad during winter when it actually feels good to be squashed in a tight squeeze because you feel nice and warm and cozy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm more of a noodles person too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I tend to shop for Asian groceries in Victoria St and Boxhill.  I head out to Chinatown as well, or to a few of the Korean grocery shops in the city. </p>
              <p>Flemington is too far for me.</p>
