              <p>You know what's interesting?  My Aussie Team Leader used to tell me that it's weird, but the Filipino Team Leader seems to be ruder and more obnoxious to the Asian staff than to the Aussies.  She used to say that she would never talk to the Aussies the way she talks to the Asians.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>In the end, the day before my last day on that ward, her unreasonable shouting at me was the last straw that broke the camel's back.  Even the other staff who were around in the locker room were  horrified at her behaviour towards me.  When she left the room, the tension was still thick in the air, so I looked at an Aussie staff, she said, "That was so rude!  Unbelievable!" and I just said, "Yeah, she's like that to me all the time.  Bitch!"</p>
              <p>That TL later sms'd me and said that she had heard me call her Bitch, if I want to be a friend, I should know how to be a friend, to which I replied, "Forget about being friends.  You would never have treated me that way if I were an Aussie.  Even an Aussie TL has commented on your behaviour before.  Friends?  Forget it... you are too double-faced!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>So she, of course, thought she was being wronged, yada yada, complained to the Aussie TL, who told her that she's not being professional shouting at me, then sms'ing me when she could have approached me directly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Thank God the Aussie TL heard my side of the story first before landing judgement.  Phew! </p>
              <p>Too many Filipinos in my old ward.  Not a healthy environment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Well, cost-cutting measure AND to meet the serious staff shortage back in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I don't like to giggle at work, unless we're in the tea room, or behind the nurses' counter or in the drug room, out of sight of the patients and their visitors.  Not them... anywhere, anytime, laughing and giggling.</p>
              <p>Hell, in my old ward, they even spoke loudly across the ward to each other in Tagalog! </p>
              <p>When a PRC colleague tried to speak to me loudly in Mandarin, I told her to tone down and talk in a corner because I don't think it's nice to just yell across the corridor in one's own language.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>You know what, I think a few of the foreign nurses who have worked in Singapore before, kinda try to have their 'revenge' on Singapore nurses here.  Back in Singapore, they weren't treated well, so here, we're on par, a few of them end up being sarcastic about Singapore. </p>
              <p>One bloody PRC even had the cheek to tell me that Singaporeans speak 'funny English' in her own irritating mock Aussie accent.  That one's a faker who tries really hard to talk like the Aussies, who like her a lot because they think that her ability to speak English is all because of their teaching as she first arrived in Australia with English so bad, no one could understand her. </p>

              <p>One of my Aussie patient told me that when he was in Hong Kong years ago, he met a very beautiful Chinese lady there, who wanted to be his girlfriend after they've gone out for a few weeks.</p>
              <p>He thought nothing wrong to it, so he agreed.</p>
              <p>He later found out that she had tried to find out how much he had in his bank account!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  She had also told him that they ought to get married cause they had dated for eight months then.  And she added that she needed AUD20,000 from him upfront to support her parents because after marriage, she can't do so any longer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>
              <p>He immediately smelled a rat, and beat a hasty retreat, saying "Thanks, but no thanks!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>He tells me that after him, she managed to hook an American man, fleece him out of all his money, and is now the owner of a string of designer-brand boutiques or something.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Well, cost-cutting measure AND to meet the serious staff shortage back in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I don't like to giggle at work, unless we're in the tea room, or behind the nurses' counter or in the drug room, out of sight of the patients and their visitors.  Not them... anywhere, anytime, laughing and giggling.</p>
              <p>Hell, in my old ward, they even spoke loudly across the ward to each other in Tagalog! </p>
              <p>When a PRC colleague tried to speak to me loudly in Mandarin, I told her to tone down and talk in a corner because I don't think it's nice to just yell across the corridor in one's own language.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>You know what, I think a few of the foreign nurses who have worked in Singapore before, kinda try to have their 'revenge' on Singapore nurses here.  Back in Singapore, they weren't treated well, so here, we're on par, a few of them end up being sarcastic about Singapore. </p>
              <p>One bloody PRC even had the cheek to tell me that Singaporeans speak 'funny English' in her own irritating mock Aussie accent.  That one's a faker who tries really hard to talk like the Aussies, who like her a lot because they think that her ability to speak English is all because of their teaching as she first arrived in Australia with English so bad, no one could understand her. </p>

              <p>Yeah!  And a few Vietnamese too. </p>
              <p>That's why I get approached whenever I'm in the Victoria St / Lennox St / near the govt commission flats area.  Tamade... I usually respond to them in bloody good English to stun them a bit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Recently, this obese Aussie bloke waved to me from across the street like he knew me.  I turned around, eh, bo lang leh... only me there...</p>
              <p>So when the green man came on, I crossed the road and walked past him. </p>
              <p>He ran after me and walked beside me, trying to strike up a conversation :</p>
              <p>"Hello, Miss!  Good day to you!"</p>
              <p>(Me starts to get super suspicious... is he selling something...) "Oh... erm... Hello!  I don't think I know you, mate. "</p>
              <p>"Yeah, you don't.  Would you like to get to know each other?"</p>
              <p>"Erm, sorry, not really." (hastens pace)</p>
              <p>"Oh wait... you're beautiful today." (huffs and puffs trying to catch up, stomach bouncing up and down... gross!)</p>
              <p>"I'm always beautiful, not just today." * tosses hair for effect...</p>
              <p>"Yeah... you are beautiful..."</p>
              <p>"Sorry, mate.  I'm busy, I'm heading towards my workplace.  Have a good day!"</p>
              <p>(gallops away)</p>
              <p> </p>
