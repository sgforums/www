              <p>I almost wanted to yell at this boastful PRC girl to just shuck the f--k up because she was waiting for the tram at the Boxhill terminal station, yakking too darn loudly in badly accented English, thinking that she speaks it well and wants the world to admire her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  She was boasting to her friend, who isn't as conversant and more humble, about how she managed to 'master' the English language.  * cough... splutter... yeah, riiiiight!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Bad grammar, 's's in places where there shouldn't be 's's, etc etc.  Her humble friend spoke to her in Mandarin, she replied in awful English... she was trying sooo hard to show off.  Show off what, I don't know, because all of us at the stop kept casting nasty glances at her direction because everyone just wanted her to shut her trap!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I found another cat lover.... I live in Brunswick... I have a so called garden, so Tammie roams around. She is so temperamental. I just love their attitude. Er R U a PR? If U R, think it's cheaper for ur courses.</p>
              <p>BTW, wait for more interest rate hike... the property prices might go down.</p>
              <p>Richmond has lots of yummy food. Was there at Watergardens last weekend after my binge at Boxhill.</p>

              <p>Orwell actually used Animal Farm to depict what happened in Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution. The story used animals... they overthrow the human, and all animals are equal, till the pigs gang up and decide they want to learn to be like the humans, so they learn to walk on two legs. Very funny. Perfect depiction of some asians who want to act ang moh....</p>

              <p>Biangz, I'm sooooo glad I'm NOT from China!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Just yesterday, I had to admit an elderly patient from PRC.  She came accompanied by her elderly husband and her daughter.</p>
              <p>My nurses' alarm went "Bing!  Bing!", meaning, I have a hard-to-please, potentially problematic patient on my hands.  My sixth sense and my instinct warned me that it is NOT a good idea to tell them that I know how to speak Mandarin and Cantonese.  I've encountered patients before who latch on to you like leeches the minute they find out that you speak Mandarin, and they remind me of one of the reasons why I left nursing in Singapore in the first place. </p>
              <p>So, yeah, I suddenly couldn't really speak Mandarin, and had to mischievously (and convincingly) pause and stutter and insert a lot of erm's and ah's etc in my feeble attempts to speak Mandarin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>True enough, the patient turned out to be so obnoxious and fussy that by the end of my shift, her husband got red-faced from being irritated at her, and her own daughter was close to tears trying to please her.  One of the Aussie patients in the four-bedded room asked to be moved to a private room, and the other patient turned her TV on loud to drown out the drama. </p>
              <p>Extraordinary... she was extraordinarily difficult.  THANK GOD I pretended I couldn't understand her half the time.</p>
              <p>She had this habit of clearing her phlegm twice a day and it is some kind of elaborate exercise whereby she'd drink orange juice first, then spit it out and spend the next 20 mins, I kid you not, hacking and doing the Aaaaargh, Acccck, Pweeee!! routine!  It was disgusting.  Horrifyingly, instead of doing it in the bathroom, she did it by her bedside!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif">  The patient beside her was so repulsed, so was I, I had to step in and get her to stop and continue at the bathroom!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Even the Team Leader shook her head and frowned at the commotion. </p>
              <p>Awful, just plain awful.</p>
              <p>No wonder the Aussies don't really like the PRC's...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>You know what's interesting?  My Aussie Team Leader used to tell me that it's weird, but the Filipino Team Leader seems to be ruder and more obnoxious to the Asian staff than to the Aussies.  She used to say that she would never talk to the Aussies the way she talks to the Asians.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>In the end, the day before my last day on that ward, her unreasonable shouting at me was the last straw that broke the camel's back.  Even the other staff who were around in the locker room were  horrified at her behaviour towards me.  When she left the room, the tension was still thick in the air, so I looked at an Aussie staff, she said, "That was so rude!  Unbelievable!" and I just said, "Yeah, she's like that to me all the time.  Bitch!"</p>
              <p>That TL later sms'd me and said that she had heard me call her Bitch, if I want to be a friend, I should know how to be a friend, to which I replied, "Forget about being friends.  You would never have treated me that way if I were an Aussie.  Even an Aussie TL has commented on your behaviour before.  Friends?  Forget it... you are too double-faced!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>So she, of course, thought she was being wronged, yada yada, complained to the Aussie TL, who told her that she's not being professional shouting at me, then sms'ing me when she could have approached me directly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Thank God the Aussie TL heard my side of the story first before landing judgement.  Phew! </p>
              <p>Too many Filipinos in my old ward.  Not a healthy environment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
