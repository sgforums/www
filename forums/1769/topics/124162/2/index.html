            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, nursing's got nothing on welfare - you'll be astounded at the number of self-important do-gooders there.<br><br>I just tune out and run on low power while going "uh huh" repeatedly.  I've usually got a couple of things on the go at any given time, so it's a good time to start working out how I'm going to take care of my other tasks.<br><br>I still do keep one ear open, though, and sooner and later the halfwit will present a single, fatal flaw in his or her argument.  I wait till they're done, point out the flaw and trash their whole argument.  I hadn't noticed it before, but my colleagues told me that when I pick up on that point, I stop blinking - that's when they know they're in for a show. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>During my postgrad, we had a guest lecturer come in and present his views on psychology.  He was a sociologist, and his stepson had been put into a remedial class because some misguided teacher had read a report about parents from single-parent families were slow on the uptake (he hadn't married the kid's mother at the time).  Later, they tested the kid and found that he had a high IQ, so they sent him from the remedial class to the advanced class.  On the basis of that, he argued that psych is crap.<br><br>Anyway, this guy had an axe to grind, and my classmates, being the polite people they were, tried to argue the point that psych isn't so bad, but this guy was running rings around them - he was a sociology professor, after all.<br><br>Anyway, I finally had enough and it was late in the day, so I took my feet off my table, sat up and said, "It was a teacher and not a psychologist who misinterpreted a psychological report that he was not qualified to interpret and act upon.  Us psychologists are obliged to interpret the information accurately.  However, for the rest of the world, teachers included, it's a case of leading a horse to water, whereupon the horse has two options: drink or turn around and piss in it.  What's it going to be?".<br><br>The dickhead's jaw dropped to the floor, and our lecturer who invited him jumped in and called the class off.  I grabbed my gear, headed straight for the pub and had me a good drink.</div>

I cannot believe I'm having this conversation!

            <div class='col-md body'>Would all of you like to know what sparked this thread?<br><br>I was thinking about how they wanted to improve the professionalism in my field and then I started to dwell on the glaring shortfalls in our one and only resource - humans.<br><br>First, I thought about our Asian neighbours and how they are slowly catching up with us in terms of mastery of the English language.  Then I looked at my workplace and realised the level of English being used there was really atrocious.  Then it got me thinking too about the standard of English you encounter in the forums.<br><br>Next, I got extremely bothered by how subjective most of my colleagues could be.  If you try to follow their trend of thought, you'll often see how it deviates and goes helter-skelter before they start to lose focus.<br><br>If we do want to remain competitive, we cannot let these things slide.  It's not within my jurisdiction to bring into effect any change, but I just wish to highlight certain issues that really need to be addressed.  Otherwise, in no time at all, we will seriously lose our current competitive advantage.<br><br>I don't often think on a macro level but there are certain things that you just cannot ignore.  I know a few of you are insinuating that I'm intolerant and perhaps, discriminatory and all that but do look around and realise that if the bad language persists, it really won't be able to take us far.  I feel sad that in this country where we're given much opportunities (eg. education), a lot of people choose to waste it.</div>
