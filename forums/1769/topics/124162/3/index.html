            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking and writing in proper English definitely should be encouraged, especially in a professional environment.<br><br>As for train of thought... heh language is an easier skill to master, as compared to sense (sanity?! ) - either you have it or you don't.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">First, I thought about our Asian neighbours and how they are slowly catching up with us in terms of mastery of the English language.  Then I looked at my workplace and realised the level of English being used there was really atrocious.  Then it got me thinking too about the standard of English you encounter in the forums.<br><br>Next, I got extremely bothered by how subjective most of my colleagues could be.  If you try to follow their trend of thought, you'll often see how it deviates and goes helter-skelter before they start to lose focus.   </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess when it comes to comparing professionalism<br>and service standards and attitudes with other asian countries...<br>I wouldnt put our aptitude with English as a top priority<br><br>After all, many countries have managed very high professional standards<br>without being good in English (i.e. Japan) In fact, many occidentals would probably claim that Singaporeans speak the best English (but unfortunately, failed to shine in many other areas) compared to other countries in Asia.<br><br>Also, while it is a reality that being conversant in English is a good tool to communicate in the global society, it is a fallacy to assume that people who come from English speaking countries can speak (or write) better English.<br><br>Another thing is, many societies have allowed their own culture to permeate their use of the English language. One reason being, to shake off the 'colonial era imprint'. Australians, Americans, and the Brits can speak different enough 'English' to sometimes not understand each other!<br><br>Ultimately language is a tool. Our attitudes to using tools is the key to raising standards, whether personally or professionally. I would not say having a good aptitude in English is unimportant, (just like now many people focus on having a good aptitude in Chinese to exploit the burgeoning -albeit erratically- Chinese influence and economy), but the THINKING that nothing is important enough to work hard for, not enough a sense of pride in your own work, that perhaps the Singaporean worker needs to change.<br><br></div>

They keep missing the point, misinterpreting facts or what was said, or they'll get distracted and go off-tangent altogether and then when you try to draw them back to the main topic at hand again, they just don't or won't or can't get it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The shocking thing is, even university graduates can be guilty of this!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I'm starting to think if there's something seriously wrong with our education system here.<br><br>Also, I think something should be done to keep students awake during English lessons from Primary school onwards.  Apparently, most just don't pay due attention to their English classes because if you would just look around, the grammar can be pretty atrocious.  Could it be a case of us sitting on our laurels?  It's amazing that we boast of English being our first language and the main language used in conducting business and yet, our mastery of the language leaves much to be desired!<br><br>I wonder if anyone else here feels the same way about the two points I brought up.  Sure hope I'm not alone in this!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div></blockquote>I have a grievance against bad spoken English as well, but those inferiority infested bugs will tell me I'm just a potato.

BEST and WISE are English language courses for labourers and workers who either do not have a working knowledge of English, or who do not have a good command of the language.<br><br>When most of the workers registered for the BEST and WISE courses, the majority of them could only manage 'broken English' whilst a minority couldn't speak English at all.  However, what they didn't have in knowledge, they more than made up for it with their enthusiasm and diligence.  They not only attended the classes without fail, they asked questions and welcomed homework.  They were so earnest in their desire to learn English that they motivated me to teach them things beyond the syllabus and to hand them extra notes and learning materials.<br><br>They truly cherished the opportunity given to them to learn English as adult learners.  They didn't take their lessons for granted and it was amazing to find out how good they eventually became in their simple grammar.  Their vocabulary might be limited but when it comes to simple, grammatically-correct English, these chaps would be able to beat quite a large number of our young schoolkids hands down.<br><br>Disturbing?  Yes, EXTREMELY!<br><br></div>
