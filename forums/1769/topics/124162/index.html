            <div class='col-md body'>... does not seem to be that common, which is a sad, sad thing.<br><br>I've been increasingly frustrated in my interactions with folks who just can't seem to think coherently.  They keep missing the point, misinterpreting facts or what was said, or they'll get distracted and go off-tangent altogether and then when you try to draw them back to the main topic at hand again, they just don't or won't or can't get it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The shocking thing is, even university graduates can be guilty of this!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I'm starting to think if there's something seriously wrong with our education system here.<br><br>Also, I think something should be done to keep students awake during English lessons from Primary school onwards.  Apparently, most just don't pay due attention to their English classes because if you would just look around, the grammar can be pretty atrocious.  Could it be a case of us sitting on our laurels?  It's amazing that we boast of English being our first language and the main language used in conducting business and yet, our mastery of the language leaves much to be desired!<br><br>I wonder if anyone else here feels the same way about the two points I brought up.  Sure hope I'm not alone in this!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Camellias, that's true.  It's disturbing though when the issue being discussed is a work issue and not a personal issue because then, that often calls for objectivity.  And it's frightening when you work in my line, to realise that too many folks apply subjectivity in their rationale!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>And not only do some folks find it tough being objective, they also cannot rein in their helter-skelter thoughts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I've used the analogy of a shotgun to illustrate this point... think of their thoughts as a single bullet that when fired from the shotgun, explodes and in so doing, releases and scatters multiple ball-bearings within that does considerably more damage because, well, they just scatter!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
