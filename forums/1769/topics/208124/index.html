You only get paid at the end of the month when that's going to be your happiest moment. On the other days of the month, if you don't like your job, you'll be thinking that you're dragging yourself to work everyday. Not only that, while in your job, you'll think of why you accepted the job and is already thinking of the good old days, or might even job hop again soon.<br><br>You can really help yourself by delegating your jobs to people. They are inexperienced. Everyone is inexperienced at first, but are they qualified to do it? If you need people to speak/write Chinese, then it's quite hard because that takes time to train them. But you can assign simpler stuff for them to do. Give them self confidence. Motivate them and train them. In time, they will be able to take on greater responsibilities. If they are permanent staff, then at least you have a peace of mind that they don't take the knowledge they got from you and run away, like interns do.<br><br>Somehow if you choose the money route, I suspect you will be posting more complaints here in sgforums.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Satisfy your curiosity, but then consider carefully if you're actually ready to leave your current job behind.  You sound pretty busy, but yet quite fulfilled, in your current job and if so, you might not be prepared to make the move yet.<br><br>In any case, working at such a wide job scope in your field will be a definite asset when you finally feel ready to make a career progression move some time in future.  Think of all the valuable, priceless experience you're accummulating!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I guess it boils down to you in the end.  I'm just wondering, if you have to consider very hard in the first place, then maybe, you're not convinced the new job is better and / or you're not ready to quit this current job yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally i feel that the issue is not about chaging jobs..<br><br>The issue is about "delgating of tasks, giving clear and concise instructions, and spending time to teach them"<br><br>I believe that u are quite stressed up over the current work conditions due to he heavy work load and your staff inability to help u.<br><br>I believe that things might change for the better if u delegate the right stuff to the right worker and spend some time teaching and instructing each and everyone of them..<br><br>Once they know that one task, u can always trust them with that particular task..<br><br>Although initally it will be a challange though.. not to mention the time spend training them..<br><br>There are a lot of qualities to what makes a good boss..<br><br>And one of those qualities i believe is improve your employee's abilities and groom them for higher position too.. So everyone gains in the process of learning. .<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>my 2 cents~  pls dun be offended.  cheers~</div>
