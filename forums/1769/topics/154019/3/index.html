It's fun to pick apart a topic and discuss it from different perspectives.  Sometimes, we even deliberately pick a thread precisely because it has the potential to be controversial just because we love to discuss things to death.<br><br>This happens not only in the forum, it also happens when we have our outings.  That's just how we are.<br><br>Yes, there are those of us in Club 30 with strong views and opinions on certain matters, and we do not make apologies for it.  Afterall, we are all entitled to our own opinions and preferences.<br><br>We have lived and let live.  We have disagreed vehemently with each other's ideas and opinions but in the end, we're still friends, we still meet each other for outings, we keep in touch, etc.<br><br>If you're unable to see that, if you're insecure enough to need to insinuate the imagined repurcussions of you having a different voice (which, in the end, isn't that unique afterall, since it's an opinion echoed by a few others in here),  then, it's really your loss.<br><br>zoik, let me make this clear to you - you are welcome to present your views in here, but be prepared to stand up to those of us who hold different views and might, for the sake of having an interesting discussion, point out the flaws in your views, and present alternative perspectives.<br><br>There's no need to be fearful nor insecure in here.   Diversity is what we crave.  Sometimes, it's hard to accept differences in views and yes, sometimes, our discomfort shows, but in the end, upon reflection, we learn from the different opinions and that is the best way to grow up.<br><br>You do not grow up by not critiquing things, because that seems to be your idea of 'growing up'.<br><br>You learn best when you're actively asking, questioning, inviting discussions which might sometimes end up pretty heated because everyone's comfort zones and security levels get broached.  But eventually, we get over it, we learn, we 'grow' in the true sense of the word.<br><br>However, if you're here to create trouble and dissent, then, be prepared to feel unwelcomed.  If you're so insecure that you cannot accept differences in opinions and possible questioning from those of us who are inquisitive and a tad argumentative for the sake of enjoying an intellectual debate, then, you'll feel really uncomfortable with the general flow in here.<br><br>To tell you the truth, I have a deep respect for a few forumites here, and they are folks who have at times disagreed with me.  I respect people who have their own opinions, and can stand firmly on their ground, unwavering.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fashion is a form of self-expression and I like to see variety in people's dressing.<br><br>It's not so much what you wear; it's how you wear it.  Some people look classy no matter what, others can make an expensive outfit look trashy.<br><br>I agree that people are less embarrassed about exposing some skin these days.<br><br>I don't frown upon all of it.  I think people should learn to accept that women have b<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>reasts (even this forum filters the word <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ) and some cleavage isn't such a big deal.   VPL is not always deliberate, simply a wrong choice of underwear for the outfit.  As for the exposed thong look, noone's convinced me that it's good taste yet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Still belongs on WWE divas and erotica.<br><br>Lastly, I don't always subscribe to the theory of - wear what's suitable for your body shape.  Sure you might not have a perfect figure (who does? ) , but that doesn't mean you shouldn't wear a figure hugging dress if you want to, or show off your legs even if they're not exactly slender.<br><br>Life is too short for so many rules and limitations.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">Nowadays, it's very common to walk around and see girls walking about with a VPL (Visible Panty Line) showing that they're wearing G-strings.  Or, they'd wear clothes that resembled lingerie and be out and about, and there won't be a semblance of bashfulness about them either.  Or, you'd see them wearing  hipsters and when they sat down, my word, even the crack of the ass is exposed!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>So, what do you think of this 'trend' that's fast becoming an accepted 'culture' here?
