              <p>Rabbit:</p>
              <p>Last year was difficult for the rabbit. Rabbits got overly emotional and rash, and paid the price in both money and emotional turmoil. Rabbits should reflect on the mistakes of the last year, and learn from them. Rabbits should strive to lead a more peaceful existence this year, and be more clearminded, so as to be able to face the challenges ahead.</p>
              <p>Rabbits will face many challenges this year. They will face much pressure, and must take care not to slacken and face these challenges head on. Rabbits must learn from adversity this year, and be able to rebound.</p>
              <p>Career/wealth matters, those born in 1963 will have help. however guard against gossip and slander. Those born in 1951 must take care to rest and eat well to peform.. Those born in 1975 will have someone help to relieve stress at the workplace. Those born in 1987 must guard against exhaustion and emtional stress. Those born in 1999 should beware of conflict, esp with family.</p>
              <p>For love life, this will be a relatively uneventful year.Due to emtional turmoil, rabbits will be unable to give their full attention to any relationships. Rabbits have to clear their head to be able to focus on what they want. It may be better for rabbits to concentrate on their careers this year. Married rabbits should beware changes in their marriages.</p>
              <p>Healthwise, rabbits should take care, especially with regards to their mental/emotional health. Don't overwork, try to relax, and take part in more group activites. Rabbits must try to put away their emotional baggage this year, control their temper, and get along with those around them. Rabbits must overcome their emotional problems, and find themselves again, not forgetting to show care and concern for others and be less of a loner. Most of the rabbit's problems come from within themselves, rabbits should strive to master their emotions this year.</p>

              <p>Sheep:</p>
              <p>Last year was positive for the sheep but going into the tai shui year, sheep will easily come under pressure, but as long as the sheep is able to calmly meet challenges, this will not be a problem.</p>
              <p>Sheep will be more accident prone this year, so care must be taken to avoid injuries. Also because of the tai shui year, sheep will be under considerable emotional stress, and hence may become unstable because of relationship and money matters.</p>
              <p>However, sheep should preservere against the challenges of the ox year. It will be worth it in the long run. For career and weath, those born in 1955 will receive help, and things will remain relatively stable. Those born in 1967 must learn to take things easy with regards to all work matters, and not get agitated. Those born in 1979 may see opportunity for development, but expectations have to be tempered, as challenges abound.</p>
              <p>For love life, changes may take place. And the sheep may ended up confused and irrational, and be in danger of making mistakes. Also guard against betrayal. This year, sheep really have to endure (ren).</p>
              <p>As this is the tai shui year, sheep have to take care of their health and go for checkups. Avoid high risk activities and prevent overwork. Also avoid emotional stress, exercise and take part in group activities. The sheep, while being down this year, will crave change and improvement. If the sheep is able to learn from the challenges this year, this will lead to future success. Sheep should not mourn whatever they have lost, instead they should look forward to the future, put aside their misgivings, and face their challenges head on.</p>

              <p>Last year was a challenging one for the horse but they will be able to rebound and recover lost ground this year. however, as this is a hai tai shui year for the horse, horses must beware of being cheated or made use of by others. Things will also be rather messy for a while. however this should only last a few months.</p>
              <p>This will be an overall positive year for the horse, but the horse needs to be clear and focused to avoid going astray. overly fast success may not be a good thing either. Horses should avoid rushing into things and overstretching themselves. careful planning will be beneficial to ensure a bright future.</p>
              <p>For career/wealth, those born in 1954 will do well this year. 1966 horses will do well but take care not to overwork. Those born in 1978 will reap benefits with career advancement and may benefit even more from a switch.</p>
              <p>For love life, this year is the hai tai shui year, horses may get hurt or cheated. So beware. Also avoid getting into arguments with people. It will be good to learn to forgive people. Be tolerant and willing to talk things over.</p>
              <p>Horses should take care of their health this year, as well as take precautions for personal safety.</p>
              <p>Horses should do well this year, provided they do more and talk less. As long as they are willing to put in the hard work, they should enjoy success.</p>

              <p><strong>1) <span style="color: #ff0000;">The ROOSTER</span> - Average year </strong></p>
              <p>Intro: There are 4 lucky stars and 6 bad ones. The year is average but career would be busy. Though there are obstacles at the workplace, there will appear a helpful person who will help you. There is a possibility of an additional new staff working for you and there will be less travelling.</p>
              <p><strong>Health</strong>: Your health is good. However take care of the occasional back pain and don’t carry heavy things. When a person gets older, the bones become weaker and hence will need to exercise often or to have “activity” is the best. Climbing stairs up and down all the time is a very good form of exercise.</p>
              <p><strong>Love &amp; family</strong>: Family members are always there for you when you need their help. However an elderly person in the family may need more of your attention this year. If single, there is no romance.</p>

              <p><strong>Intro</strong>: There are 3 lucky stars and 2 bad stars. Last year, 2008 was a year of many changes and obstacles while this year is going to be a slow year. Whatever you try to do, you don’t get through, hence be patient and wait for the new year to come. Since rats are most active at night they tend to receive good news at night. There is a possibility of a small good news, the second half of the year.</p>
              <p><strong>Money &amp; Work</strong>: Since matters would be slow so money luck would also be slow. Career is standard but would need to work harder as competition is very stiff. Go travelling to break the slowness in your chart that way, business will be as usual or consult a good fortune teller. There would be obstacles at work. Clear each one at a time and clear the most important one first then the least important one the next day.</p>
              <p><strong>Health</strong>: Your health will be good this year.</p>
              <p><strong>Love &amp; family</strong>: There is love and harmony at home if you are married. Everyone is close to you. If single and if you are a female then chances of finding your rightful partner is there. A good year for romance as sparks will fly !!!</p>
