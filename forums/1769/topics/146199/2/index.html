A couple of arms factories and military headquarters do not justify eliminating entire cities. The real reason for targeting Hiroshima is that the city was not damaged much by earlier raids and the Americans wanted to see the effect of this new bomb on a city. Nagasaki was bombed to test out an A-bomb with a different design. They let the Japanese Emperor go although he was just as guilty of war crimes merely because it would be easier to administer post-war Japan with a puppet emperor.<br><br>Politics is full of hypocrisy.</div></blockquote>Yes, but not quite.<br><br>Look at Dresden - the targets were the war factories, but ultimately the whole city got wiped out.  Why?  It wasn't a matter of choice - before the days of precision munitions, carpet bombing was the only way to achieve destruction of the target.<br><br>If the Allies wanted to knock out Hiroshima's military facilities with conventional munitions, it would have resulted in similar damage.  In fact, the causalties would probably have been higher - the difference between German and Japanese construction methods would have put paid to that.<br><br>Yes, they wanted to bomb an intact city to assess bomb damage - as a result Hiroshima was deliberately left relatively untouched by earlier bombing raids.<br><br>Nagasaki was bombed because after three days, the Japanese government obviously didn't get the first message clearly enough.</div>

It might have cowered the Japs into surrender.<br><br>Even if Hiroshima was necessary and expendable, Nagasaki was overkill. Bombing Hiroshima was already a massive show of force.

About a week before Suzuki spat on the Potsdam Declaration and left the Allies no choice.  Yes, it would have been a lot easier for Truman to have been prepared to be civilised on that particular date.<br><br>I think the more telling stance was in what Truman said AFTER the bomb was dropped:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Having found the bomb we have used it. We have used it against those who attacked us without warning at Pearl Harbor, against those who have starved and beaten and executed American prisoners of war, against those who have abandoned all pretense of obeying international laws of warfare.

By all accounts, Truman was not insane, so indulge me in assuming that there was some reasoning behind his decision.<br><br>Truman's military advisors estimated that anything between 105,000 and 4 million Allied lives would have been lost in Operation Olympic, with up to 10 million japanese casualties.  Was dropping the bomb the ideal thing to do?  No.  Was it the lesser of two evils?

Would you say that they couldn't have been tried for war crimes in this regard because that was perfectly within the rules of warfare?</div></blockquote>When you lose a war, you could be put on trial for tiptoeing through the tulips.  It's no real measure for ethics or morality simply because the victors get to write all the rules.<br><br>While we're on the topic of the rules of warfare, Japan agreed in 1942 to abide by the Geneva convention, and then spent the next three years not keeping her word.  To have attempted to fight on equal terms a vicious and determined enemy who already demonstrated a capacity to ignore all rules of war conduct would have been plain stupid.  If the Allies had decided to go that way, I would advocate putting Allied commanders up for trial, for war crimes against their own people.<br><br>What if, instead of a nuclear weapon, the Allies had dropped a fuel-air explosive bomb on Hiroshima?  It's almost as destructive, but it's not nuclear.  Would it have made a difference?<br><br>I don't know about you, but when I was being taught to set up minefields during NS, I was thinking, "Jesus, I hope I never get caught up in one of these - if the AP mines don't get you, the MGs will, and if they don't there's always the Claymores".  The design of the ambush was plain vicious, but that's warfare and I had to accept that the enemy could well do the same thing to me - it's simply the facts of life.  When you get down to brass tacks, there's nothing pretty, civilised or honourable about it whatsoever.  From the Allied perspective, it comes down to the simple point that you do whatever it takes to ensure that you and your friends are not robbed blind, raped and murdered at gunpoint.<br><br>I'm not saying that the ends justify the means.  In that situation, you don't have the luxury of justification, so you go with the facts and decide what to do, and hope that someone in the future doesn't second-guess you, knowing all the time that they definitely will.</div>

So what are your feelings on this matter? </div></blockquote>Nah, I'm a psychologist.  My interest in this started when I was in Sec 3 and read Stephane Groueff's "The Manhattan Project".  Initially, I was horrified, and over the years it's nagged at me about how Truman could have made such a decision, especially since he refused to share the burden of the decision with the other Allied leaders.  That kind of a decision is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.<br><br>Like I said, dropping the bomb isn't an ideal solution by any stretch of the imagination.  Getting the Japanese to lay down their arms without bloodshed would have been the best outcome - after all, Sun Tzu did say that the best war fought is one that is won without a single shot being fired - but the Japanese were never going to be succeptible to a "hearts and minds" campaign.<br><br>It came down to two things: invasion or dropping the bomb.  Based on the invasions of the outer Japanese islands, we may (very conservatively) estimate Japanese causalties to be twice that of Allied casualties, and on the lowest estimates presented to Truman, that would have been 210,000 over 120 days of fighting, with 105,000 Allied losses.  Mind you, those are conservative figures.  Let me explain.<br><br>The invasion of Japan was never going to be easy - an ambhibious assault on Tokyo could only take place on the beaches of Kyushu and Kanto, and the Japanese knew this and had both heavily covered.  This would have made Normandy look like a minor skirmish.  Mind you, the Battle of Normandy resulted in 209,000 Allied casualties, and that was against an enemy that had been faked out into defending the wrong spot, a mistake which the Japanese were not going to commit.<br><br>In light of this, I would personally figure the Allied casualty figures at 300-400,000, and Japanese somewhere between 600-800,000.  The total casualty figure of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined was still less than half of the lower end of this estimate.<br><br>So it comes down to this: the need for the decision was created by the Japanese, not the Allies, when Suzuki rejected the Potsdam Declaration.  The decision taken resulted in half the number of Japanese being killed, and no needless expenditure of Allied lives.  So the problem really lies only in the weapon of choice, but for that one point, would you have 3 times the number of deaths on your conscience?  I wouldn't.<br><br>The nature of history is such that for every decision you make today, there's going to be a whole bunch of people second-guessing you tomorrow with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.  Rather than making that mistake, I'd leave it at saying that the decision to use the bombs was, quite simply, the lesser of two evils based upon the figures above.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My grouse is with the killing of innocent lives, and not whether people were sorry for what they did...<br><br>Besides, the leadership and the innocent civilians are two separate entities. As you have pointed out, that the japanese leadership was so ruthless that they were more concern how many Allied soldiers are killed rather than their soldier's life.<br><br>but i agree, it's the conduct of war and the US did what they thought could win it for them. fairdinkum.<br><br>and thanks for the insightful commentaries (especially for those who couldn't be bothered with history in school!)<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Gedanken:<br><br>Rolex, the Germans simply cannot be used as a comparison for the Japanese.  Yes, most Germans were not aware of places like Auschwitz during the war, but once they found out about it they went out of their way to make sure it never happened again.  And yeah, they break out in a rash when somebody mentions Nazi - I had an unpleasant German classmate I loved to antagonise that way, but that's another story. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On the other hand, to this day, history books in Japanese schools describe WW2 like an excursion through Asia.  Also, unless something's changed recently, Japan has never apologised to the countries she raped.<br><br>No, none, zero, zip comparison at all.</blockquote></div>
