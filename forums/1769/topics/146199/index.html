How would you value the suffering of a Chinese farmer strung up on a post and filleted slowly like a fish, compared to that of a Japanese civilian, in the middle of combat training, being wiped out in a flash?  Would you rather that the killing of Japanese have taken place on a more personal level?  Keep in mind that among the 120-150,000 troops the Japanese had waiting for the Allies were enslaved Taiwanese and Korean soldiers.  At that level, I'd say the Japanese had it good, but let's not go there, eh?<br><br>The Potsdam Declaration cabled to the Japanese government is outlined as follows:<br><br>Points 2 and 3: You saw what happened to Germany, and you know we're playing for keeps.  Now that we're done with the Krauts, we're coming for you.<br><br>Points 1 and 4: Still, we'll play nice one last time: here's your chance to surrender.<br><br>Point 5 (verbatim): "Following are our terms.  We will not deviate from them.<br>There are no alternatives.  We shall brook no delay."<br><br>Point 6: The existing leadership in Japan responsible for this war is to be removed.<br><br>Points 7 and 8: Until a new local leadership is installed, the Allies will temporarily occupy and administer over Japanese territories.  You will retain sovereignty over the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, so even at this stage you haven't lost the house on your bet.<br><br>Points 9 and 11: Your soldiers will be permitted to lay down their arms and go back to their normal lives, and non-war-related industries will not be affected.  Hell, you have to have some way to pay for the damage.<br><br>Point 10:  We are not going to enslave the Japanese people, but we ARE going to get anybody responsible for war crimes.<br><br>Point 12: After we're done sorting out who's responsible and oversee the installation of a government who can play nice, we'll pack up and leave.<br><br>Point 13: We'll say it again: we're not mucking about here - drop the gun and come out with your hands up.  We're not going to wait too long.<br><br>Prime Minister Suzuki's response to the Declaration was <span style="font-style: italic;">mokusatsu</span>, or "treat with silent contempt".<br><br>It's very simple in a strategic sense.  You've got a gun pointed at the other guy's head, and he spits on you and waves his knife about.  He doesn't need to say anything to say, "Yeah?  So what the f*** are you going to do about it?".<br><br>In light of that, do you think bombing a deserted island was going to put the fear of God, Shinto or whatever they pray to into them?  Besides, the Americans didn't have all that many bombs to spare to provide a harmless lightshow.<br><br>It comes down to this: the Allies had no obligation whatsoever to the Japanese people - that job was for the Japanese government.  As Patton said a year prior to the bombing: "No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.  He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country".  Again, the point that innocent civilians were killed is invalidated by the fact that these civilians were in training for war, making them combatants.  The Allies' imperative was to win the war with as few losses as posssible.  Call it calculating, call it callous, but that's simply the conduct of war.<br><br>And it's not as if the Japanese were unaware of the equation either.  As already seen on Iwo Jima and the othe outer islands, the Japanese attitude was to trade their troops' lives with as many Allied lives as they could get.  The only way to take the fight out of such a ruthless opponent is to be even more ruthless than him.<br><br>After the bombs, I'd wager that Hirohito and Suzuki were thinking, "Holy sh!t!  We're down 140,000 to zero!", and decided that the odds were a bit too rich for their blood.  As far as the Allies were concerned, job done.<br><br>All the signs are there - the Japs were begging to be dragged all the way downtown.  I for one am glad somebody had the balls to do it.</div>

Yes, most Germans were not aware of places like Auschwitz during the war, but once they found out about it they went out of their way to make sure it never happened again.  And yeah, they break out in a rash when somebody mentions Nazi - I had an unpleasant German classmate I loved to antagonise that way, but that's another story. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On the other hand, to this day, history books in Japanese schools describe WW2 like an excursion through Asia.

            <div class='col-md body'>The one thing that really cracks me up is this remark made by Hirohito in his announcement to the Japanese people that he had accepted the Potsdam declaration (14 August 1945):<br><br><blockquote>We cannot but express the deepest sense of regret to our allied nations of East Asia, who have consistently cooperated with the Empire toward the emancipation of East Asia.</blockquote>What a fricking load of bollocks!  Is there some nuance of Japanese that confuses "emancipated" with "conquered, pillaged and raped", and "cooperated" with "bent over and racked hard"?<br><br>This is what I'm talking about.  I'll admit that I admire some of Hirohito's work as a marine biologist, but ultimately he's still the creep who's responsible for the Japanese people not coming to terms with what they did, even though 60 years have passed.<br><br></div>

A couple of arms factories and military headquarters do not justify eliminating entire cities. The real reason for targeting Hiroshima is that the city was not damaged much by earlier raids and the Americans wanted to see the effect of this new bomb on a city. Nagasaki was bombed to test out an A-bomb with a different design. They let the Japanese Emperor go although he was just as guilty of war crimes merely because it would be easier to administer post-war Japan with a puppet emperor.<br><br>Politics is full of hypocrisy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the theory is they could drop the bomb somewhere isolated in Japan to show the awesome power. But Truman wanted to have a demostration..since he spent a lot of cash on it. Also Hiroshima was a low priority target..a sleepy town even though it houses the manufacturing facilities of the army. It was number 5 on the hit list I think.</div>
