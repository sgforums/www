I couldn't stand the noise &amp; complained to the building warden!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The next few were actually housemates - one of them had an obsession with cleaning &amp; would wash her hands umpteen times a day, and even used a cloth &amp; wipe the carpet in her room clean, once a day  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Stayed with a family who kept their dog in the backyard and it would whine and bark THROUGHOUT the day... drove me mad, man!!

            <div class='col-md body'>I have this Indian family living just next to my unit. Every weekends, they would played those stupid indian songs and turned it on to full blast. Kinda torment to me and my family because those are supposed to be my "wake up late" days.<br><br>And they have this mix breed Jack Russell and barks at anyone who walk pass their unit. In the beginning when they just moved in, they hushed the dog whenever it barks but it seems nowadays, they don't do it anymore. And now, this stupid dog has its merry time of barking day in, day out. Thinking of feeding that canine with some chocolates.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
