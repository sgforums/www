            <div class='col-md body'>One movie that I watched a few months back that was really thought-provoking was the movie, 'Closer'.<br><br>It's a movie that explores in depth, the intertwining relationships of four protagonists - two men and two women, who eventually pair up as two couples.  It explores the issues of love, compatibility, online sex chats, marriage, fidelity and infidelity, honesty in relationships and sex.<br><br><img src="http://us.movies1.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/hv/photo/movie_pix/columbia_pictures/closer/closer_bigposter.jpg"><br><br>I like how the movie depicted that infidelity, and the resultant honesty that is demanded in its aftermath, can have two very different effects on two couples.  Whilst it draws one couple closer as they learn to trust each other again and to forgive the transgression, it tears another couple apart because one of them simply couldn't handle the truth.  It makes you realise that sometimes, life deals you lemons despite your best intentions and plans, and then you'll just have to take a deep breath, make a conscious effort to grin and bear with it, make lemonade with the lemons, and move on.<br><br>The movie is pretty slow-moving at times, funny at others, but it always explored its themes with intensity.  Despite having three 'big names' in its acting cast, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman and Jude Law, this movie will not be accepted as a 'mainstream' movie because it is too deep, too intense.  But it is for that very reason that I like it.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The movie ends with the very scenario it started with - Natalie Portman walking through a busy street, very conspicuous amidst the crowd, attracting the attention of quite a few men.  In the very beginning, she attracted the sole attention of one Jude Law and then, an incident happened to draw them closer.  The ending suggests that various possibilities one could have in life with various different partners and it makes you realise that there's no such thing as 'THE ONE', but rather, it's about the commitment you've made with the chosen one, and the experiences in life you decide to share together.<br><br>Amazing movie... gives you tons to digest afterwards...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>'Closer' even inspired me to write a poem and enter it for a recent contest in another forum in here!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>'Closer' is now out in the stores.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
