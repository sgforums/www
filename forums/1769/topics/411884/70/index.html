              <p>That's the reality of the world these days. At least they're telling us that degree holders are not overqualified, should they be unable to find "suitable" jobs elsewhere.</p>

              <p>I could never figure it out myself....</p>
              <p>Back in JC, I once joined my friends who were studying at the airport....</p>
              <p>I didn't understand what the attraction was.... we were sitting on the floor, with our notes propped up on the seats. It was so uncomfortable that I could hardly concentrate.</p>
              <p>That was the one and only time I went there to study.... since then, I've done all my revision at home or in school.</p>

              <p>It gets better......</p>
              <p>By right there should currently be three chequebooks in existence under my name:</p>
              <p>1. The chequebook I got when I first opened the account.</p>
              <p>2. The chequebook that got lost in the mail.</p>
              <p>3. The chequebook that I finally got one month after requesting (2).</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>When (2) got lost in the mail, I ordered the DBS operator to invalidate it so that no one who finds it can make use of it. They had definitely sent it out, because they had already deducted the cost of it, and because they told me it <strong>had</strong> been mailed out.</p>
              <p>Now, another operator is telling me that the system tells him that only two chequebooks are under my name..... <strong>inclusive</strong> of the one that they cancelled. And they had cancelled the first chequebook that I already have.</p>
              <p>WTF?!?!?!? There should be THREE!!! So does this mean there is one more chequebook out there, under my name, STILL VALID?!?!?!</p>
              <p>And that their system is so f**ked up that they can give me inconsistent information?!?!?!?</p>
