              <p><br>we stepped onto their plane, the air stewardess stood by the isle and doing nothing but looking and chatting with her co-mate...and blocked the isle.  !!!</p>
              <p>I said "excuse me" as i need to pass, she said : "go back to your seat!" </p>
              <p>I was angry liao..i had to raise my voice at her to tell her off..How are we going to pass and get toour seat if they (yeah the 2 fat whales) just stood there and blocked all the passengers!... she fumed and moved away!</p>
              <p>she came back to serve drinks, rudely just dump the orange juice on serving tray.</p>
              <p>btw, we got her name, a couple of us wrote in..  oh it may not reach the management at all...!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there was an incident of my friend who took the 1st class seat, the air stewardess without checking nor any warning) suddenly approached him and just yelled at him in front of all passengers..: "go back where u belong (pointing at the economy class)". </p>
              <p>Little did she noticed that the head person from the sidney who was seated at the next seat saw the entire incident.  She was called to the hd office at sidney airport where she was sacked immediately.!  serve her right!</p>
