              <p>TIME and energy were wasted on Wednesday, all in the name of a new media marketing campaign for a shaver.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday night, Philips Electronics Singapore apologised
               for alarming the public with its guerilla advertising campaign 
              featuring a video of a 'bear' along Ulu Pandan Road.</p>
              <p>The police told The Straits Times that it is now 
              investigating if what happened was an offence of public nuisance under 
              Section 268 of the Penal Code, which can lead to a fine of up to $1,000.</p>
              <p>In a statement, Philips said the 'bear' was actually a 
              mascot deployed as part of a guerilla marketing campaign undertaken by 
              social media agency, The Secret Little Agency, to launch a new shaver.</p>
              <p>'We had anticipated the attention that the bear would draw 
              but had no intention to cause any alarm. We would like to apologise for 
              any concern caused,' it said.</p>
              <p>It is understood that the agency had not alerted any of the 
              authorities about the 'bear' before the campaign, though it did inquire 
              if a permit was needed to wear an 'animal mascot outfit'.</p>

              <h1>Philips sorry for ad stunt</h1>
              <div>By Victoria Vaughan</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TIME and energy were wasted on Wednesday, all in the name of a
              new media marketing campaign for a shaver.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday night, Philips Electronics Singapore apologised for
              alarming the public with its guerilla advertising campaign
              featuring a video of a 'bear' along Ulu Pandan Road.</p>
              <p>The police told The Straits Times that it is now investigating
              if what happened was an offence of public nuisance under Section
              268 of the Penal Code, which can lead to a fine of up to
              $1,000.</p>
              <p>In a statement, Philips said the 'bear' was actually a mascot
              deployed as part of a guerilla marketing campaign undertaken by
              social media agency, The Secret Little Agency, to launch a new
              shaver.</p>
              <p>'We had anticipated the attention that the bear would draw but
              had no intention to cause any alarm. We would like to apologise for
              any concern caused,' it said.</p>
              <p>It is understood that the agency had not alerted any of the
              authorities about the 'bear' before the campaign, though it did
              inquire if a permit was needed to wear an 'animal mascot
              outfit'.</p>

              <p>Marketing idiots. By all means launch a creative ad campaign,
              but they crossed the line when they ended up wasting the time and
              resources of the police, ACRES, and the Singapore Zoo......

              <p>What makes it even more inexcusable is that the SingPost saga
              earlier this year should have underlined the need for responsible
              marketing.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
