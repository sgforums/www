              <p>Easy.  Most of you have nowhere else to go to, even if
              you're pissed and unhappy.</p>
              <p>FT's, they can uproot themselves and leave anytime, but
              Singapore needs them, therefore, you kinda have to appease them and
              keep them happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or, on a level that most males would be able to understand, your
              wife has no choice but to tolerate your nonsense unless she wants a
              divorce, but you have to work  hard to keep your mistress
              happy because she can leave you for another man anytime.

              <p>Yup yup!!  I almost wanted to go down on my knees and thank God when some living human FINALLY answered the call and I didn't get booted out of the queue and get automatically hung up on!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>Everything's in order.  Think by July or so, I should have my PR. </p>
              <p>I'm thinking of postponing my Deakin course because the current batch says that their income drop by about 40-50% when they take up the course, because working hours are cut by lecture time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  I'm more concerned with assets acquisition at this stage.  Either delay enrolling for an entire year to save up for the drop in income and to learn driving and maybe even, purchase a car first.  And if property prices fall enough, get into the market quickly and secure my very own apartment and pay mortgage instead of rent.  So... see how... too many variables at this stage. </p>
              <p>So what are your plans now that you are a bona fide American?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Hey, cool! Congrats! The next logical step after PR acquisition is, of course, citizenship. Is that the path you'll be following? How long do you have to remain in PR status before becoming eligible for citizenship status?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it's a good idea to hold off on the Deakin course until you've had time to build up some financial reserves to weather the drop in income when you do enroll. What are the chances of the fees increasing next year, though?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmmm... I don't feel that much has changed now that I'm naturalized. Blame being a PR for 15 years for that! I'll probably travel a bit more, now that I have more vacation hours accumulated on account of my seniority with the organization. Not that I need to be a US citizen to do that, though! <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Oh, dickheads like that have an international presence, unfortunately. </p>
              <p>Over here, I'm really scared of the cucinas and the over-anxious, dramatic Greek men and women, and the Italian families.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Really over the top!  Quite often, we meet attention seekers, who are like leeches who wanna cling to you and suck the lifeblood out of you! </p>
              <p>These days, whenever I meet prescription drug addicts, I don't care and just give them the bloody drugs they are so keen on.  I give up on them.  The govt is so soft of them, there's nothing we can do except be like some kind of waitress serving prescription drugs to them.  If you deny them their drugs, you're infringing on their 'rights' and what-not.  I wouldn't bother fighting with the druggies... just let them get their high and continue in their messed-up ways.  Hopefully, Rudd will enforce stricter laws to stop prescription drug abuse.</p>

              <p>I'm looking forward to a regulation to be enacted here that allows us to transfer our vacation days in terms of years of service to be transferred to our new employers if we choose to work elsewhere.  That way, we won't lose any vacation benefits from a change of employer!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Once I hit the 15 - 20 year service mark, biangz... I think I get almost three months of vacation days a year!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  Happiness, sia!!  My colleague, who's a Ward Clerk, has been with the hospital for 25 years, and she only works 2 days a week, choosing to retreat to her beachside home for the rest of the week in her fully-paid-up home, tending to her newly-bought chooks, gardening, reading, taking hikes, etc!  What a life!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I love the work flexibility here too!  I can choose to cut down on my workdays with my current employer, and work the remaining workdays in another hospital or with a nursing agency!  Or I can choose to work X no. of days in one ward, and Y no. of days in another.  Or X no. of days as an RN, and Y no. of days as an administrator or trainer or clinical specialist or what-not!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  Good, innit?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm not worried about the fees increasing... I'm  holding out because I have a feeling the hospital might improve their sponsorship scheme because the current batch of students are living a hand-to-mouth or a deficit situation and if there are dropouts or if more are discouraged from taking this up in future, then they will HAVE to improve the conditions.  I'm biding my time and playing my cards right because afterall, I become a fully-certified ICU RN upon completion of my course, which ends before November.  I don't really need the Post-Grad Dip to find work in any ICU then!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Learning how to drive and owning a car is pretty much the top priority after my course because with a car, I can consider moving to the outskirts, where I can purchase a larger property for less.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>So what are your plans now?  You already have your car and house!  What next?  A second property for rental?  House prices are so hot there right now, they are good investments... or maybe wait for it to drop even further.  I am!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Not true.  Not everyone will satisfy the criteria for immigration because some countries are very strict in their criteria.   Australia has already stepped up the criteria since last year.  You'll find that if you try to apply now, you might not even meet the minimum points required to be eligible.  I myself barely made it... and mind you this is after I've worked here for almost two years and have a guarantee of a steady job.  And my occupation is listed under a priority list.</p>

              <p>I'm looking forward to a regulation to be enacted here that allows us to transfer our vacation days in terms of years of service to be transferred to our new employers if we choose to work elsewhere.  That way, we won't lose any vacation benefits from a change of employer!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Once I hit the 15 - 20 year service mark, biangz... I think I get almost three months of vacation days a year!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  Happiness, sia!!  My colleague, who's a Ward Clerk, has been with the hospital for 25 years, and she only works 2 days a week, choosing to retreat to her beachside home for the rest of the week in her fully-paid-up home, tending to her newly-bought chooks, gardening, reading, taking hikes, etc!  What a life!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I love the work flexibility here too!  I can choose to cut down on my workdays with my current employer, and work the remaining workdays in another hospital or with a nursing agency!  Or I can choose to work X no. of days in one ward, and Y no. of days in another.  Or X no. of days as an RN, and Y no. of days as an administrator or trainer or clinical specialist or what-not!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  Good, innit?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm not worried about the fees increasing... I'm  holding out because I have a feeling the hospital might improve their sponsorship scheme because the current batch of students are living a hand-to-mouth or a deficit situation and if there are dropouts or if more are discouraged from taking this up in future, then they will HAVE to improve the conditions.  I'm biding my time and playing my cards right because afterall, I become a fully-certified ICU RN upon completion of my course, which ends before November.  I don't really need the Post-Grad Dip to find work in any ICU then!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Learning how to drive and owning a car is pretty much the top priority after my course because with a car, I can consider moving to the outskirts, where I can purchase a larger property for less.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>So what are your plans now?  You already have your car and house!  What next?  A second property for rental?  House prices are so hot there right now, they are good investments... or maybe wait for it to drop even further.  I am!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>The vacation policy in my organization allows employees to carry over a maximum of 275 hours of vacation time per fiscal year. However, during the year, you can accumulate as much time as your position/seniority permits--you just have to ensure your balance drops to or under 275 hour by the end of the f/y.

              <p>From the look of things, hang in there first, because I think prices will plunge further... </p>
              <p>Petrol prices here are crazy right now.  Public transport here, whilst not exactly the best, is pretty alright.  At least it gets me to most places and I'm used to walking by now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  I'm pretty good at figuring out how to get places via public transport now too.  I feel very independant and confident now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>I want to beef up my savings first before getting a car.  I want to pay for my first car up-front.  But once you buy a car, you have to be prepared for sudden mishaps and stuff so I want to be sure I can handle all the contingencies first.  I don't intend to start building a castle only to run out of bricks halfway.  I've picked out the car I'm going to buy too!  Most likely the Toyota Echo, or if I'm feeling indulgent, or if the prices drop, the Toyota Yarius.  I don't have a driving licence yet, but I don't foresee any difficulty in getting that out of the way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Someday, when I have my own house, I'm going to consider buying a scooter as well so I can vroom vroom to the neighbourhood grocery shops and restaurants without having to fret over parking space.  Hehehe! </p>
