              <p>Its not enough, because if you notice our youths, they tend to mix around with their own kind.. the mandarin speaking will stick together, the english speaking ones etc.</p>
              <p>but the point is that, due to the wide usage of other languages and dialects, that is the very reason why Singlish is around and thriving. and i agree with what KB said bout having the need to abolish Singlish totally before the majority of Singaporeans can start speaking and writing good English.</p>
