You can't keep them with other tortises/turtles as they tend to be highly territoral, plus you need a good filitration system and ensure they have a good diet too.<br><br>I think the problem is that alot of ppl forget that a baby turtle (inclusive of RES) can grow big and not look tiny and cute forever and also they have long lifespans!</div>
