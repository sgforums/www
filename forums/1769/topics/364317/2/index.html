              <p> </p>
              <p>its for myself..  i entered JC only in April ( I missed Jan-Mar ) and I chose Maths C (science class).</p>
              <p>My 1st maths paper : 0/50, my very 1st failure test... what</p>
              <p>Wis a octangen ?  I went what the ***?  I was clueless..</p>
              <p>I always get straight As for my Mathematics E, but i never learnt Maths A before, and blur blur embarked on Maths C.</p>
              <p>I engaged a tutor (along with my other friends, same plight as me), tution twice a week, we studied every day and forced the 2years secondary school Maths A to our brain within 6 months.</p>
              <p>finally end of the JC first year, i got all the Maths A understood and sorted out, caught up with my Maths C and passed it finally with pleasing scores...</p>
              <p>boy...that is one big challenge.</p>

              <p>The syllabus now is hellish, and they've started incorporating aspects of the A Level syllabus into the O Level syllabus.... believe it or not. For instance, I only learnt 3D geometry in Maths C, but I was forced to tutor that to my cousin for her E Maths.</p>
              <p>And frankly speaking..... at times, I have serious problems with the way some concepts are taught in schools. Like for that aforementioned 3D geometry, for instance, the kids were forced to solve 3D trigo problems by visualizing in three dimensions! They were never taught to project 3D problems onto 2D space!</p>
              <p>This is nonsense.... I'm a friggin' mechanical engineer, and I still manually solve many 3D problems by decomposing them to 2D first! Not surprisingly, my cousin (and many of her classmates) struggled with it.</p>
              <p>So I taught my cousin how to project 3D geometry onto a 2D plane. She understood what I taught her immediately, and she was soon able to laugh it off as 'ridiculously easy'.</p>
              <p>As I told her..... 'What I just taught you is simply what my JC lecturers taught me.'</p>

              <p>The syllabus now is hellish, and they've started incorporating
              aspects of the A Level syllabus into the O Level syllabus....
              believe it or not. For instance, I only learnt 3D geometry in Maths
              C, but I was forced to tutor that to my cousin for her E Maths.</p>
              <p>And frankly speaking..... at times, I have serious problems with
              the way some concepts are taught in schools. Like for that
              aforementioned 3D geometry, for instance, the kids were forced to
              solve 3D trigo problems by visualizing in three dimensions! They
              were never taught to project 3D problems onto 2D space!</p>
              <p>This is nonsense.... I'm a friggin' mechanical engineer, and I
              still manually solve many 3D problems by decomposing them to 2D
              first! Not surprisingly, my cousin (and many of her classmates)
              struggled with it.</p>
              <p>So I taught my cousin how to project 3D geometry onto a 2D
              plane. She understood what I taught her immediately, and she was
              soon able to laugh it off as 'ridiculously easy'.</p>
              <p>As I told her..... 'What I just taught you is simply what my JC
              lecturers taught me.'</p>

              <p>I just read this. Maybe some parents weren't educated to the levels that are now being taught to kids earlier, or weren't good at it (so they majored in something else). I remember that my form teacher in P6 held a one-day seminar for parents on how to solves Maths problem sums.</p>
              <p>How do tutors keep abreast of the syllabus, besides looking at what their pupils are given? Will tutors eventually need to go for upgrading courses?</p>
              <p>Some parents want to prove that their children is "gifted", while others want theirs to avoid the former EM3/Normal Stream route. All this is contributing to the high migration and low birth rates.</p>
