              <p><strong>IT'S not just the students who need extra coaching when it comes to their schoolwork.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Indeed, homework is getting so tough now that parents themselves are
              signing up for workshops and classes to learn how to better coach their
              children, reported Lianhe Wanbao.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Parents who tutor their own primary school kids are increasingly
              stumped by the level of difficulty in the homework dished out to their
              children.</strong></p>

              <p><br>same sentiments... </p>
              <p>Balance of parents and play time is important for a kid..</p>
              <p>Childhood affects everybody's thoughts and development when they grow older..  once they reached adulthood, if they looked back at the kids playing happily, some may felt the loss of their childhood happiness and closeness to parents and eventually blame their parents.  This is my opinion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I talked to some kids before, they dun even know their parents well.</p>
              <p>They only know about that they must do homework, learn everything, they almost breakdown and crying out cos they cannot spell those words properly.. and this haunted them daily...  they go to sleep and still thinking ...tomorrow how...</p>

              <p>Tuition is getting very hot and rampant; like bubble tea last time.</p>
              <p>Only difference is... there's definite tangible results... but then... tuition is not going to be there forever, so it's quite jialat if students rely it all the way... they will die in uni or in life if they continue their dependencies...</p>
              <p>That's why I also coach students, especially at A levels, on my methods of studying and preparing... More on the skills on how to score than hard methods on the subject matter itself...</p>

              <p>maybe i am wrong,</p>
              <p>so far i see, the parents who pushes their kids further than they can cope, the parents are not as high educated and do not understand the system.  So they push their children to attend every subjects every tution, so they dun miss out anything, just in case..</p>
