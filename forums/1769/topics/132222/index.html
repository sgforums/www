            <div class='col-md body'>kops, I know what you mean.  I hate it when organisations seem to exploit charity for profit, or for publicity or what-not.<br><br>There are WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too many charity shows on TV now.  It's really an overkill.  Even if they don't profit from the calls made, they profit from the publicity and the no. of viewers so they can sell ad space at a premium.<br><br>Charity should not be linked with personal gains.  If we need a lottery prize to entice us to 'donate', then, it's no longer a 'donation' in all sense of the word but rather, like kops said, it shall then be equivalent to purchasing a lottery ticket because the principle of gambling and trying out one's luck and increasing one's chances of winning is there.<br><br>And yes, I do get fed-up when there are flag days EVERY Saturday!  It makes a stroll down Orchard Road infuriating!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

In the past, I always drop a coin or more into those charity tins, but now I see them every weekend I don't even bother anymore!!!!<br><br>They start to become an eyesore. I mean if schools want to educate the kids about charity, I think it is better off bringing them to the homes to help out, or even the spca or clean up the beach or something. I never liked to go to any Singapore beach including ECP (to skate, not to use the beach) because the rubbish you find on the beach is really super disgusting. I don't see how ANYONE can bring themselves to swim in the sea.<br><br>I have some cash automatically deducted to community chest though I feel like changing it to the Children's Cancer Foundation or the Milk Fund.<br><br>And I always hate the way NKF raise their money. I never ever call in. The way they do it, it's just so distasteful.</div>
