            <div class='col-md body'>Steph, it's called the Rat Race.  And it's hard to avoid being in the Rat Race here, esp when everyone else is obsessed with running and coming out tops somehow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But there are the few of us who choose not to run that crazy rat race.  We'll never be 'successful' in the commonly-accepted definition of the word, but we're each 'successful' in our own terms.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Basically, you need to develop a self-confidence in yourself.  You need to have a strong sense of self-worth too, if you're going to run a different race.  People around you will be passing comments, even those nearest and dearest to you.  It won't be easy to stay on the less-trodden path, but it can be done.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Think about your exams first... one hurdle at a time!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Study hard, concentrate, do well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Good grades never hurt anyone!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Good luck!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

By that definition, it determines when we have "arrived".<br>In a way, the education in singapore has sort of shaped us, the citizens, to see that being successful means to be highly qualified and be able to earn a lot of dough.<br>Meaning, only when we ignore what the society determines as successful then can we really say we are happy with what we have. But it's not really going to be easy to go against the flow...<br>point to add, not that i'm sexist or anything, a gal prob have a higher chance of choosing what she wants to do more than a guy.<br>Would you think twice before choosing to marry a guy who aint as highly qualified as you? Would pressure from your family force you to leave a guy who doesn't earn enough to support a family?<br><br>Just my 2 cents....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Steph,<br><br>Whatever will come will come, whatever can happen may happen. We'll never know what is installed infront of first. All that we can do is just be true to yourself, family, friends, community, country and our world.<br><br>Just remember, each time when you wake up in the morning before opening your eyes. There are thousands or probably millions of people who are not as fortunate as you to see today's sunlight, smell the flowers in the garden, listen to great advice, and taste the EVER-YUMMY food prepared by mummy.<br><br>Being young, go all way out to learn and make many mistakes - get scolding, get laughed at. These are excellent growing up experiences. Through these experiences, we mature and we learn and they are PRICELESS.<br><br>Life is an opportunity, benefit from it.<br>Life is beauty, admire it.<br>Life is bliss, taste it.<br>Life is a dream, realize it.<br>Life is a challenge, meet it.<br>Life is a duty, complete it.<br>Life is a game, play it.<br>Life is a promise, fulfill it.<br>Life is sorrow, overcome it.<br>Life is a song, sing it.<br>Life is a struggle, accept it.<br>Life is a tragedy, confront it.<br>Life is an adventure, dare it.<br>Life is luck, make it.<br>Life is too precious, do not destroy it.<br>Life is life, fight for it.<br>(I think it is from Mother Theresa)<br><br>100 years from now, no one, probably not even our offsprings will remember us. We will one day become very insignificant. So do things that are of worthy goals with GREAT compassion and love.<br><br>Have a great life.<br><br>Cheers,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being in the Rat Race does not necessarily mean a bad thing. The most important thing is whether do u enjoy what u do? Whether what u do is rewarding? Whether do u feel appreciated for what u do? Whether it's worth while what u do? Do things for the sake of doing it wouldnt be that agonising if u do not despise doing it. It's balance.
