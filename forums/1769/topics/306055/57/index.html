              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>here's something to share</p>
              <p>my auntie/uncle's company from australia was asked by NParks to
              give advice on the problem with singapore's greenary. they said
              they wanted to bring the standard up.</p>
              <p>my uncle (used to be a singaporean) told them in the face. the
              problem with this country is that labour is under appreciated,
              everyone thinks its a banghra job. unknown to them, a landscape
              artchitect (or gardener) earns a starting pay of $2-3K in other
              countries with good opportunities for increment if you're
              certified. the certification is recognised in most countries.</p>
              <p>so he told NParks, the problem now is that the foreign workers
              come to singapore. do manual labour for a few years, go back home
              and start a company with the money and experience. so in the end,
              the employment ends at that country. that is a problem for us,
              since there's no one to take care of the trees anymore.</p>
              <p>So who's left? Singaporeans lah. but every mother son thinks its
              a dirty job and there's no money to it.</p>
              <p>who's to blame? education, parents, culture... u go figure it
              out.</p>
              <p>another problem is a typical singaporean problem - cost
              savings.</p>
              <p>We purchased D-grade trees, now they are deteriorating. my
              relatives told them, if you had purchased A-grade trees in the
              first place, the initial cost (though high) would be lesser than
              the repair costs now.</p>
              <p>They offered land to my relatives to train singaporeans in
              landscape maintainence, they rejected.</p>
              <p>Out of goodwill, they offered to let Singaporean students to get
              the cert at their nursery in Australia.</p>
              <p>recently my auntie came back to singapore, she said singaporeans
              (in my words) cannot make it.</p>
              <p>every little thing also complain, can't do manual labour.
              lol~</p>
              <p>i tell her not to waste time with them anymore and just send
              them back. I'll go over when my contract finishes and take over
              them.</p>

              <p>Construction too.</p>
              <p>In the US, construction workers are regarded as professionals with pretty high pay and respect.</p>
              <p>Here, when we talk about them, the first thing that comes to mind is 'banglas'.</p>
              <p>Let's face it.... hardly anyone here wants to do such work.</p>
              <p>Don't even talk about construction workers.... even jobs as foremen and site supervisors are shunned by many.</p>
              <p>I know of quite a few people in my class (mechanical engineering) who wants to go into finance and such..... basically, engineers are overworked and underpaid.</p>

              <p>then again, there are idiots in the SAF forum... or was it military nuts who says his passion is "flying military aircraft"</p>
              <p>ehhhh... passion will be gone under a screwed up organisation.</p>
              <p>let's see if he has passion when he knows his aircraft will be maintained by NSFs who don't understand the aircraft system. I'm not saying NSFs are incompetent, they just don't have the knowledge... and this kind of knowledge takes a while to set in.</p>

              <p>It's sad that a lot of careers in Singapore is under-appreciated and underpaid.  And it's also equally sad that everyone seems to flock to the same few careers that pay well. </p>
              <p>kopi, I read your account re. the landscaping situation in Singapore and can't help but feel sad.  Our heavy reliance on cheap foreign labour shall someday backfire, esp since we don't remunerate them well, and don't encourage them to stay on.</p>

              <p><em>Brute<br>You are 14% Rational, 42% Extroverted, 71% Brutal, and 71% Arrogant.<br>You are the Brute! You are introverted, arrogant, brutal, and more intuitive than rational. Like a big, dumb animal, you are driven by your emotions more than your reason, and as a result of the fact that you care very little for the feelings of others, you tend to be rather selfish. Because of your selfishness, you also tend to be a bit arrogant, seeing yourself as big or strong or smart or always correct. This makes you a stubborn, irrational, emotion-driven brute. King Kong best represents the gorilla-version of your personality. Emotional, introverted (King Kong was isolated on his own island, after all), brutal, and arrogant (proud to be the largest ape on Earth!), Kong would probably get along very well with you, seeing as how you share many of the same traits. Aside from, you know, all the fur. So your personality defect is simply that you resemble King Kong to a very high degree. Which probably isn't a good thing, you big brute!<br></em></p>

              <p>Ferret, have you been in  here THAT long?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  Wah... never realised! </p>
              <p>Anyways, my results :</p>
              <p><em> STARVING ARTIST<br><br> You are 42% Rational, 42% Extroverted, 42% Brutal, and 57%
                                      Arrogant.<br><br> You are the Starving Artist! You are more intuitive than logical,
                                      and are primarily guided by your heart and emotions. You are also
                                      very introverted and gentle.<br><br> Of course, this does not mean that you do not have an ego. In fact,
                                      you are surprisingly arrogant for someone so emotional and gentle.
                                      This is why you are best described as a starving artist. You are
                                      very introspective and quite sure of yourself, as any accomplished
                                      artist is, yet your views are impractical, guided by feelings, and
                                      overly gentle. You probably find math, logic, and similar
                                      intellectual pursuits offensive to your artistic sensibilities, and
                                      you prefer the open-endedness of artistry because then you know you
                                      can never truly have a wrong answer.<br><br> So really you have no reason to be arrogant, you big doofus,
                                      because the skills you value (emotion, spirit, art, etc.) in
                                      yourself are valuable only on a subjective level, meaning your
                                      arrogance is purely masturbatory.<br><br> In short, your personality is defective because you are arrogant,
                                      introverted, introspective, gentle, and thoroughly
                                      irrational...posessing most of the traits needed to be a
                                      starving--and useless--artist.<br><br> So get out there, write a few short stories that are allegories for
                                      the spirit, and starve!<br><br> To put it less negatively:<br><br> 1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational.<br><br> 2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted.<br><br> 3. You are more GENTLE than brutal.<br><br> 4. You are more ARROGANT than humble.<br><br> Compatibility:<br><br> Your exact opposite is the Capitalist Pig.<br><br> Other personalities you would probably get along with are the
                                      Haughty Intellectual, the Televangelist, and the Emo Kid.</em></p>

A couple of years ago, as a result of damage received from the numerous hailstorms we experienced, our townhome association’s insurance company agreed to pay for the roofs of all 17 buildings in the complex to be reshingled. The insurers contracted the task out to a roofing company that used Mexican labor.</span></p>

If everyting went according to schedule, it would mean all the buildings in the complex would be reshingled in just under a month.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Well, everything did go according to schedule, and the roofers finished their work in less than a month. However, they didn’t bother cleaning up the literally tens of thousands of sharp roofing nails that had fallen around the bases of the buildings from when they removed the old shingles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Then we had some heavy rains after the work was completed, and a number of the townhouse units immediately reported roof leaks. This information was forwarded to the insurers and they sent a building inspector out to take a look at the roofs of the affected units. He discovered that the roofing crew had forgotten to lay down the plastic waterproofing barrier between the shingles and the roof structure on some of the units. Additionally, a significant number of the shingles were unevenly lined up, didn’t overlap consistently, and/or were secured to the roof with an insufficient number of nails.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">(The insurer got another roofing company to correct the mistakes.; I think they also initiated legal action against the original roofer to recover the cost of hiring the second contractor.)</span></p>

              shingles.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then we had some heavy rains
              after the work was completed, and a number of the townhouse units
              immediately reported roof leaks. This information was forwarded to
              the insurers and they sent a building inspector out to take a look
              at the roofs of the affected units. He discovered that the roofing
              crew had forgotten to lay down the plastic waterproofing barrier
              between the shingles and the roof structure on some of the units.
              Additionally, a significant number of the shingles were unevenly
              lined up, didn’t overlap consistently, and/or were secured to the
              roof with an insufficient number of nails.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(The insurer got another
              roofing company to correct the mistakes.; I think they also
              initiated legal action against the original roofer to recover the
              cost of hiring the second contractor.)</span></p>
