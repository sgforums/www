              <p>i dunno.</p>
              <p>i did this shoot for someone and i felt the photos were crap.</p>
              <p>then he got someone else to do it and the results were much better!</p>
              <p>but deep down inside, i don't really like to take photos of women. unless they don't mind looking silly.</p>
