              <p>here's something to share</p>
              <p>my auntie/uncle's company from australia was asked by NParks to give advice on the problem with singapore's greenary. they said they wanted to bring the standard up.</p>
              <p>my uncle (used to be a singaporean) told them in the face. the problem with this country is that labour is under appreciated, everyone thinks its a banghra job. unknown to them, a landscape artchitect (or gardener) earns a starting pay of $2-3K in other countries with good opportunities for increment if you're certified. the certification is recognised in most countries.</p>
              <p>so he told NParks, the problem now is that the foreign workers come to singapore. do manual labour for a few years, go back home and start a company with the money and experience. so in the end, the employment ends at that country. that is a problem for us, since there's no one to take care of the trees anymore.</p>
              <p>So who's left? Singaporeans lah. but every mother son thinks its a dirty job and there's no money to it.</p>
              <p>who's to blame? education, parents, culture... u go figure it out.</p>
              <p>another problem is a typical singaporean problem - cost savings.</p>
              <p>We purchased D-grade trees, now they are deteriorating. my relatives told them, if you had purchased A-grade trees in the first place, the initial cost (though high) would be lesser than the repair costs now.</p>
              <p>They offered land to my relatives to train singaporeans in landscape maintainence, they rejected.</p>
              <p>Out of goodwill, they offered to let Singaporean students to get the cert at their nursery in Australia.</p>
              <p>recently my auntie came back to singapore, she said singaporeans (in my words) cannot make it.</p>
              <p>every little thing also complain, can't do manual labour. lol~</p>
              <p>i tell her not to waste time with them anymore and just send them back. I'll go over when my contract finishes and take over them.</p>
