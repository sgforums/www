              <p>I still remember got thread that asked why no purpose in life, and got this guy actually blamed it on the govt!</p>
              <p>Because the govt gives a structured path to follow, even if the system is not very forgiving for those that choose not to follow, do you blame it on the govt if you have no goal in life?</p>
