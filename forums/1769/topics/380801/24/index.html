              <p>I agree that it has nothing to do with religion but I just didn't know they practice it. To me, it's a art of living in harmony with the environment but nowsaday those you see will recommend you 101 things with going rates like $108, $808..... and sometime very religious.</p>

              <p>I'm quite sure it's not a curse from them ... just that their house design is affecting mine, a lot. It's lucky that we have mindef behind us, that's known as "General's hill" in fengshui. So there, I tell you, the SAF built their HQ there not out of accident.  But for houses facing that hill, it's not so good.</p>
              <p>And you know the best part, apparently, it's just affecting me particularly badly .... I'm a metal monkey, and the coming year is the year of the tiger .... monkeys and tigers are a bad combi.</p>

              <p>so maybe all those daggers and beasts were really meant to be against SAF and the hill. Your family is just collateral dmg?</p>

              <p>it's not quite a war per se lah ........</p>
              <p>but the house directly opposite mine's built some very
              adversarial features into their three story facade. it's like
              knives poking into my house. and it's painted white and grey, a
              white tiger poised over mine. It's definitely no accident, they had
              chaps with luo pans around the place all the time. We are not
              poking them back and hexing their family or anything, but just to
              ward off all the bad vibes.</p>
              <p>On the day their outer facade went up, cookie died ..... a short
              while later, my mother fell down, badly, one of my trading
              customers ran away without paying me, owing me tens of thousands,
              my bro got downgraded out of command school etc etc. And the run of
              bad luck has been continuing, family members' been falling sick
              very regularly. These are emergency measures to ward off the bad
              vibes. ........</p>

              <p>So if their house is warding off the bad vibes from MINDEF, and you are deflecting it as well, does that mean it'll all be concentrated on the road?</p>
              <p>That reminds me. ST ran an article about one of our parishioners who was killed on her way to Mass on Sunday, and it's very sad.

              <p>actually I think to have those driveways on the main road is safer than in those small alleys. At the main road you know there will be traffic and people, so you're more careful. Unlike in alleys where you so often don't meet any other cars or people when you drive out that you can get careless.</p>
              <p>But of course having those driveways at the mainroad can lead to traffic jams.</p>
