              <p>i am just flying through the neutered one's second set of photos.</p>
              <p>fark it, just do a generic skin smoothening and change the colours.  i've got no time to dodge, burn, liquify, detailed skin smoothening...  i would have time if cash was offered. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>i am more interested in getting a client's photos done and sending them the invoice asap.</p>
              <p>good thing i should be going to tioman next week, i get to avoid the neutered one for 4 days.  best thing is that he was supposed to arrange for a shoot, up till now still haven't arrange and we're already 3/4 done. his wedding is like in 2 weeks time.</p>
              <p>he will receive the bad news that i'll be away, then see how kanchiong spider he will get.</p>

              <p>i sent off my folks' maid last week... she's on home leave for 2 weeks</p>
              <p>fricken Air Asia counter is a total and utter fustercluck!!</p>
              <p>wah lau eh.. we lined up at 9:05 for the 11:10 flight.. and the place was already bedlam... because the staff cannot clear the earlier flights...</p>
              <p>line up until 10:30 and they haven't even cleared that flight she was on...</p>
              <p>finally checked her in at 10:40...</p>
              <p>the big mess comes from asswipes who are allowed 15kg but bring like 35kg of luggage then start to bargain with the counter staff... who are told to collect the excess baggage fee instead of referring them to the totally empty excess baggage counter.. which had 2 people sitting there chatting with each other...</p>
              <p>the bloody supervisor didn't care</p>
              <p>sign for yogjakarta line suddenly changed to line for miri.. then the counter staff stood up and started shouting "yogjakarta.. who hasn't checked in?" so i shouted back "EVERYONE HERE!!" gesturing to her about 50 people still haven't been checked in..</p>

              <p>on the subject of maids, we hired a local one that only has to come in on alternate days to help with the washing up, cleaning, ironing etc. CB, only after she started then we discovered that she doesn't know how to iron clothes(even though she said she does). fucking useless, fired her on the spot. </p>

              <p>recommended by a family friend. what a lousy recommendation that turned out to be! not just because she can't iron (what kind of woman in her late 40s can't iron?) , she's pretty slow too. even I can do housework faster than her. </p>

              <p>one of my friends had this maid who was told to clean the top of his cd player.</p>
              <p>now, there was some stuff on top of the player. </p>
              <p>a normal person will remove those items before wiping the dust off the player. what she did, was to wipe the player, with the stuff still on it, in effect scratching the finish of the player and not really getting rid of the dust properly.</p>

              <p>i sent off my folks' maid last week... she's on home leave for 2 weeks</p>
              <p>fricken Air Asia counter is a total and utter fustercluck!!</p>
              <p>wah lau eh.. we lined up at 9:05 for the 11:10 flight.. and the place was already bedlam... because the staff cannot clear the earlier flights...</p>
              <p>line up until 10:30 and they haven't even cleared that flight she was on...</p>
              <p>finally checked her in at 10:40...</p>
              <p>the big mess comes from asswipes who are allowed 15kg but bring like 35kg of luggage then start to bargain with the counter staff... who are told to collect the excess baggage fee instead of referring them to the totally empty excess baggage counter.. which had 2 people sitting there chatting with each other...</p>
              <p>the bloody supervisor didn't care</p>
              <p>sign for yogjakarta line suddenly changed to line for miri.. then the counter staff stood up and started shouting "yogjakarta.. who hasn't checked in?" so i shouted back "EVERYONE HERE!!" gesturing to her about 50 people still haven't been checked in..</p>
              <p>fricken huge mess</p>
