              <p><br>nope.. it was huge amounts of charged particles thrown out by the sun which hits the earth.. these charged particles caused the electrons in the telegraph poles to move - electricity...</p>
              <p>however, those were simplier systems which were basically electromagnets and wires.. our electronics are more fragile these days... imagine, if you are statically charged and you touch a computer chip, the chip is fried...</p>

              <p>Yeah.... at the very least, they should inform the boy before actually wiping the data out. And also, prior to any routine maintenance, it is the duty of the technician to inform the customer that some data loss may be inevitable, and that they should back up the data first.</p>
              <p>I remember the times I had to send my laptop to the repair center. Even though the problems were not related to the hard disk (once the RAM failed, and at another time the DVD-ROM drive failed), the tech still asked me whether I had backed up my data before I handed my laptop over to him.</p>
