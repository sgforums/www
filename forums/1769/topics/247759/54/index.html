Â“I cannot think of another issue where there is such a disconnect between what is really the correct policy and how the public view that policy,Â” the long-standing MP told Parliament last week.<br><br>But he shouldnÂ’t have wondered aloud. It was really a no-brainer because the timing of an increase of about $400,000 a year in the starting salaries of ministers soon after a GST hike, despite the payouts to offset the increase, and a $30 increase a month in aid for the poor was just, well, off centre.<br><br>Apart from the timing, the three-day debate took on a life of its own, both inside and outside Parliament, with new points being brought up by the government ministers and each one being countered with another.<br><br>Linking economic growth to ministersÂ’ performance got MPs rushing to speak.<br><br>How does the Health Minister, for instance, see his ministryÂ’s good performance linked to GDP, asked Denise Phua.<br><br>Corruption, one main reason given when the benchmarking of ministersÂ’ salary was first raised more than a decade ago, was hardly mentioned this time round.<br><br>Then, the fact that pensions are still being paid to some political office-holders got dragged in with Minister Teo Chee Hean trying to explain the historical backdrop for this perk and finally responding to calls for a re-look by saying: Â“It is quite a complicated exercise but weÂ’ll have a look and see whether it can be done and how it can be done.Â”<br><br>And when the PM wrapped up the session on Wednesday, he put in sharper focus another reason for the pay increase when he framed it this way: It is not to take care of this Cabinet, but to make sure Singapore has a strong group of future leaders.<br><br>Even the decision to donate his salary increases for five years had a counter: This was a sweetener to make the decision more palatable, even though Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan told reporters the PM had made up his mind some time ago.<br><br>With clarity of purpose being pushed out of and onto the House floor, the debate missed two issues which are likely to decide what kind of society we want to be.<br><br>One, leadership. Will young Singaporeans see leadership Â— in the home, government and their place of work Â— as a privilege or as a burden?<br><br>Are the types of leaders like Minister of State Balaji Sadasivan, who missed the boat to become a full minister but did not want to go back to his former job as a neurosurgeon despite the PM offering him that choice, a rarity in a money-chasing Singapore?<br><br>He must have seen leadership as a privilege, a calling. Search high and low and getting such individuals is not impossible.<br><br>Two, how will the rules between the ruler and ruled be re-defined with this gruelling debate?<br><br>With a Lee Kuan Yew, it was Â“trust me and I will make you all first world citizensÂ”. With a Goh Chok Tong, the mantra was Â“trust me and I will make this society not just a first world country but a kinder and gentler oneÂ”.<br>Singaporeans, in most instances, bought the arguments without much of a quarrel.<br><br>With a Lee Hsien Loong at the helm, what will that one line be?<br><br>He, his ministers and MPs can expect the citizens to ask more of them.<br><br>Expect Singaporeans to be more demanding at meet-the-people sessions, ministriesÂ’ information counters and other places where contact with the public is very close. That 40-year-old social handshake between the government and the governed will come under scrutiny. With some grassroots leaders, that vital link to the citizens, already signalling difficulties in explaining the salary decision with clarity and a sense of mission, PM Lee and his team have their job cut out for the next four/five years.<br><br>And in those four/five years, good GDP figures may not be the only magic answer. Making sure the good times roll down to those people feeling trapped in their individual circumstances must be one KPI.<br><br>If the PM swings this one, then expect a new deal to be signed, sealed and delivered. That can only be good for Singapore. - TODAY/ra<br><br></div>
