            <div class='col-md body'>Hahhaa.<br>/reaches for the gingko supplements<br><br>================================<br>More young here hit by Parkinson's<br>Gracia Chiang<br>gracia@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>DOCTORS are seeing more young people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disease usually associated with ageing.<br>.<br>In fact, of the 5,000 to 7,000 cases diagnosed in Singapore, 15 to 20 per cent are patients below the age of 40, said senior consultant neurologist Dr Tan Eng King at a press conference yesterday on World Parkinson's Disease Day.<br>.<br>He told Today he has seen a 10-to-20-per-cent jump in the number of new diagnoses in that age group over the last two years at the Singapore General Hospital.<br>.<br>Why this is happening is unclear, but Dr Tan said this makes early diagnosis and treatment even more important.<br>.<br>"A young student might think it is just their nature to be slow in their movement, or someone who has tremors may think it is because of anxiety," he said.<br>.<br>Parkinson's is a brain disorder that manifests itself in uncontrollable shaking, stiffness in the limbs and slowness of movement. There is currently no cure but the symptoms can be managed through medication and surgery.<br>.<br>Another consultant neurologist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital also said he was "beginning to see more cases of younger patients".<br>.<br>However, Dr Au Wing Lok noted that this could be because "more of them are aware (of the condition) and are coming forward".<br>.<br>A local study in 2004 found that the disease affects three out of every 1,000 Singaporeans aged 50 and above. While there has not been a similar study done among younger Singaporeans, Dr Louis Tan from the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) suggested that research could focus instead on the genetic causes of the disease Â— as it has been found that a greater proportion of younger people with Parkinson's carry gene mutations.<br>.<br>Last year, Singapore and Taiwan researchers identified a mutated gene that doubles the chance of developing the disease and, interestingly, is found in people of Chinese descent.<br>.<br>More genetic information will "allow doctors to confirm the diagnosis in some patients earlier" and to counsel patients on the risks of their children having the disease, said Dr Tan Eng King.<br>.<br>Meanwhile, a three-day international symposium on the disease will be held here in October. It will include workshops on rehabilitation therapy and nursing.<br>Gracia Chiang<br>gracia@mediacorp.com.sg</div>
