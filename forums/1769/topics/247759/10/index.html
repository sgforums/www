But the drugs problems might be a worry these days.<br><br>You know it's funny to know Australian parents do not know how to mix hot water from the kettle for bathing their babies.  A few years ago,  when there was a big explosion at the oil field, we had limited gas supply so people with gas hot water heater had to boil water with electric kettle for taking shower and bathing their kids.  Guess what, there were many kids got scalded by hot water during that short period and suddenly there were many warnings for parents to check the temperature of the water before putting the kids in.  Ha ha...<br><br>Thanks for the offer to babysit our kids.  I will remember that for sure!!!  Mild-mannered parents???  Hee hee....  perhaps you should say parent.  Hubby is mild mannered, I am definitely not.
