              <p>There is a difference between compromising and bending over backwards.  Compromise is positive.  Bending over backwards isn't and it can mean betraying yourself and the values you hold dear, just to make someone happy, and that is something you can do temporarily, but not permanently, because it is just not you.</p>
              <p>For instance, I have no interest whatsoever in Cricket and if I force myself to like Cricket and immerse myself in Cricket and suddenly become some sorta Cricket fanatic just to please a boyfriend, then that's bending over backwards and it's a bit too contrived, and probably will not last. </p>
              <p>That is my interpretation of "bending over backwards".</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>that's the thing - at first I could not tell the difference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i.e. taking the cricket example - i have no interest in cricket.. and I would DEFINITELY not bend over to just please a boyfriend or a husband.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I guess compromise means, if he really wants to go to a game, I would accompany him if he wants me to. But initially I would refuse to do even such things that cos I held on to my independence a lot. I enjoy doing things on my own and found it hard to see why he needs company to do some things I don't like to do.</p>

              <p>Some factors you can't overcome.</p>
              <p>Mom told me something at the start of this year that kinda spooked me.  She refused to give me details, but when I told her that this year seems to be much smoother for me and that the past few years had been utterly suay, she said, "Yeah, I know.  I was also told that you will undergo a horrible time the past few years but that this year will be the start of great changes." I was a bit shocked!!  I pressed her for details, and she said that she had gone to 'someone' to have my fortune told.  I think the fortune teller must have told her to go easy on me too because I would have been shouldering a burden that's hard to bear and I could have been easily pushed over the limit, so no wonder, for the past two years or so, she had been extremely gentle with me, unlike her usual style. </p>
              <p>Thing is, she never told me all this until it had all passed.  Unknowingly, to some extent, our future may already have been charted. </p>
              <p>I think unless one is an atheist, it's hard to believe that everything in the future lies in our hands alone.</p>
