              <p><br> That's because women in the first world know there is more to life

              <p>Precisely!!</p>
              <p>Some folks say not having kids is selfish.  But having kids can be selfish, esp if you look at people's reasons for having kids.</p>
              <p>- Because it's a natural thing to do after marriage , ie.  marriage life is getting boring and we needed a distraction or to 'move on' to the next stage;</p>
              <p>- Because we want a family, WHY?  Because we are afraid of growing old and alone with no kids to support us;</p>
              <p>- Because I love kids.  Therefore I want kids because it satisfies my love of kids and makes me happy; etc etc</p>
              <p>All are selfish reasons.  Real lovers of kids are those who will still choose to have kids despite not reaping ANY benefits from the whole exercise. </p>
              <p>Reminds me of this article in last Sunday's papers that said that a study has exposed dog lovers to be selfish people because they keep dogs basically to satisfy their own needs and wants and that true dog lovers are those who will pick up dogs in distress off the streets, or select the uglier abandoned dogs, etc just because they love dogs, period.  </p>

              <p>Some factors you can't overcome.</p>
              <p>Mom told me something at the start of this year that kinda
              spooked me.  She refused to give me details, but when I told
              her that this year seems to be much smoother for me and that the
              past few years had been utterly suay, she said, "Yeah, I
              know.  I was also told that you will undergo a horrible time
              the past few years but that this year will be the start of great
              changes." I was a bit shocked!!  I pressed her for details,
              and she said that she had gone to 'someone' to have my fortune
              told.  I think the fortune teller must have told her to go
              easy on me too because I would have been shouldering a burden
              that's hard to bear and I could have been easily pushed over the
              limit, so no wonder, for the past two years or so, she had been
              extremely gentle with me, unlike her usual style. </p>
              <p>Thing is, she never told me all this until it had all
              passed.  Unknowingly, to some extent, our future may already
              have been charted. </p>
              <p>I think unless one is an atheist, it's hard to believe that
              everything in the future lies in our hands alone.</p>

              <p>yes, maybe our futures are...charted... as in.. like maybe if u stopped schooling at say, N levels, maybe u r gonna be stuck in jobs like sales, retail, admin, etc.</p>
              <p>But the CHOICE of taking our lives in own hands is still with us. An example would be as in the above, but then taking a course and getting higher paid jobs or entering into businesses and hope it takes off.</p>

              <p>i.e. taking the cricket example - i have no interest in

              <p>But I guess compromise means, if he really wants to go to a
              game, I would accompany him if he wants me to. But initially I
              would refuse to do even such things that cos I held on to my
              independence a lot. I enjoy doing things on my own and found it
              hard to see why he needs company to do some things I don't like to

              <p>Hehehe!  I guess it was just us interpreting the term 'bend over backwards' differently.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>I think if God forbid, my next boyfriend suay suay happens to love cricket, then bo bian, I will ask him questions about it, and try not to fall asleep and have my infamous micro-sleep sessions when he's droning on and on about it.</p>
              <p>But I will stop at attending the dreadfully boring games for every match, just to make him happy.  I'd rather he go with his Cricket-loving pals and give me some time off alone to do my girly stuff!  Hehe! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or, imagine this - I'm always criticising the loud, noisy and uncouth Greeks.  To bend over backwards would be to have a Greek boyfriend, pretend I am ok with the loud, noisy and uncouth company, and then sooner or later, my true self will surface again and I will start throwing freak-out tantrums over all the bloody noise, drama and gossips!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You know what, given the inflation rate these days, it WILL be a miracle if you don't have to bail your kids out somehow by giving them a headstart in life with some financial help.</p>
              <p>Most of the Singaporeans I know who own property here, after you know them well enough to ask how they managed to do it, will somehow tell you that their parents got involved.  It was either a gift / a loan / joint investment from their parents.  I think so far, I only know of one who really did it all single-handedly. </p>
              <p>Too bad my parents aren't wealthy enough to give me that kind of aid.  I really wouldn't mind, esp when you see good opportunities coming right up your alley but you still need to save for another 8-10 years for the downpayment, and by then, the prices would have gone even steeper. </p>
              <p>I do want to grow old with someone, to laugh together, to walk together holding hands, to plan for our future and for our financial security together, and to work together and hopefully retire early together.  Asset Management.  Children are a huge deficit and unless I can be certain that I can have kids and still retire comfortably in a lovely retirement village here without having to rely on the kids for a single cent, I don't think I'd feel secure enough to have kids.</p>
              <p>Think about it, our kids will find it  harder to make a living when they've grown-up.  It's going to be hard enough for them to support themselves, don't impose your retirement costs and healthcare costs on them.  That's selfish... burdening your own kids as if they are your creatures of burden, your 'insurance'.</p>
