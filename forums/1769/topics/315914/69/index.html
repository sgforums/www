              <p><strong>Finding Next PM Overdue, So Country to Be Fined</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Wednesday, May 07, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=43&amp;author=">Politics</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=43"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-politics.gif" border="0" alt="Politics" align="right"></a><br><em>by K.K. Cheow</em><br><br> After the Prime Minister said finding his successor was ‘overdue’, the Gahmen has decided to fine the country.<br><br>“This
              is just standard library practice when things are overdue,” said Prime
              Minister’s Orifice spokesman Cheng Hu Kong. “You kena fine.”<br> <br> “We think a fine of $1 million per Minister per year should be a
              reasonable penalty,” Mr. Cheng added. “That should give you all the
              incentive to faster find people to take over us.”<br> <br> He explained that the amount of the fine was necessary to compensate
              existing Ministers for the opportunity cost of retiring to the private
              sector where they might find lucrative employment as directors of
              corporate boards by virtue of being, um, ex-Ministers.<br> <br> Mr. Cheng said that the National Library would be arro… sorry, sorry, <em>tasked</em> with the, um, task of collecting the fines from the citizens, as they had the necessary infrastructure.<br> <br> Mr. Cheng also set out some criteria for finding the future Cabinet:<br> <br> 1.	The current Prime Minister will be retained as Senior Minister<br> <br> 2.	The current Senior Minister will be retained as the Minister Mentor<br> <br> 3.	The current Minister Mentor (and/or his clone) will be retained as whatever he wants to be named<br> <br> 4. Candidates need not be perfect human beings – it’s okay if, for
              example, the organization they run has made even major mistakes, such
              as, oh, letting a terrorist escape from a toilet, as long as in the
              grand scheme of things, they’ve done a good job such as, just saying
              only lah, training their CCTV cameras on opposition politicians<br> <br> 5.	Looking good in white is a plus<br> <br> 6. Should have the right attitude – for example, should be firm about
              why rich people such as them deserve higher and higher salaries, but
              not enthusiastic about giving money to the poor in case they get an
              “entitlement mentality” <br> <br> 7.	Able to dance hip-hop and other demonstrable abilities to connect with the “youth” are preferred<br> <br> 8. Don’t even think of nominating that Dr. Chee Don Juan or Mr. Johor
              Baru Jeyaretnam. I said don’t. Wait you kena slap by the future Senior
              Minister then you know.</p>

              <p><strong>Gahmen Suspected of Steroid Use</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Tuesday, May 06, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=31&amp;author=">Sports</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=31"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-sports.gif" border="0" alt="Sports" align="right"></a><br><em>by Kway Bangket</em><br><br> Just as it was announced that a medal-winning Singaporean bodybuilder
              was suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs, rumours have
              surfaced that Gahmen Ministers may have used unnatural means to pump up
              their salaries.<br><br>“You know, at first I thought their pay was so
              tua liap because they just worked very hard at it,” said Mrs Anna
              Boh-Leck, chair of the Singapore Unsporting Council. “But you have to
              ask yourself: how can the rulers of one of the world’s smallest
              countries have the world’s largest governmental salary? It’s not
              natural!”<br> <br> The Council is now conducting investigations, but the Ministry of
              Monetary Development has issued a statement saying that consuming
              performance-enhancing pay is not illegal in Singapore.<br> <br> Said Ministry spokesman Chia Koh Yoke, “We need to remain competitive,
              and being Singaporean, we’re at a disadvantage, so taking
              performance-enhancing pay enables us to level the playing field.” <br> <br> However, the Council says that steroidal salaries may have adverse
              health benefits. “It is well known that steroid-use can have side
              effects like causing brain cancer, lowering testosterone and causing
              suicide,” said Mrs Boh-Leck.<br> <br> Mr. Chia, however, rejected this. “Our own tests show that those
              consuming giant-size salaries are very healthy. Conversely, regular
              citizens who do not, actually suffer the side effects – they are brain
              dead, they have no balls and their suicide rate is high. The
              correlation is clear.”</p>

              <p><strong>PARENTING PREPARATION EXERCISE!</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Thursday, May 08, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=47&amp;author=">We, The Citizens</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=47"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-wecitizens.gif" border="0" alt="We, The Citizens" align="right"></a><br><em>by Pak Cham Kai</em><br><br> So last week, the State’s Times reported a survey showing that thanks
              to the Gahmen's policies (what else?) more young Singaporeans now want
              to get married and have chewren. But do you really know what you’re in
              for? Try our <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=2557">PARENTING PREPARATION EXERCISE</a> – it’s as close to the real thing as we can simulate!<br> <br> <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=2557"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/parentprep.jpg" alt=""></a><br> <br><br><strong>Mess Exercise</strong> - Smear peanut butter all over your sofa
              and curtains. Place a fishball under your sofa cushion and leave it
              there for 3 months.<br> <br> <strong>Toy Exercise</strong> - Buy a giant box of Lego. (Thumbtacks also can.)
              Ask your friend to spread them all over the floor of your flat.
              Simulate the middle of the night by putting on a blindfold and trying
              to walk to your toilet or kitchen. When you step on a Lego or
              thumbtack, do not scream because this would wake your child up at night.<br> <br> <strong>Supermarket Exercise</strong> - Go to Hay Dairies in Lim Chu Kang and
              borrow two of their goats. Take them with you to your supermarket to do
              your groceries. Always keep them in sight, and pay for anything they
              eat or damage.<br> <br> <strong>Dressing Exercise</strong> - Buy one very big, very buay song live octopus. Try to stuff it into a small net bag and make sure all its arms stay inside.<br> <br> <strong>Feeding Exercise</strong> - Get a large plastic bottle. Fill it halfway
              with water. Suspend the bottle from the ceiling with a bungee cord.
              Separately, make a bowl of Quaker Oats by adding warm milk to the dry
              oats. Start to swing the jug. As it swings, try to insert as many
              spoonfuls of the soggy oats as you can into the mouth of the bottle. As
              you do, make sounds like “um-um-um” or pretend to be an aeroplane.
              After a while, just dump the contents of the bottle onto the floor.<br> <br> <strong>Night-Time Exercise</strong> - Fill a small cloth bag with 5 kg of sand.
              Soak it completely in water. At 3 pm, pick up the bag and stand up,
              swaying gently back and forth while humming songs. Keep doing this till
              8 pm. Put down the bag, and set your alarm clock for 9 pm, then try to
              sleep. At 9 pm, wake up, pick up the bag again and resume swaying and
              humming every song you’ve ever known. If you run out of songs, make
              some up. Continue till 5 am. Take a nap, and set alarm clock for 6 am.
              At 6 am, wake up and make breakfast. Keep this up for 5 years. Look
              happy.<br> <br> <strong>Car Exercise</strong> - Forget the BMW and buy a MPV. Buy a cone of ice
              cream and put it in your dashboard compartment. Leave it there. Take a
              twenty cent coin. Stick it into your CD player. Buy a big packet of
              cookies. Mash them into your back seat. Take your car keys and run them
              along both sides of your car. There! Just like the real thing!<br> <br> <strong>Mother's Body Exercise</strong> - Buy a large bean bag chair. Attach it to the front of your clothes for 9 months. After that, remove 6 beans.<br> <br> <strong>Financial Exercise</strong> - Go to the nearest NTUC. Go to the cashier
              and give her your wallet, telling her to help herself. Now go to your
              bank and arrange for your pay to be GIRO’d directly to NTUC from now
              on. Go to the mama stall and buy a newspaper. Go home and read it
              quietly for the last time.<br> <br> <strong>Sanity Exercise</strong> - Make sure your TV can only switch to
              children’s channels. Throw out all your DVDs and buy only the Best of
              the Wiggles, Barney, Dora the Explorer, etc. Check in every few weeks
              with your psychiatrist to see if your IQ is still normal.<br> <br> <strong>Final Exercise</strong> - Find a couple who already have a young child.
              Lecture them on how they can improve their tolerance lah, discipline
              lah, toilet training lah, patience lah, the child’s table manners lah,
              the kid’s PSLE results lah, etc. Tell them how the kindergarten they
              enrolled their kid in is just not good enough, and they must enroll in
              all sorts of extra classes like Music &amp; Drama, Speech, and donno
              what else. Emphasise to them that they must never, ever allow their
              kids to stray onto the wrong path or their future will be fucked
              forever. Enjoy this experience while it lasts. Because when you have
              your own kid, it’ll happen to you.</p>
