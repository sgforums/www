              <p>that's the general trend now .... even sgforums uses the same model ... pay per click can be too expensive for the advertisers ....</p>
              <p>my advice ... looking at the success and failures of my few clients in the short time since I started this thingy, I'd say you must be prepared to pump in the money when it comes to ecommerce... you do get what you pay for, from the website design to the payment gateway ... I mean, just look at <em>marketplace, </em>every few days someone comes along and tells the whole world about their blogs selling clothes and fashion .... it's another bubble tea run isn't it ? ....</p>
              <p>but i do have a client who's clocking up &gt;$10000 in the past two month selling stuff in a very specialized niche market (damm ! ... I should have charged him a lot more !)</p>
              <p>as for making money from ads ... don't even think of it now ... be prepared to lose money .... if it's a directory, forget it ... i've known sgmall if you're thinking of implementing your rich-dad-poor-dad theories by doing something like this, I think you'd be better off learning about forex futures and automated trading systems .....</p>

              <p>well ... hey ! I just clinched a deal with an educational
              start-up just on monday .... their game plan is interesting, they
              tender for enrichment courses and CCA activities through the MOE
              for schools ...</p>
              <p>this may be something you can look at ... with your science
              background there's lots of money to be made, cos most times,
              massive amounts of edusave money gets snowballed into the student's
              eventual CPF ...</p>
              <p>I have no doubt that the ourmall chap's making some spare cash
              ... but I'd imagine you'd want better returns for your time and
              effort right ? ... seriously, since you're a math whiz ... go learn
              about forex futures and financial modeling and automated trading
              systems .... I have more than one friend who's doing this full time
              ... and one chap's so good at it he's driving a convertible a year
              after graduation ... makes me wonder what the F I'm slogging my ass
              off for ....</p>

              <p>I will take your advice for the financial modeling thing, seriously...  Already planning to learn all these actually....</p>
              <p>the educational start up plan, my fren told me of such an idea about a year ago... not bad... my website is more of for my gf to use cuz she's a teacher, and have a hell of a time finding resources to capture students' interest... but then, I think other teachers might find it useful too, so I can expect high traffic from within Singapore if I do it correctly and interesting enough so that students will want to come back to learn...</p>
