              <p>It may have scientific truth to it afterall, because our body needs lipids (fat) to coat the membranes of the cells in our brains that conduct impulses and send messages. </p>

              <p>Actually, I was giving my ECG notes a quick glance-through and I remembered yet another health myth perpetuated by movies and TV shows.  When someone flatlines, you see in the movies and TV series that the crash cart will be wheeled in and defibrillation will be started.  (Defib = using the special paddles to send electricity into the body to 'shock' the heart, and hopefully get it to revert back to its normal beat). </p>
              <p>That is such a huge,  huge myth!  In reality, if a person flatlines, you don't shock the person, instead,  you commence CPR.  If you shock a person when he/she flatlines, all you're doing is 'fry' the heart by electrocuting it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>There are only TWO waveforms that warrant a defib - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF).  But I guess for dramatic effect, the flatline is more dramatic!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Well, detox diets probably won't do you a lot of harm..... but they won't do you a lot of good, either.</p>
              <p>I've read about the detox diets of some people.... all they eat for 3-4 days straight are fruits and those overpriced 'detox teas' costing $60-$70. End of story. And then at the end of it all, they proclaim that they feel 'cleaner' and point to their weight loss as proof of the efficacy of detox diets.</p>
              <p>I dare say that their 'clean' feeling is just a placebo effect.... and the weight loss was mainly water loss coupled with some fat and muscle loss due to the lack of intake of protein and complex carbs during the detox session.</p>
              <p>So what do you lose during detox diets? Maybe about $60-$70 for those detox teas.</p>

              <p>Those are special automatic defibrillators.  Malls and public places in the US have them too. </p>
              <p>The machine is fully automatic and all you need to do is place the two pads on a person's chest the way it's shown in the diagram on the machine, and then the machine will automatically interpret the ECG waveforms and there's a mechanical voice announcing what's happening, and giving you instructions on what to do next.  If there's a need to defib, the machine automatically does it at the right time.  You barely have to be trained to use it, really!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Did you know that if you try to defib a person during the wrong time, you'll either :</p>
              <p>- get no response because the electrical charge had been given at the moment when the heart's having its own electrical impulse so it's obliterated; or</p>
              <p>- inadvertently send someone into Ventricular Fibrillation, which means, your electrical charge was given when the heart muscles are repolarising (relaxing), and the wrongly-timed electrical charge triggers the bottom half of the heart into some sort of abnormal spasm!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>The whole process is a lot more complicated than what you watch on TV!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Well, detox diets probably won't do you a lot of harm..... but
              they won't do you a lot of good, either.</p>
              <p>I've read about the detox diets of some people.... all they eat
              for 3-4 days straight are fruits and those overpriced 'detox teas'
              costing $60-$70. End of story. And then at the end of it all, they
              proclaim that they feel 'cleaner' and point to their weight loss as
              proof of the efficacy of detox diets.</p>
              <p>I dare say that their 'clean' feeling is just a placebo
              effect.... and the weight loss was mainly water loss coupled with
              some fat and muscle loss due to the lack of intake of protein and
              complex carbs during the detox session.</p>
              <p>So what do you lose during detox diets? Maybe about $60-$70 for
              those detox teas.</p>

              <p><em>There's no scientific backing for this oft-cited rule, which has
                                      seen the water bottle become a ubiquitous accessory.  It's
                                      such a popular myth it was endorsed by Kidney Health Australia
                                      (KHA), until it reviewed the policy about five  years ago and
                                      discovered a "distinct lack of evidence.</em></p>
              <p><em>The origin of </em><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"8X8" - eight glasses of eight ounces (240mls)</strong></span> -
                                      is unclear, although a potential suspect is a 1974 book by American
                                      nutritionist, Dr Frederick J Stare.</em></p>
              <p><em>KHA Medical Director, Dr Tim Mathew, says the best rule is drink
                                      when you're thirsty, and choose water.  You can use the colour
                                      of your urine as a guide - pale amber is good, darker means you're
                                      dehydrated.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Point No. 1 : It doesn't say to NOT drink water.  All it says is, it's not necessary, not die-die MUST drink EIGHT GLASSES, ie works out to a total of 1,920 litres!  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">An individual's need for water varies, and there are some medical conditions where fluid restrictions have to be imposed and it therefore becomes detrimental to drink 1,920 L a day.  We do have to drink water, just not 1,920 L of it. </span></p>

              <p><em>Despite widespread use of the vitamin for this purpose, a
                                      Cochrane Review this year concluded that there's not much
                                      point.</em></p>
              <p><em>The results of 30 trials showed that <span style="color: #ff0000;">taking Vitamin C
                                      supplements (orally 0.2g+) makes almost no difference to whether
                                      you get a cold</span>, unless you're doing extreme exercise and / or in
                                      very cold temperatures (marathon runners, skiers, soldiers on
                                      sub-arctic exercises).</em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Taking Vitamin C before the cold can cut its duration, <strong>but after
                                      you have symptoms it makes no significant difference</strong>.</span> 
                                      Severity isn't affected.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">And that's true, because taking Vitamin C regularly doesn't mean that you will NEVER catch a cold ever.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">And also, if you have already caught a cold, remember that it CAN help you recover faster, but it will not be able to reverse the situation.  It just augments the recovery process, but isn't a miracle cure. </span></p>
