            <div class='col-md body'>Location: Parisssss Takashimaya<br>Meal Time: Lunch<br>Price: uh.. around $35 after all the +++<br>Rating:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>- - - - - - ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Have heard quite a bit about this place and thought I would give it a try today lunchtime. Unfortunately..HumHum~ How to say? There were a lot of people there, they look like they are enjoying themselves - But I was left discontented.<br><br>Why? I guess it is due to the quality of the dishes and personal preferences. There sure was a lot of 'quality' items - big fat oysters, goose liver pate, king crabs, sharks fin if you eat it, stuff like that. However, the quality was compromised in.. small quirky ways that I guess the general public wouldn't mind but left in me a general feeling of unidentifiable discontent.<br><br><strong>For example- in terms of quality... </strong><br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The King Crab claw</span> was ... a bit 'lao hong'. The shell for some reason became soggy.<br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The spanner Crab </span>got a bit funny smell.<br>- The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sashimi</span> was a bit not cold enough.<br>- A lot of the dishes were a bit not hot enough.<br>- The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">roast beef </span>a bit too raw.<br>- The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">'onion rings'</span> were not 'onion rings'<br>- The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">turmeric rice</span> was soggy and sticky and not using bismati rice.<br>- The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">handroll sashimi</span> used china seaweed instead of the crispy japanese one. So when you BITE it.. it just doesnt tear off. Even if you bite it real hard. Plus it does not have the slightly salty sweet taste of japanese sea weed.<br>- Most of the dishes were slighty too salty.. except the stir fry vege.. which was... not salty enough.<br><br>See? It's all.. a bit a bit.. but add together... can be quite depressing.<br><br>Sigh.. i could go on as for <strong>personal preferences in terms of VARIETY</strong>... I suspect it is a ploy to keep you interested enough to eat more.. cos..<br>- No <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Icecream.</span> All some obscure flavours.<br>- Toppings were some green and yellow Passion Fruit Sauce or watever. I just want my Chocolate Fudge but don't have. Dont have peanut topping or chocolate rice or watever. So in the end I didnt eat ice cream<br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Fondue</span> ... had... GUAVA and tomato?! No bananas. No strawberries. And because dont have peanuts topping, I can't cover my chocolate covered marshmallows with peanuts anyway. Bah.<br>- The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fish head curry</span> has no brinjal only lady's fingers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>- No fried Chicken Wing. How come? Why buffet don't have fried chicken wing one?<br><strong><br>What IS GOOD</strong><br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oysters</span> were big and fat and fresh<br>- Provided <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ritz crackers</span> with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pate.</span><br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shisamo</span> Is Nice<br>- Has obscure Soup. Like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">australian Crocodile Soup.</span> Though from what I understood.. usually Australian is Alligator. Humm.<br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Black Pepper Crab</span> pretty nice<br>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lobster Salad, </span>though didn't taste any lobster, was nice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>AMBIENCE<br>is nice if you like those ostentious pretentious sort of plaster pillars and crystal chandelier type of thingy.. I mean, at least they put in the effort to make it look nice...<br><br>But try not to sit where they stick their posters on the glass (where we were seated) cos people come and gawk at the posters, and u feel like they are all looking at you.<br><br>MUSIC was.... inappropriate. I mean.. it is singular depressing to eat when STORIES is playing.. "now i'm standing here... no one to wipe away my tears... " sobs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Pariss Main Restaurant at Marina Square is better, i like the ambience there especially the window view area overlooking the sea. Don't like the one at Takashimaya. However i got to comment also, the standard dropped alot, when they first started, its quite nice, service good also except for the lousy english speaking staffs. The boss lady is very friendly, i like to chat with her. Used to frequent there often previously but stopped for quite awhile. Recently i went there with my client, food not that nice, as your review Seafood kinda small in size not that fresh all that. The manager on duty still remember me, she asked me why i never patronise for so long, i told her i am quite busy, seldom in that area, anyway gave her my comments about the food. My client not so contented with the food, i kinda feel bad about it.</span></strong><br><br></div>

If my wife weren't around, she would have no wife to point to, so no question lor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Anyway, some of these foreign talents nowadays are very aggressive and daring.<br><br>Other places for buffet for cheapos like me.....<br><br>- Marina South Korean BBQ (open air) at S$12 per pax.<br>- Paramount Hotel coffee house (3rd or 4th floor) at S$18+++ per pax.<br>- Sizzler at Suntec City basement (healthy) at S$16++ per pax.<br><br>Since you guys are going to JB, I would advise you against have buffet there.  They're cheaper, but its really a case of "you get what you pay for".<br><br>In JB, try the seafood like at New Lucky Restaurant at da ma (big horse), just at the diagonally opposite the junction Crystal Crown hotel (look out for the neon signs about 50 m from the junction).  I used to frequent there.  There is also a big hawker centre in that area, open from evening onwards, with lots of good Chinese zhu zhar and Malay food.  Satay at RM 0.40 per stick.  Personal security wise, just be a little more alert in that area at night, but its generally safe lah.<br><br>There are some hairdressers around the hawker centre area too, situated in shop houses by the roadside.  If you're bored with the others <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and have an hour to spare, just walk into any of them for some great "head sex".  For less than RM 20, they'll wash your hair, then massage your head, neck and shoulders for maybe 15-20 minutes or so, then blow dry (your hair), etc.  They're all unisex, open to both men and women.<br><br>I haven't patronised those places for quite some time because I'm balding and so have to avoid others scratching my head too much.<br><br>For the lazy ones who haven't cleaned their ears in a while, at these hairdressers', you can also opt for the dig-ear service, pedicure, manicure, etc....at additional few RM.  They're usually quite friendly (even without courtesy and GST campaigns) and you can ask away without obligations, chit-chat with them, etc.  Service is not hurried at all.  Doesn't even feel commercialised.  But they speak only Malay, Mandarin and Cantonese.<br><br>Two of these hairdressers' in that area have massage rooms also - service is decent-type only, quite cheap and not too bad.  But they're not professional and don't change the sheets, etc.  Its also open concept, so other customers can see you through the glass panel (and if you're lucky/unlucky, maybe some customers will call your number <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).<br><br>Oh, just after the Malaysian customs, there is the City Square area.  Avoid that area at all costs.  Its either sleazy or expensive.  There is a Food Junction food court there which is even more expensive than Singapore's.<br><br>Actually, if you can, skip JB and go right deep in lah.  Skudai, Tebrau, Plentong, Permas Jaya, etc.  Those areas are nice for grocery and other types of shopping, with big hypermarts of Giant, Carrefour, Jusco, Makro, etc.  The newly opened Jusco City at Tebrau is a fantastic shopping centre.<br><br>For Milo lovers, I heard that our local Milo prices increased a lot recently (I don't drink it, so I don't know).  You'll be happy to know that Milo there is much cheaper.  But please remember not to buy their sugar to accompany your Milo.  Sugar is sweet, legal consequences are not.<br><br></div>

The boss lady is very friendly, i like to chat with her. Used to frequent there often previously but stopped for quite awhile. Recently i went there with my client, food not that nice, as your review Seafood kinda small in size not that fresh all that. The manager on duty still remember me, she asked me why i never patronise for so long, i told her i am quite busy, seldom in that area, anyway gave her my comments about the food.
