It could be a few 00's to a few 000's.<br><br>engagement ring, IMHO no need to be very expensive as it only last for a few months or a few years, before replaced by the wedding ring.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>It is the thought, the feeling and the love that counts at the end.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The wedding ring is important for its symbolism of never-ending love and also to signal to the world that you've chosen to commit the rest of your life with a partner already.<br><br>A wedding ring used to be a sort of 'hands off!' signal to singles who might otherwise try to hit on the ringed person but these days in our sad, perverse society, there are folks who view the ringed ones as 'a challenge'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I don't think we should place a minimum monetary value on the wedding ring as such.  To be honest, I kinda feel repulsed when I see ladies showing off their wedding rings, talking about carats and how many K gold and all that because hey, what really matters is not the ring per se or how much it costs or how large and brilliant the diamond but rather, it's the fact that someone loves you and you love someone back and you're both going to build a life together.<br><br>I guess if the couple is well-off and can afford a nice ring that sets them back by a few thousand, well and good.  If the couple is struggling financially, a simple wedding band will suffice.<br><br>If I had a few thousand, I'd rather spend it on a nice honeymoon.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   Memories are afterall, everlasting too!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

(ala, in-laws), i stick by the logic of, bringing my wife (future) to places around the world with the money..... the experience is priceless compared to a few pieces of metal, or 100 tables of wedding.<br><br>besides, it also gives my wife bragging rights that i brought her around the world over 10 countries.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>thats sufficient enough to cover a mediocal wedding dinner + cake + rings..etc.</div>
