            <div class='col-md body'>There are stereotypes everywhere  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Like what my American friend once said,"We like to think of Chinese as an Asian who pronouces 'Fried Rice' as Fried Lice' and you Asians like to think of us Americans as white trash living out of a trailer."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway we were talking about 'chinks' and 'red necks' so it kinda lead to that.<br><br>People stereotype because it is easy to assume. For example, going out with Kan_i and his wife is funny coz they are chinese but can't speak chinese and everyone in Singapore wants to speak to them in chinese  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And not all Singaporeans and Malaysians can speak and understand Chinese well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  SO told me one funny incident where he had to talk to this Beijing customer about the repairs they want them to work on. I was like "..... You have no Chinese colleagues in your team?" He said yes there are but they don't understand the PRC's heavy Beijing accent and couldn't make out what he was saying. Anyway my SO said the PRC could not help staring at him throughout the whole meeting especially when my SO spoke to him in fluent mandarin  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
