Please let us know what it might be, or where we might be able to locate it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><strong>just because you like guns.. remember.. your friend's friend may be your worst enemy..</strong></blockquote>Okay.... and how does this relate to the topic at hand?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><blockquote><strong>why do you think waiting periods for guns have been watered down to heck by politicians?</strong></blockquote><br>Waiting periods have, on the whole, gone down (although in some states like Califorinia, New Jersey and Maryland, increasingly strict gun laws have actually <span style="font-style: italic;">increased</span> the waiting period), but this is due less to political pressure, than to the introduction of the computerized NICS system (mentioned in my previous reply) which is able to perform the required criminal background checks in a shorter period of time.<br><br><blockquote><strong>why do you think there are videoclips of people going fully auto in oklahoma with 0.50 machineguns?</strong></blockquote><br>Um, probably because <strong>it is completely legal</strong>, and the owners of the full-auto 50-cal. guns are licensed 'Class 3' firearms dealers who have paid the necessary taxes, duties and fees to the BATFE for the privilege of being able to own and shoot such guns.<br><br><blockquote><strong>where do you think weapons which should only be in the armory of the armed forces come from?</strong></blockquote><br>Not sure what you mean with this question, but I'd answer that they come from firearms manufacturers.<br><br><blockquote><strong>the right to bear arms.. has always been a contentious issue... the spirit of the right to bear arms was to make sure the government of the United States do not oppress the people.. so that the responsible citizens can take on the government if there was oppression...</strong></blockquote><br>BINGO!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><strong>however, maniacs who horde weapons.. (there was a maniac who had half a million rounds of ammo, things including 0.50 machineguns.. and a CYANIDE BOMB which detonated, will kill everyone within a radius of a few blocks).. are they covered by that right to bear arms?</strong></blockquote><br>Okay, now you're clouding the issue.<br><br>How is a <strong>cyanide bomb</strong>, if it existed, related to the issue of gun control? It would presumably be an explosive device that would not be covered by any gun legislation, although the BATFE would certainly take a keen interest in it. If such a bomb could be made, anyone, <strong>including those who don't own firearms</strong>, could conceivably make one, yes?<br><br>And there is NO FEDERAL LAW limiting how much ammunition a person can keep in his domicile, although some states (not including Minnesota) have city ordnances and fire codes that limit how much you can store in a residential unit.<br><br>And, aside from the possible fire risks, why would storing large amounts of ammunition be bad? Professional competitive shooters regularly go through thousands of rounds a week in practice and tournaments, and it is not unusual for them to have literally tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition stockpiled in their homes.<br><br><blockquote><strong>look at them.. anywhere else, these people would be called the lunatic fringe..</strong></blockquote><br>They might be called that, but if they are not breaking any laws or putting other people in danger, <strong>they are completely within their rights to do so.</strong><br><br><blockquote><strong>however, if you see Charlton Heston waving a huge rifle, in a meeting of the NRA which condemned everything about gun control, and in the meeting, you have people with high-velocity assault rifles, demanding that the authorities scrap EVERY SINGLE legislation put in place for gun control, you will know different...</strong></blockquote><br>Lemme guess: you got that scene from Michael Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine,' right?<br><br>Then <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> analysis of that movie might enlighten you.<br><br><blockquote><strong>don't let your love of guns cloud you on this issue...</strong></blockquote><br>Actually, being a firearms owner has done something positive: it has opened my eyes to the double-standards, hypocrisy and outright lies pepetrated by the popular media to demonize gun owners, particularly those in this country. Before you fall hook, line and sinker for their propaganda, consider this: according to the 1997 study by the USDOJ, there were 192 million firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens in this country (study results <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/165476.txt" rel="nofollow">here</a>). This number has obviously gone up in recent years. If we are to believe what the media say about the gun culture in this country, the streets should by now be awash in the blood of the victims of gun violence. Well, guess what? IT ISN'T! All of the gun violence you see on TV and read in the magazines and papers have intentionally been sensationalized to do one thing: sell more media. There is gun violence in this country, but it is very isolated and usually concentrated in the poorer neighbourhoods. It's a sad fact, but the accurate reporting of news in this country takes a back seat to profitability.<br><br><blockquote><strong>this is a big issue in the US... unfortunately, the GOP is in the pocket of Big Oil, Big Corporation, and the NRA..<br></strong></blockquote>The GOP is currently not exactly endearing itself to most of the electorate here, but this has more to do with its currently Midest policy than any influence by the NRA.<br><br>MG</div>
