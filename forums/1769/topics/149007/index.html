I checked the entire area around my house, no sign of him or accidents etc. My guess is, he ran away.... for reasons known only to himself.<br><br>Soon after, I hear stories of a couple of friends' cats running away in this few weeks. Just wondering if .... anyone's cats also ran away in the last few weeks?<br><br>I mean, its either these cats are 'tuning in' to something.

            <div class='col-md body'>Is yours a male cat? How old is it?<br><br>If it's a young cat (&lt; 1yr), it's possible that it got lost and didn't know the way home. Male adult cats also have a tendency to roam about - an instinct to mark and conquer more territory, even to the extent of leaving a regular food source. However, it may one day return and turn up at your door again. It's happened before.<br><br>You can try checking with SPCA, the classifieds or local cat websites/ forums to see if anyone has found your cat.</div>

When me or my dad comes home, he will run to greet us. I had him since he was a little kitten. But he's wilful. I dont know, maybe he just wants to see the world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>or he could have been picked up by AVA or National envo??call them up to check. sometimes when other people complain about cats hanging around and dirtying void decks, national envo just send some workers to relocate the cats somewhere else. happens alot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh no! If AVA or Town Councils picks the cats up, sorry man, forget about "relocating elsewhere". It means they would be held at Pasir Panjang for 3 days, and if no one claims them, bye bye cats!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  This has been a long-standing issue btn carers of stray cats/cat welfare groups and the gahmen bodies which keep changing the rules to suit themselves...but that's another story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm I already informed AVA. they were very helpful told me if they get a cat with my cat's description they will call me. Also left his details with SPCA.<br><br>Sigh.. I can't help but feel he has chosen to go on an adventure. He's always been this wilful little self.<br><br>He isn't those friendly manja cats that my neighbours will pick up inadvertently. He doesn't like strangers, and isn't friendly at all. Unless he knows you real well.... and.. well.. I've had him since he was a kitten.<br><br>He started off giving me companionship... then.. he became my muse.. my inspiration... like they say abt cats... you hold the wilderness in your hands when you have a cat in your hands. I ... miss him so much. I dont really want to think about it... cos.. u know he's a cat. not a dog. u can't FORCE a cat to come back to you or anything.<br><br>and .. i .. somehow have a feeling he doesn't want to come back. Cos... see.. I just got married. I moved away and my house isn't fixed properly yet. No grills and all.. so not safe for him... but I make sure I return home at least once during weekdays, and over the weekends. He doesn't seem to be much affected cos he is close to my dad too. but... ... anyway i try to communicate with him 'mentally' u know. mebbe send out messages. cats are so smart. maybe he can feel me missing him somewhere and come home eventually. Heartache. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Oh Well.<br><br></div>
