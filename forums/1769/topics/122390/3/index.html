            <div class='col-md body'>Well, these days, the customer loves to act like they're slavemasters because they know that all they have to do is to threaten to complain and then everything will be done their way and no expense will be spared to please them.  They love to twist the arms of service personnel to get what they want.<br><br>To make it worse, I'm NOT a service personnel!  I'm a healthcare professional!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  I attend to patients according to medical and nursing priorities but nowadays, it seems like whoever complaints the loudest gets tended to the fastest!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>The latest 'trend' is for patients and their families to smile and say their thanks and goodbye's upon discharge, and then slap us with some nasty letter finding some sort of fault with us, in the hope that they can then have some leverage to fight their case of having their hospital bills waived.  It's getting uglier and uglier and conscience and moral values seem to have gone right out the window.<br><br>People no longer flinch when they commit morally detestable acts and that, is scary.  When there is no conscience to pull the stops, what's there to stop us from committing worse and worse acts anymore?</div>

I shudder to think how kids like this would grow up to be.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   It's the parents' responsibility to discipline the kid, to show him/her how to make morally right choices, teach them values and all but sadly, the focus these days is more on earning enough to give the kid a cushy life, to afford an expensive education for the kid but no heed is being paid to character building.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Reminds me of a recent incident where my colleagues and I really really wanted to slap the granddaughters of one of our patients.  The entire family had been giving the doctors and nurses endless grief with their incessant complaints, nit-picking, attempts to dictate the patient's treatment, etc and because of our silly customer service, treat the hospital like a 5-star hotel drive, we end up taking nursing directives from the family, which was utterly ridiculous!  These folks even commented once, 'Don't criticise the nurses - you don't know what they will do to our mom!'  I mean, for goodness sake!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So, one day, I went into the room, explained to the patient's daughter that I had to do some procedures for the patient so please return in about 30 mins' time and as I drew the curtains in preparation, I saw one of their granddaughters throwing me this really nasty look, like she wanted to swallow me alive and well, I ought to be a nice, sweet nurse but this family had really driven me to my limits already so I glared back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  What in the world did I do to offend her?  I was doing a service to keep her grandma alive, for goodness' sake!  I didn't deserve the hostility.  You guys shoulda seen that look on her face.  It was a 'gou3 yan3 kan4 ren2 di1' look (or as PCK would say, 'see me no up!') and she acted like she was a da xiao jie.  Not a surprise since most of the family liked to talk down to us like we weren't worth anything or that we were lesser humans.<br><br>They were with us for a week and I was assigned to serve them for that entire duration and I tell you, it was one of the worst weeks I had to endure.  Thank God for my buddies who cheered me up and gathered round me and basically became my cheerleading team!  hehehe!<br><br>Anyways, thanks for listening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div></blockquote>gosh. they sound a right horrid bunch!<br><br>that's so silly! their grandmother's the PATIENT!
