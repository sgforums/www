              <p>growing up to 6ft across and up to about 30lbs, it's the largest
              of the land crabs around.. strong enough to rip open a coconut with
              its claws (hence its name) it's cool as heck as it can climb trees
              to get at the coconuts..</p>
              <p>eating things like coconuts, bananas and carrion, it's a
              formidable creature but there has been regional extinctions where
              they have been found after they were found to be surprisingly
              delicious...</p>
              <p>let's hope they will be around for millennia to come</p>

              <p>looking like a cross between a rabbit and a kangaroo, it is not rabbit or kangaroo.. it was grouped with lots of other species until it was given a family all by itself..</p>
              <p>living in the dry savannahs of Kenya and Tanzania, it eats the stems and roots of many types of plants..</p>
              <p>it is called a spring hare because although pretty small at about 40cm (not including its tail which adds another 40cm), it can jump over 2m like a kangaroo...</p>
              <p>the young are born furred and active...</p>

              <p>A rare animal called the Saola has been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11328123">caught in Laos</a>.</p>
              <p><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49123000/jpg/_49123717_saola1.jpg" alt="" width="464" height="310"> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p class="introduction">An extremely rare animal known as the "Asian unicorn" - in 
              spite of having two horns - has been caught by villagers in Laos.</p>
              <p>No biologist has ever reported seeing the rare Saola in the wild and there 
              are none of them in captivity.</p>
              <p>The animal was discovered in the forests of South-East Asia as recently as 
              1992.</p>
              <p>There have only been a few photos of the Saola taken so far, by villagers and 
              automatic camera traps.</p>
              <p id="story_continues_1">The Saola - <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em> - is 
              believed to inhabit the Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam, and that is 
              where villagers from Laos' central province of Bolikhamxay caught the 
              unfortunate adult male earlier this August.</p>
              <p>They brought the mammal back to the village. </p>
              <p>Surprised by the odd-looking animal, the villagers took a few photos and 
              notified the Lao authorities. But by the time a team from the Bolikhamxay 
              Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office reached the remote location, the 
              Saola was dead.</p>
              <p>"The death of this Saola is unfortunate," said a spokesperson of the 
              provincial conservation unit of Bolikhamxay province.</p>
              <p>"But at least it confirms an area where it still occurs and the government 
              will immediately move to strengthen conservation efforts there." </p>
              <p>In 1992, biologists declared the Saola a news species after analysis of its 
              physical features and DNA.</p>
              <p>It resembles the antelopes of North Africa, but is believed to be more 
              closely related to wild cattle.</p>

              <div class="caption"> </div>
              <p>The Saola is listed as critically endangered on the International Union for 
              Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species. Only a handful 
              have reportedly been sighted, mainly by the local population.</p>
              <p>"At best a few hundred survive, but it may be only a few dozen. The situation 
              is critical," said Pierre Comizzoli, a veterinarian with the Smithsonian 
              Conservation Biology Institute and a member of the IUCN Saola Working Group.</p>
              <p>The technical team took the carcass to the provincial capital Pakxan for 
              further analysis.</p>
              <p>"Our lack of knowledge of Saola biology is a major constraint to efforts to 
              conserve it," noted Dr Comizzoli. </p>
              <p>"This can be a major step forward in understanding this remarkable and 
              mysterious species. It's clear that further awareness-raising efforts about the 
              special status of Saola are needed but Saola doesn't have much time left."</p>
              <p>The Lao authorities have urged villagers not to capture any Saola, and if 
              they do, immediately release the animal.</p>
              <p>"This incident highlights the importance of Laos to global wildlife 
              conservation. Saola and several other rare endemic species are found almost 
              nowhere else in the world," said Latsamay Sylavong, the national representative 
              for the IUCN Lao programme.</p>
              <p>"Our knowledge of them is limited, and in Laos we need to improve protection 
              of both the ecosystems and the special species they hold, like the Saola. Much 
              needs to be done."</p>
