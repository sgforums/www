              <p><strong>Chinese Give Skeptical Welcome to Singapore Rescuers</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Sunday, May 18, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=41&amp;author=">International News</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=41"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-intl.gif" border="0" alt="International News" align="right"></a><br><em>by Nyonya Kway</em><br><br> The Chinese government has given a skeptical welcome to a Singaporean
              disaster and rescue team arriving in Chengdu to help find survivors of
              the recent earthquake.<br><br>“We welcome everybody who wants to help,”
              said Mr. Da Dizhen, the deputy mayor of Shifang in Sichuan province.
              “But of course, we don’t dare to get our hopes up.”<br> <br> “I mean, we’re very grateful to the Singaporean team,” he explained,
              “but if the whole of Singapore still cannot find one guy who escaped
              from a toilet cubicle into a country only 672 sq. km. in area, we
              really don’t think a small team can find thousands of people buried
              under tonnes of rubble in a city of over 12,000 sq. km in time.”<br> <br> However, Major Tao Kah Chew, a spokesman for the SAF’s Disaster, Rescue
              and Assistance Team (DRAT), pledged that the Singapore team would do
              their best.<br> <br> “Obviously, it’s a complicated job,” he said. “And we might not succeed
              in the mission. But I want to reassure everybody that in the event of
              failure, no Ministers will resign. That's what's really important in
              the end”<br> <br> In addition to an array of high tech equipment, special vehicles and
              four specially-trained sniffer dogs, the team has also brought along a
              State’s Times journalist to ensure that only good things are reported
              back home.</p>

              <p><strong>Channel U Show Leads Myanmar to Reject Singapore Food Aid</strong><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Posted on  Monday, May 19, 2008<br>Topic: <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=41&amp;author=">International News</a></span><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/search.php?query=&amp;topic=41"><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/topics/icon-intl.gif" border="0" alt="International News" align="right"></a><br><em>by Kway Bangket</em><br><br> The ruling junta in cyclone-ravaged Myanmar has rejected food aid from
              Singapore, after watching an episode of Channel U’s “U Are The One”
              model contest.<br><br>“The <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/singapore-a-friend-indeed-to-burma/2007/09/30/1191090945019.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2">Singapore Government has been a good friend to the ruling junta in Myanmar</a>,”
              said Burmese spokesman Major Wan Mangnyi. “So we cannot in good
              conscience accept any food aid from Singapore when people in Singapore
              are clearly starving themselves.”<br> <br> Major Wan said that the Burmese junta arrived at this decision after
              Embassy staff forwarded a recorded episode of “U Are The One”, a
              modeling contest being aired on Channel U. The show is an apparent
              underground hit in Myanmar, where one of the contestants is of Myanmar
              origin.<br> <br> “My god,” he said. “The girls are so skinny, some have no hips never
              mind breasts, and they make Burmese victims look like the contestants
              on the ‘Biggest Loser’ show.”<br> <br> “Well, Burmese victims <em>are</em> in a way, the biggest losers,
              but… you know what I mean,” he added, pleading, “We insist you keep all
              the food you’re sending to us and force feed it these poor starving
              girls instead.”<br> <br> Major Wan said it was important that Singaporeans continue to be well
              fed. “Otherwise, our generals might wonder why they should continue
              coming to Singapore for medical treatment if they can’t keep their own
              people healthy.”<br> <br> A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meanwhile, has
              responded, thanking the Myanmar Government for their concern, but said
              they might actually send the emaciated contestants to the Irrawaddy
              Delta to help with flood conditions. <br> <br> “They’re thin as sticks, so you can tie them all together and make a raft or something,” he suggested.</p>
