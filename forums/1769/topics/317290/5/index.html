              <p>Like how we try to talk you out for it because ultimately it is not only your happiness but the girl's happiness so we try to make sure you know what you are getting into because if you don't, you will be implicating the poor girl as well</p>
              <p>But if you decide that a MOB is for you, we will wish the both of you happiness and from the looks of it, we seem more worried about the poor girl than you :P</p>
