              <p>LOL @ Keii</p>
              <p>I just love his reply to what one of our guildies posted in the WoW Forums</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guildie:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span>My guild wants me to go resto because they have a fair few tanks, but because of the server-wide tank shortage, i'm thinking of staying feral. But now i hear of the massive overload to Hunter's fear beast (for those of you who dont know, its instant cast and 30yrd range), so i pretty much wont be able to pvp. <br><br><br>i have some alright healing gear, staying 69 for now just to grind honor + marks. <br><br>any suggestions? <br><br>by the way, i'm too lazy and have too many comittments to raid at nights / during the week. </span></p>

              swiss ones .... you start air-kissing your friends ..... you look
