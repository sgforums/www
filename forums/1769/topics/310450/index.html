              <p> 
                              
                              
                              <span> She sacrificed her life for her unborn child</span></p>
              <p>Mrs S, a 35-year-old woman in her second pregnancy, was diagnosed
                  with breast cancer. She was then four months pregnant and was offered a
                  termination of pregnancy by a gynaecologist. But she delayed her
                  decision to abort the baby. She told her husband: 'I am going to take
                  my chance and let my baby live.'</p>
              <p>She
                  came to see me in her sixth month of pregnancy and said that she had
                  felt a painless lump in her right breast while bathing. She was then in
                  her third month of pregnancy.</p>
              <p>The
                  lump was firm to the touch and grew rapidly from the size of a small
                  fishball to a golf ball within a month. Soon, there were lumps
                  appearing in the right armpit. She consulted a surgeon who told her
                  that she had advanced breast cancer and she was referred to a
                  gynaecologist for an abortion prior to surgical removal of the cancer.</p>
              <p>
              
              Breast
                  cancer is the most common cancer among women in Singapore. One in five
                  cancers occurring in Singaporean women is breast cancer. Every year,
                  about 1,100 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed.</p>
              <p>That means three women are diagnosed with breast cancer each day. And about 270 die from the disease each year.</p>
              <p>Breast
                  cancer occurs in about one in every 3,000 pregnancies and most often
                  when the mother is between the ages of 32 and 38, as in the case of Mrs
                  S. It usually appears as an innocuous lump and may cause retraction of
                  the nipple as it grows.</p>
              <p>Breast
                  cancer is usually difficult to detect early in pregnant women, whose
                  breasts are often tender and swollen. By the time the patient presents
                  herself to the doctor, the cancer is usually at the advanced stage.
                  This is what happened in MrsS, whose cancer had spread to the lymph
                  nodes in the armpit.</p>
              <p>When
                  I examined her, she appeared anxious, but was firm about her decision
                  to continue with her pregnancy even though this was contrary to the
                  surgeon's advice. She knew very well that the cancer would grow more
                  rapidly during pregnancy due to the increase in female hormones. This
                  would make the management of her condition difficult.</p>
              <p>After
                  many sessions of prolonged discussion with her and her husband, I was
                  moved by her willingness to risk her life for the sake of her baby.</p>
              <p>A
                  holistic approach was required in this unique case as I worked closely
                  with my surgical colleagues. Mrs S underwent removal of her breast with
                  clearance of the lymph nodes in the armpit during the seventh month of
                  her pregnancy. The cancer was found to be aggressive in nature.</p>
              <p>A
                  baby boy was delivered in the eighth month of her pregnancy by
                  Caesarean section. He was discharged after a week in the neo-natal
                  intensive care unit.</p>
              <p>Soon
                  after the delivery, Mrs S had radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy.
                  This was more palliative than curative as the cancer was found to have
                  spread to the brain. This information was passed on to the patient's
                  husband. It was to prepare him for the inevitable.</p>
              <p> <strong>A difficult time<br> </strong>Three months later, I received a phone call from her husband
              and was informed that she had passed away in her sleep. At that
              juncture, I could only be reminded of the brave decision she had made
              and her love for her unborn son.</p>
              <p>It
              was a difficult time for me as I thought of the days when we journeyed
              together during her pregnancy. I constantly encouraged her and affirmed
              her determination to proceed with her pregnancy even though the odds
              were against her.</p>
              <p>When I attended the funeral, I met the patient's admirable husband who was looking after the two children.</p>
              <p>I
              was surprised when he approached me and put a note in my hands. He said
              that Mrs S wrote this note about a week before her death. It took me a
              while before I decided to read it. I was on the verge of tears after
              reading the touching note which said:</p>
              <p>'Dear
              Doctor Chew, I appreciate your concern and care. You have certainly
              provided me with the opportunity of motherhood even though it may be a
              short one.'</p>
              <p>As
              an obstetrician, I have encountered numerous cases but it is these
              instances that render the fruits of my labour worthwhile and continue
              to inspire me as a health-care professional. I have kept the note till
              this day and it has been a source of motivation when the going gets
              tough.</p>

              <h1 class="story">Breastfeeding Reduces Risk Of Breast Cancer For Women Who Delay Childbirth</h1>
              <div id="story">
              <p id="first"><span class="date">ScienceDaily (Apr. 17, 2007)</span> — Breastfeeding can offset the increased risk of invasive breast cancer for women who had their first full-term pregnancy after the age of 25, a study led by researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) suggests.</p>
              <p><strong>"Breastfeeding may have a protective effect that negates the increased risk of breast cancer associated with late pregnancies," says Giske Ursin, M.D., Ph.D, associate professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. "As more women may choose to delay pregnancy until after 25, it is important to note that breastfeeding provides protection against both estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and negative tumors."</strong></p>
              <p>While having a first full-term pregnancy before the age of 25 and having many children protect against the type of breast cancers that express estrogen and progesterone receptors, these factors do not protect against the rarer tumors that do not have these receptors. Breastfeeding, however, appears to protect against both types of breast tumors, Ursin says.</p>
              <p>Researchers analyzed data for women aged 55 and older--including 995 invasive breast cancer patients--who participated in the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study. The women varied by their age at first birth, their breastfeeding history and hormone receptor status.</p>
              <p>Previous results from the Women's CARE Study have shown that early age at first pregnancy (younger than 25) and having many children (defined as four or more) are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, Ursin says. Researchers sought to gain a better understanding of the associations between reproductive factors and breast cancer risk in women with a late age at first birth, she says.</p>
              <p>Breastfeeding appears to have a protective effect regardless of when women started giving birth, Ursin says. This is important since having many children was only protective among women who gave birth early, she says. Giving birth after age 25--the average age that women in the U.S. first give birth, according to Census data--was associated with increased risk of hormone receptor negative breast cancer.</p>
              <p>"Evidence suggests that women who have children after age 25 can reduce their risk of breast cancer by choosing to breastfeed," Ursin says.</p>
              <p>The study was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and by the National Cancer Institute.</p>
              <p>The findings of the study were presented at a news conference on Monday, April 16 at the 2007 annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research held in Los Angeles.</p>

              <p>So if you have birth early and breastfeed your child, the risk of developing breast cancer is reduced.</p>

              <h1>Breastfeeding Reduces Risk Of Breast Cancer For Women
                  Who Delay Childbirth</h1>
              <div>
              <p><span>ScienceDaily (Apr. 17, 2007)</span> —
                  Breastfeeding can offset the increased risk of invasive breast
                  cancer for women who had their first full-term pregnancy after the
                  age of 25, a study led by researchers at the University of Southern
                  California (USC) suggests.</p>
              <p><strong>"Breastfeeding may have a protective effect that negates
                  the increased risk of breast cancer associated with late
                  pregnancies," says Giske Ursin, M.D., Ph.D, associate professor of
                  preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the
                  University of Southern California. "As more women may choose to
                  delay pregnancy until after 25, it is important to note that
                  breastfeeding provides protection against both estrogen and
                  progesterone receptor positive and negative tumors."</strong></p>
              <p>While having a first full-term pregnancy before the age of 25
                  and having many children protect against the type of breast cancers
                  that express estrogen and progesterone receptors, these factors do
                  not protect against the rarer tumors that do not have these
                  receptors. Breastfeeding, however, appears to protect against both
                  types of breast tumors, Ursin says.</p>
              <p>Researchers analyzed data for women aged 55 and older--including
                  995 invasive breast cancer patients--who participated in the
                  Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study.
                  The women varied by their age at first birth, their breastfeeding
                  history and hormone receptor status.</p>
              <p>Previous results from the Women's CARE Study have shown that
                  early age at first pregnancy (younger than 25) and having many
                  children (defined as four or more) are associated with a lower risk
                  of breast cancer, Ursin says. Researchers sought to gain a better
                  understanding of the associations between reproductive factors and
                  breast cancer risk in women with a late age at first birth, she
                  says.</p>
              <p>Breastfeeding appears to have a protective effect regardless of
                  when women started giving birth, Ursin says. This is important
                  since having many children was only protective among women who gave
                  birth early, she says. Giving birth after age 25--the average age
                  that women in the U.S. first give birth, according to Census
                  data--was associated with increased risk of hormone receptor
                  negative breast cancer.</p>
              <p>"Evidence suggests that women who have children after age 25 can
                  reduce their risk of breast cancer by choosing to breastfeed,"
                  Ursin says.</p>
              <p>The study was funded by the National Institute of Child Health
                  and Human Development and by the National Cancer Institute.</p>
              <p>The findings of the study were presented at a news conference on
                  Monday, April 16 at the 2007 annual meeting of the American
                  Association for Cancer Research held in Los Angeles.</p>

              <p>So if you have birth early and breastfeed your child, the risk
                  of developing breast cancer is reduced.</p>
              <p>Most breast cancer start to develop after 30 y.o.</p>

              <p>Well, sweet to know, but you know what, this won't send women rushing to get married and give birth and subsequently breastfeed just to keep Breast Ca at bay.  In fact, ladies who rush into bad marriages and then give birth and breastfeed just so they have a lower risk of Breast Ca might die of several other factors from the stress of being in an unhappy marriage, and of having to take care of so many kids, who may or may not be easy to take care of!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
