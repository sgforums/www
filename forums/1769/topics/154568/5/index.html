I find that whilst I can be quite a demoness with one group, I can be an angel to another.  Basically, it's whether they approach you with their nose up in the air, talking down to you with their hoity-toity, 'bah-bahn' attitude, or if they are polite and considerate when approaching you.<br><br>We all go the extra mile for those who are gracious to us.  And it's our joy to go beyond the call of duty for these folks.  I have, and still do, keep in touch with a select few patients and their families, and I constantly keep them in my prayers.<br><br>Then, there are those who love to 'squeeze blood out of stone'.  Sure, because the entire management is so darn freaking scared of complaint letters, nevermind if they do have grounds for complaint or not, we will end up doing their bidding, but we certainly do not like these folks and amongst us, much is said about these monsters.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Service staff or not, people are still people.  No one is 'more important' than someone else just because he/she's a customer.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I am also mighty glad that our PM has brought this up!<br><br>Too many times, I've seen local customers abuse their status.  I entered the healthcare sector, not realising that in Singapore, healthcare is interpreted to mean 'service'.  Which means, instead of us prioritising our tasks depending on who is more critically ill and needs the medical / nursing attention more, we end up apportioning a great deal of our time towards pleasing demanding and unreasonable relatives.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I heard of a recent incident too, where a newly-graduated nurse was reprimanded badly by relatives who were angry that she didn't know the Consultant of a discipline that's totally different and unrelated to the nurse's ward discipline.  They went overboard, shouting, "If you don't even know the doctors in your hospital, you might as well don't be a nurse!  You're not fit to be a nurse!"  What the!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>There are HUNDREDS of doctors in the large public hospitals here.  It is impossible to know ALL of them, especially if their discipline is not related to your ward's!  Besides, the poor girl had just started her job as a nurse, it takes time to get to know her job well, much less know all the in's and out's and the nitty-gritties!  Give her a break!!<br><br>I think when we're in the queue where a trainee cashier or trainee customer service staff is at work, we should also be a bit more patient.  It takes time for newly-employed staff to get to know the ropes.  Don't make life harder for them by making rude remarks, showing your impatience, being grouchy and verbally abusive!<br><br>And I feel we should stop complaining and demanding, "I want to see your supervisor / manager!" so often!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  No service personnel wants to deliberately make a customer displeased but sometimes, it's the customer who's obstinate, unreasonable, and unruly.  I think we have to stop being selfish, and start being more reasonable and gracious.<br><br>Just because we're purchasing goods / services, doesn't give us the right to lord it over the poor staff!<br><br>We should start seeing this issue for what it is - abuse.  Abuse of a perceived 'power' that isn't really justified.<br><br>Let's give the customer service folks a break!  Let's bridge the gap between education and civilised behaviour for contrary to popular delusion, the two sure don't automatically go hand-in-hand in the local context!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div></blockquote>Yeah, at times I get comments like," I know your boss..you want me to talk to your boss." Go ahead, you may know my boss, but does my boss know you and want to talk to you?? That's another issue.<br><br>Everyone can say they know someone. I know Brad Pitt too, what the heck.</div>
