(i couldn't understand either because his accent was very strong)<br>she glared at him snootily and said "what did you say?!!!??"<br>he repeated again.<br>and he said in the same tone of voice "I don't understand you!!!"<br>he repeated again.<br>This time we both made out it was "slew liwer" or something like that<br>and she exclaimed VERY LOUDLY<br>"OH! YOu want a Screwdriver!!! Why don't you just SAY so properly then!?"<br><br>(forgot to add) AND she told him to REPEAT after her. 'Say SCREWDRIVER" a few times.. which .. he did.. patiently and calmly.<br><br>He smiled, thanked her profusely and took his drink.<br><br>I was shocked and stunned. Being about 17 then I didn't know what to do about it. The blatant racism for so shocking. The air stewardness even 'tsk'ed and shoved the drink the the Japanese businessmen.<br><br>After about 15 mins of angry simmering contemplation over the incident, I turned to him and said "I am sorry but that air stewardess was really rude. You've got to make a complain!"<br><br>The following conversation we had was something I remembered for a long time. Especially when I was faced with racism, bad service, or simply just bad behaviour.<br><br>"If you travel all over the world, you meet all sorts of people. Some who can control themselves, and some who can't. Often it isn't their fault, but their society and upbringing. Instead of complaining about them, SHOW them what is the right thing to do.

            <div class='col-md body'>there are a lot of arguments about good service in the papers recently.  i find many comments ridiculous.<br><br>sales assistants and waiters are paid a pittance, say $1k or slightly more.  they work long and irregular hours.  what can we expect from them?  some even pass comments like 'if you dont like service job you shouldnt join'.  do they really believe that people actually become waiters or sales assistant because they like the job?<br><br>how many people actually make a living out of something they like?  i think most people dont.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i pity the waiters and sales assistants.<br><br>generally we have a very weak service culture.  most singaporeans are cold, rude and demanding.  employees of restaurants and shops are not the only guilty ones.  the service provided by most companies are very poor too.  i dare say that those who complained about poor service are themselves probably guilty of providing poor service to their customers.  the only difference is their company is not under public scrutiny.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some customers, although rarely do you meet them, can make the day good for the service staffs. Just say a simple "thank you" and you can make them feel happy (sorry, I counldn't think of a better word because of my limited vocabulary) Sometimes, if you see the service staff a little blur blur, give them some time to learn, they most probably new staffs, given that most fast-food restuarants seem to depend on part-timers. Even if they may serve you slower, they are already trying their best to be fast liao.<br><br>Read on newspaper about the so called "service DNA" or "fu wu DNA" in Chinese. Sometimes, it is not the service staffs' fault for being rude. Some customers simply get on your nerves and made you want to shout back at them.<br><br>My experience recently, got an old lady came and ordered a meal, because the product could not be served yet (still cooking), I told her I sent her meal in about 5 to 10 minutes. After that, I continued to take orders (about 2 to 3 customers, assuming that one customer I took 1 minute to serve or slightly more), I brought up the food to the old lady. When I serve her, she said rudely to me: " I thought this is a fast-food restaurant and you call this fast?" I turned my back and walked away muttering some expletives under my breath (my fault, I should not be doing that). If she want her food to be serve fast, I can... but I cannot gurantee it is fully cooked. Cooking one fish take about 4 minutes, so if you can't wait, why bother to eat, wouldn't it be better for you to cook your own meals yourself?<br><br>I am not that good at service because I can suddenly become bad temper especially when I meet such customers. But sometimes, I just wish customers realise one thing. They worked for maybe 10 hours a day. We worked for 6 hours until sometimes we reach home at midnight and before that, we still attend school in the morning and afternoon. Some more, we still need to go to school the next day.<br><br>And to death, I am also a shy person. Personally if I speak to another person, he or she might not be able to hear what I am saying sometimes even though the person may be right beside me, even now. But I still go out to work. I changed after I start working as a service staff. When I just started working, customers would sometimes say they can't hear what I'm speaking but now I can speak louder. You got to take the first step out or you will always be what you are now. I used to work in a factory but stopped because of schooling, maybe you can try it, not really much contact with other people, maybe only with a few very closed colleagues as compared to service industry where you got to meet all sorts of people.</div>
