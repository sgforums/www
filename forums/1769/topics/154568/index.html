            <div class='col-md body'>I passed by a ward recently, and saw this newspaper copy of a quote by PM Lee pinned up on the notice board :<br><br>"If customers treat you like dirt, you are not going to serve with pride.<br><br>"And customers have to know that the person is serving you, it doesn't mean he or she is a slave or a servant.<br><br>I am in total agreement with this sentiment!!  I am also mighty glad that our PM has brought this up!<br><br>Too many times, I've seen local customers abuse their status.  I entered the healthcare sector, not realising that in Singapore, healthcare is interpreted to mean 'service'.  Which means, instead of us prioritising our tasks depending on who is more critically ill and needs the medical / nursing attention more, we end up apportioning a great deal of our time towards pleasing demanding and unreasonable relatives.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I heard of a recent incident too, where a newly-graduated nurse was reprimanded badly by relatives who were angry that she didn't know the Consultant of a discipline that's totally different and unrelated to the nurse's ward discipline.  They went overboard, shouting, "If you don't even know the doctors in your hospital, you might as well don't be a nurse!  You're not fit to be a nurse!"  What the!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>There are HUNDREDS of doctors in the large public hospitals here.  It is impossible to know ALL of them, especially if their discipline is not related to your ward's!  Besides, the poor girl had just started her job as a nurse, it takes time to get to know her job well, much less know all the in's and out's and the nitty-gritties!  Give her a break!!<br><br>I think when we're in the queue where a trainee cashier or trainee customer service staff is at work, we should also be a bit more patient.  It takes time for newly-employed staff to get to know the ropes.  Don't make life harder for them by making rude remarks, showing your impatience, being grouchy and verbally abusive!<br><br>And I feel we should stop complaining and demanding, "I want to see your supervisor / manager!" so often!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  No service personnel wants to deliberately make a customer displeased but sometimes, it's the customer who's obstinate, unreasonable, and unruly.  I think we have to stop being selfish, and start being more reasonable and gracious.<br><br>Just because we're purchasing goods / services, doesn't give us the right to lord it over the poor staff!<br><br>We should start seeing this issue for what it is - abuse.  Abuse of a perceived 'power' that isn't really justified.<br><br>Let's give the customer service folks a break!  Let's bridge the gap between education and civilised behaviour for contrary to popular delusion, the two sure don't automatically go hand-in-hand in the local context!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>
