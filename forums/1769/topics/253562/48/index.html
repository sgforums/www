When she was was the one pushing, biting &amp; kicking the POs.<br><br>Her vulgarties was so bad, that resident, in another block, on the high floors came down and offers to be witness against her screaming and making life unpleasant for everyone in that middle of the night.<br><br>Then, the media tries to paint her in a sad picture, with being ex stewardess &amp; then pregnant and all to get sympathies for her.<br><br>But, actual people on the scene, including the ambulance workers was shaking their heads at such as a shrew of that woman.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reminds me.<br><br>one time, at orchard rd.<br><br>got this lady selling those party favours on the street.<br><br>she was hysterical cos of some NEA officer insisting we arrest her.<br><br>then her brother came along, who happens to be a ex reservist.<br><br>so while i calmed her down and hold her hands down from gesticulating.  her brother came from behind me, grab my arms from behind and practically pulled me away.<br><br>my inspector stopped him and warned him against touching me again.<br><br>anyway, that lady was very pitiful, so we finally took her away from the scene where it was escalating into a major arguement with that NEA officer &amp; the police officers.  The out of sight, out of mind tactic.  at least with her away from the crowds, she was so much calmer and co-operative.<br><br>her brother, and her so called 'not know her' relatives even tried to run after me to clobber me.   turns out, that female relative was her sister in law, and she was playing the 'I am a concerned public' role.<br><br>The next thing i know. her brother went and made a police report against me for arresting her sister.<br><br>I have half the mind to go down to another office below mine and lodge a more formal complaint about ex officers manhndling other officers while on duty.  The IO keeps persuading me against it.  These are times, where I was really cheesed off with such officers.<br><br>Frankly, all of us sympatised with that lady, and didnt arrest her.  We were still talking about how hard a life most Singaporean have, and how we should be giving more leeway to those that needs to make a living.<br><br>But to have our kindness thrown into our face as someone to blame for their own misfortune and their own misbehaviours.  I am certainly not comfortable with that.</div>
