            <div class='col-md body'>I remember reading that there is no lack of witnesses in this case.  In fact, when the boy started assaulting the bus driver, one male passenger came forward to break up the fight with almost everyone else on board scolding the boy for his actions.  The article made it sound like it was a unanimous response by the passengers to chide the boy and put him in his place.<br><br>SBS also released a statement saying that their bus driver did everything right.<br><br>The driver did say that he was shocked to see the boy's dad kneeling to beg for forgiveness on behalf of his son.  He's a father himself and so he understands that only a father's love would let a man resort to this.<br><br></div>
