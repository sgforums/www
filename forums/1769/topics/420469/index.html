              <p>Not so long ago, we were talking about how our children were not enjoying themselves and lacking spontaneity. However, I think today's kids have forgotten the meaning of effort and dedication. They give up too easily because it's all about being "free" and "happy" and adults are afraid to push them beyond the comfort zone.</p>
              <p>Ironically, their freedom is compromised by all kinds of restrictions on their playtime due to health &amp; safety and political correctness.</p>

              <p>Ultimately, pull factors always trump push factors...</p>
              <p>My grades improved once I saw why I should be good and study. And once I saw something I liked studying, it gave me more motivation to learn more.</p>
              <p>In contrast, under pressure from my parents, I took higher chinese, flunked it, only to find out I had probably wasted a lot of time on useless memorisation (there's no way you can si bei chinese anyway), when the normal route was so much easier and less stressful.</p>
              <p>I wasn't interested in biology, not in the least bit. Yet I was under constant pressure to take it up, which I was extremely unhappy about. Thankfully, my lousy grades ensured that I couldn't have taken biology in sec sch even if I had really wanted.</p>
              <p>I took economics in JC, and was informed that it was 'probably a wrong choice' and like a repeat of last time, again pressured to try for biology again. Finally, I figured I had enough of this nonsense after being humiliated by some teacher to whom I appealed to.</p>
              <p>The last time I had such a run-in, was my application to uni to do economics. Again, I was question and badgered on why I shouldnt be doing "accounting" "chem engineering" etc etc when my grades could have allowed me to do all these. Why was I going to a 'dumping ground'?</p>
              <p>I stood my ground this time and I can say, at least for now, I immensely like what I'm doing.</p>
              <p>For those who believe they should be there to guide kids with titanium hand, I think they should be in the kids' shoes and understand what it feels like having to do things they don't like.

              <p>Why cause undue stress on the kids? Its unhealthy.</p>

              <p>It's not just Singapore, my friend. Anywhere in the world you go, there's a hierachy of subjects in the education system (a legacy of industrialisation) where mathematics and the sciences are at the top, and dance and theatre are at the bottom.</p>
              <p>I don't want to stereotype your parents but they probably feel that those subjects lead to the highest-paying job opportunities - because the search for that financial security is ingrained in them.</p>
              <p>As long as you and I aim to do our best in our chosen fields, that's fine. However, to excel in anything, one needs to make the commitment and go beyond the comfort zone. Such moments aren't so enjoyable.</p>
              <p>Sometimes in life, we don't get to choose what we like, so we have to learn to like what we get. And if we get to choose, well, we'd better be prepared to bear the consequences (lower starting pay and all that).</p>

              <p>Ultimately, pull factors always trump push factors...</p>
              <p>My grades improved once I saw why I should be good and study.
              And once I saw something I liked studying, it gave me more
              motivation to learn more.</p>
              <p>In contrast, under pressure from my parents, I took higher
              chinese, flunked it, only to find out I had probably wasted a lot
              of time on useless memorisation (there's no way you can si bei
              chinese anyway), when the normal route was so much easier and less
              stressful.</p>
              <p>I wasn't interested in biology, not in the least bit. Yet I was
              under constant pressure to take it up, which I was extremely
              unhappy about. Thankfully, my lousy grades ensured that I couldn't
              have taken biology in sec sch even if I had really wanted.</p>
              <p>I took economics in JC, and was informed that it was 'probably a
              wrong choice' and like a repeat of last time, again pressured to
              try for biology again. Finally, I figured I had enough of this
              nonsense after being humiliated by some teacher to whom I appealed
              to.</p>
              <p>The last time I had such a run-in, was my application to uni to
              do economics. Again, I was question and badgered on why I shouldnt
              be doing "accounting" "chem engineering" etc etc when my grades
              could have allowed me to do all these. Why was I going to a
              'dumping ground'?</p>
              <p>I stood my ground this time and I can say, at least for now, I
              immensely like what I'm doing.</p>

              <p>Its tough to have parents/relatives interfere so much.... had that before and struggled too. Although I wished my parents had some money that I could have attended some music lessons or art lessons or that my life's education is just hell bent on science and engineering to make sure that I can make "lots" of money. Although I appreciated the strict discipline but sometimes I think of "what if" and "what I might hvae been" and "what opportunities lost"</p>

              <p>Apparently the model described in the excerpt you posted is what she <em>used</em> to be, according to this <a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/jan/18/qa-yale-law-professor-amy-chua/">Q&amp;A</a>.</p>
              <p>And I'll let you guys make comparisons with what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY">Sir Ken Robinson</a> claims is wrong with our (i.e. worldwide) education system. Pay attention to the anecdote about Gillian Lynne.</p>
