              <p>In Singapore, one can afford to be lazy to moisturize, and the situation still won't be as bad as if one doesn't moisturize here!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Humidity in Singapore is always in the high 80% range, here, it can be as low as in the 30% range.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>A few days ago, the Summer quickly turned into Autumn.  I know because the skin on my fingers started to crack and my nose started to have small nosebleeds and my nostrils kena clogged up with dried blood clots.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>I bought dozens of pairs of cotton gloves, so after moisturising them, I slip on a pair of cotton gloves and go to bed.  I bought a 550g tub of Cetaphil cream to use!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  And I have tons of other moisturisers that I've tried and tossed aside cause it failed my stringent Quality Assurance Test!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/greggman.com/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Everyone stays too far away, or is too busy to bother.  Somehow, it's much harder to make friends here.  I think most people started living here as migrants themselves, or they have met so many migrants that they no longer pay any special attention to any one migrant. </p>
              <p>It's odd... I heard my Filipino colleagues, who've worked in a few other countries before, tell me that they find the Brits friendlier than Aussies in general.  Even my Irish colleague complains to me about the Aussies when we have our outings!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"> </p>

              <p>I think after you get to a certain age, you somehow accept that
                  no matter how close you are to certain friends, in the end, when it
                  comes to the crunch, you are alone. </p>
              <p>Heck, even if you get married, you might end up alone someday
                  too. </p>
              <p>Sadly, in this world, nothing is permanent anymore.  Few
                  people hold relationships and friendships sacred.  Lucky are
                  the few who do find friends who stay with them through thick and
                  thin for life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>I have had to evaluate my life recently, and start making plans
                  for a life alone.  I never ever thought I'd be alone for the
                  rest of my life, but now, the possibility of that happening has hit
                  me and it seems as if I've suddenly come to accept that.  All
                  these years, I've refused to even dwell on this possibility. 
                  Now, I can't escape anymore liao...</p>

              <p>I don't really think it matters with age. It's more of the experiences you've gone through. Of course, the older you are the more experiences you have. But one can only tolerate so much.</p>
              <p>And yeah. Nothing is permanent anymore. Friendship and relationships nowadays are taken so lightly that being alone, in most cases, would be so much better.</p>
