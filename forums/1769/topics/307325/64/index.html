              <p>They had no other requirements except that documents be scanned as JPEG's / PDF / BMP.  Blardy idiotic, the way they function!  Their auto emails give extremely conflicting instructions!  One minute, they gave me a heart attack saying all documents must be scanned and submitted by a certain date, the next minute, they send another email saying they are inundated with applications and a case officer has not yet been assigned to me yet so my case is "Pending"!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p>They made me panic about my CID background check not being able to be processed on time to meet the deadline, and then the next minute, they say, if you're asking for a Police Clearance from Singapore, you need to wait for a Case Officer to send you a letter from the Immigration Dept first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p>Five days to process a passport is unheard of here! 
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Reminds me of a friend who worked for a
              Ministry here.  She was told to prepare some documents
              "Urgently"!  So, she rushed to do her job, and presented the
              document by the end of the day, which shocked everybody!  They
              asked her why she was in such a hurry, and she said, "Well, you
              said "Urgent!"" And they looked shocked again, then said something
              like, "Erm... 'urgent' means within the next few days!"</p>
