              <p>This morning, I read up on the Edison Chen scandal because even the online The Age Aussie newspaper site headlined it.  Then I googled it and oh my word... the photos... they are so darn explicit, I think the actor and actresses cannot hide behind claims that it's not them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Reminds me of that Tammie video where every inch had been exposed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>How are they going to face their relatives and pai nian the next year?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>Worse, there are fallouts already.  Gillian Cheung's fiance decided to rescind his proposal before she gave him her reply.  And Nicholas Tse is not only divorcing Cecilia Chung, he is also demanding a paternity test for their son, and it's said that her second pregnancy is not from her husband!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>True, true!  I have learnt to adapt to it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I no longer expect efficiency!  Before I make those dreaded phone calls to service lines and etc, I brew tea or some beverage first, then sit down with a magazine or turn on the TV and / or computer first, and THEN make the phone call.  Usually, I'll have to put it on speaker mode because I'll have to hold for quite a few minutes before the phone gets answered by a human, and even then, I might get transferred to yet another extension and start waiting all over again.  But nevermind... I have my refreshments and entertainment, so my blood pressure remains normal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It took me a few seconds to realise what they were doing, then I walked away, but then they sounded like they had gotten out of the car so I went to look again.  I'm a self-appointed security guard of sorts here!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Think they only started to make noises towards the end of their mischief.  Or rather, I just thought they were yet another loud-mouthed Aussie teenager or something so I didn't bother to go look. </p>
              <p>Anyways, if I wanted to watch something racy, it's just too easy to get hold of something here.  There are the magazines from 7-Eleven's across the road, adult movies on cable, or pirated porno movies from Victoria Street.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I don't have to resort to peeking at some yucky rednecks going at it.</p>

              <p>That's funny, cause when you have a group of Aussie females together, omigosh, can they talk!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  That's when they talk so fast that I sometimes can't catch all that they are saying!  I think they talk fast in that context because being the social animals that they are, they wanna squeeze as much gossips as they can into that short space of time!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>But yeah... there are Aussies, mostly the elderly ones, who taaaaalk soooooo slooooooow I start to daydream so that I can keep myself from nodding off to sleep.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>strangely i've never met anyone who talks too fast or too slow.
              just accents which i have difficulty understanding at times.</p>
              <p>i dont like asking people to repeat themselves more than twice.
              almost all the time. it's embarrassing not just for me. but
              probably for the other party too =p</p>

              <p>Just a few days ago, I had to ask this elderly patient to repeat herself because she was hallucinating from all the Morphine and Pethidine in her system, and she was just mumbling unintelligibly!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  Nobody could understand her, including the Aussies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, if we have confused patients who might harm themselves, we administer chemical sedation and/or restrainers.  Here, it's some violation of human rights so I sat there and repeated myself, "Please don't get out of bed!", "Please stop kicking the side rails!", "Please stop twisting and turning in bed!", etc etc etc like some broken record.  By the end of the day, I needed chemical sedation myself!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Anyways, all this thing about human rights... she got more confused during the night, and she was so restless that she caused her surgical wound to bleed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Ah well, it's gone too far here.  I have encountered too many patients who are addicted to painkillers and opiods and opiates here.  (ie. strong painkillers like Morphine, Oxycodone, etc).  Basically, because they have 'rights', even when we KNOW they are faking the pain, as long as they tell you that they are in pain, we cannot deny them painkillers, because they have a right to be pain-free.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  You can see a lot of people who basically need good old-fashioned discipline in their lives.  A lot of anxiety disorders and panic attacks that are just probably manifestations of over-indulgence and attention-seeking disorders.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Back in Singapore, we had Chinese families who acted like they were in some Ch 8 drama with their exaggerated behaviour.  Here, we have the dysfunctional Aussies who act like they are in some Greek Tragedy. </p>
              <p>Once, this old Greek woman SCREAMED and YELLED so melodramatically, it sent the entire ward of nurses running to see what was happening only to realise that her sleeping husband started to breathe a little slower, and she thought he was dying, and so she screamed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  The Greeks own the word "melodramatic" here!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
