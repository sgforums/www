              <p>At the age of 40+, if one is STILLl wavering in one's career direction despite having tried out several other routes before, one will never be able to make it.  Harsh, but true. </p>
              <p>I mean, I rushed out of an elderly lady's room to grab a few towels and he suddenly asked me where the pat slide was, so as I rushed back to the lady's room (because I didn't want her to fall off the bed and I had left her half naked cause I was cleaning her), I pointed to my right and said, "The pat slide is on your right, hanging on the wall, near the Crash Cart!".  He complained to everyone who'd listen, including the Team Leaders and the Nurse Educator, that I was rude and unhelpful because I didn't help him find the pat slide.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  What the ... !!!  Like fuckin' go LOOK!!!  If you can't find it where I said it would, then probably someone else has used it so just go and ask the other colleagues if they have taken it!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  If you can't even do this, forget about taking care of others' lives!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Damn I wish I was still your age</p>
              <p>So damn carefree then (sighs)</p>
              <p>I can only say if you made up your mind on someone who does not fit the norm of a 'normal' relationship, just ignore what people say la.</p>
              <p>Like my cousin. He was a married man with 2 kids</p>
              <p>One day he annouced to all of us he is becoming a woman. We were shocked but we accepted it because she was so certain of what she wanted to be. Went through the entire sex change operation and had her name changed and sex changed on the IC as well.</p>
              <p>Now she is happily dating another guy.</p>
              <p>And she is happy. Really happy and she is a manager in a large MNC (wun say which) and maybe she is getting married again.</p>
              <p>For us who knew him as a man when he was a child, we now know him as a woman. Of course people talk about the shock and all but in the end everyone accepted her for who she is (exact for the narrow minded ones of course)</p>
              <p>Being able to laugh at yourself helps too you know</p>
              <p>Kinda like me and MPB</p>

              <p><br> Well Keii, age wise you are still young... very young... (I feel
              old)</p>
              <p>Damn I wish I was still your age</p>
              <p>So damn carefree then (sighs)</p>
              <p>I can only say if you made up your mind on someone who does not
              fit the norm of a 'normal' relationship, just ignore what people
              say la.</p>
              <p>Like my cousin. He was a married man with 2 kids</p>
              <p>One day he annouced to all of us he is becoming a woman. We were
              shocked but we accepted it because she was so certain of what she
              wanted to be. Went through the entire sex change operation and had
              her name changed and sex changed on the IC as well.</p>
              <p>Now she is happily dating another guy.</p>
              <p>And she is happy. Really happy and she is a manager in a large
              MNC (wun say which) and maybe she is getting married again.</p>
              <p>For us who knew him as a man when he was a child, we now know
              him as a woman. Of course people talk about the shock and all but
              in the end everyone accepted her for who she is (exact for the
              narrow minded ones of course)</p>
              <p>Being able to laugh at yourself helps too you know</p>
              <p>Kinda like me and MPB</p>

              <p>Aiyah. Can ignore lah. I'm just frustrated at how stupid people can be sometimes.</p>
              <p><br>And for adults who can look back and 'wish' to be young again. Good for them. Honestly, I don't want to be. (Blah blah blah, and people will say, all kids wanna grow up fast.)</p>

              <p>Oh, btw, I started work in the ICU this morning!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  I've never been happier since I came here!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Finally, after almost two years and a lot of trials and tribulations, I've finally made it!  Yippeeee!!!  I now spend three days in the ICU, and two in my old ward.  In June, I'll most likely start on a Critical Care course in my hospital that has a heavy emphasis on hands-on experience, and that will give me one credit point off an elective module when I start my Deakin University course proper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Today, my mentor kinda threw me into the deep water!  She said, "You've worked in the ICU before, now, calibrate this for me!" and she asked a few questions that PHEW!!  I managed to answer!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>"How do you calibrate the transducers?"</p>
              <p>"Using the Phlebostatic Axis as Reference Point."</p>
              <p>"Where is your Phlebostatic Axis?"</p>
              <p>"Between your 4th and 5th Intercostal Space."</p>
              <p>HENG AH!!!  Heng I remembered enough to save my skin!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
