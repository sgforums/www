              <p>the last time i went for physiotherapy, the hospital told me to
              get ankle support like the wrap around ones, instead of the ones
              you just slide into.</p>
              <p>what i'm afraid is that my ankle gets reliant on the support and
              from then on i'll have to use the support to play football!</p>

              <p>I think the support is to ensure that you don't inadvertently twist the ankle again easily.  I mean, you can still twist it again if you're not careful, but the support kinda splints it. </p>
              <p>I don't think  your ankle will get reliant on it, not if you do the exercises the physio would have instructed you to do on a daily basis.</p>

              <p><br>Have you tried using a wobble board to strengthen the muscles around your ankle?  I've got very weak ankles too... and my chiro gave me a wobble board to practice on.  After a couple of months of using it, I'm pleasantly surprised to say that my ankles are much stronger now! They also seem to 'right' themselves if I happen to turn my ankle in an awkward position. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Oh, as an aside, the thread exposing the luxury goods market just got really ... amusing!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I just had someone insult me for having a different opinion, and then when she said I'm getting defensive, I showed her what her insult really meant, and then instead of saying sorry, she's acting all miffed up at me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
