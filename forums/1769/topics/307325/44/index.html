              <p>Actually, Pharmacists should be given a more active role to play in the management of a patient's medication.  Whilst it's ideal for doctors to know everything there is to know about treating health problems, it is unrealistic, given the huge expanse of knowledge they'd have to grasp.  I believe that the way to prevent mistakes thus lies in close collaboration with other specialists, in this case, with Pharmacists. </p>
              <p>I hope that in future, doctors will not be viewed as know-it-all's, because most of the time, they don't!  Doctors who are humble enough to acknowledge that and seek the advice of other specialists do a lot of good for their patients.  Those who insist that they know everything about everything end up doing much harm at times.  </p>
              <p>In my relatively short career, I have alerted doctors before to the : dodgy dosage of meds they have ordered / a double-prescription / prescription of meds that are contraindicated / potential drug interactions.  It's common to make mistakes, esp working the sort of hours in the sort of stressful conditions doctors have to undergo.  Therefore, to prevent mistakes, there has to be a closer collaboration amongst the different professionals working towards improving a patient's health. </p>

              <p>I think a lot of times, it's the ego that prevents people from collaborating better.  Some people think that collaboration is like asking for help and admitting that you are not good enough to handle things single-handedly, which can be a fatal mindset to adopt when it comes to the medical field.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>I'm really glad to see that here, there is a really close collaboration amongst the health professionals.  Well, most of the time at least.  There are still surgeons and doctors who think that they are Gods and their word is final, regardless of whether it's the best thing for the patient or not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  Thankfully, they remain in the minority here. </p>
              <p>When a Family Conference is called for here, the patient, his/her family members, the Surgeon and Doctors taking care of the patient, the Nursing Team Leader, the Nursing Care Coordinator, the Physiotherapist and the Occupational Therapist are all involved.  If need be, the Pharmacist / the Dietitian / the Speech Therapist will be called to join in the discussions.  Sometimes, if a Social Worker / Psychologist had been involved in the patient's case, they are called in too.  This ensures that everyone is kept up-to-date with the different aspects of treatment the patient is receiving so a good decision can be made as to the best way forward. </p>
              <p>The other Health Professionals and Allied Health Professionals in Singapore need to be given more prominence.</p>

              <p>well ... most doctors certainly act like they do ....... I have

              <p>Whilst there are super arrogant doctors who think they are omniscient here, there are also doctors who are humble here and before they order any treatment, they will talk to the nurse who had been taking care of the patient first for feedback.  Some of them even ask, "So do you think that this medication will work for Mr Soso in this case?" or "What would you recommend as the best method  for dressing this wound?".  I think that is a really good stance to take because the nurses take care of the patients 24/7 and we exchage notes with the incoming shifts so we do know the patients much better than the doctors, in a way.  (That's why, NEVER treat a nurse badly, because the word gets passed down until ALL the nurses in the ward, and sometimes the doctors and allied health care professionals as well, eventually know about you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> )</p>
              <p>There are also doctors here who, no matter how senior they are, welcome your feedback on whether you think a certain therapy they have prescribed for the patient is working well.  I think with these doctors, once they've seen you on the ward long enough, and once you have earned their trust, they will be open to your suggestions and comments. </p>
              <p>It's much easier to find humble doctors here.  Back in Singapore, it's the Medical Officers (MO's) who tend to be more humble but then again, not all of them are.</p>
              <p>Then again, the society plays a huge part in this too!  In Singapore, if a doctor works in close collaboration with the other professionals, some Ah Soh's or Ah Pek's might go around saying stuff like, "This doctor doesn't know much at all, that's why he always depends on all his other kah kia's before he makes a decision one!  Bo eng! (Useless!)" <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I mean, if you translate it all to Hokkien, I'm sure you can almost 'hear' the way they talk, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Haiz... so poor thing!  Remember to learn from this lesson, ah!  Next time, plan ahead, and keep your Lecturers informed about what you are up to so that they KNOW that you ARE doing SOMEthing.
