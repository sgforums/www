              <p>Hell, he could have died.... burns on the neck region are no joke at all. Not to mention possible asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning.... if the methanol wasn't already poisonous enough.</p>
              <p>Then he'd have the distinction of becoming Singapore's entry into the Darwin Awards.</p>

              <p>Forget the Body Mass Index, peeps!  It's inaccurate! </p>
              <p>Imagine this... You have four candidates standing in front of you, they are all 1.7 m tall. </p>
              <p>#1 : He's a bodybuilder... his BMI shoots through the roof!  He's supposedly categorised as "morbidly obese"!</p>
              <p>#2 : He's a sprinter.  He is lean and thin, and according to his BMI, he is "underweight". </p>
              <p>#3 : Has glucose intolerance issues, along with a low metabolic rate.  Needless to say, despite him eating small, healthy meals, he gets labelled "Obese".</p>
              <p>#4 : Extremely skinny guy with a high metabolic rate.  He loves to eat fried and oily food, and doesn't hesitate to consume animal fat.  He is genetically predisposed to have a high metabolic rate.  His BMI is in the 'healthy' range... but is he really? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Use the Waist-Hip ratio instead.  Right now, it is touted as the most accurate indicator of mortality, as it is a pretty accurate indicator of cardiovascular health, ie. how healthy your heart is. </p>
              <p>If you are apple-shaped, ie. thick-waisted, your risk of heart problems increases. </p>
              <p>If you are pear-shaped, ie. bottom-heavy, your risk is not as great. </p>
              <p>If you are hour-glass shaped, you risk getting stampeded from all the lusty and horny chee koh peks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's what I found from Wikipedia :</p>
              <p>"A WHR of 0.7 for women and 0.9 for men have been shown to correlate strongly with general health and fertility. Women within the 0.7 range have optimal levels of estrogen and are less susceptible to major diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders and ovarian cancers. Men with WHRs around 0.9, similarly, have been shown to be more healthy and fertile with less prostate cancer and testicular cancer.</p>
              <p>WHR is a better predictor of mortality in older people than waist circumference or body mass index (BMI).
              If obesity is redefined using WHR instead of BMI, the proportion of
              people categorized as at risk of heart attack worldwide increases
              threefold.</p>
              <p>Other studies have found waist circumference, not WHR, to be a good indicator of cardiovascular risk factors, body fat distribution, and hypertension in type 2 diabetes.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference">"</sup></p>
