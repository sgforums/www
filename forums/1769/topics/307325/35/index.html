              <p><br>If I am not wrong, the bozz has to support her.  She is afterall a supervisor, and i am a part timer. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I understand that the dept will be shifted to another supervisor and she will be transferred out in a months time.  That was insider management grapevine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, its not big deal anyway.  I was only holding on because the new staff needs training before I submit for resignation end this month where it will be pivotal whether I stayed in sg or not.  It looks likes 'Not'.</p>

              <p><br>think its different. err. think my ex boss probably very tempted to fire me and my colleague many times for insubordination too. heehee... it was reallyfunny once my colleague got so pissed she asked him "LOOK! YOU hire me to THINK right? So i am thinking you are WRONG now, so am I supposed to tell you that? Or you hire me to AGREE?" the boss got stumped.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but that's the key u see.. u need to bring some form of unique contribution to the team as well as the position you play int he company.</p>

              <p><br>If I am not wrong, the bozz has to support her.  She is afterall a supervisor, and i am a part timer. </p>

              <p>But I understand that the dept will be shifted to another supervisor and she will be transferred out in a months time.  That was insider management grapevine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, its not big deal anyway.  I was only holding on because the new staff needs training before I submit for resignation end this month where it will be pivotal whether I stayed in sg or not.  It looks likes 'Not'.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I ganna more worse then she gave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anotherfemale supervisor of similar department was trying to win a arguement and didnt succeed.  She was also trying to raise issues between her staff and myself by claiming that the other girl says something against me.  Evne tried to call her girl to verify what was said and then later quietly didnt dare to tell me about that phone conversation in front of me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She then tries to talk down to me and dismissed me with a 'You may go.' statement.  I was already pissed off as it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But to have my own trainee supervisor called me and tries the same stunt as she does and then to claim that I was shouting at her and was rude. That takes the cake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She even tried to excuse to say that she was saying the same things twice over because she couldnt hear me clearly.  I replied her: Then maybe you should move to a quieter location to speak on the phone. (This was said in my lower calm "very raging" tone liao)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe she was upset when I told her that, which constitute my rudeness to a supervisor.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You know.....the idea was that our team of part timer, namely the party/park host was employed was becaus we are smarter, can think on our feet and was paid higher then the rest of the part timers that does mandane stuffs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the more structured older Guest Relations and the trainee supervisor was kinda either trying to conform us to their standard staffs or does not know how to lead us to make a breakthru.</p>

              <p>yeah.. it sucks that way..</p>
              <p>mine was.. uhh.. basically the cowardice, stupidity and general asswipery of both the boss of the other team and the big boss caused an incident where if people knew what happened, they'd demand both of them fired, and maybe even imprisoned..</p>
              <p>i was there swearing at the other team boss in front of the staff of his team, staff of my team, and the general public.. with vulgar language, calling him a <a href="mailto:%24#%@ing">$#%@ing</a> disgrace to his uniform, his rank, the organisation and as a human being.. and suicide was the only way for him to atone for his dereliction of duty.. and that his cowardice and his manipulation of the big boss's own cowardice has cost the whole department dear..</p>
              <p>he just stood there, rooted to the ground, unable to move and shivering in fear... taking it all from an officer who is of lower rank than he is..</p>
              <p>of course the big boss didn't like it.. he took me aside a week later and tried to threaten me.. i looked him in the eye and told him to do so.. and we'll see what will happen... he backed off in fear.. and began a campaign to drag my name through the dirt which remains until this day... but in there, he's also shamed himself badly.. really really badly..</p>
              <p>insubordination? it depends on what is going on isn't it?</p>
