              <p>They get quite a lot of money, Ferret! </p>
              <p>We currently have a patient in the ward who's a
              'longstayer'.  He's readmitted himself to hospital on numerous
              occasions.  He is becoming more verbally abusive to the nurses
              with each successive stay.  The team leaders know that he's
              trying to find fault with the entire hospital so that he can
              somehow claim some form of damages and not have to work
              forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  He claims to be in such bad pain, he
              can't walk properly, and he always winces and grunts and all manner
              of grand show of pain whenever he passes the nurses, so that he can
              demand for his morphine, and then in the next breath, tell us that
              he hates morphine but has no choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>And then, in the afternoons, when his dodgy girlfriend comes to
              visit, suddenly, he's well enough to walk to the elevators and go
              down to the garden for a smoke!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>
              <p>I was so exasperated with him once I walked out of the room
              shaking my head, and I immediately told the Team Leader that I do
              not wish to nurse him after that shift.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I went in to take his vital signs, he
              complains that he's having his blood pressure taken twice in a day,
              blah blah blah, ranting and raving, so I said, ok, if he didn't
              want to, I won't do it.  So he said something like the doctor
              won't be pleased to find out that the nurse didn't do it.  So
              I said I will tell the doctor that the patient didn't want it
              taken.  Then he said he didn't say he didn't want it
              taken.  Blah Blah Blah.  He was basically venting his
              frustrations on me because he has yet to have his application to
              take money from Centrelink forever approved.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>He's notorious in our ward.  We all take rotations to nurse
              him because nobody can tahan him for more than a shift.</p>

              soldiers who ensure that Generals get their coffee on time and
              piping hot. It is further estimated that another 100,000 or so

              with evidence of numerous competitions held within the various

              <p>Ferret, before I became a nurse, I was critical of our healthcare system.  After I joined the other side of the fence, I continued to be critical, but this time round, I was tempered with an understanding of the true situation. </p>
              <p>It's sad, but there is a real nurse shortage.  We work on a ratio basis.  In Singapore, the Nurse : Patient ratio is atrocious.  It doesn't matter if you're in a private hospital or not, the ratio is equally bad.  When you pay extra in a private hospital, it's for the amenities, NOT for extra nursing attention.  If you want to receive close attention, you really have to employ your own private nurse. </p>
              <p>First off, I want to comment that if the writer's mom was indeed THAT critically ill, she would not have been placed in the general ward.  She would have been moved to the High Dependency Unit (HDU) or the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  When it involves our loved ones, we tend to magnify things sometimes.  We've encountered too many relatives who stormed up to our counter and started shouting and screaming bloody murder when their loved ones aren't really THAT ill to warrant that kind of medical attention.  It's hard to think logically when you are extremely worried over someone whom you love a lot.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, you get one Registered Nurse to every six or seven patients in the General Ward.  (The ratio is worse in the 'C' class wards).  That means that if you have ONE very ill patient, you are knackered, your shift will be completely screwed.  I have had shifts before, both here and back in SG, where my entire attention was focused on that ONE extremely sick patient, and inadvertently, the rest of my allocated patients didn't get much attention from me.  Everyone expects immaculate service, but the system is built such that it simply isn't possible.  In acute hospitals, the sicker the person, the more attention he/she gets.  However, if they are very ill, but not ill enough to get into the HDU / ICU, they might not get full attention because the nurse would still have to attend to the other patients' wound dressings, medication, IV Medication, doctors' rounds, assist in procedures, liaise with the allied health team to arrange for X-rays, scans, tests, physio, etc. </p>
              <p>On top of that, you get patients demanding a lot from you, and then there are the relatives who come in and find fault with everything and act as if you are their mom / dad's personal nurse.  Do you know that Singaporeans are so quick to complain, it can be quite shocking?  There have been people who say that since they are paying to be in hospital, press the buzzer for the nurses to come and then order the nurses to pour water for their mom / dad when the jug and cup is right by the bedside!  Or I will always remember wives who press the buzzer for you to wipe the spittle off their husband's mouth and chin, comb their hair, etc.  Tell me, do you think being a nurse means that even if you can go to the toilet and wipe your own arse, I have to do it for you just because you're in hospital and you suddenly do not feel like doing it for yourself?  Don't be surprised, but there ARE such people around.  We know because when they have to wait to be fed or attended to, they get impatient and do it themselves anyways.  It's not that they can't do it, sometimes, they refuse to do it. </p>
              <p>I meet more and more Singaporean nurses coming over to Australia.  It's no longer just the nurses who do it, even the Nursing Officers and Nurse Managers (ie. the Sisters) migrate too!  Very soon, if the abuse continues, the healthcare system will crumble.</p>

              <p>I saw quite a few interesting cases when I was doing duty at the
              SAF Psychiatric Medicine Inpatient Center (PMIC) at Alexandra
              Hospital.</p>
              <p>I can tell loads of stories.... like the time when one Malay guy
              asked a bomoh to put a curse on his poly lecturer because he didn't
              like him (no kidding). Then when he was in BMT, he kept ruminating
              over it, regretted what he did and had a total mental breakdown....
              at which point he was referred to the PMIC.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, I encountered quite a few chao keng cases as well
              who eventually admitted that they were faking their symptoms.</p>

              <p>And you WILL continue to see more and more foreign nurses in Singapore.  These days, there are numerous cases of young Singaporeans who enrol in nursing school, and immediately upon graduation, they travel to Australia to study an extra year to get their degree, and then start work here.  Most of them had an inkling of how nursing in Singapore would be like as student nurses and they'd rather die than be subjected to that sort of working condition.  It is really bad if even Nursing Officers turn up in droves here, uprooting their entire families in the process.  </p>
              <p>If I had a daughter, I would refuse to let her be a nurse in Singapore too.  There's no need to study so hard only to be screamed at by doctors, nursing officers who act like Empress Dowagers, senior colleagues, and then, patients and their relatives.  Plus there are the less glamourous aspects of the job like dealing with human wastes from all orifices.  On top of that, Nurses are paid pitifully in Singapore!  There will come a point when you'll start asking, what's the point in all the struggling if at the end of the day, all you afford is to pay your bills, and that's about it?</p>
              <p>Filipino and PRC nurses are no longer keen on Singapore, unless they really have no other choice.  Singapore doesn't treat the foreign nurses equitably at all, and people aren't stupid - they return home for visits, they discourage their friends from coming here, and Singapore soon has to look elsewhere for nurses.   The reason why we are able to recruit foreign nurses from other Asian countries is simply because these nurses can't apply to go to Australia / the UK / the US, so they gain work experience in Singapore first, which makes their process much easier.  Or, they come because of the favourable currency exchange rates and the working conditions back home are even worse. </p>
              <p>Now, there are nurses recruited from India and Nepal and Myanmar... where else can we scout for them?</p>

              <p>Ferret, I shan't post there, because I have encountered too many people like the thread starter who will refuse to listen to any and all explanations, insist that they are right, and will be relentless in their complaints. Seriously, what he/she really needs is to employ private nurses for his/her mother so that they will be watched 24/7.  I don't think he/she will take kindly to that suggestion!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Afterall, they are paying the bill, so they must be right mah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  It's not my war to fight.  I abandoned ship, remember?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/unused/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"></p>
