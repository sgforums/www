              <p>The <strong>Singapore Armed Forces</strong> (abbreviated: <strong>SAF</strong>) is the <strong>most powerful military organization in the world</strong> because it has never lost a single war.
              The SAF relies largely on conscripted soldiers and comprises three
              branches: the Branch That Blows Up Things On Land, the Branch That
              Blows Up Things In The Air, and the Branch That Blows Up Things In The
              Sea. The number of active personnel in the SAF is estimated at
              60,000,000,000, the most important of which being over 10,000 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">malingering</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">chao keng kia</span> PES E soldiers who ensure that Generals get their coffee on time and
              piping hot. It is further estimated that another 100,000 or so soldiers
              are actually full-time 'Winning Eleven' Professionals - with evidence
              of numerous competitions held within the various divisions (3rd, 6th,
              9th).</p>

              <p>the back of me was once on tv..</p>
              <p>it was hilarious.. it showed me falling off the chair..</p>
              <p>i volunteered (actually, my sister volunteered me) to be medical backup since i'm a trained medic for a east coast cleanup.. the divers went there with their scuba stuff to clean up the mess in east coast waters..</p>
              <p>when the time to gather and listen to the organiser speak, the mascot turned up.. the mascot looked like the mutated illegitimate son of an unholy union between a ninja turtle and a bullfrog.. i was laughing so much i fell over..</p>
              <p>and that was what turned up on tv that night <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
