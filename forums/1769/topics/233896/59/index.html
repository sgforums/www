Thank god.<br><br>We are just more likely to go to Chinatown during a weekend to see whether there is something like Chinatown light up for the Chinese New Year Weekend.

They are way too expensive and might not suit her family.  She needs some fengshui stuffs in her home.  Quite a string of bad luck, especially with the children having bad dreams at night.<br><br>I also was having dreams, thats why I needed to move the bed and drink more chinese tea to stay awake during the days. Now adjusting my room to suit my fengshui so I can be waking up refreshed and helpful in the morning.<br><br>And oh....this is the first morning I woke up early in my room, without the need of a alarm clock.

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets say pork ribs. Get thin strips of them, cut into cubes with the bones in the centre.<br><br>Cubed/diced carrots<br><br>Diced Celery<br><br>Cubed/diced patatos<br><br>Chunks of winter melons (if you like them).  Tomatos or Western Spinach. Add them in only when you get home and boil the soup on high for a while, angle the cover so its does not totally cover the crockpot &amp; allows it space to boil, bubble &amp; cook your wintermelons while you go for a shower.<br><br>For a Minestrone Soup style.  You can cut a throw in one of those big onion.  One will do. So by the time you get home, even w/o the wintermelons, tomatos or western spinach, the patatos, celery &amp; carrots plus the meat can be drunk &amp; eaten straight-away.<br><br></div>
