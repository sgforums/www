            <div class='col-md body'>This should go into my blog.<br><br>Woke up early at 7.45am. Lazed in bed.  Finally, when I still dont hear the kids up. I got up, went for a leisurely shower, apply moisturiser blah blah blah &amp; put on shorts &amp; polo tee, though it was quite chilly.<br><br>Went kitchen, start boil water and make ready a flask of chinese tea.  Made it too thick though, had to water it down with more hot water.  Drink Tea.<br><br>Finally, hear the sis calls and goes upstairs suppose to piggy back little boy down.  Buts its morning and they are still clingy to their mama.  So my sister has no choice, to carry her little gal in front and piggyback the little boy down the stairs while I go forward to provide a ready cushion if my sis were to tumble, at least to tumble onto the auntie and we can all 4 of us slid down that staircase.<br><br>Then....made cheese &amp; apple butter sandwich for the boy.  And I had made ready his juice.  And cook noodle with leftover pork ribs for sis.  And start making the carrot cake for steaming and prepared porridge for kids lunch.<br><br>Then...went to the Van, removed toys, dust out the toy boy in the van. There was so many foodbits in that box enough to feed a army of roaches. Then sort of organised the place, stock up on the diapers &amp; generally keeping myself busy.<br><br>Come back into the house, ate some lunch, do some more washing up, soak the veggies and kept kids company while their mother has her shower.<br><br>Little gal starts crying and its time for their nap.<br><br>Once they are upstairs, I was busy at the garage removing a bicycle from the ceiling hook. Knocked my chin and nearly strangled myself with the bicycle as it was thankfully lowered down to the cluttered garage thru sheer luck that it was caught in so many ways by other contraptions stored in that space.<br><br>Finally pushed the bicycle aside, with its punctured tires and went in for a wash, but sis called for me and suggest I bring little boy for a stroller walk as he was not napping and creating a ruckus.<br><br>Went half hour walk....manzzz...its hard pushing stroller upslopes!  He still wont sleep.<br><br>Went home but Sis suggest a longer walk....so this time, I walked till the supermarkets outside the estate &amp; walked back home...Still he wont sleep!  My knees was killing me!  So was my arms cos the walkway are all slanted angle and its hard to maintain the stroller!  On the way, we saw dogs, and he was happy.  So I finally reached home; it was a 1+ hour walk.<br><br>Then rush to the kitchen and started cooking cos brother in law is coming home soon.<br><br>The little boy wasnt at all tired, but this auntie is!  I am ready to drop dead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sis just opened up a box of UPS stuffed with Hawaiian Macadamia Cookies.  The family have loved the cookies so much when they were in hawaii, they ordered more to be delivered to the home.<br><br>However, they were not the exact rectangular box shaped one.  They are the easier to ship Square shapped boxes.  Total of 4 box of delicious hawaiian Macadamia cookies. Beautifully packed.  I am too tired to want a cookie though.<br><br>And about that baking thing  I was suppose to do in USA.  For heavens sake!!! Cookies, cupcakes are all so beautiful and in abundance here in USA. Why would I want to go thru all that trouble to do baking myself?<br><br>Its like living in Singapore, and all you got to do, go downstairs and eat all those delicious hawker food! Why would you want to cook yourself?</div>
