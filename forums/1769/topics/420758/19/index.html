              <p>of course, I love my country too .... that's why I've taken steps beyond chatting on the forums about this issue, as some of you may know. </p>
              <p>I may have a very traditional asian mindset about this, but to me, there are overriding considerations above minor bouts of verbal incontinence from ruling politicians or policy lapses, or even the over-inflated ego of an old man, whom, like it or not, really built us up to where we are today.To me, stability, predictability and the big picture are more important than any sort of personal peeve or grevience that one may have.</p>
              <p>True, the MIW may have gotten long in the tooth, and certainly policy and administrative issues have struck people right in the ass. But I think a vote should be more than a revenge or axe grinding tool, or even as an outlet of displeasure, for the collective consequences can be far reaching.</p>
              <p>Will change happen one day ? I'm not sure when, but eventually, it will, for no party lasts forever. If nothing else, what I do not hope to see, and what i am hoping to avoid, is for the local political scene to degenerate into the circus that characterizes the democratic process of most other countries, east and west. When politicians tell you only what you'd like to hear, for you to feel good, out of fear for your votes going the other way, then, verily, you'll only get shows and theatrics from showmen and nothing else, like most other countries. It is implicit in the democratic process, goverment by the vote, that an emotionally mature and cool electorate is neccessary for it to work. This is something that cannot be learnt overnight; most other countries have not gotten it right yet, and we'd be kidding ourselves if we think we have. If anything, to me, this is the most damaging legacy of the past 40 years of MIW rule. For we have evolved into a people whom, actually, are too dependent on the ruling party for all the answers. And now, like an over-coddled child grown up, people are learning to use the ballot box to get what they want to hear. This, of course, is our right, but have we as a people learnt the responsibilities that comes with this right ? looking at the trollers in the ypap forums, at other forums, etc, I think not. I think we still need some years to learn that.</p>
              <p>Now if nothing else, if the MIW's last function were to be a holding and transitional force in politics, even if it's to slap down people like chee who's trying to degenerate our political scene into something unsavoury, while allowing the rise of a real viable alternative bloc to emerge, then perhaps it's all worthwhile.</p>
              <p>Why else, would they spread their legs wide open this time round ?</p>

              <p>the casinos are here.. i guess we can only minimise the impacts through our personal values</p>
              <p>depending on the MIW's values is a road to hell.. they've proven time again that they don't give a shit about the people they were put there to serve, they don't give a shit about the advice, the good sense, the logic of long term and the social good.. they just care about "growth" and the bottom line</p>
              <p>before the casino thing was put to a "debate" we already knew one will be built.. the MIW went ahead and built two...</p>
              <p>we, the people, will have to deal with the repercussions, not the MIW who are cloistered in their ivory towers...</p>
              <p>alas...</p>

              <p>When I first heard about the higher-ups thinking about building the casino, I knew that all this 'citizen consultation' was just a wayang. One way or the other, the casinos were going to be built.</p>
              <p>If they had been truly concerned about the will of the masses, they would have called for a referendum on the issue.</p>
              <p>That said, it's also true that personal responsibility plays a part. Nobody forced the CPT to walk into the casino and throw away his money there.</p>
              <p>I feel a little sad for him, considering that he threw away his money, family, career, freedom, and pretty much the chance at a normal life..... all for a chance at quick cash.</p>
              <p>But still, he must pay the price for his misdeeds, and I feel really sorry for the true victims of all this: his wife and kids.</p>

              <p>actually I'm not sure if the casino is causing more social problems or if they are just pulling out the previously hidden problems. There were afterall lots of illegal gambling, cruise ships and genting. Given that they can now blatantly advertise for gambling addicts to help them, more people could be helped too.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the recent increase in number of know gambling addicts reported is at least in part due to more publicity and awareness.</p>

              <p>well, for all that, you seem to want to stunt the growth of the

              <p>the unfortunate thing about democracy, or at least the brand of democracy that the opposition and their supporters are trying to force onto singapore, is that there is no middle ground, you're either for one side or the other, it forces you to commit to the whole package.</p>
              <p>Is the MIW perfect ? no, not by a long shot, for all the nice furry exterior there's an underbelly too, of course. Ditto the opposition, there are clowns like chee, and there are chaps who try to do what they think is best for the country. You said so yourself, that there were chaps you could trust among the ranks of the MIW, eh.</p>
              <p>And, just like you've decided that while there are idiots like CSJ in the opposition, there are people in the opposition worth your vote. I've decided that the MIW as a whole is better for the country for the next 5 years, for stability, for predictability, for gradual change, after taking both sides into account. And this was after a close examination of the existing opposition bloc, too. I have acquaintances who are card carrying opposition members, real ones, not forum trollers.  and I've spent plenty on opposition literature too. But I have found them disorganized, vindictive, and very wanting. I do not deem them worthy of my vote.</p>
              <p>If there comes a day when another bloc emerges that I think provides a viable alternative whole package, then my vote, as the vote of a responsible citizen, would be up in the air too. It's as simple as that.</p>
              <p>I would not, however, use my vote as an outlet for my displeasure at specific policies or greviences, assuming that the MIW would always be in power regardless. I think my right to vote as a citizen comes with more responsibilities than that.</p>
