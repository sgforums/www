              <p>well, I'm now convinced that they are a neccessity, I disagree strongly with the brand of politics certain sectors of the opposition are pulling. I think of it as not so much keeping the PAP in power, but to keep these other fellows out of power ......</p>
              <p>and judging from the comments floating around in fb groups and the forums here, many singaporeans lack the emotional maturity for a really civic and participative democratic process to work anyways.</p>
              <p>I'm very happy the SDP is coming to my neighbourhood, that means I can count my vote against them ..... once upon a time I'd perhaps have simply voided my vote, now, I'd put a cross besides the lightning bolt and be very happy to do it.</p>

              <p>remember also that I told you I'd hold my nose a little more
                  recently  and vote for the MIW ? ....</p>
              <p>well, I'm now convinced that they are a neccessity, I disagree
                  strongly with the brand of politics certain sectors of the
                  opposition are pulling. I think of it as not so much keeping the
                  PAP in power, but to keep these other fellows out of power
                  ......</p>
              <p>and judging from the comments floating around in fb groups and
                  the forums here, many singaporeans lack the emotional maturity for
                  a really civic and participative democratic process to work
                  anyways.</p>
              <p>I'm very happy the SDP is coming to my neighbourhood, that means
                  I can count my vote against them ..... once upon a time I'd perhaps
                  have simply voided my vote, now, I'd put a cross besides the
                  lightning bolt and be very happy to do it.</p>

              <p>well, when the fear for their jobs become overriding, then you can only expect douchebag politicians who'd do what feels good to you, instead of doing what's neccessary for the betterment country.</p>
              <p>Just look at the UK or the US for example, successive goverments are screwed over by the opposition, and by the people with their votes, cos no goverment has the balls to say, this needs to be done ! Cos they know, they'll be screwed over and lose their jobs at the next elections.</p>
              <p>now if one were to examine dispassionately the political systems of these countries, what sort of conclusion can you draw ?</p>
