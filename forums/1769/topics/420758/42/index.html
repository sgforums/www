              <p>The latest boo-boo was when this Indian told us he was going to give a re-test to help those who didn't do well for the previous paper. The new score, if better than the previous one, would replace it wholly.</p>
              <p>Which is utter bull-crap, since it would render the efforts of those who actually studied useless.</p>
              <p>The same cockster set a paper with A-F options when the answer sheet had only A-E. His amended, amended, and amended again answers came up with multiple answers for the majority of qns.</p>

              <p>They told me is open market. Wa laoz eh, the M'sian buses gets subsidised road tax, subsidised diesel, even LTA charges than S$30 of PSV road tax nia and ends up the route 95% is clocked in Singapore now.</p>
              <p>They simply refuse to do anything. Open market let foreigners compete on a easier platform</p>
