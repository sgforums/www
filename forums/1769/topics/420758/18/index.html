              <p>well, they are not doing what is good for us, they're not doing what's good for the country in the long run... fuck knows what they're doing now...</p>

              <p>let me relate what happened this weekend when S Iswaran or whatever the hell his name is, was directed to me by his sycophants...</p>
              <p>he started asking the usual "where are you from?" stuff... when i said over there the other side, not your constituency, he didn't know who was the MP of the other constituency.. he didn't even know when i told him what it was... i had to prompt him by outright telling him who the MP was...</p>
              <p>then when i asked him how come the place, surrounded by other constituencies is "Bukit Timah", he was muttering incoherently.. until i told him outright it was now under "Holland-Bukit Timah"...</p>
              <p>then i asked him why they keep redrawing the maps, the guy outright said it "wasn't our doing" which is the only direct answer i got from him!</p>
              <p>i asked him why again.. he muttered the public line of "more effective" and then started to stutter and mutter again... you could see his sycophants were almost in a panic...</p>
              <p>i told him that this was one of the things which pissed the people in the ground off, he said he'd take it up with the PM... which i doubt... and i said "i doubt you will.. and even if you did, the guy won't care"</p>
              <p>his sycophants quickly guided him away...</p>
              <p>all the time, his fake smile didn't change, all the time, he did not make eye contact with me even when he was attempting to address me...</p>
              <p>an MP like that?</p>
              <p>EVERYTHING in my yelled out "do not trust!!"</p>
              <p>i felt the same way with CSJ by just looking at him for the first time.. i felt the same way when one of the opposition idiots tried to talk to me.. i felt the same way when young PAP idiots talk to me...</p>
              <p>which taught me that politicians cannot be trusted no matter what party they come from... and therefore, always keep them on their toes, always make sure they are doing their job..</p>
              <p>that is our job... the job of we, the people..</p>

              <p>but actually, since an election is really about choices, and we seem to have a paucity of choices here, you mind saying who, other than clown chee, is a viable opposition candidate ?</p>
