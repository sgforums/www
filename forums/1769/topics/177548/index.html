            <div class='col-md body'>the problem abt going to JC or poly shld not be such a big issue really, if poly grads are given equal opportunities as the JCers to pursue a degree. spore education system is not very forgiving once we made a wrong choice previously, especially when u hv to decide what you want to be in your late teens where most of u do not hv real working experience in the area that u choose.<br><br>my advice is : the job environment and our interests are never static. choose one that u are passionate about. once your passion is there, it is tough not to do well. as long as u are the best in any one field, u will be appreciated. gd luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1) Poly only takes in poor grades students </strong><br>That's definately not true. Quite a number of courses have quite high cut off points. And also, alot of students with grades eligible to enter JC, may it be below 20pts or 10pts, do apply for poly too. It's all about their interests and what they wanna study. They choose poly not for the sake of studying in one, but because poly provides them with courses which interests them.<br><br><strong>2) Poly only offers Eng and Biz courses</strong><br>Of coz that isn't true.<br><br><strong>3) Poly students many dun get a degree later on (Poly have said at least 60% pursue a degree within 5 years)</strong><br><br>To pursue a degree after a diploma is a decision which is up to each and every  individual... some would just make do with their poly dip, some are willing to spend more time to further their studies. I'm not trying to generalise, but most of my friends/classmates who have been through poly education do further their studies, either in local uni,SIM or in universities abroad.<br><br><strong>4) JC students are more prepared into Uni education </strong><br><br>That's not true too.... in fact poly students are more prepared for uni education, especially when the field of studies are similiar/the same. Thats why some poly students get exempted from yr1 in certain courses offered by local unis.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I completed courses in BOTH a Junior College AND a Polytechnic, and here's what I have to say :<br><br>- Junior Colleges focus more on the academics.  I learnt a lot about how to present an essay better, how to formulate your arguments, etc, 'soft skills' that have proven to be very invaluable in critical thinking.  This will be very important when one proceeds to higher education in future.<br><br>- Polytechnics prepare one to be competent in a particular field.  There's theory AND practical training involved.  Thus, when a poly graduate enters the workforce, their contribution to the company can be almost immediate, because they have been rigorously trained to take on the challenges of their role.<br><br>One focuses on pure academics; another focuses on competencies.  Both have their use in our economy.<br><br>Academics should never be belittled - afterall, it's the basis where Research and certain fields like Medicine is built upon.  You cannot do without academics in any field.<br><br>Nowadays, both poly grads and 'A' level grads can enter the Universities to obtain the same degree.  So then, isn't it time to stop arguing which is more superior but instead, choose the path that one is most suited for?<br><br>I've benefited from BOTH and I don't regret the experiences I've gained from both.  The academics widened my perception whilst the competencies taught me valuable life-long skills.  I wouldn't trade one for the other!<br><br></div>

Even if they performed average for A Levels, they still can get into university. Diploma holders performed average you see where they go. That will be in terms of results.<br><br>Preparation in other terms, poly students will fare better.</div>
