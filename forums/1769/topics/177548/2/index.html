If a poly graduate is not in the top 5%, he won't be able to do the same degree with an A Level graduate with average results.

There are certain courses where you do not have to be in the top 5% of your cohort to gain entrance to a degree program.<br><br>And, you quoted ONE PARAGRAPH from my post, and omitted the earlier paragraph where I specifically mentioned that :<br><br>"Academics should never be belittled - afterall, it's the basis where Research and certain fields like Medicine is built upon. You cannot do without academics in any field."<br><br>That was after I had established that it's via 'A' levels that one gets stringent training in the Academics.
