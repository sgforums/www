But every day is Valentine's Day for this man who gave up his job to care for his wife in hospital day and night </span><br>By Maureen Koh<br><br>February 13, 2006<br><br>ON Tuesday, Mr Roland Lee will spend Valentine's Day in Ward 43 of the National University Hospital.<br><br>The clinical six-bed ward is devoid of any Valentine's Day frills like heart-shaped cards, expensive chocolates or flowers.<br><br>There, he will celebrate the true meaning of love, devotion and sacrifice - just as he has done almost every waking moment of the past three years.<br><br>He will, as usual, cut a lone figure in the corner of the B2-class ward, a familiar face who has made that corner his home away from home.<br><br>He has hardly ever left that corner. When he does, it is to run quick, urgent errands.<br><br>He has quit his job as a security manager. He has quit a normal lifestyle.<br><br>He is intent on giving his all to the woman he watches over, day and night.<br><br>She is Madam Soh Hong Kiaw, or Ah Poh, as Mr Lee calls his wife of more than 16 years.<br><br>Ah Poh is 52, frail and bed-ridden.<br><br>In the hospital bed, her fragile frame is shrivelled.<br><br>She is suffering from a rare medical condition known as Melas (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke) syndrome, which has caused her to be bedridden with stroke-like symptoms.<br><br>There are only five such known cases in Singapore, and she is one of two patients at NUH with the illness. (See report on page 4).<br><br>Roland knows almost as much about her illness as doctors.<br><br>He provided us with a stack of A4-sized printouts of research information he has culled from the Internet and books.<br><br>'This will help you understand the disease better.'<br><br>The 54-year-old could rattle off names of the medication, its uses, even statistics and relevant details.<br><br>Ah Poh, who turns 53 in exactly two weeks, suffered her first seizure in November 2002.<br><br>There were no warning signs.<br><br>Roland recalled: 'She was just like anyone of us before it happened.<br><br>'The illness was so rare with hardly any symptoms.<br><br>'Blood tests did not reflect any sign of diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol.<br><br>'By the time a CT scan was ordered for Ah Poh, it was too late.'<br><br>A scan later revealed a block in her lower left side of her brain.<br><br>She subsequently slipped into a coma that lasted for 48 days.<br><br>When she recovered, Ah Poh was only half physically able.<br><br>And she had lost 30 per cent of her mental capacity.<br><br>Today, her life is a routine of shuttling between the hospital and their home.<br><br>She had been in hospital for as long as 82 days in 2003.<br><br>This time, as of today, she's been warded for 15 days.<br><br>And he would be there, by her side, every step of the way...<br><br>NEVER GETS IRRITATED<br><br>SHE calls out occasionally to him, rattling off words that are barely intelligible to anyone. He responds tenderly in Hokkien: 'Ho, ho... will tell the nurse, will call the doctor.'<br><br>At times, she grumbles incoherently. But he takes it in his stride and continues to massage her hand soothingly, smiling indulgently at his wife: 'Ok, ok... I know, I know...'<br><br>This goes on many times in the four hours that The New Paper on Sunday spent with Roland.<br><br>Not once did he show any irritation. Instead he laughs and tries to explain to us that it is Ah Poh's way of getting his attention.<br><br>'Ah Poh is just scolding me. She always complains, lao de hen hui jiang hua (the old one is very talkative in Mandarin).<br><br>'She's annoyed that I'm talking too much and in doing so, I'm 'neglecting' her,' he said in English.<br><br>Roland, who worked as a security manager at the Woodlands Regional Library when Ah Poh first fell sick, would take the first MRT train from his 3-room HDB flat in Bukit Batok to the hospital at 6.15 every morning.<br><br>He would chat with his wife and share his schedule for the day while giving her gentle massages until about 10.30am.<br><br>He would then head to work till 9pm, when he'd make his way back to the hospital and accompany her until 11pm before heading home.<br><br>Roland said: 'Ah Poh used to ask me, lao gong (meaning husband), why are you so good to me?<br><br>'I told her, simply because I'm her husband. I took the vows we had exchanged seriously - that we would love and cherish each other, in health and in sickness, till death do us part.'<br><br>SHE SAVED HIM FROM DESPAIR<br><br>AH Poh was a friend of Roland's younger sister.<br>She came into his life when he was at his lowest point.<br><br>'My girlfriend of seven years had just broken off with me, after another unsuccessful attempt to register our marriage (because of immigration problems).'<br><br>He was then dabbling in some trading business.<br><br>Roland turned to drinking.<br><br>He was on an emotional roller coaster - until he met Ah Poh at his sister's home, where they had arranged to play mahjong.<br><br>That was in 1988.<br><br>Dates were fuss-free, said Roland. 'We'd meet for mahjong games at first.<br><br>'When I was gradually drawn to her cheerfulness, we started to go on movie dates.<br><br>'One of the dearest qualities about Ah Poh was, she never demanded to be pampered.<br><br>'She had a big heart - she was filled with compassion.<br><br>'And everything she did, she had her siblings in her mind and heart.'<br><br>'I knew she was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.'<br><br>In November 1989, the couple registered their marriage.<br><br>They could not have any children because Ah Poh had gone through several operations for incontinence which, they finally realised, was the first hint of the Melas syndrome.<br><br>Continued on next page<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>HE QUITS JOB AFTER WIFE'S TRAGEDY<br><br>LIFE after marriage had been simple but blissful.<br><br>Mr Roland Lee tried to provide the best for his wife Ah Poh and, knowing that she loved to travel, he scrimped and saved.<br><br>They've been to the Gold Coast in Australia and Yunnan, China.<br><br>But that was before the Melas syndrome struck in 2002.<br><br>'Yet I did not give up. I was confident. I prayed that Ah Poh would recover one day,' he said.<br><br>A near-tragedy in March 2003 jolted Roland into making another sacrifice: He quit his job as a security manager, which he had held for two years, to devote himself to caring for his wife.<br><br>'Melas syndrome causes a patient to feel disoriented. And so, even when Ah Poh is lying in bed, she'd think she was being turned upside down.<br><br>'Then she would struggle to put herself into the right position.'<br><br>To prevent her tossing and risking a nasty fall, hospital staff decided to tie her to the bed. Roland was anguished by this, even though he knew it was necessary.<br><br>Tears welled up as he recalled: 'I felt her pain and I was so frustrated that I could do nothing to ease her.'<br><br>He had a rude shock one morning when he reached the hospital.<br><br>'I found her entangled in all the strings; they were almost strangling her. Because she had lost so much weight, her head was caught between the railings.'<br><br>It was then that he made up his mind to be by her side every waking moment:<br><br>'Only I could give her the full attention she needed. I decided to quit my job and devote myself whole-<br>heartedly to caring for Ah Poh.'<br><br>It was difficult. 'I did not have any help. Everything was a learning curve. There were times when I felt so desperate that I felt like banging my head against the wall.'<br><br>'I had to repeatedly remind myself that I could not collapse because Ah Poh needed me - more than I needed anyone.' He sleeps about two to three hours at most a night.<br><br>He hardly leaves Ah Poh's bedside, even when she is in the hospital. A blue foldable PVC bed sits by the side table in the ward. Buddhist sutras play from a portable radio on the table.<br><br>Roland said firmly: 'I will not give up. I'm not ready to succumb to this battle.'<br><br>The scene repeats itself even when Ah Poh is allowed to return home. Daily meals for him consist of a kopi-o kosong (black coffee without sugar) for breakfast, followed by a packet of rice to last him for lunch and dinner. On days when Ah Poh is well enough to be home, he would cook simple dishes.<br><br>'When I have to see the doctor, or if there are really any urgent errands to run, my younger sister takes over for a couple of hours,' said Roland, who has been a Type 2 diabetic for 15 years, and relies on medication to control his condition.<br><br>His only past-time, he said matter-of-factly, is taking care of Ah Poh and chanting Buddhist sutras.<br><br>Top of his list of worries is the financial bind that they are in now.<br><br>NO MORE SAVINGS<br><br>Their savings have dried up.<br><br>He has lost count of how much he's paid for his wife's medical bills. She doesn't have insurance cover.<br><br>One prolonged hospital stay came up to over $23,000, but the bill, which was reduced to $4,000 after subsidies, was paid for by Medisave and Medishield.<br><br>'My wife's Medisave is down to slightly above $800 and mine is exactly $666.30 left,' he said.<br><br>He admitted that he was initially frustrated by the seeming lack of assistance from Ah Poh's other nine siblings.<br><br>'Yes, there was some bitterness in the beginning - I'd be lying if I said otherwise - but that's all buried now.<br><br>'I want my wife's final journey to be an easy one... I don't want her to feel that she's been a burden to me.'<br><br>A nurse had once asked Roland: 'What if you meet someone now who is drawn to your devotion and is willing to look after your wife, and be with you?<br><br>'Would you accept her?'<br><br>His reply? 'No one can predict the future but the answer is 'no' right now. I just want to devote my full attention and love on my wife.<br><br>'Ah Poh is all that matters to me at this point.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Malnourished as she can't retain food<br><br>PATIENTS with Melas develop brain dysfunction with seizures and headaches, as well as muscle disease with a build-up of lactic acid in the blood, temporary local paralysis and abnormal thinking.<br><br>In Ah Poh's case, the main complications she has suffered recently are related to her inability to retain food, causing malnutrition.<br><br>'This has included extreme weight loss, skin and chest infections,' said Dr Philip Iau, a consultant in NUH's Department of Surgery.<br><br>It has also resulted in neurological deterioration, fits, and tremors.<br><br>Ah Poh needs intravenous nutritional support as she cannot eat.<br><br>There is no known treatment for Melas syndrome which is progressive and fatal.<br><br>A witness to Roland's devotion is nurse manager Ms V Bathmavathi, who first got to know the couple in January last year, when she was posted to Ward 43.<br><br>She said: 'He never once sighs or gets tired in giving continuous love and care to his beloved wife.'<br><br></div>
