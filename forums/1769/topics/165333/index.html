'You have to go on your knees,' he insisted tonelessly, 'and crawl up to the altar. Kiss the altar cloth, then lie flat.'<br><br>'Then what?'<br><br>'Then God and the king forgave you,' he said, and waited. 'Just do it,' he snarled.<br><br>So I did it. I went down on my knees and I shuffled through the mud, and the silent lines of men watched me, and then Ã†thelwold, close beside me, began to wail that he was a sinner. He threw his arms in the air, fell flat on his face, howled he was penitent, shrieked that he was a sinner, and at first men were embarassed and then they were amused. 'I've known women!' Ã†thelwold shouted at the rain, 'and they were bad women! Forgive me!'<br><br>Alfred was furious, but he could not stop a man making a fool of himself before God. Perhaps he thought Ã†thelwold's remorse was genuine? 'I've lost count of the women!' Ã†thelwold shouted, then beat his fists in the mud. 'Oh God, I love ti<strong></strong>ts! God, I love naked women, God, forgive me for that!' The laughter spread, and every man must have remembered that Alfred, before piety caught him in clammy grip, had been notorious for the women he had pursued. 'You must help me, God!' Ã†thelwold cried as we shuffled a few feet farther. 'Send me an angel!'<br><br>'So you can hump her?' a voice called from the crowd and the laughter became a roar.<br><br>Ã†lswith was hurried away, lest she hear something unseemly. The priests whispered together, but Ã†thelwold's penitence, though extravagant, seemed real enough. He was weeping. I knew he was really laughing, but he howled as though his soul was in agony. 'No more ti<strong></strong>ts, God!' he called, 'no more tit<strong></strong>s!' He made a fool of himself, but, as men already thought him a fool, he did not mind. 'Keep me from ti<strong></strong>ts, God!' he shouted , and now Alfred left, knowing that the solemnity of the day was ruined, and most of the priests left with him, so that Ã†thelwold and I crawled to an abandoned altar where Ã†thelwold turned in his mud-splattered robe and leaned against the table. 'I hate him,' he went on, 'and now you owe me a favour, Uthred.'</span><br><br>Interesting read, and this book ends with the Vikings' dominance in England.
