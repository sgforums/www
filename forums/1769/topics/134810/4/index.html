            <div class='col-md body'>I think Babylover may have the answer to Wanda's question  regarding the NLB gardens:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BabyLover:<br><strong>July 23, 2005<br>Green and bear it<br><br>The National Library's 14 gardens are part of its award-winning green features, but only four are open to the public. What a pity<br>By Tay Suan Chiang<br><br>VISITORS to the newly opened National Library could be forgiven for thinking they have stumbled into The Secret Garden by Francis Hodgson Burnett.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-07-22/l10a.jpg"><br>Always open: The spa garden on level 10 (above) is open to the public and has seven 12-m tall plant towers, a reflexology path and pebbled pathways. It looks up to the pod (below) on level 16. -- DESMOND FOO<br><br>The building in Victoria Street has 14 pockets of greenery located up and down its 16 floors and basement.<br><br>The gardens, with vegetation forming 35 per cent of the total site area, provide a relaxing respite from the endless bookshelves and all that reading.<br><br>A pity then that only four of the 14 are open to the public.<br><br>'The gardens were mainly to help keep the building cool. That is why not all are open to the public,' says Mr Surjit Singh, the library's director of properties and facilities management.<br><br>The four gardens that are open to the public are: The sky garden on Level 5; spa garden on Level 10; and two within the Central Lending Library in Basement 1.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-07-23/l10b.jpg"><br><br>Even then, the two in the basement are accessible only during certain times, such as when the library holds literature and poetry reading sessions outdoors.<br><br>One of these features sculptures by local artist Chong Fah Cheong that were commissioned for the library. The sculptures sit against a backdrop of 5,000 bricks salvaged from the remnants of the old Stamford Road library.<br><br>The gardens on levels 5 and 10 are the only two with free access during library hours.<br><br>The one on Level 10 is the most impressive. The space - soaring to a height of three storeys - features seven 12m-tall plant towers for growing multiple plants in vertical stacks.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-07-23/l10c.jpg"><br>Sometimes open: One of two gardens in the basement within the Central Lending Library, it is open to the public only during reading sessions.<br>In keeping with its theme as a spa garden, you can find plants such as aloe vera as well as pebbled paths for those seeking a spot of reflexology.<br><br>Landscaping for the 14 gardens was done by landscape consultants DLQ Design, while maintenance will be by landscaping company Eco Flora.<br>[b]<br>Mark of success</strong><br><br>All in, a total of 120 species of tropical plants helps to lower the temperature surrounding the building and reduce the load on air-conditioning.<br><br>So, it is no surprise that the building was designed by Malaysian architecture firm T R Hamzah and Yeang, which is known for its climate-sensitive projects.<br><br>Malaysian architect Ken Yeang, who designed this library, has a reputation for using plants both inside and outside his buildings.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-07-23/l10d.jpg"><br>Never open: This garden on Level 7 is one of 10 gardens that are not accessible to the public.<br>For him, plants are not just decorative items but essential in helping to make a building more eco-friendly.<br><br>One of his most famous works is the Menara Mesiniaga Building in Selangor, which has segments cut out of several floors to insert high-rise gardens.<br><br>The gardens in the new library are just part of other eco-conscious features which won it the Platinum Award for the Green Mark Scheme. The award, by the Building and Construction Authority, is its highest for environmentally friendly buildings here.<br><br>One of these energy-saving features is the use of automatic blinds that are lowered in the late afternoon when the sun's rays into the building are strongest.<br><br>Others include shade fins all around its facade to keep the sun off its wide glass windows; daylight sensors that dim or switch off the lights when there is enough natural light; and rain sensors that shut off garden sprinklers when there is enough water for the plants.<br><br>Even the building is built off the sun's east-west path and the atrium spaces are located to channel breezes using natural ventilation.<br><br>Still, it may be the spa garden that is the big attraction for visitors.<br><br>Housewife Susie Lee, 35, was excited when she heard about it. She says: 'After shopping at Parco Bugis Junction opposite and borrowing my books, I can still get a foot reflexology session at the library.'<br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

Well, everything... especially when the Drama Centre is within the new National Library Building.<br><br>While stage performances can whet the appetites of theatre-lovers, the 50,000 reference collection will thrill book-lovers.<br><br>The Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, like many other parts of the library, is opened to the public.<br><br>However, there are some areas where only staff have access, and members of public will never get to visit.<br><br>Located at the top of the 16-storey building is an Observatory Pod - an area reserved only for functions and library events.<br><br>Two floors down is the Library's Corporate Headquarters housing some its administrative staff.<br><br>On either side of the floor are two gardens where only staff have access.<br><br>And in a corner is the Chief Executive's office where there is a meeting space and a glass door access to the garden.<br><br>Dr N. Varaprasad, Chief Executive of the NLB, said: "I have to admit because we are on the 14th floor, I have a nice view. But I have to admit that I have to share my toilet facilities with all my other staff, and queue up just like everyone else."<br><br>And in terms of furnishings, he feels his office would score a five out of 10. - CNA/de<br><br></div>
