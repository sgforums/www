              <p>To people who are so uncool</p>
              <p>There's alot of space in the front, at the back of the bus or train, have some common sense not to cram into my area and expect me to move and give way. I can and sometimes do but I think sometimes, I just wanna get in your face just to piss you off for the lack of simple common sense. Then to those who cannot stand it if I walk faster than you and you have to catch up just to cut me out again so as to show you are "better" than me. When you cut me, you think I don't know? You cut me at close range making me step on you -happy now? All of you people out there who are unhappy that someone didn't give way to you just because you think you exists and people have to let you have what you want. Please see a shrink, there's alot more things in life to worry about other than me cuttuing you, not giving you space (there there's lots but you just have to stand 3 inch from me as if you are surrounded by ghosts).  You have a bigger problem than you care to admit. Please don't take it out on other people. Please learn to use your brain. Please have some bloody common sense. Please know that everyone is a paying customer and everyone has equal rights. Live and let live. You might be happier with yourself and other people too.</p>

              <p>it's really about what you DON'T KNOW .... I know i have made over 30 phone calls to you from last week till now .... I know you are now sticking pins into a voodoo doll with my name on it, I know the manager probably gave you hell cos I blurted out something to him over an unrelated issue ..... </p>
              <p>BUT, I had to farking call so many times cos you couldn't farking solve my problem ! ... I asked very elementary questions regarding network generalities of the app .... none of which you could answer without consulting your colleagues and the development team chaps, that lead me to wonder if you were actually properly trained in this field or not ? .... where is Mr X btw ? .... the singaporean ? .... he KNEW what he was talking about .... what happened to him ? .....</p>

              <p>You suck. The only reason why I got you was because you were a 3G phone that came for free when I renewed my M1 Student Plan.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you have a serious attitude problem, what with your penchance for suddenly restarting when I'm busy talking on the phone.</p>
              <p>Pui. I'm gonna dump you for Sony Ericsson as soon as I can afford it. At least they know how to make good and reliable cellular phones.</p>

              <p>To: the REMF who stole my SAF New Balance</p>
              <p>KNN... I bought those shoes just two weeks before my ICT, you know! My current shoes are really falling apart, and I'm not sure whether they can last long enough for the AHM!</p>
              <p>Don't even talk about the AHM... I need proper shoes for everyday use!</p>
              <p>And I can't afford a new pair, you ball-less eunuch. My eMart credits are all used up. And as it is, I don't even have enough
              spending money for my normal needs for the rest of the month. So you want me to wrap paper around my feet and walk around in them, huh?</p>
              <p>DEATH TO YOU! BURN!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>You had better pray that I don't find out who you are.... else I'll take the biggest, thickest catheter I can find and shove it up your willy!</p>
              <p>And the biggest, thickest rectal probe goes up your anus!</p>
              <p>Oh... and I hope that by wearing those shoes, you get foot rot to the extent that your feet have to be amputated!</p>
