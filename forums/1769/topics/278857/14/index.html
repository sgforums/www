              <p>to young lady that got me 'kicked' out of the nice good personal assistant job that she has been eyeing.</p>
              <p>i really couldnt care less if you want my job.  polish up your english and people skills, especially with clients that is paying a minimum of 10+ k for a few days work.  and if you had been nice, i would have just trained you to be a reasonable personal assistant before i leave.</p>
              <p>it was depressing when you scare off clients with the way you talk to them and you got away with it because you are a rare legal secretary that took the pressure and low pay the way you did.</p>
              <p>most legal secretaries, especially in the litigation and criminal work, dont work long because of the low pay and tremedous pressures.  i respected your field of work, but does not mean that I a lowly clerk is actually more galmourous then you.  you got the idea yourself, which i hope you learn that its not as you think it seems.</p>
              <p>you may have a diploma in legal studies. but i have 3 others that is more related to human beings and computers.  So please, leave the customer handling and the taking care of bozzes's personal matters to the PA, and stop lowering yourself to be a PA/secretary/clerk.</p>

              <p>To Jo,</p>
              <p>You are very right.</p>
              <p>But I can never  say no to family.</p>
              <p>And I always buy clothing in pairs.  If I buy a pair of shorts, I must buy another pair in similar fabric or design, but in different colours......</p>
              <p>Much like if I buy a skin care, like for example.....a facial cleanser. I must always buy the full sets......which means buying a toner, a moisturiser &amp; a scrub or a mask.</p>

              <p>To my dear supportive friends,</p>
              <p>Some friends ride out the entire bus journey with you.  Most board your bus and alight a few stops later.  Others board and get off, only to board your bus again at a later stage.  And you'll always encounter a few who board your bus and leave you to pay for their bus tickets, leaving you shocked and broken-hearted. </p>
              <p>To those who have chosen to board my bus currently to take this difficult journey with me, I appreciate you guys very very much.  Although my bus is right now heading towards a yet-to-be-determined destination, thanks for riding out the bumps and dips and sharp curves and narrow misses with me. Thank you for your kind words, and thank you for not condemning my bus.</p>
              <p>Please also understand that I'm not quite myself at this stage and the bus I'm on is very beaten up and sorely in need of maintenance, but thanks anyways for selflessly and patiently sitting in my bus.  You have all made the journey bearable.  Although I am now poor, I am very rich simply because you have all chosen to board my bus and stay with me for the journey.  I hope none of you will ever want to get off my bus because I love you all. </p>

              <p>To the woman with that baby sling on you at Explorer Kid Downtown East Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p>That was terribly sickening of you to tell my nephew: Why did you hit my son!</p>
              <p>The boy was so ashamed that he was accused of hitting your son.  He tried to turn into a cube, hiding in one corner, much like what Wallie did in the Wall-e movie.</p>
              <p>For the record, his auntie (thats me) and his mama was actually sitting at the raised coffee shop area overlooking where the kids are playing.</p>
              <p>The nephew, neice and 2 new Malay big kids made friends and was playing together.  It was apparent that your child, which should be somewhere at 3 years old, was bumped as everyone is rushing to move around.</p>
              <p>Scolding my nephew, accusing him of hitting your son, is despecable! </p>
              <p>Which hand was used to hit your son?  Instead of speaking to a parent/guardian.  You had used your big fat chunky body to intimidate a skinny 5 year old and 3 other kids to tell them off? </p>
              <p>And when my sister went down the play area, to seek you out and speak to you.  You quickly grab your kid's hand and hurried your child out of the place???!!!!!!</p>
              <p>If your 3 year old cannot take rough play, then you really should have heed the situation and bring your child to the below 3 year old play area instead of having him at a location where lots of big kids are running around!  Because when kids runs around, they bump each other!</p>
              <p>It was further sickening, because my nephew is never known to hit anyone, he was usually the one being bitten, hit at, knocked at &amp; he most often use his body to block off any kid that may go into danger, earning himself more injuries, then to have some other kids hurt.</p>
              <p>And I am not boasting or trying to be protective.  My 3 year old neice bit her borther, kick, hit &amp; push her brother often enough, so I know my nephew's temperament.</p>
              <p>If he becomes autistic because of your psychological terrorism.  I will seek you out and make sure karma works out the same for your kids.</p>

              <p>to young lady that got me 'kicked' out of the nice good personal assistant job that she has been eyeing.</p>
              <p>i really couldnt care less if you want my job.  polish up your english and people skills, especially with clients that is paying a minimum of 10+ k for a few days work.  and if you had been nice, i would have just trained you to be a reasonable personal assistant before i leave.</p>
              <p>it was depressing when you scare off clients with the way you talk to them and you got away with it because you are a rare legal secretary that took the pressure and low pay the way you did.</p>
              <p>most legal secretaries, especially in the litigation and criminal work, dont work long because of the low pay and tremedous pressures.  i respected your field of work, but does not mean that I a lowly clerk is actually more galmourous then you.  you got the idea yourself, which i hope you learn that its not as you think it seems.</p>
              <p>you may have a diploma in legal studies. but i have 3 others that is more related to human beings and computers.  So please, leave the customer handling and the taking care of bozzes's personal matters to the PA, and stop lowering yourself to be a PA/secretary/clerk.</p>

              <p>Fanta,</p>
              <p>I was a legal secretary, back when the days that diploma in legal studies is still brand new.  And a Process Server which means I am not a pushover since I go places to stick papers (Tak Jua).</p>
              <p>Plus I did some police work, in coast guard, land, TP &amp; CNB.</p>
              <p>So nasty people, I am used to it.</p>
              <p>But playing office politics, is just like wasting my time.  The bozz offered her the job actually, but she declined, stating she has no confidence in her english.</p>
              <p>Then when I got the job, was so blardy new to the office, she suddenly decides she should be the PA.</p>
              <p>I was practically sianz half, cos I know, that a real diploma legal secretary, unlike me half bucket water legal knowledge, with private secretarial cert......cannot compare to a diploma of legal studies.</p>
              <p>I am ultimately a clerk.  A legal secretary is like a executive level person. So technically, the executive is arelady few ladder up on me.</p>
              <p>And my HR training tells me that we will have a really really hard time if we cannot engage any other legal secretaries with her diploma/experience.  So I really rather go then to lose a worker for the company.</p>
              <p>Even if I am a bozz, I will have rather let go of just a clerk/pa/secretary, then to let go of a executive that has the 'ability'.</p>
              <p>But till now, I am still pissed with that girl.  People skill, dont have, business skills...kinda lacking since she missed out a major billing that is 1/2 a million dollars.  Only hoard the files because the previous PA left those files to be finalised.....</p>
              <p>Manz.......I really hated to have to be biatchy.  Some kinda 'nasty' I am.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : Break all eggs and do chicken and egg last ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer :</span> Silly. Chicken will still lay. Except most eggs ,due to rare, become golden</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : Why chicken and egg last ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer :</span> Survival instinct regardless of climate, god's will, belonging, land and etc. We flourish faster than we are being eaten.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : How are chicken and egg related ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer :</span> Keep reducing the eggs and you will see in time the population of chickens will be controlled.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : Is it possible for chicken to hatch duck?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer :</span> It is possible. Happen once.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : Since happen before, why there isnt a relationship between duck and chicken</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer :</span> Duckling hatched. Grew up and lay duck egg but not chicken egg</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : How can I be certain?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer :</span> Keep reducing the duck eggs and the chickens will still flourish.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : How do I know that chickens wont lay duck eggs in the future?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer :</span> Chicken have its too many eggs to incubert itself.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : Do chicken prefer duck eggs more than chicken eggs ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer</span> : Duck eggs are not even in the picture at all.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff99cc;">You ask : How do I know all the above is true?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">I answer :</span> This are all facts!!!</p>
