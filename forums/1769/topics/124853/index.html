Inclined to luxuriate in the things which give gratification to the senses, but rejects anything tasteless, vulgar, or coarse.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Stress Sources </span><br>The tenacity and strength of will necessary to contend with existing difficulties has become weakened. Feels overtaxed, worn out, and getting nowhere, but continues to stand her ground. She feels this adverse situation as an actual tangible pressure which is intolerable to her and from which she wants to escape, but she feels unable to make the necessary decision.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Restrained Characteristics </span><br>Relationships rarely measure up to her high emotional expectations and her need to be made the center of things, leading to disappointment . Always has mental reservations and tends to remain emotionally isolated and unattached.<br>Feels that things stand in her way, that circumstances are forcing her to compromise and forgo some pleasures for the time being.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Desired Objective </span><br>Seeks success, stimulation, and a life full of experience. Wants to develop freely and to shake off the shackles of self-doubt, to win, and to live intensely. Likes contacts with others and is enthusiastic by nature. Receptive to anything new, modern, or intriguing; has many interests and wants to expand her fields of activity. Optimistic about the future.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Actual Problem </span><br>The tensions induced by trying to cope with conditions which are really beyond her capabilities, or her reserves of strength, have led to considerable anxiety and a sense of personal (but unadmitted) inadequacy. She attempts to remedy this by intense activity and by insistence on getting her own way. Faulty self-control can lead to ungovernable displays of anger.<br><br>The stress bit and actual problem is pretty true and it's all work related  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

As a result, she pursues her objectives with a fierce intensity that will not let go of things. Becomes deeply involved and runs the risk of being unable to view things with sufficient objectivity, or calmly enough; is therefore in danger of becoming agitated and of exhausting her nervous energy. Cannot leave things alone and feels she can only be at peace when she has finally reached her goal.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Restrained Characteristics </span><br>Unhappy at the resistance she feels whenever she tries to assert herself. Indignant and resentful because of these setbacks, but gives way apathetically and makes whatever adjustments are necessary so that she can have peace and quiet.<br>Clings to her belief that her hopes and ideas are realistic, but needs encouragement and reassurance. Applies very exacting standards to her choice of a partner and wants guarantees against loss or disappointment.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Desired Objective </span><br>Sets herself idealistic but illusory goals. Has been bitterly disappointed and turns her back on life in a weary self-disgust. Wants to forget it all and recover in a comfortable, problem-free situation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Actual Problem </span><br>The fear that she might be prevented from achieving the things she wants increases her need for security and freedom from conflict. Is therefore seeking stability and an environment in which she can relax.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
