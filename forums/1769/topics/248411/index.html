            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys... I'm sure you guys have heard my constant rants on my academic life, seeing how I'm one of the few people still studying in here....<br><br>Anyway, Bear once said that he thinks that I'm in danger of burnout, and I'm inclined to agree with him on this. I seem to be taking a lot less interest in things that I used to enjoy in the past (poetry, blogging, etc). And I'm finding it harder and harder to study properly. I'm now a lot less efficient at studying than I once was in the past.<br><br>I've been doing my best to pace myself as evenly as I can and to take regular breaks. But even enforced study-free nights like what I did last night don't seem to be clearing my mind by much. And I can't afford to enforce any more study-free nights... my first paper starts on the 21st.<br><br>With all this in mind I guess it's no surprise that I have elevated blood pressure (140/90). It's not hypertension, to be sure, but it's enough to get me to reevaluate my life.<br><br>Any tips on how to stave off burnout?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is a syndrome called 'lack of nature' syndrome...<br><br>what u need is to get out for a walk in nature.. every week or so...<br>somewhere where u can't have access to computer, something that makes u tired so u can't think of work, sometimes that lets you let go of what stresses u at the moment..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, you need to consult your doc about that blood pressure.  The latest news suggests systolic BP of 140mmHg and above to be considered 'hypertensive' but I think this is more an effort to be politically correct in the face of too many people scoring Systolic 130mmHg.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   You need a doc to run tests to conclude if it's stress-induced and not early-onset hypertension.  BTW, Singapore has more and more hypertensive peeps diagnosed in their 20's nowadays.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>It's hard to ask you to relax and slow down in the fast-paced Singapore society.  However you do need to find a way of destressing, be it talking it out with friends, taking some time-off during your vacations, or whatever.  Pace yourself.  I know you want to do well in your studies but you have to acknowledge your limitations and meet your basic needs for R&amp;R too.<br><br>EAsier said than done.  In my 20's, I was a Type A at work.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  And then, I became diagnosed with early hypertension (because of hereditary factors  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) and was put on Beta Blockers which slows me down so much I can't be fast now even if I wanted to.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Your Diastolic BP is still decent, which suggests that it's more likely than not to be a case of stress-induced hypertension.  But I won't take that as a conclusive diagnosis because what with lifestyle factors and diet and hereditary factors playing a huge role, you really can't play it too safe so go get checked out.<br><br>Other than that, I cannot suggest anything to prevent burnout short of a total time-off to just R&amp;R.  I was totally burnt out for years and couldn't get out of the rut until now, and that's cause I've physically removed myself from the lifestyle in SG and have finally more-or-less settled down here.<br><br>Good luck in finding your own oasis amidst the tumultuous sea of stressful living there!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, guys. Sorry I didn't reply earlier... the sgforums server slowdown just now impacted my ability to answer.<br><br>In any case, I agree that the only true solution would be a total time-off from academic-related stuff for at least a few weeks. Unfortunately, with my exams starting in exactly a week's time, that's absolutely not an option at the moment. The best I can do is to pace myself properly to prevent total burnout.<br><br>I just hope I can stave off its effects as much as I can till my last paper - which is on the 30th.<br><br>Anyway, I'll have a 3-month break after the exams. I think I'll at least take the first two weeks off before I go on a vacation job.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If you don't do that, you CAN really become burn out and that will affect your performance in exams too. :&gt;<br><br>Like elindra says, just go take a walk everyday or something. WITHOUT your notes! even a 30 minutes walk away  can give u some good rest <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think part of your problem could be your putting too much unnecessary pressure on yourself. Thoughts like if I don't score well for the exams, I'm dead meat - no job - no future, etc.......... could be eating up your energies. Indeed, too much pressure usually gets in the way of people putting in optimum performance, resulting in cracking up and choking instead of fluorishing and excelling.......<br><br>You clearly are experiencing symptoms of burning out but at this juncture, you shouldn't even think at all that you are coz you are almost home liao.....<br><br>This is the time when instead of yielding to your heart's pleas, you should let your head completely overrule your heart as this is only for a very short term and temporary only ma. Kick in the afterburner and persevere..... When the going gets tough, the tough get going! Pain is nothing but a good friend that just tells you that you are still alive! Get the theme song of Rocky blasting into your ears! Adrenaline can help to push you through......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Have faith in yourself and that everything will work out!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Good hunting!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
