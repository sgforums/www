I've read through the linked thread and it's, um, interesting.<br><br>Speaking not only as a practicing psychologist but as someone who's worked with abused children for years, I'll come at this from a practicioner's perspective.<br><br>I agree with kitty that textbook answers don't really offer much help.  However, generalising from personal experiences is precipitous as well, and if the person you're trying to help thinks you're being ignorant, you'll be shoved well behind square one.<br><br>The fact is that the motivation for self-harm varies on a case-by-case basis.  Yes, some people are just drama queens, and in such cases an REBT approach, such as kitty's SIA girl example, might work.  On the other hand, REBT, when used in the wrong situation, can lead to things going pear-shaped very rapidly.  For that matter, any approach used in the wrong context will produce detrimental results.<br><br>This leads to the point that, as a rule, any competent practicioner would know to perform some proper fact-finding before attempting to generate solutions.  Self-harm (or any observed behaviour) is only the symptom, not the problem itself.  Fix one symptom and another will pop up to take its place.<br><br>The underlying problem also dictates how effective the solution is.  The DSM-IV (the diagnostic bible) lists self-harm as a diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder.  A BPD person would be highly unlikely to have any interest in being a flying waitress for SIA, or any other airline for that matter.<br><br>The bottom line is that what's good for the goose is not always good for the gander, and jumping off the mark to close one door isn't going to do any good if the rest of the building's on fire.  You always need to make a point to find out what's going on before offering solutions - doing so too early is just a waste of time.<br><br>Anyway, for what it's worth (about a hundred bucks by the reckoning of the APS), that's a professional's take on this debate.</blockquote></div></blockquote>[/b]<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by udontknowme:</div><div class="quote_body"><span class="large">[b]THE FOLLOWING POST MIGHT BE TRIGGERING!!!</span><br><br>ok. no matter what the reason is, DO NOT scold them or call them stupid or stuff like that. even if they are doing it cos they think it is 'cool'. chances are, you calling them stuff like that will only piss them off and they will cut more.<br>and if they are depressed, all the more you cannot scold them or yell at them or call them stupid. the best advice i can give is to show that you care about them and that if you feel that you can deal with it, let them know that you are there for them should they need any help and that they can come and talk to you. if they do not wish to discuss about their cutting but other stuff. just let them talk. a lot of these people just need and want someone who care to listen to them. of course, there are those whom you KNOW cut but hide the cuts. do NOT go up to them to demand to see their cuts or go up to them and the first thing you mention is cuts. try to talk to see if they have any problems. let them know that you feel that they are upset or whatever and that you are concerned. some may respond well. other may just ask you to fark off and shut up or something. if that happens, do NOT pester them. let them be. you may want to try talking to them another time...<br>of course, there is a lot more to just this. but im not going to write a thosand word post on this...<br>i have interracted and discussed this topic with a hundred odd people for the past 5 years. so this post of mine will be coming froma cutter's point of view. how they feel and how they want to be treated.<br>the truth is that CUTTING REALLY DOES HELP! some people want to feel as though they are in control of the pain they feel. (trust me what you are depressed, you are in A LOT of physical emotional and mental pain. it feels as though you hurt inside outside and around you as a friend of mine said)<br>also, people who cut ARE NOT ALWAYS SUICIDAL! a lot of times when people die by cutting, its an accident. they accidentally cut too deep.<br><br>this topic may seem like a small thing. but it IS a VERY complicated thing. i can write a 5000 word essay on this and it still wont cover everything.<br>care and concern. thats really what you can do...[/b]</div></blockquote>She went on to accuse me of using my power as a Moderator.

Apart from what she's trying to be in front of you.<br><br>What I really wanna 'warn' you people about is that, I USED to be a 'friend' of viciouskitty74 too. Until she decided to go on ALL PERSONAL ATTACKs which started based on the trivial 'stubborn inappropriate comment' of hers mentioned at this start of this post. At that time when we were still friends, she was ALSO going 'PERSONAL' with MCSquare. Another MOD in AA.
