            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Over the weekend, I was camping overnight at Jelutong Campsite at Ubin.<br><br>This happened on Friday Night. About the middle of the night 3 am, a whole big group of teenagers stopped near my tent. They were speaking loudly, giggling, laughing at bloody 3 am in the morning!<br><br>After tolerating it for about 5 minutes, I got up and went over. There were about 20 of them I guess. I requested they keep their volume down please. It is the middle of the night and campers ARE trying to sleep. They told me they were going to sleep at this campsite for a couple of hours. Fine.<br><br>I returned to my tent, and still the discussion was going on in non-modulated, cannot-be-bothered-to-speak-softer tones. The giggling continued. Eventually though, they dragged out their fly sheet and the nearest group camped less than 10 m away from us. I wondered why. The campsite was HUGE. I mean H U G E, for anyone who have ever been to jelutong campsite, it is one big stretch near the beach. But NOPE, they camped less than 10m away from us. FINE.<br><br>My friend and I eventually gave up, sat up in the tent and observed them, waited for them to settle down. One guy actually came to about 5m away from us and SHINED HIS TORCH INTO OUR TENT. walao eh. (we were camping inside a hut because it was too damn hot to put up a flysheet) We were so shocked by the torch shining in, felt a little like deer caught in headlamps, mouth open probably could not talk.<br><br>later, a girl and a guy approached our tent. I don't know for what, because they sure did not 'call out' when approaching. We asked them where they were from.<br><br>They said NUS. No teacher with them, They are the leaders. At 3 plus am in the morning, I didn't have the clarity of mind to  ask them exactly which organisation in NUS. I suggested to them that as part of their camp, they should also share with their participants on the basics of Camping Etiquette and Basic Courtesy which will make everyone's camping experience a more pleasant one. They said eventually to give them a bit of time for their participants to settle down.<br><br>Fine, eventually some of them did. More groups came throughout the night. All equally noisy. We have given up in the need to get more sleep. Finally they left and we had peace.<br><br>But u know what's the worst thing? The worst thing was waking up at 7 am in the morning, and finding the front of the campsite littered with rubbish. Ziploc bags, half used mosquito coils, paper plates. These were all not there before.<br><br>WHAT THE HELL! NOTHING annoys me more than campers who are so bloody inconsiderate they can't clean up after themselves!!!!<br><br>Jelutong campsite is such a lovely campsite despite the lack of trees and heat. I felt like I was camping in the australian bush. I even saw a hornbill, a lovely sunset, lots of birds, butterflies and flowers.<br><br>so yeah. Please.. if you happen to know WHICH group of kids these are - Let them know that if they continue to do this, there will be NO nice places to camp in Singapore sooner or later, NO place they are have fun, night walks, and all the great memories they have of their trips - will be JUST memories - simply because they don't know how to take care of it.<br><br></div>
