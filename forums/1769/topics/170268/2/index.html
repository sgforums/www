            <div class='col-md body'>You know...i am guilty of being a loud at times.<br><br>But where i am, people are so... repressed. At first i was soothed by their exceptional politeness. All the Ps and Qs. But then you realize that means nothing. The politeness is at best shallow and after you get over the novelty of it, it can get quite (very) irritating.<br><br>Witness the bank teller:<br><br>"I'm sorry sir, but we will need some form of ID"<br><br>"Will a driving licence do?"<br><br>-takes out wallet, fishes licence from wallet -<br><br>"Yes...I am afraid we cannot accept provisional driving licences sir"<br><br>"!"<br><br>"Yes...you should come back with your passport"<br><br>"Can you explain to me WHY you cannot accept PDLs? It has been issued by the government after having inspected my passport, and after verify ing that the photo on the card is current. There is no difference between this and a normal driving licence."<br><br>"I am really sorry, but this bank doesn't accpet PDLs sir"<br><br>"! But WHY?! If there is a ligical reason, please tell me"<br><br>"Its bank policy"<br><br>"YOU FCUKING JOBSWORTH CNUT BTICH COCK SCUKER" (I wish i had said this...i really do)<br><br>But what i did was... "!..." and walked out.<br><br>This was after i have been told over the phone that my debit card transaction cannot be processed w/o me knowing some obscure password that i have not  used even once in the couple of years i have been there. No, they will not accept my card pin number, my address, my card number, my account number. They want THAT word. And my mum's maiden name.

I threw up a thread at the SO forum about some African bro I met speaking with a Singlish like accent, and sad to say, I think his grammer and his diction is a lot better than some Singaporean's ...<br><br>on the other  hand, if Singlish evolve to such a stage that it becomes "creolized ", as they say in linguistics ... we risk not being understood by the rest of the world ... it's like some of the carribean students here ... they are speaking "English" ... but trust me, no one other than themselves can understand what they are talking about ...<br></div>
