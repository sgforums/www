We went to look for a free parking space just beside the mall. Of course, you should follow where the arrow points so that you'll know what's the direction of the traffic. When we were almost going inside this vacant parking space, all of the sudden, we saw a car speeding "directly coming in front of us and *against the direction of the arrow - which simply means they on the wrong side of the road". 2 ladies went out of their car, around their mid-20's. *SHOUTING* (In Singlish) "We found that space first leh!". We tried to be calm, explained to them that even though they just came from the entrance of the parking space and the parking space is near that area....You're still using the wrong direction.<br><br>Worse came to worse.... They shouted "K.N.N.", (I felt really funny when they're shouting those words at people who naturally know what it meant)... Anyway, we just ignored them and left our car, they weren't happy and shouted "CCB!".   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Worse came to worse, I was pissed off. My friends stopped me from attacking those original CCB's! But, after I explained to them what it means, they agreed to join the fun! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>At the end, I told those gals not to show how stupid &amp; dumb they are in other countries. People might think Singaporeans are really that way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>That really ruined our day. And brought back an interesting story to my folks back home.<br><br>...............Isn't that loud?................... </div></blockquote>hey dude, I dont think there is such thing as system and manners in ME and MEs the last place on earth where you want to be mr nice guy.<br><br>Having said that, there is also a high chance that the 2 ladies might not be used to driving on the right side of the road.<br><br>Whatever it is, this kinda of shi.t happens everywhere it is not just singaporean.<br><br></div>

I've been in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, and yes, Dubai... It's just strange that it was a first time that I've seen such a *tourist* (I'm not sure if they are because they're driving a company car that says "SIA". Flight attendants, I assume?<br><br><blockquote><br>Having said that, there is also a high chance that the 2 ladies might not be used to driving on the right side of the road.<br></blockquote>Could be but not with a *HUGE WHITE* arrow pointing in front of them?
