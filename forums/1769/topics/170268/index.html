            <div class='col-md body'>Sawadeeeeeee.....!!  Phom cheu Gentlerock.<br><br>Greetings from Khrungthepmahanakorn (aka Bangkok).  I'm here for the 90th time on a semi-working, semi-holiday trip.....and after a two-month lapse, I still can hold a simple conversation in Thai <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .  Just came back up to my hotel room and something interesting (disgusting) happened in the lift.<br><br>So on the way up to my room, I shared the lift with two other groups of people.<br><br>Group 1:  Two Singaporean women, who were chatting about their computer keyboards being worn out.  Yes, of course their conversation could be heard in the lift, but it was by no means intrusively loud.  Acceptable by any Asian standards (unless you're the type who is used to whispering in lifts).<br><br>Group 2:  Two women, one most likely a Singaporean (from her accent), the other spoke with an American accent (she's Asian).  Dyed and styled hair, well-dressed, with loads of shopping.<br><br>The women who chatted about their computer keyboards (Group 1) left the lift first, since their rooms were on a lower floor.  After they had exited, the remaining two women (Group 2) made some loud comments, their exact words being "Typical Singaporean!  Can hear them from a mile away".  The irony of it all was that their comments were even louder than the "loud" women they were criticising.  Sheeeeesh, what dumb poopoos...!!<br><br>Honestly, if Group 2 had thrown their criticisms softly, it would have been totally fine.  But to LOUDLY criticise others for being too loud is, at best, hypocrisy + blind arrogance + stupidity....especially when the criticised party wasn't too loud at all.  Seems to me like a failed attempt by Group 2 to promote their own social status.<br><br>On a totally different topic, I went to the all-new sparkling Siam Paragon today (supposedly the biggest shopping mall in Asia?).  If size does count, then this would be the most potent of them all!  But its too high-class for me, with all the expensive branded stuff.  They had a car exhibition there today too, with Ferraris and Lamborghinis (isthathowyouspellit?) displayed, with gull-wing doors opened and all.  Nahhhh....I still like my Subaru.  At least I have a backseat.....especially useful when my wife drives and I sit behind to play the role of backseat driver. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ooooh...Thai traditional dance starting on TV now....gotta go!!  Always loved to watch these.  One day, I'm gonna be able to curl my fingers as far back (although this might be dangerous at the age of 39)....<br><br></div>

I see with my own eyes lots of parents and grandparents teaching/training their children how to cut queues and rush for seats on buses and trains and other public places, mind their own business and never help strangers, never to help their own friends or classmates because they are competition for examinations/entrance into good schools etc. How do you think these kids will turn out? Some teachers I know have commented that whatever good values they try to instill in children often gets reversed by the parents at home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
