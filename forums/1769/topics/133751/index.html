            <div class='col-md body'>one wonders what the term 'best match' really means?<br><br>i mean, is it supposed to be that person who engenders all the qualities &amp; attributes you think you want in you ideal partner? Or someone soo different from you &amp; your world that he/she is able to see you from a completely abjective perspective &amp; be able to see you for who you really are?<br><br>my last r/s was with a person whom i thought was 'the one' cuz we shared all the same interests, tastes etc but when it came to the crunch, it seemed we never really knew who we were at the core level?<br><br>now the love of my life i feel i have known all my life - &amp; we are so very different! Go figure heh, sometimes cupid can't hit you if you're standing too close to the wall.

A match is best for you at that point in time.  It doesn't necessarily mean it remains the best match when you're 40.<br><br>Assuming the above, as we go through different stages of life, there are  chances of finding a good partner.

Ppl sometimes like to say, do something abt it else if it ended, you'll regret. But there's only so much one can do. All things happen for a reason.
