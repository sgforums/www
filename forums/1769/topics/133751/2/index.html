He thought it would be his ideal future and every night he pray to god that his wish can come true<br><br>but when he grew older, he slowly forgot abt this wish. He found a very good job in the city so he moved into an apartment there. Met a beautiful brunette girl who can't sing but is an artist. Have 3 daughters who would run and hug him when he reach home. And 2 cats who ignored him. He was happy.<br><br>Until one night, suddenly he had the dream again, and next morning when he woke up, he looked at his brunette wife humming out of tune to herself while preparing his breakfast and he felt very annoyed with her. He went to work in a bad mood and felt he hated his job. When he reached home, he felt the shrill voices of his daughter giving him migraine. He felt grounchy and unhappy and felt that life was damn unfair to him. He had been a good person, prayed hard, how come his life was still so unlike the perfect life he always dream for.<br><br>Finally he got so depressed Blah Blah then he want to commit suicide.
