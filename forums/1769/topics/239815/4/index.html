Expensive experience huh?<br><br>*sigh* Transitions are almost always difficult and expensive. You know my story, relocating every 3 years. All that moving has only compounded my debt situation. Digging out of debt takes time and discipline and when we're almost at the surface, it's time to move yet again. Can't win. Since this is our very last duty station, it's prompted us to buy a place since we receive a housing allowance. IMHO, mortgages are a necessary evil. For now that allowance pays for 90% of the mortgage until the hubster retires this year. *gulp* Like they say, MG, "Onward and upward".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Yeah... some of us get burnt!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Mortgages are scary!  Once you take out a mortgage, it's like die-die must work!  With your dying breath, you still have to work otherwise, you won't have a roof over your head!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Scary thought, but it's part of what it means to be a 'responsible and independant adult'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think the stress increases double-fold when you are married with kids.  But then again, in such situations, having double wage earners to share with the bills can ease the situation somewhat, provided the extra family expenses are not astronomical!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
