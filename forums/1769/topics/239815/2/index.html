I seriously looked at doing it ... but then I did my sums and realized that with properties, you can only play flipper once ... cos after the first deal, you'll be looking at assuming ever bigger risks with each successive properties, and pumping more and more of your own money into it .... and that is assuming that property prices keep going up, eh ....
