            <div class='col-md body'>Hi....this is quite embarrassing for me, but I'm worried enough to ask for opinions.<br><br>That night I was at a pub with this friend who kinda showed a dirty face everytime I said I needed to go home.  So I give my friend face lor.... stayed for as late as I dared to, before we left (which was unfortunately too late).<br><br>After dropping my friend off, before I hit the main road, I SMSed my wife to explain to her why I was late and asked her not to internally latch the main door yet (we have an agreement that I have to be home before this happens each night - an agreement which she takes very seriously).  I SMSed her because she won't answer my the calls if I'm late.<br><br>Problem is that there was a traffic policeman was hiding there near the road exit from her apartment.  He saw me SMSing and confiscated my phone.  I tried to explain to him vaguely that I had urgent family commitments but he just wouldn't hear of it.  It was difficult for me to elaborate on the truth too much, so I just kept saying "urgent family commitment", which I now think sounded like lame BS.<br><br>I read the police website and it says that first offenders will have to attend court to receive a penalty of 12 points + max. $1000 and/or 6 months jail (handphone forfeiture and driving ban are options).  However, my "experienced" friends tell me that its usually 12 points + a few hundred bucks + 6~12 months ban from driving.<br><br>Does anyone know in reality, what the penalty for first-time offenders usually is, please?  And will they return our handphones?  (I hope they don't auction off the phones?  Cos I have some very personal data in its memory card...).<br><br>I'm still nervously waiting for the official summons letter.  If you can, please provide some information for comfort because I'm really quite nervous now.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>since he is a first-time offender i doubt there is even a suspension.<br><br>just act remorseful in court and ask for leniency.  dont argue, plead guilty and the court will be forgiving.<br><br>afterall they are not out to ruin your life.<br><br>you can also through the lawyer explain why you were calling your wife.  this is a good mitigating factor.<br><br></div>
