            <div class='col-md body'>Just continuing from our jive pad thread.<br><br>An ex-secondary school friend is the neediest person I have ever had the unfortunate luck to meet. Her life is fraught with emotional issues, low-self esteem, OMG. I was her friend for about 10 years. Heng ah I got married and left Sg and lost touch with her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>When we were in primary school, she had complaints about her mother who loved her two younger brothers and didn't care for her, etc. When we were secondary school, it was about how fat she was and how no boy found her attractive. When we left school, it was about how unloved she felt. When she finally had a boyfriend it was all about he treated her, etc. I lost track of her (heng ah) for a couple of years then (suay-suay) I bumped into her again and she had a new boyfriend and the complaints and neediness started all over again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

She didn't need to tell me but I know she was seething with jealousy that I had gotten married to a nice guy and had two kids, something that she had been craving for for herself. So it was just as well that I am no longer in touch with her.<br><br>She should be 40 this year.</div>
