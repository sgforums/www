Not all ADHD or ADD children are naughty - they just learn differently.<br><br>It is easy to claim its just parents' inability to control their children - There are really some parents who lack parenting skills. but how do we explain other parents who can have 2-3 kids, yet they may have extra difficulty with only one of the children?<br><br>How is it that the same parents, with same parenting styles can produce such different behaviours in their children if the answer lies simply in Nurture?<br><br><strong>In time these parents will learn how to handle their children better if they are given time.</strong> But are they?<br><br>The reality is, are people tolerant during this process? Perhaps with less societal pressure for kids to behave in a certain way, in a certain place, at a certain time - there will be less need to label these kids with an ailment.<br><br>If people are more tolerant, there will be perhaps less pressure on parents to resort to medication to control their children.<br><br>Ok.. its out of topic liao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> SOrry abt that.<br></div>

But after some research in the internet and read Bear's post, understand liao...<br><br>But I do believe tat there r bad times where people have to be an emotional vampires... Not tat they want to but it is natural for them to be 1...
