Hopefully that 7-8 years of togetherness is strong enough to bring you both back together.

In fact, the minute I smell something not right, I walk away from trouble.  Nip in the bud, as they say.  Don't start.<br><br>Relationship can be beautiful and can be painful.  Both at the same time or at different time.<br><br>You both will have to talk it out.  Dig deep where the problem is.  You admitted that you neglected her which I wonder if you have begin to take her for granted.  That is a grave mistake we make, at one point or another.  It can be a poison or disease in a relationship.  If you don't check it, one day the relationship will just die a natural death.<br><br>Anyways, I wish you well and good luck in your salvage.  Hopefully that 7-8 years of togetherness is strong enough to bring you both back together.  Sometimes, a little "incident" jolts one up and when awaken, the relationship can be more beautiful and lasting.  It is one of those through thick and thin and gone through one of life's challenges.  Every obstacles when handled carefully strengthens the relationship.<br><br>Stay well.</div></blockquote>Thanks!

            <div class='col-md body'>1stly, i strongly think that, that guy is a jerk... but i think that ur r/s had dragged on for too long w/o progress, thats why ur gf had a change of heart or a dying of passion. anyway i think that her heart is no longer with you. she still stays with u because of her commitment to you, sadly, not much feelings involved here.<br><br>i feel sry for you pal... i know you must be in pain... but if she leaves u in the end, i know that she would be the one who lose out... coz she left a man who really loves her. recently i saw this quote "she lost someone who loves her, she should be sad. you lost someone who doesnt love you, you should be happy."</div>

You both will meet more/new people, friends, colleagues, blah, blah.  There will be/may be temptations but if there is NO commitment or there is problems in the relationship, it is so easy to give an excuse to sway.  Our partners are after all, not angels.  And neither are we.<br><br>One thing I tell my husband is, he has to give me the chance to right a wrong so if he is unhappy with either me or an issue, he has to speak up.  Likewise, I do the same which pai seh, sometimes can be classified as nagging.<br><br>If I can be of any encouragement to you at all, I have been with my husband for 25 years and am still in love with him.
