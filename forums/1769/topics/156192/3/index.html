But nevertheless, it takes two hands to clap, so both also have their issues and only both of them can resolve it.  How much they want the relationship to work.  If one wants it bad enough, one will make it happen, I guess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Littlestream, as ever, has her finger on the pulse here, but I think that Cams is a bit closer to the point.<br><br>Don't take this as me trying to beat up on you here, Kaden, but the crux of the matter is that you neglected your girlfriend and, knowing that this has been going on for months, did nothing about it - if you found an out-of-place lump somewhere on your body, would you ignore it for months before seeing the doctor?  Being busy with work is also no excuse - I'm off travelling on business one out of every three months, and I know plenty of people who have been doing the same (maybe being gone even more often), and none of us has this problem because we make a point of making the most of our time with our partners.<br><br>I'm mentioning this because it is a key element in what you need to do next.  The key mistake here is yours - your girlfriend's feeling neglected and on top of that, eight years is an awfully long time to go on without taking it to the next level.  If I were her I'd be questioning your level of commitment and how much this relationship really means, and therein lies your weak point.  At this point, saying that you'll be sore if it's over, but c'est la vie, is absolutely the last thing you should be doing if this relationship means anything at all to you.<br><br>I know you probably don't mean to come off that way, but you do present yourself in that manner.  In fact, it appears that you don't seem to have expressed yourself very well to your girlfriend at all, and that's something that you're going to have to fix.  So you guys have been together for so long, but is it still a good thing or are you guys just in a rut and unwilling to make any changes because of discomfort?  You're going to have to start making your feelings clear, pal - that'll go a much longer way than breaking that cock-gobbler's face. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
