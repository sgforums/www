              <p>this should go under the insane and weird news thread, but I think this extra-ordinary person deserves a special mention ....</p>
              <p>now who would you blame for the SARS .... </p>
              <p>God ? the goverment ? ..... ermmm ... homos ? ... the abortionists ? ..... </p>
              <p>and who do you think saved Singapore from the Tsunami ? ....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Leading Singaporean lawyer blames abortion for SARS</strong><br>          </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">One of Singapore's leading 
              	lawyers has claimed that SARS was God's punishment for the country allowing 
              	abortion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr Thio Su Mien is the founding partner of TSMP Law Corporation and the 
              	first female dean of the law faculty at the National University of 
              	Singapore. Which are quite staggering achievements for someone who appears 
              	to be one card short of a full deck. After the outbreak of SARS, Dr Thio 
              	said that she and her colleagues prayed for forgiveness and repented for 
              	their nation's sins - and as a direct consequence Singapore managed to avoid 
              	the tsunami.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr Thio, who refers to herself as a "<em>feminist mentor</em>", also hit 
              	the headlines for attempting to take over AWARE, the Singapore womens' 
              	rights organisation, and replace its committee with members of her church. 
              	The attempted coup failed last weekend, with the bruised Dr Thio complaining 
              	that AWARE's sex education classes for schoolchildren would result in "<em>a 
              	generation of lesbians</em>". </span></p>
