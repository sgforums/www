            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly agree with Mr Leon Tham on first being a Singaporean, then a Chinese (ST Oct 24).<br><br>I've had the opportunity to live in Shanghai for about three months and found myself wrestling with the question of identity, be it national or cultural.<br><br>From my stay in China, I found myself to be so different from the local Chinese. We grew up with different experiences and are shaped by different cultural and linguistic backgrounds even though we are essentially from the same gene pool.<br><br>To prove a case in the linguistic context, terms like 'lu' and 'kai' popped up in work meetings which I found to mean aluminium and calcium respectively.<br><br>I've never heard of such terms before I was in China. I cannot even fathom the names of other common elements like silicon or common everyday terms like 'desktop shortcut' in Chinese.<br><br>However, it was more than the language. Once, a Chinese colleague was trying to tell me how to write her name and mentioned the 'Jin' in 'Ba Jin'. I asked her what was 'Ba Jin'. She was in disbelief and asked me if I had never heard of the famous Chinese author Ba Jin or read his books. The fact is I had not read any of his books or a book by any famous Chinese author. Identity crisis was setting in.<br><br>Most of us grew up reading Enid Blyton, Hardy Boys and Roald Dahl. Children even during my time grew up watching Sesame Street, which is virtually unknown in China.<br><br>This presents a unique problem, one I term 'The dichotomy of identities facing Singaporean Chinese'.<br><br>Chinese culture has a huge impact on Singaporean society but at the same time, our upbringing, outlook and identity aren't that Chinese. This is a difficult issue to resolve, perhaps one which is unresolvable.<br><br>Many Chinese Singaporeans may resist this notion but I think we share more cultural experiences with the West than with the Chinese per se, even though the Asian mentality may be very prevalent in our society.<br><br>For me, this is indeed an odd situation to be in and it tugs at my cultural identity in different directions.<br><br>Eng Zhen-Hui<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I would say that we have some things in common with the west and with China. We are unique in the sense that we are a blend of both East and West.<br><br>We are by race chinese. However that does not shape our beliefs, our culture, education etc. The living environment does. Even if we were to compare our culture with the West, we will find many differences once we are living there because Singapore is such a unique blend of cultures itself.<br><br>If a PRC husband and wife were to migrate to USA and have children there, their kids won't be able to identify with the culture in China as well. The Chinese might think we are the same because we are of the same race.<br><br>Anyway, in Singapore itself, there are already a 'divide' between the more 'Ang Mo Pai' Singaporeans and the 'Cheena' ones. The lifestyles and beliefs are really different from what I have seen.<br><br>However, ultimately what is most important is respecting each individuals ideals and practices. Afterall, the whole world is a melting pot of cultures and practices with technology bringing us closer day by day anyway.<br><br>Just my 2 cents  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

For instance, my parents were schooled in English, with Malay as the 2nd language, because back then, we were a part of Peninsular Malaya.  Their parents could speak their own dialects, having come from China, but they don't know much pu tong hua.<br><br>So, my parents end up being able to speak Mandarin, but of course, their English and Malay ended up being much better.<br><br>Not by choice, but by nurturing through the education system here at that time.<br><br>I struggled with Mandarin, growing up.  I had she-devils for Mandarin teachers and they instilled so much fear in me, I was largely paralysed and crying each time I had to do Chinese homework - I didn't know what to do, couldn't catch up with the lessons, parents couldn't help, and worse, at that time, there wasn't such a thing as 'tuition' or at least, it wasn't a popular concept then.<br><br>I had a morbid fear of Mandarin, up till Sec 3, when I finally had a sweet Chinese teacher, who actually made me pretty fascinated with the language, which made me watch more Mandarin TV shows, which in turn inspired me to read Qiong Yao (with a dictionary close by, of course!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ).<br><br>So, my English is way better than my Mandarin, not by choice, but by nurturing.<br><br>Does that make me any superior than you, my Mandarin-speaking counterpart?  Nope.<br><br>Does that make you any superior than me, a jiak gan-dang person?  Nope.<br><br>It just means that we're both Chinese, but brought up under different circumstances, and with different backgrounds and exposure.<br><br>Live and let live!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
