They celebrate all kinds of religious festivals together, but they don't ask people to put down their race on a form. Their cooking and food gelled together. Just the other day, I was down at Little India with my fiance, and I was thinking if his race was not Indian I would probably not be there. I bet most people are the same too. I would probably not have tried the Indian food. What most of us know is just prata for Indian food, and maybe briyani? But it's so much more.<br><br>Race is a dumb theory. We are all homo sapiens, unless some of us are actually neandethals in disguise. We just look different because we have lived for generations in different climates. We developed our own cultures because of the climate and natural barriers. But I don't see much point in segregation because at the end of the day, we can procreate with each other, therefore affirming the fact that we are same, and any differences that we view one another in, is merely a product of ignorance.</div>

We grew up with different experiences and are shaped by different cultural and linguistic backgrounds even though we are essentially from the same gene pool.<br><br>To prove a case in the linguistic context, terms like 'lu' and 'kai' popped up in work meetings which I found to mean aluminium and calcium respectively.<br><br>I've never heard of such terms before I was in China. I cannot even fathom the names of other common elements like silicon or common everyday terms like 'desktop shortcut' in Chinese.<br><br>However, it was more than the language. Once, a Chinese colleague was trying to tell me how to write her name and mentioned the 'Jin' in 'Ba Jin'. I asked her what was 'Ba Jin'. She was in disbelief and asked me if I had never heard of the famous Chinese author Ba Jin or read his books. The fact is I had not read any of his books or a book by any famous Chinese author. Identity crisis was setting in.<br><br>Most of us grew up reading Enid Blyton, Hardy Boys and Roald Dahl. Children even during my time grew up watching Sesame Street, which is virtually unknown in China.<br><br>This presents a unique problem, one I term 'The dichotomy of identities facing Singaporean Chinese'.<br><br>Chinese culture has a huge impact on Singaporean society but at the same time, our upbringing, outlook and identity aren't that Chinese. This is a difficult issue to resolve, perhaps one which is unresolvable.<br><br>Many Chinese Singaporeans may resist this notion but I think we share more cultural experiences with the West than with the Chinese per se, even though the Asian mentality may be very prevalent in our society.<br><br>For me, this is indeed an odd situation to be in and it tugs at my cultural identity in different directions.<br><br>Eng Zhen-Hui<br></div></blockquote>got news for you.<br>westerners don't share your sentiments</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm surprised by the negative feelings towards the mainland chinese. It is important to realise that every race/country/religion has its fair share of black sheep. I for one, do not think that identifying oneself as westernised gives you a stronger claim to be the fairer species.<br><br>The chinese may be ignorant, but that is the result of having had a closed society/economy for decades. For things they have not seen or experienced, they can only make assumptions. Of course when the reality is beyond their expectations, they show surprise. It is only natural.<br><br>Moreover with the Singaporean government trumpeting on a daily basis the claim that this island state is the bridge between the East and the West, who would not expect the Chinese in Singapore to speak mandarin?<br><br>Are the western nations also not intend or ruling the world and grabbing resources for themselves? If not, why was Singapore a colony and the US still in Iraq?</div>

It is important to realise that every race/country/religion has its fair share of black sheep. I for one, do not think that identifying oneself as westernised gives you a stronger claim to be the fairer species.<br><br>The chinese may be ignorant, but that is the result of having had a closed society/economy for decades. For things they have not seen or experienced, they can only make assumptions. Of course when the reality is beyond their expectations, they show surprise. It is only natural.<br><br>Moreover with the Singaporean government trumpeting on a daily basis the claim that this island state is the bridge between the East and the West, who would not expect the Chinese in Singapore to speak mandarin?<br><br>Are the western nations also not intend or ruling the world and grabbing resources for themselves? If not, why was Singapore a colony and the US still in Iraq?</div></blockquote>you got it all right!!!<br></div>
