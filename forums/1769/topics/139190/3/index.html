While Hitler was "admiring" the British people, he was violating the Treaty of Versailles by reoccupying the Rhineland, building submarines and remilitarising.<br><br>Neville Chamberlain was too damned busy proclaiming "peace in our time" to see how dangerous Hitler's actions were for the rest of Europe.  Despite protests about Germany's rebuilding of its military, he sat on his hands because he wanted to make friends with Hitler.  If he had had the spine to do something before 1936, Germany would not have caused as much trouble as it did.<br><br>As for the Soviets, you DO realise that no alliance was struck because nobody could agree on who was in charge (e.g. on 18/19 March 1939, Britain and Russia could not work out which countries made up the proposed alliance), and five months later Hitler slid right in and signed a non-agression pact (which was of course violated) only because Stalin had no confidence in the alliance, right?<br><br>Sure, Hitler hated communists, but not enough to keep him from striking a deal with them, eh?  For all of his love for British manners, history has shown that the sleazebag was happy to hop into bed with anybody, so long as he got his way.<br><br>Try reading - maybe you'll find out what facts are and what they do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
