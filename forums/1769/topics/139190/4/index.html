This is Singapore.  We don't mention said country and democracy in the same sentence 'round these here parts, so what the hell's your beef?<br><br>Listen up and listen good, booster.  <strong>The topic here is the misguided attempts of a bunch of dickhead teenagers trying to argue that Adolf was a model of good leadership.</strong>  If you're not either arguing that he is or he isn't, your post has no place here.  This particular post isn't about free speech or democracy - it's about thread integrity and the right of someone to click on this link and see posts about <strong>THE TOPIC </strong>on one side of the argument or the other.  Is that simple enough for you to understand, or do you need to get a PhD to decipher that for you?  Personally, I think you'd be better served by having your mommy illustrate that simple point in crayon for your limited intellect.<br><br>Sure, you may feel that it's your right to push sh!t if you want to, and hell, I'll tell you to knock yourself out doing that, but it's not pertinent to this discussion.  Personally, I couldn't give a good goddam if you want to stick your pecker in the wrong whole, so long as it isn't mine, but if you want to talk about gay rights, start a new thread about it.  At the moment, you're just going way off-line here and you've got no business b!tching if people here talk about Hitler, as they're meant to in this thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another quote from wikipedia<br><br><blockquote>In comparing various leadership styles in many cultures, academic studies have examined the patterns in which leadership emerges and then fades, sometimes by natural succession according to established rules and sometimes by the imposition of brute force. Some scholars choose to judge the effectiveness of leadership by the size of the following that the "leader" can muster. By this standard, <strong>Adolf Hitler became a very effective leader even if through delusional promises and coercive troops. </strong></blockquote></div>
