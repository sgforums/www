Some leader.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for the tennage yokels' admiration of Hitler's early success during the war, I would recommend just the first volume of Winston Churchill's memoirs of WW2.  It lays out a blow-by-blow account of how Germany was allowed to expand by the Allies, thanks to Chamberlain's weakness (allowing Germany to rearm in clear violation of post-WW1 restrictions) and the Allies' inability to put their differences aside and stand together.<br><br>Hitler didn't win the first part of the war - a bunch of weak leaders lost it.  Those teenagers' admiration of Hitler for that "achievement" shows their lack of knowledge, insight and, well, gray matter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It's all a joke - hey, if they want to emulate Hitler, I say let them go ahead.  They'll end up screwing their first cousins before they find a basement in which to shoot themselves in the head.  Is that really any loss to the world? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Bottom line: it's like a five-year-old being pleased with the shocked expressions he gets from adults when he walks around saying "F***".

None of that, however, changes the fact that Hitler was a poor leader who simply lucked out preying on the weaknesses of the surrounding leaders, and who through a long series of poor and selfish decisions led his country to ruin.</div>

Hitler, a model of leadership?  Germany's loss of WW2 was due to Hitler's refusal to listen to his military and political advisors.  Well, the ones he didn't execute anyway.  Some leader.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for the tennage yokels' admiration of Hitler's early success during the war, I would recommend just the first volume of Winston Churchill's memoirs of WW2.  It lays out a blow-by-blow account of how Germany was allowed to expand by the Allies, thanks to Chamberlain's weakness (allowing Germany to rearm in clear violation of post-WW1 restrictions) and the Allies' inability to put their differences aside and stand together.<br><br>Hitler didn't win the first part of the war - a bunch of weak leaders lost it.  Those teenagers' admiration of Hitler for that "achievement" shows their lack of knowledge, insight and, well, gray matter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It's all a joke - hey, if they want to emulate Hitler, I say let them go ahead.  They'll end up screwing their first cousins before they find a basement in which to shoot themselves in the head.  Is that really any loss to the world? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Bottom line: it's like a five-year-old being pleased with the shocked expressions he gets from adults when he walks around saying "F***".

I saw him at one outing after that event, and he literally ran away. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div></blockquote>Correct. I do not understand why many people keep saying that he is a great leader. After the war, quite a number of his subordinates described him as an amatuerish military commander. He isn't much better in other fields as well. He would be a control freak on certain matters, but couldn't care less in other areas. Often, decisions would be made by him depending on who went to him first.<br><br>Since the Singapore texts do not seem to be fulfilling their function, perhaps schools need to ditch its MOE approved textbooks and teach off the following websites and documentaries instead:<br><br>- <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/wwtwo/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC History WW2 Website</a><br><br>- <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/walden/hit_indx.shtml" rel="nofollow">BBC Education - Walden on Villians - Adolf Hitler</a><br><br>- <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/hitler_adolf.shtml" rel="nofollow"> BBC Education - Historic Figures - Adolf Hitler</a><br><br>- <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004CVR4/026-5186871-7201221" rel="nofollow"> The Nazis, A warning from history </a><br><br>Personally, i think these kids just wanted attention, as kids their age do.
