            <div class='col-md body'>ID Result:<br><br>You're cool and lead a life with as little exercise as possible, and getting on the wrong side of you is a definite no no... that's the motto that rules your life! Fashionistas and packed dance floors are definitely not your scene. Your sofa is definitely your best friend! Your peace and quiet is sacred to you... there's never a raised voice or a drama in your house... but in times of need your friends know they can turn to you. You are renowned for being late and having your head in the clouds. Despite this you are very attractive to others... especially as you know how to keep a clear head, all thanks to your amazing knack for taking an unbiased outlook on situations. On the style side, you're neither one thing nor the other. One day it might be a wild hair do, the next a buttoned down practical look - your style always takes your friends by surprise! You're mad about new things... in particular, you love skin care products and shampoos with gentle fragrances such as vanilla and mango. An expert at pampering yourself, you always keep refreshing and enriching lotions to hand so you can treat yourself on a lazy Sunday afternoon.</div>
