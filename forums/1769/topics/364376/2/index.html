              <li><strong>Description:</strong><br>
              <p>Choi Gi Chan is an University Botanic Professor with the "perfect genes." The drama is about an editor of a fashion magazine, Kim Dang Ja, who suddenly develops an urge to have her own baby despite opposing the idea of marriage. The story will talk about Dang Ja striving to look for a man with perfect genes to accomplish her mission. Gi Chan happens to be her "target" in order for her to accomplish her mission. The story later develops as Dang Ja must persuade him to do it without any commitments, which is a problem because Gi Chan doesn't believe in the idea of sex before marriage.</p>

              <p>My Review : A light hearted comedy, the story centre round 3 classmates, one refuse to believe in marriage because his father abandoned the family for another woman. Another who became a meek housewife  without any working experience. Terror overcame her when the husband wanted to divorce her and the 3rd who helped the husband dream of becoming a professional photographer. </p>

              <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Propaganda movies from the North Korea </li>
              <li>T<strong>otal Episodes:</strong> 1</li>
              <li><strong>Description:</strong><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the 14th century Koryo dynasty period, peasants who had been languishing under tyranny finally stood up against the military regime.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The king and the military tried to reinforce their forces to quell the farmers' uprising. The authorities confiscated farming tools from peasants to make weapons.</span></li>
              <li>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Taksae, a skilled smith was ordered to make weapons from the farm tools </span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">looted </span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">by the government. But conscientious Taksae secretly gave back all the tools to farmers, and was arrested and tortured harshly. At the last moment of his life, he made a little doll with rice his daughter Ami had brought to him, and named the doll "Pulgasari" after a legendary monster which was believed to help people in hard times.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After his death, Ami and her younger brother brought the doll to their home as a memento of their father. One day, when a drop of Ami's blood happened to fall upon the two-inch-tall Pulgasari, it was suddenly given life, and grew bigger as he ate iron. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">On the day of the public execution of Ami's lover Indae, who was arrested because he was one of the leaders of a riot, "Pulgasari" suddenly appeared and saved his life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As the monster sided with the peasants as their guardian, the people won battles against the soldiers from the military regime and advanced towards the king's palace. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The military regime fiercely fought against the peasants, but giant Pulgasari, as his name "immortal" means, was overwhelmingly stronger and there was no ways for the authorities to stop the uprising.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Then, a cunning general who captured Pulgasari by taking Ami as a hostage, tried to burn to death Pulgasari when was confined in a huge cage, but the monster was still immortal and saved Ami. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the decisive battle, Pulgasari destroyed the King's palace and routed the enemies. </span></p>
              <span style="font-size: small;">
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As the legend goes, Pulgasari helped people and brought peace to Koryo. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But his insatiable appetite for iron ironically became another menace to the life of peasants who had to give their farm tools to the monster. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ami, who wished for the happiness of people, decided to take the life of Pulgasari by sacrificing herself. Ami hid herself in side of a big bell in a temple, and Pulgasari, who did not know that Ami was inside the bell, ate it. Ami told Pulgasari to sleep calmly from the belly of Pulgasari. Then, suddenly Pulgasari fell down and the two passed away peacefully.</span></p>

              <p>My Review : This is one rare movie from North Korea. The origin of this movie making itself outweigh the actual story. Under the instruction of Kim Jong il, North Korea send her spies in 1978 to kidnap a South Korean actress and her director husband to force them to produce this movie. 12 years later, the South Korean husband and wife escaped from North Korea and seek alysum in the US. This movie was finally completed and released in 1985 in DPKR but the movie was banned until after some 10 years later.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>It is somewhat interesting to know that they fought to get rid of the corrupted government who confiscated their metal farming tools only to feed the tools to their guidance monster Pulgasari after the liberation.</p>

              <p>My Review : A light hearted comedy. Because Gi Dong needed money for her mother hospital bill and operation, he had to undergo a series of test including military training to apply  to be the potential son-in-law of a rich man. All was for "business" until love finally blossom. Pretty funny at first but once the rich man family went bankrupt, he had to help put the family back together again</p>

              <p>My Review : An action and romance drama. Like most story, the lead actor and actress help in love, on to later find out that her father was the one who killed her mother. He went on to become a spy in the underworld to seek revenge. Fighting scene was good but too much tears jerking scene too.</p>

              <p>My Review : It pretty funny that a lead actor in one show plays second fiddle in this one. The lead actress took over the main lead. This movie is about woman supporting role at home an in her husband work arena where the wives tried to please her husband superior wives in order to get a promotion.</p>

              <li>
              <p> A sixteenth century love story about a marriage of alliance that gave birth to true love between a great Mughal emperor, Akbar,(Hrithik Roshan) and a Rajput princess, Jodha (Aishwarya Rai).Politically, success knew no bounds for Emperor Akbar, after having secured the Hindu Kush, he furthered his realm by conquest until his empire extended from Afghanistan to the Bay of Bengal, and from the Himalayas to the Godhavari River.<br><br>Through a shrewed blend of tolerence, generosity and force, Akbar won the allegiance of the Rajputs, the most belligerent Hindus. But little did Akbar know that when he married Jodhaa, a fiery Rajput princess, in order to further strengthen his relations with the Rajputs, he would in turn be embarking upon a new journey - the journey of true love.<br><br>The daughter of King Bharmal of Amer, Jodhaa resented being reduced to a mere political pawn in this marriage of alliance, and Akbar’s biggest challenge now did not merely lie in winning battles, but in winning the love of Jodhaa - a love hidden deep below resentment and extreme prejudice. Jodhaa Akbar is their untold love story..</p>

              <p>My Review : This was a movie recommended by a forumer here. It's about the religious tolerance of the conquorer on his conquored land. The sceneries are beautiful and the music and songs by AR Rahman is equally nice. Someday, I hope to visit those places in the movies.</p>

              <p>My Review : Watch this movie years ago on television. This was a highly comical movie. To use the word movie is an insult to the waterboys as this movie is based on a true story. You get to laugh throughout the whole movie.</p>

Due to the sudden death of his father, he had to return to Korea in a hurry but the message wasn't related to LTV. His elder brother Park Sok Woo(Lee Won Jong) who worked as a farmer in the field was hard pressed by his mother to go to Vietnam to find a wife and he ended up bringing LTV to Korea with the intention to marry her. Song Il Lan (Yoo Hye Jung) was PSW's childhood friend and she realized that she was in love with him and PSW had similar feeling for her too. When the misunderstanding between PEW and LTV got clarified and all truth were out in the open, his mother who thought LTV was going to be her first son's wife and liked her didn't think she was good enough for her second son as he was a doctor. LTV was hurt and returned to Hanoi. Later the mother came to realize her folly and relented. PEW didn't want to give up LTV and so he went back to work in Hanoi and search for LTV.</p>

              <p>My Review : Having friends talking about mail order brides and reading news about how sometime they are being abandoned or marrying someone twice their ages and their social problems in an unfirmilar enivronment. This drama provides a very superficial scan of the problems.This drama could have provided an excellent platform for such development but being only 2 episode, it couldn't develop further.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>It is interesting to see that the mother was willing to accept fully the Hanoi bride as daughter-in-law to her 40 years old  eldest son who is a farmer but was  unwilling to accept her to her 2nd son who is a doctor. Finally, if they have chosen a vietnamese actress as the lead, it would have been perfect.</p>

              <li><strong>Description:</strong><br>
              <p>A man wakes up one morning to find a beautiful young woman sleeping nude beside him. Neither of them can remember the previous night’s events. After trying to walk away from the incident and get back to his normal life as a lawyer, he quickly learns several important facts:</p>
              <p>1. The girl is the daughter of a big crime boss.<br>2. She was allegedly a virgin before he had his way with her.<br>3. He can either choose to marry her, or be murdered.</p>
              <p>The circumstances are very suspicious, and it seems possible that he’s somehow been framed into this position. But even a lawyer would have trouble talking his way out of this one–especially when the judge and jury are not at all impartial, are not his peers, all carry weapons, and want to kill him if he says the wrong thing.</p>

              <p>My Review : A light hearted comedy. There are several movies with such title but this is one of the better one. In order to get her daughter to marry someone outside the underworld, the boss ordered his sons to look for a suitable person and this unlucky lawyer was chosen.</p>

              <li><strong>Description:</strong><br>
              <p>Mirume (Ken'ichi Matsuyama) is a 19 year old college student who falls in love with Yuri (Hiromi Nagasaku), an almost 40 year old art teacher at his university. Yuri isn't your typical college professor, having a quirky sense of humor and unpredictable personality. When Yuri invites Murume to her studio, she playfully seduces the still naive 19 year old student. Things become more complicated when Murume discovers that Yuri is married to a much older man ....</p>

              <p>My Review : Can't really tell what is the meaning behind this movie. Yuri couldn't get what she want from her husband? And Murume didn't see what was infront of him? Is it that you have to seize your opportunity for what you want? I'm still  thinking. Perhap a 2nd viewing might help.</p>

              <li><strong>Description:</strong><br>
              <p>Last fall, over 3 million people were brought to tears by the movie Koizora. The original story of Koizora, by the author Mika, was popularized on the cell phone novel site, Mahou no Land, and since then has been turned into a novel, a movie, and now a drama. The highly popular movie will be turned into a drama, which follows the life of a normal higschool girl who experiences many unbelievably sad events, but through it all proving that love conquers all, and this true love story remains unchanged from the movie. Not only does it simply portray the first love of the highschoolers, it shows the warmth from the family, the importance of life, the bonds with friends, and the common happenings of teens, and through it all Mika and Hiro's love story gets unwound.</p>

              <p>My Review : This novel was said to brought tears to many. But the movie didn't touch me. Maybe it was the choice of the actors and actress. The acting didn't touch my soft spot.</p>

              <p>My Review : Ok, for the first time I have finished watching a Taiwanese drama. I have always shun taiwanese drama but put up a brave front ton finish this. Not too bad. For the first 18 episodes, it was just comedy, just laughter. From Mdm white-bone demon to turtle girl were just her nick name.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Only after epidsode 19 did they addressed the problems of å§�å¼Ÿæ�‹. From family disapproval to friends disbelieved. from company of age gap friends to money. from fashions to studies. This drama did address these but unfortunately only for last 3 episodes. These 3 stars are for the laughters.</p>

From that day on, Min-hyuk woos her, escorts her home at night, stuffs her locker with roses, and clears a passage for her in the morning after the snow falls. For all his efforts, he doesn’t get much more than a tender glance from Mi-hyun. When she suddenly vanishes, ‘sorry’ is the only word she leaves behind.</p>

              <p>The "Death Investigation Extension (D.I.E.)" in the police force was established to accommodate those who have been sent away by their supervisors. As everybody knows, members of the Extension are to investigate unsolved cold cases. YUE CHI-LONG (Roger Kwok), who has cracked a large number of difficult cases by extrasensory means, is assigned to the D.I.E. believing that he will get promoted soon. Later LONG finds out that his supervisor still has a long way to go before he reaches retirement age. Hoping to leave the Extension as soon as possible, he gets to solve a lot of intriguing cases. New appointee YING CHING-CHING (Sonija Kwok) is a good-looking girl but she means to act tough and sassy in front of others. She takes an uncompromising stand over every case she deals with, which leads her into constant quarrels with LONG. The relationship between the pair is deteriorating day after day.</p>
              <p>LONG's elder sister, YUE CHI-CHING (Margie Tsang), has been living with him. While investigating an old case, LONG gets to find his long-lost father YUE TAI-HOI (Leung Ka Yan). Through close collaboration with LONG, CHING-CHING has gradually developed affection for him. As she is still torn between LONG and her two-timing boyfriend SHING KA-TSUN (Kenneth Ma), LONG has started to try to avoid her without rhyme or reason. Feeling so confused about what is happening, CHING-CHING decides to do some probing and is shocked to discover that LONG has been dogged by a female ghost called SIU SIN (Kitty Yuen).</p>

              <p>My Review : Ok, for the first time I have finished watching a Taiwanese drama. I have always shun taiwanese drama but put up a brave front ton finish this. Not too bad. For the first 18 episodes, it was just comedy, just laughter. From Mdm white-bone demon to turtle girl were just her nick name.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Only after epidsode 19 did they addressed the problems of å§�å¼Ÿæ�‹. From family disapproval to friends disbelieved. from company of age gap friends to money. from fashions to studies. This drama did address these but unfortunately only for last 3 episodes. These 3 stars are for the laughters.</p>
