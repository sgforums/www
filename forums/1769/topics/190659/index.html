Can recommend???</div></blockquote>Um....a bit too general leh.  Don't know where to aim.<br><br>I live in the vicinity, but I'm one who mostly eats according to what my body needs and not according to taste.<br><br>At Parkway Parade itself, there's Burger King, one of my favourite foods.  Other than that, there's nothing much there for me.  However, at the Parkway Parade area, there are:<br><br>That big hawker centre where the corner (nearest to Parkway Parade itself) chai-png is nice and cheap.  I usually take the Indian food there (I like Indian and western cuisine mostly....don't really like Chinese food, although I'm Chinese).<br><br>Paramount Hotel buffet - lunch cheap cheap at only S$18+++, mostly local food which I don't care much for.  But, but, but....there's satay!  Quite empty also....no need to line up one.<br><br>Tow Kua Pau - at a corner coffeeshop diagonally opposite Roxy Square.<br><br>Indonesian Nasi Padang - at the coffeeshop just beside Tow Kua Pau coffeeshop.<br><br>Five Star Chicken Rice - coffeeshop at the same row as Tow Kua Pau, further down, after the Shell station.<br><br>Ampang Yong Tau Fu - coffeeshop same row as  Tow Kua Pau, even further down from Five Star Chicken Rice.   Expensive.<br><br>CMC coffee shop - run by mature folks (a.k.a. original batch) and good for traditional kaya toast and coffee.  Opposite Ampang Yong Tau Fu, next door to a Catholic church.<br><br>Further down the road away from the church, same side as CMC, there is a Peranakan restaurant which serves Buah Kluak or however you spell it.  Quite expensive.  Last time I was there was years ago....maybe closed down liow.<br><br>(note that, due to the way I've described it, if you can't find Tow Kua Pau, you can't find the rest <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>Katong Laksa - somewhere along the row of shophouses just opposite Roxy Square.  Not worth trying, but this is just my opinion.<br><br>At Roxy Square itself, there is a cafe and an ice cream joint near the entrance.<br><br>A few buildings down the road from Roxy Square towards the direction of Katong Shopping Centre, same side as Roxy Square, there is a buffet restaurant (mostly local food) which is quite cheap with not too bad food quality.  Sorry, but I forgot the name.  Ground floor, facing the road, you can't miss it.  From Roxy Square, it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to walk there.<br><br>Of course down the road the opposite way at Siglap (not exactly within walking distance), there is also a string of cafes and eateries.  Thai food, Cafe Cartel, Pizza Hut (where I used to have the Bigga Betta Buffet till they did away with it), etc.<br><br>Sorry, its late....if I think of anymore, I'll come back and post again.<br></div>
