            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forums.<br><br>Plea for ice cube rebuffed<br><br>ON SATURDAY, a group of friends and I had our training for a coming marathon. We usually have our long runs at East Coast Park.<br><br>However, the weather that day was exceptionally hot. Without the hydration provided by sports drinks, I felt that the top of my head was on fire. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the hydration point, the ice in the sports drinks had all melted.<br><br>I needed ice to cool down my core temperature and I had no choice but to go to the snack bar at the Osim Tri Swim starting point by the beach, called Kayak Snack Bar. I told a man there that I did not have any money with me, and asked if he could give me an ice cube as I was not feeling too well.<br><br>He refused, despite my plea that all I wanted was just one cube. He said the ice was not for sale.<br><br>I was shocked. I asked him: 'So, even if someone is dying, you will not give him one ice cube?' He said: 'No.'<br><br>I told him that he had just lost my business and that of many other athletes. He said: 'It doesn't matter.'<br><br>A week ago, my husband and I were in Kona, Hawaii, for the Ironman World Championship. The people there were amazing. Each time when we had our training before the day of the race, running down Alii Drive, folks there did not hesitate to top up our water.<br><br>At the Olympic Distance race in Phuket, the villagers, who barely had anything to their name, never hesitated to offer us water from their water bottle, even though they had paid for it.<br><br>What is wrong with the staff at Kayak Snack Bar? I could have died of heatstroke!<br><br>Janet Simone Lim (Ms)<br></div>
