            <div class='col-md body'>The runner makes a big fuss out of this issue. what is she trying to achieve? To shame someone? or to air out her unhappiness? There is way to do it, going to newspaper should not be in this case.<br><br>1) if she can argue, she is not going to "die".<br>2) She is going to Hawaii for Ironman. That is the "Premier" Ironman of the world. Either she is a professional athlete or damn good one. In Singapore(only a handful have qualify for it). She is a damn tough cookie wont break down easier.<br>3) Can taking ice cube cure heatstroke?<br><br>After reading the story, i conclude she is too pampered. If you are asking for a favour, you should be prepare to get rejected.<br><br>On the other hand, what is an ice cube? The person manning the shop should have "morally" given her the ice cube. Nevertheless, he might have other reservation why he did do it. We wont know the circumstance there, when it actually happens.<br></div>

In some countries, not only will the ppl not give her a cube of ice, they will even take her shoes and more if she did faint.

Last Friday, it was raining when a huge tree branch fell on my head in Selegie Road. I sustained severe head and shoulder injuries but other than a kind soul who ran over to ask if I was all right, no one else bothered to help me get up.<br><br>All I got was lots of weird looks as my clothes were muddied when I fell. I could not understand their behaviour.<br><br>We are lucky that Singapore is not buffeted by tsunamis and hurricanes. Unlike countries like Thailand and the United States, where people went all out to help each other during trying times, in Singapore the only thing people do is donate to charity.<br><br>Suramya Sharma (Miss)<br></div>
