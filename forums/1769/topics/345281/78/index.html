              <p>I wanted to buy some kway teow, but the kway teow here looks like rice vermiceli.  They are so thin!</p>
              <p>And then I was shopping for char kway teow kacap Manis (Sweet thick soy suace)  but the ones here all contains wheat, and the bozzes are on a gluten free diet!</p>
              <p>This is a gluten free household.</p>
              <p>So in the end, didnt make char kway teow today, only made laksa, and the porridge for the bozz lady cos she was sick.</p>
              <p>And there was century eggs with japanese ginger slices, glass canned chai sim, salted duck egg &amp; I stir fry some chinese vege, but she cannot take them saying I cook them too sweet.</p>

              <p>It requires a lot of patience and work.  Plus you have to have a source where you can get hold of fresh coconuts.  And a charcoal stove is best.  A lot of stirring is required periodically. </p>
              <p>I remember grandma putting on a bandana and tying a handkerchief around her wrist to wipe off her sweat when she made kaya.  I remember the heat in the kitchen from the charcoal stove.  I was always in her way in the kitchen because I always wanted to participate in the cooking process, and I always got too near and then kena stepped on by her or elbowed accidentally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  But I was easily pacified... when I kena injured cause I got too close, all she had to do was give me some snacks, and I stopped crying liao.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  I was born to be a foodie...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>

              <p>That family must be doing pretty well financially with secure jobs.  People are downsizing in this climate and only a few lucky ones are able to afford to upsize.</p>

              <p>I forbade myself from cooking during the recent heatwave.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  I stocked up with food in the evenings when the weather was cooler, and stayed home during the day.  Next summer I'll just go watch movies in the cinema the whole day to enjoy the air conditioning.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
