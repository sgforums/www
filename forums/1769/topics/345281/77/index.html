              <p>What, Rhonda, you've never come across lionnoisy up till now?  He's the resident Oz basher. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Okay, here's a couple of things about him:</p>
              <p>1) He never has an original thought - he just loves cutting and pasting any articles that have anything to do with Australia and then saying it's an awful place<br>2) He generally does not respond to counterarguments - it's just too much for him to take in<br>3) His English is disgraceful<br>4) He's got a bit of a hero complex - he claims he's doing all of this crap to save Singaporeans from going to the purgatory called Australia<br>5) The current theory is that he applied for migration, but the DIMIA staff laughed hysterically when they saw that he had just written "I wan move to Oz" in crayon and left the rest of the forms blank, and he's never gotten over it<br>6) Nobody's quite convinced he's human - he seems to be actually either a sexually transmitted disease or some odd form of diarrohea</p>
              <p>We've pretty much given up on trying to argue with him because he can't take anything in anyway, so he just drones on as if nobody said anything.  These days I just sling insults at him and Singapore Tyrannosaurus does a brilliant send-up of him.</p>

              <p>Wine tasters and connoiseurs follow that principle too, don't they? </p>
              <p>Sip, swirl around in mouth to taste, spit out... on to the next wine... </p>
              <p>It's actually a smart way of eating / drinking - you get to taste a huge variety of dishes / drinks, but you don't suffer from overconsumption. </p>
