              <p>Yeah... quite cute!  Actually, yesterday, I couldn't tell if baby was going to laugh or cry because her expression for both is a huge, open-mouthed, toothless grin with the entire face scrunched up... like in utter glee, also like prelude to a huge cry.  I can't tell which is which!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hanor!  I'm with you on that.  I also thought as long as not over-processed, can liao.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>I don't think we should encourage babies to grow up to become fussy over food leh.  Organic stuff are costly and there have been current affairs programs here and magazine articles which state that they may not be worth all the hype afterall.  However, I must agree that Fritz Gelato, which uses organic products, do taste better compared to other brands of Gelato.</p>

              <p>i was playing tennis when it was 40 in the shade <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>tennis was from after lunch to about 8pm when we went back, grabbed a shower then went to the pub for dinner and drinks.. lots of drinks <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>it was hilarious because my black baseball hat ended up with lots of crusted salt and after that summer, it was sub-bleached brown</p>
              <p>thing was to keep hydrated, keep electrolytes up and attempt to keep cool... the little tap at the side of the tennis court was used to occasionally wet the baseball hat or wet a towel to be draped on the head while hitting the ball.. it dried disconcertingly fast..</p>
              <p>Gatorade was chugged down by the litre..</p>

              <p>You know, tare, I saw a very cute scene the other day in a park near my place.  Walking by, I spotted a dark-skinned dad with his baby.  Think the baby had just learnt how to walk cause it was tottering wildy with imbalance.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  The baby suddenly lost its footing on a gentle slope and promptly slid onto its backside.  For a split second, it was a bit shocked and stunned, then it whimpered and burst out crying and looked at its dad.  Dad just looked down, orh... baby has fallen, lifted baby back on its feet, and resumed staring elsewhere so baby, seeing that dad didn't kick up any fuss, continued to walk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It's such a cute scene but it's really what I wish more parents would do.  Don't fuss over little falls like the typical Singaporean parents do.  Just let baby pick itself up and proceed as if it's not a big deal at all.  Baby, picking up how bo chup its parents are, will realise, orh, not a big deal, and won't cry.</p>
