              <p>OOOOOhhhhh!!  I remember now!!!</p>
              <p>Yes, I overheard it on a very crowded tram recently!  There was a lady with two male friends right next to me, talking soooo loudly, you had to be deaf to not hear them!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  So, this lady turned out to be a Pathologist and one of her male friends is some Insurance person (not sales).  They were discussing how 'interesting' it might be for her to pursue Forensics when the insurance friend related this extremely gross REAL incident!</p>
              <p>A landlord who had taken out a policy with his company tried to claim for damages.  The company sent someone to investigate the claims.  When he arrived at the property, there were police all over the place! </p>
              <p>The damages claimed was for the apartment directly below the 'crime scene'.  Apparently, the tenant of the apt had already died eight months earlier, but NOBODY knew!!  It was the cold season so decay was not accelerated and there wasn't much stench until the warmer months crept up and the neighbours complained of the extremely noxious odour.  The landlord received the rent on time every month cause it was direct debit so no one suspected anything.</p>
              <p>In that eight months, the man, who had died on his couch, slowly decayed, right... Now, after eight months, you don't have a corpse anymore... you have a gooey, formless mess with the skeleton still rather intact but all soft tissue would have... you know... 'melted' away!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  The greasy goo had soaked right through his couch, collected on the floor and seeped right through to form a horrid-looking brown, dripping mess on the ceiling of the apartment directly beneath him!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Drip!  Drip!  Drip!!  Into the living room of the apartment below!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png">  Liquified man!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>When the tenant complained about the 'greasy spot', the landlord filed the claim and it was then that the tenants on the same floor as the deceased also complained about the foul smell.  Unfortunately, the insurance company could not pay any damages to the landlord as he had not bought a policy covering 'accidents' or something!  </p>
              <p>Now, this is a true incident!!  Gruesome or not?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> </p>

              <p>I'm ok with reading about gross stuff, as long as I don't see the pictures</p>
              <p>That is why violent books are ok to me but not violent and gory movies</p>

              <p>Haiz... don't you know that I no longer watch TV because I keep falling asleep halfway or even before the halfway mark?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  Told you many times liao!  Watch first 5-15 mins, fall asleep, wake up 1-2 hrs later wondering, what happened?  What's the ending?  So I know ALL the beginning, none of the ending!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif">  Fed up now, I just get the DVD's so I can fall asleep, wake up, rewind, fall asleep again...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for those of you who are laughing over how long it's taking me to learn driving, this has got to do with it too.  I'm quite worried I'll fall asleep at the wheel...</p>
