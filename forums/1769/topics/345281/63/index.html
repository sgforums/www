              <p>Remember if you get some Peacock Bass or some freshwater cichlid, keep them alive and dun force the hook out of their mouth. Dun bother bringing back Mayan Cichlids or the Tiger Tilapia. Those aren't worth much and most people dun want them due to their aggressiveness</p>
              <p>Earth Eaters don't fetch much but at least got a couple of dollars, Peacock bass is the best for $$</p>
              <p>I'll gladly keep and sell them ^^ we can split the profits :P</p>
