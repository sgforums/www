              <p>Left
              brain dominant individuals are more orderly, literal, articulate, and
              to the point. They are good at understanding directions and anything
              that is explicit and logical. They can have trouble comprehending
              emotions and abstract concepts, they can feel lost when things are not
              clear, doubting anything that is not stated and proven.<br></p>
              <p>Right
              brain dominant individuals are more visual and intuitive. They are
              better at summarizing multiple points, picking up on what's not said,
              visualizing things, and making things up. They can lack attention to
              detail, directness, organization, and the ability to explain their
              ideas verbally, leaving them unable to communicate effectively.</p>

              <p>According
              to Darwinian theory, optimal evolution takes place with random
              variation and selective retention. The evolution savvy individual will
              try many different approaches when faced with a problem and select the
              best of those approaches. Many historical intellectuals have confessed
              their advantage was simply considering/exploring/trying more approaches
              than others. The left brain dominant type suffers from limited
              approaches, narrow-mindedness. The right brain dominant type suffers
              from too many approaches, scatterbrained. To maintain balanced
              hemispheres, you need to exercise both variability and selection. Just
              as a company will have more chance of finding a great candidate by
              increasing their applicant pool, an individual who considers a wider
              set of options is more likely to make quality decisions.</p>

              better at summarizing multiple points, picking up on what's not said,
              visualizing things, and making things up. They can lack attention to
              detail, directness, organization, and the ability to explain their
              ideas verbally, leaving them unable to communicate effectively.</p>

              <p>According
              to Darwinian theory, optimal evolution takes place with random
              variation and selective retention. The evolution savvy individual will
              try many different approaches when faced with a problem and select the
              best of those approaches. Many historical intellectuals have confessed
              their advantage was simply considering/exploring/trying more approaches
              than others. The left brain dominant type suffers from limited
              approaches, narrow-mindedness. The right brain dominant type suffers
              from too many approaches, scatterbrained. To maintain balanced
              hemispheres, you need to exercise both variability and selection. Just
              as a company will have more chance of finding a great candidate by
              increasing their applicant pool, an individual who considers a wider
              set of options is more likely to make quality decisions. <br></p>
