              <p>With all the plastic and metal we see encasing computers and
              accessories, it's refreshing to see a few that utilize wood. The soft
              grains, warmth, and earthy colors make computers a little less harsh.
              But it's not like wood computers are a new concept. According to <a href="http://macadoodle.wordpress.com/2007/04/21/true-or-false-the-first-apple-computer-was-made-of-wood/">Macadoodle</a>,
              this Apple computer was put together around 1976 by Steve Wozniak. Only
              200 like this were made, and today Macophiliacs will have to shell out
              at least $50,000 to own one.</p>

              <p>Luckily, wood computers aren't old and rare. They're actually getting
              quite popular and while there aren't a whole lot on the market,
              designers are messing around more and more with wood casings in their
              concepts. This <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/04/fujitsu-woodshell-computer.php">Fujitsu FMV-BIBLO NX95Y/D notebook</a> (yeah, we didn't name it...) boasts a forest-thinned cedar shell, and
              as a whole it is a prototype design called the "WoodShell," exhibited
              at the Japan Design 2008 - Innovation exposition.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.treehugger.com/galleries/asus-bamboo-laptop.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360"></p>
              <p>One computer that is on the market and has grabbed the attention of TreeHugger is the <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/03/asus_bamboo_eco.php">ASUS bamboo notebook</a>.
              In fact, bamboo casings are starting to become quite the rage for "eco"
              computers. This ASUS notebook was played up at the company's booth at
              CES 2009 and it feels as good as it looks. Bamboo was the material of
              choice because of its high rate of renewal and sustainability, and ASUS
              wanted to make a point that <a href="http://www.asus.com/news_show.aspx?id=12577">â€œit's easy being green."</a></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.treehugger.com/galleries/myrtle-burl-wood.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="465"></p>
              <p>Beautiful wood choices can also be made for PC towers. This tower is
              made from Myrtle and displays a beautiful grain texture. Myrtle is a
              northwestern wood and can be found FSC, so it's a great choice for a
              decorative casing.</p>

              <p>Wood computer cases can get pretty elaborate, so that they're <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/09/suissa_computer.php">more art than anything else</a>. Suissa is one company doing just this. This is their "Englighten" model with a limited edition of 10 pieces. Art, for sure.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.treehugger.com/holtz-kontor-wood-computer.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480"></p>
              <p>Like Suissa, Holz Kontor produces beautiful wood-cased computer
              devices, including monitor, mouse and keyboard. They offer a variety of
              wood choices, though you'd have to double check on the sustainability
              of the materials. Also, you have to be ready to shell out quite a bit
              of money. The mouse alone is $150. But if you're looking for unique
              elegance for an office space, beautiful wooden computer parts would do
              the trick.</p>

              <p>Custom computer towers from wood can be made at home and many DIYers take up the task and create some cool cases like this one.</p>

              <p>Custom cases can be super simple for those who want a minimalist look,
              or just want to put as little money and time into a case as possible.
              Simple still turns out looking pretty great, showing it's hard to go
              wrong with wood. This particular beautifully simple case has a
              minimalist and modern look a Mac user would love.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.treehugger.com/wooden-computer-cube.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="340"></p>
              <p>Even if you go for a simple cube, you can dress it up a bit with some
              finish and varnish. The shine on this DIY case gives it some extra
              polished oomph.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.treehugger.com/zapweb-wooden-computer-set.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="340"></p>
              <p>DIY projects can look just as polished and sleek as any super-expensive
              custom job. Take this project done in redwood. The creator took
              store-bought computer accessories and custom built wood veneers to go
              over them. Though it takes quite a bit of time and lots of measuring,
              the finished product looks beautiful.</p>

              <p>For your custom job, you might just want to look around the house for supplies. <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/01/scrabble-keyboard-is-possibly-the-coolest-nerdy-project-ever.php">This Mac keyboard</a> was built from Scrabble pieces. Time and patience, and attention to detail, pays off!</p>

              <p>The more creative the better. This art deco-style "Skyscraper Photo PC"
              was inspired by a similar looking clock casing. The finished product
              looks nothing like a computer, but sure runs like one. The USB ports
              and other components are hidden underneath. Watching the <a href="http://slipperyskip.com/page22.html">step-by-step creation</a> of something like this makes you even more appreciative of the final, beautiful product.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.treehugger.com/extreme-mod-case.jpg" alt="" width="340" height="340"></p>
              <p>While the Skyscraper Photo PC seems pretty elaborate, this Japanese
              case mod will make you do a double take. This piece is a combination of
              the creator's dual love for furniture and computers - and it definitely
              looks like it could be a piece of furniture. The case makes the
              computer part of a room's decor.</p>

              <p>Rather than a piece of furniture, <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/04/the_computer_as.php">this carved case</a> looks like an heirloom jewelry box. The monitor, keyboard and mouse are
              pretty basic, but the computer case itself is something to stare at.
              And with the work that goes into something like this, it is sure to
              encourage the upgrading, and not tossing of the computer.</p>

              <div class="caption">This is by far the most ornate wood computer case
              we've seen. Carved by Valerie Beetle of the Ukraine, it is a piece of
              techy art any goth gamer can appreciate. This is the kind of thing that
              will end up in museums after our computers become so 300 years ago.</div>
