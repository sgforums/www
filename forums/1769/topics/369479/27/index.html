              <p>well it's religion. It's supposed to be unbelievable, which is why leaps of faith are required <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway jokes aside, although I believe this is a sham, there is a difference in how they treat major religions vs small/unknown ones. It could have been a real case where the person really believes in such a religion, but they would likely still force the punishment for not complying</p>

              <p>It really sucks to have children with a spouse you don't like, and it gets worse when they take on the said spouse's qualities. And then they grow up and bite back, claiming you screwed up their lives because you and said spouse didn't give them a model for love.</p>
