              <p>And oh....my landlord's wife is doing the stand chart run.</p>
              <p>I've already convinced them that I shall reprise my role as a helper on those runs.</p>
              <p>I was already discussing ideas with the landlord how we can best support our friends on such a event.</p>
              <p>1) We shall buy those energy jellies and cans of 100 plus.</p>
              <p>2) Freeze them and carry them to various points of the run in cooler bags.</p>
              <p>3) Have a car and bicycle handy to transport the bicycles, us and the cooler bags of goodies to various locations at the run.</p>
              <p>4) Set up mats, beach umbrellas, lounging chairs and maybe books at those various points to pass out the frozen jelly drinks and 100 pluses.</p>
              <p>5) Standby extra socks, so runners can change into dry socks and not have wet socks blisters their feet.</p>
