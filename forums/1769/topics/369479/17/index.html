              <p>As much as I was defending, I was also fairly partial. I never stood up for a particular side just because of gender.</p>
              <p>Please lah VK, don't get involved, I'm barely involved, it's their problem and I was merely telling em to stop derailing the thread, which already was god knows how many pages into it, in no relation to what original TS was enquiring about.</p>
              <p>Someone wants attention, trying to gain sympathy and whatever in hell she was trying to do. I would say the same even if it was male. Just look at her replies, it says alot for itself.</p>
              <p>As much as a feminist you may be, which I respect. There's no need to stand on a side of a 'ballistic woman who has been sexually harassed'. If there is never any reasoning, then wouldn't we as men, be put in such an unlawful position due to the fact she was... well... 'harassed'?</p>
              <p>There are bad eggs in that gender too you know. Besides, you also dunno what's going on, why butt in on it, let alone me even? I already say I'm not gonna reply on that matter, you know how I post, I've held back quite abit. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Can we just forget about this, it's just another stupid thread, with some idiot trying to muck it up. This discussion can go on forever, and has been going on ever since the start. I am not going to talk about this matter anymore, let's just move on.</p>

              <p>As much as I was defending, I was also fairly partial. I never stood up for a particular side just because of gender.</p>
              <p>Please lah VK, don't get involved, I'm barely involved, it's their problem and I was merely telling em to stop derailing the thread, which already was god knows how many pages into it, in no relation to what original TS was enquiring about.</p>
              <p>Someone wants attention, trying to gain sympathy and whatever in hell she was trying to do. I would say the same even if it was male. Just look at her replies, it says alot for itself.</p>
              <p>As much as a feminist you may be, which I respect. There's no need to stand on a side of a 'ballistic woman who has been sexually harassed'. If there is never any reasoning, then wouldn't we as men, be put in such an unlawful position due to the fact she was... well... 'harassed'?</p>
              <p>There are bad eggs in that gender too you know. Besides, you also dunno what's going on, why butt in on it, let alone me even? I already say I'm not gonna reply on that matter, you know how I post, I've held back quite abit. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Can we just forget about this, it's just another stupid thread, with some idiot trying to muck it up. This discussion can go on forever, and has been going on ever since the start. I am not going to talk about this matter anymore, let's just move on.</p>

              <p>LOL, okay.</p>
              <p>But at least let me go put my words in, that I do not approve of them derailing the thread too.</p>
              <p>I didnt realise that it went to this stage.</p>
              <p>And since you are friend with at least one party.  Maybe can advise that one party to make a effort to clear up this misunderstanding face to face.  Especially since this matter started when it was a face to face outing with the forumers.</p>
