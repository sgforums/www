Sometimes it could be that people are just better at one thing than another. But i believe if all teachers could teach while believing that all students COULD learn - then whatever their current results are, they definitely could improve.<br><br>I have had teachers telling my class point blank that.. Oh.. arts class ah.. why don't u drop maths C or A maths? Waste of time you know - all will fail anyway.<br><br></div></blockquote>Haiz, I kept getting failing mark after failing mark. At some point, you just stop trying, you know? The teachers I had were resigned to the fact that I would fail miserably. None of them took me aside to give me one on one coaching. So that was how I sailed along in secondary school. I didn't even want to turn up for the GCE Maths paper because I knew it would be a waste of time, but I sat for it anyway. Strangely, I was good at Math in primary school.</div>
