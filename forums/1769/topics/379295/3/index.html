              <p><strong>caption : Yamdork-tso at 4441m above sea level ç¾Šå�“é›�æŽª</strong></p>
              <p>One of the perfect place to see Yamdrok-tso should be at the summit of Kamba-la at 4700m but it's sort like becoming a market place with tourist vehicles stopping there , touts trying to sell you their goods to you and chattering tourists clicking away with their cameras. Therefore our driver recommended us this quiet spot some distance away from the summit but still offering a view as dazzling as ever.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/1144/p1000421k.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>caption : Far in the distance is the huge massif of Mt Nojin Kangtsang (7191m) </strong></p>
              <p>Yamdork-tso is one of the four holy lakes in Tibet (the other three being Nam-tso in the North, Manasarovar in the West and Lhamo La-tso in the south). Yamdrok-tso is a closed lake with no inlet or outlet, therefore the water level in the lake have never change drastically. From goggle earth, Yamdrok-tso is shaped like a coiled scorpion with its pincers closing together forming an island in between.</p>

              <p><strong>caption : other ranges like Mt Jangsang Lhamo (6324m) and Mt Jetung Chusang (6342m) become visble as we travelled westward </strong></p>
              <p>It was very windy and the wind was sending ripples across the water thus we were unable to get the reflection of Mt Nojin Kangtsang or the other ranges on the lake but still, the fabulous deep turquoise lake was enough to win us over.</p>

              <p><strong>caption : Life on the lake</strong></p>
              <p>Most travellers will be contented with just a glimpse of the lake from the Kamba-la and the view from the the town of Nagartse but the devout Tibetan prlgrims will circumambulate the lake (believed to be the home of some wrathful deities) that will take up to seven days to complete.</p>

              <p><strong>caption : Is the lake leaking away?</strong></p>
              <p>In the mid 1980s, there was plan to build a hydroelectric plant in Yamdork-tso by building a tunnel below the surface of the lake to send the water dropping some 846m. Although there were objection by the Tibetan communities, arguing that on top of being a holy lake, it will damage the ecosystem in the lake, Yamdrok-tso had since become the largest hydroelectric plant in Tibet since 1997.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/7574/p1000445a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"> </p>
              <p><strong>caption : The dam and the hydroelectric plant</strong></p>
              <p>In the rule of exchange, whatever you receive, you have to pay back in an equivalent amount. The hydroelectric plants brought lights to Tibet but it may one day drained Yamdrok-tso to the extend that the damage will become irreversible.</p>

              <p>It is alarming to see that snow in this glacier is far lesser in area than it used to be, due to greenhouse effect. It used to be just some 30m away but now so much more further away. Karo-la pass is the first mountain pass we have to cross to reach our next destination Gyantse.</p>

              <p>The inscriptions on the stone slab tell you that this was the very place a movie, the Red River Valley was shot in 1997. Red River Valley is a tragic tale about the occupancy of the British force in Tibet when a young beautiful Tibetan woman saved the lives of two British men who had design for future of Tibet (a Chinese version of the Younghusband expedition).</p>

              <p>Most people will rush through Gyantse, stopping just to see this famous Kumbum mural art (100,000 Buddha images). Gyantse Kumbum is a six storey stupa with 108 rooms. Every room contain hundreds of these mural arts that are of Indian style, Newari style and Tibetan style.</p>

              <p><strong>caption : Newari style. Look at the fine details in the painting</strong></p>
              <p>Gyantse Kumbum was fortunate enough to survived the Culture Revolution although the chapels around it wasn't that lucky. These painting date back to the 14th century with strong influence from the Newari art style.</p>

              <p><strong>caption : Gyantse Dzong (4180m) -The tragic story behind the Gyantse Fortres</strong><strong>s</strong></p>
              <p>Like most people who rushed through Gyantse, they will give this empty fortress a miss. In fact, this Dzong is not being taken care off and there are rubbish and litters everywhere. The little park at the base of the Dzong had become a dumping ground and the little lake was littered with rubbish.</p>
              <p>Like others, my team wanted to give this a miss so I was on my own again. Armed with the direction to the entrance, I set out on foot for the Dzong. Unfortunately, upon reaching, I found that the Dzong was closed early for the staff to practice singing for their National Day celebration. I was locked out again, so I decided to walk the perimeter of the Dzong instead.</p>

              <p><strong>caption : Dzong reflection on the littered lake</strong></p>
              <p>After knowing the story (history) behind the Gyantse Dzong, I think that it deserves better respect and care than this. Here this the brief summary of tragic story (history):</p>
              <p>This is the story about the British invasion of Tibet in 1903, also known as the Younghusband Expedition. The war was started because of some unreliable intelligence and the newspapers rumour spreading the claim that the Russian had design on Tibet and many people are starting to believe them.</p>
              <p>The British Raj in India feared losing the buffer state between Russia and India send Major Younghusband, an army officer on a diplomatic mission to Tibet. After six months of waiting, no Tibetan showed up for the meeting. Major Younghusband was instructed to advance to Lhasa with 3000 troops (plus 7000 shepras and 4000 yaks) to force the recalcitrant Tibetans to a treaty.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/962/p1000484f.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
              <p><strong>caption : An old Tibetan's town with the newly added Han's block building in it's backdrop seen at the top of the gate</strong>.</p>
              <p>Despite previous brushes with the British firepower, the Tibetans seem to have little idea what they were up against. Halfway between Yatung and Gyantse, a small Tibetan army armed with a motely assortment weapons confronted the British force carrying light artillery, machine guns and modern rifles. The Tibetans trumph card was a charm with the seal of the Dalai Lama which they were told, could protect them against the British bullets. It didn't and 700 Tibetans were slaughtered in just 4 minutes.</p>
              <p>The British buried the dead Tibetan soldiers (the Tibetans dug them up at night and carried them off for sky burial) and set up a field hospital to treat the wounded. The dumbfound wounded Tibetan could not understand why the British would kill them one day and saved them the next day. The British advanced to Gyantse and found the fortress deserted. Curious as to why the defensive fortress was deserted, the British camped outside instead of occupying it, while waiting for the Tibetan officals from Tibet to arrive.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/7644/p1000486x.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>caption: A view of Gyantse Kumbum and its chapels around it from the Fortress</strong></p>
              <p>While waiting, Major Younghusband sped of to Karo-la with a small contingent of troops to take on the 3000 Tibetan who had dug in at the over 5000m mountain ranges. The result was the highest land-based battle in the British military history. After another 2 months of waiting for the Lhasa offical, the British was ordered to retake Gyantse Dzong (it was reoccupied by the Tibetans) to cut off any attack from the rear and to march straight into Lhasa. Artillery shell began to breach the wall and one of the shell destroyed the Tibetan gunpowder supply forcing the Tibetan to restort to throwing rocks at the invaders. The Dzong fell within the day with only 4 British casualties and over 300 Tibetans dead. </p>

              <p><strong>caption : The spooky look of Gyantse Dzong at dawn</strong></p>
              <p>With the fall of of Gyantse Dzong, the British effectively controlled the road to Lhasa. Major Younghusband took the 2000 troops to the capital Lhasa without much resistance. Once in Lhasa, Major Younghusband wanted to look for the Dalai Lama (for causing the unnecessary casualities) but he had already fled to Mongolia. Younghusband managed to get the trade treaties done within a month. Ironically the troops did not find any Russian made guns and weapons in Lhasa like what the rumour said, but they found British made biscuits and sausage machine in the Bakhor street bazzar.For the first time, Major Younghusband felt that he had lost his war even though they had the final victory.</p>

              <p>This 11th century monastery is the only monastery in Tibet that combines Tibetian and Chinese in style. It was famous for its training such as trance walking and thumo (generating internal heat to survive cold weather) . However we are more interested in the mural painting than those "special feats". Shalu has some finest 14th century painting that fused Chinese, Mongol and Newari styles lining the corridor of the central assembly hall.</p>

              <p>Narthang was famous for its printing, press and huge collections of books. During the Culture Revolution, the lama distributed all the printing and press to the local for safe keeping to prevent the Red Guards from destorying them. This did saved the press and books but did not prevent the damaged to the chapels and chortens.</p>

              <p><strong>caption : Himalayan mountain ranges at the distant end</strong></p>
              <p>At the thought of Mt Everest before our eyes, it blurred our wisdom. We were mostly at the 3600m altitude, other than the short stop at Gyatso-la pass. On our schedule, we were supposed to stop overnight at Old Tingri (4250m). Old Tingri is a a small dusty town comprising of rows of Tibetan homes, shophouses, restaurants and guesthouses with nothing much to see. We therefore decides to bypass the overnight stay and head straight to Mt Everest Base Camp. This was my biggest mistake.</p>

              <p>The ride from Old Tingri to Everest Base Camp was rough and it cost our driver his 2 front wheel suspension. He had to replace them when we reached the base camp. The sight of Mt Everest right in front of my eyes made me lose sight of my body condition. With the sudden increased in altitude, I was having slight breathing difficulty and my friends were having headaches (they never told me until it was over). </p>
              <p>Rongphu Monastery holds the title of being the world highest monastery. The chorten besides the monastery makes a great photograph with Mt Everest head skyward in the background and is a favourite even with the professional photographers. We were lucky that the sky were not too cloudy otherwise we may have to wait days before we can even get a clean shot.</p>

              <p>Our lodging was a normad tent on a dirt road between Rongphu monastery and Everest Base Camp. After settling into our tent, I decided to have a walk with another friend while the rest stayed put. I was starting to feel lethargic and could not keep up with my friend.

              <p>This was where our guide was sent away to India to study Tibetan in Dharamsala illegally by his parent when he was 9 years old. He told me his escapade encounter whereby they were set upon by the Chinese Border Police guard dogs, how they killed the dogs, escaped the border police and survived on dry corns on their way to India. 10 years after his education, he returned to Tibet. Today, he's more a Chinese Tibetan than a Tibet Tibetan.</p>

              <p>I had coughed the whole night with sputum on the tissue paper. It was only the next day that I discovered that the tissue was pink in colour. There were traces of blood in the sputum. We set off to the Everest Base Camp in a bus for the hike. Unfortunately, I was only to be satisfied with just a bus ride to and fro the Base Camp. All the photographs below were taken by my friend who did the hike.</p>

              <p>Everest Base Camp was first used by the British Everest expedition in 1924. The start point of the Base Camp hike is marked by a a prayer flags with a great view of Mt Everest and the springs below. The blue base camp marker reads Mt Qomolangma Base Camp instead of Mt Everest Base Camp as it is known by the Chinese. </p>

              <p>Arithematically, if you substract 5150m from 8144m, you are left with 3694m. All I have to do is just climb 3694m and I will also become the next Singaporean to reach the summit of Mt Everest. It's that simple! However, I'll be insulting all the climbers who reached the top or who gave away their life trying to reach the summit. I can only dream about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>This is the one of the star attraction of the trip as most of the earlier places were a revisit by me. During the early days, getting to these part of Tibet proved to be a challenge as transports and accomodations were not easily available.</p>
              <p>If you remember during my trip to Sri Lanka, there was a painting depicting the mystical Lake Anotatta at the foot of Mount Meru in the Himalayas and  according to the legend, the four sacred rivers of India flow out of this lake through the spout  in a form of a lion, a horse, an elephant and a bull? This could be the place. </p>

              <p>Mt Kailash is Mt Meru, Manasarovar Lake is Lake Anotatta and the 4 sacred rivers that flow out of the lake into India are Karnali which feed into the Ganges (south), the Indus (north), Sutlej (west) and Brahmaputra (Yarlung Tsangpo) (East). However in this case, only the Sutlej originates from Manasarovar Lake and it doesn't go 24 times round the lake.</p>
