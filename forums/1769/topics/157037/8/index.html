            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KarismaPurdue:</div><div class="quote_body">IÂ’ve read through the replies and frankly am not surprised by the replies but pleased the admin staff have not banned me for being Â‘tabooÂ’. It is the same old Â“letÂ’s hunt in packsÂ” mentality.<br><br>Meaning, this guy is the baddie, letÂ’s all gang up and Flame him which is a typical response in an immature board or should I say board comprising immature members. I was under the impression we would get a fair discussion in Club 30 as I thought it comprises of members above 29??? I stand corrected if itÂ’s not.. maybe you should change it to Club Elite or Club Elite Wannabe? Just a suggestion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Â…<br><br>WhatÂ’s so difficult about flaming the baddie or making juvenile remarks like heÂ’s Mummy is still nursing him? Nothing, it is sooo easy isnÂ’t it? ItÂ’s easy because you are in the mainstream.<br><br>So, whatÂ’s difficult to do in a board like this? WhatÂ’s difficult to do is going against the grain which typifies Singapore, go against the grain? Ohh! Hmm?!<br><br>Look back on your posts, did you have the courage to go against the grain in this thread or any other? I am sure many of you who have posted your replies will in you heart of hearts say no which typifies a mentality which will not suit you overseas where you have to be a #2 dragon.. a house lizardÂ…roll with the times and when the shit hits, drop your tail and hope. Why? because you are a foreigner with yellow skin.. just like me. Without your normal support group.<br><br>Which brings me to theÂ‘green eyedÂ’ issue. Frankly IÂ’m a Singaporean who has worked overseas for close to 9 years, most of it in Genoble, France. And many a time I have wished that things would be different and I could be back home making just enough to get by and feed my kids who I see every once in a while and being in my comfort zone with friends and family. So your issue of being jealous is Â‘not gravyÂ’.<br><br>Let me ask you something which any Singaporean overseas asks him or herself in quiet or troubled timesÂ…why? Why do I have to work away from my comfort zone? And the answer?...$$$. So what IÂ’m saying is, practice some humility (esp in a SG themed board), just because youÂ’re going away or are working away  (and in this case studying away) doesnÂ’t mean you are superior or any better than the other guy selling noodles in Toa Payoh. In fact, I am sure that the day will come when you long for the comfort zone which is Singapore (with all itÂ’s overweight baggage).<br><br>So, in closing.. you have the opportunity to go away, thatÂ’s great, but be humble, it doesnÂ’t automically make you a winner, donÂ’t be an elitist (in a SG based board).<br></div></blockquote>In the very first place,pardon my ignorance but did you ever state why and reasons to justify your claim as to why the people in here are elitist..All you ever did was to claim this and that,but not without actually posting the reasons to support your claim..And the flame-war between gaz and ged has got nothing to do with your claim of a pack of hungry wolves ganging up on a poor sheep..So take it as a seperate entity.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

If you have something happy, won't you want to share with friends or people whom you care?  Or let's work it the other way.<br><br>If you have a good friend who succeeded or achieved something, wouldn't you be happy for him/her?<br><br>If I can add, it is also about intent.

            <div class='col-md body'>err, I have no idea why you think we are showing off...why can't someone who is going to migrate soon ask for advice here in this forum? After all there are some others who are staying overseas right now and might be able to give some good ideas. When you are moving to a new place, there is a lot of things to take note of and what's better way to do that than to ask for opinions?<br><br>And pls, it is this thread of yours that is causing trouble, it has attracted many troublemakers to come in here and flame the regulars here. So should I say you shud never have started this thread in the first place so as to avoid people from starting all these flamings?<br><br>You have migrated to a new place before. You, of all, shud understand the excitement and the need to gain opinion from others before making the shift. If you can't even see this, then I am sad to say that your 9 years of experience overseas have done absolutely nothing in shaping your character.</div>

Does it really matter ? I like to talk to matured people .  I don't long for Singapore any more . 3.5 years out and never once for a holiday.

You are the one started the accusations  . Yes I stated the green eyed monster because I met many people like that  in real life . They flame people for asking innocent questions about migration . Rhonda was being happy that she could finally move out of singapore and into greener pastures. In no way can you understand the shit the healthcare profession undergoes in singapore.  No right have you to comment on any one being elitist . Even a cabinet maker can migrate  - it just depends how good his skill is .<br><br>Rhonda wasn't being elitist ...she was probably being relieved that finally she get to go somewhere which would appreciate her help and would pay her reasonably well for that same help, instead of rotting away in a place where connections and being a government scholar matters THAN WHETHER U CAN PERFORM IN THE ACTUAL WORK.<br><br>ELITISTS are the ones who chase us off from our homeland   because they believe we are sheep but they forgot people have minds of their own and skills which other countries want . Singapore was my home ....used to be my home ...you know how it feels to leave friends and family behind , I left everything to get the $$$ and to secure my parent's own future. I already hit the target and I am happy enough to slow down and look at my life. You think I would leave if I could do that in Singapore?<br><br>ELITISTS are the ones born with  the PLATINUM  spoon ,  connections  and power while the rest of us have to build our lives from the start. ELITISTS are the ones who encourage foreign talent to take out high paying jobs so that singaporeans like us have to work overseas for the $$$ .  HELLO....go talk to the <strong> REAL ELITISTS </strong> who call singaporeans stupid while they bask in their millions.  THe elitists need more humility than any of us in the forums ...go tell it to their faces - I dare you .  Of course u know what happens - they shut u up and continue on their elitists way .<br><br><strong> Oh by the way , gazelle is just one of those who just wants to show how elitist he is with his luxury hotels, his cars ( how great he actually bought a second hand car for his wife )  and a beautiful wife when he actually cheats on her online about panty sniffing  WHEN HE IS NOT EVEN IN THEIR LEAGUE<br><br>This reminds me of a lil tune<br>What ever you have I must have too<br>Whatever good you have I have it better than you ...<br><br></strong><br><br>There is always class ....and there is always crass....so go figure</div>

You are the one started the accusations  . Yes I stated the green eyed monster because I met many people like that  in real life . They flame people for asking innocent questions about migration . Rhonda was being happy that she could finally move out of singapore and into greener pastures. In no way can you understand the shit the healthcare profession undergoes in singapore.  No right have you to comment on any one being elitist . Even a cabinet maker can migrate  - it just depends how good his skill is .<br><br>Rhonda wasn't being elitist ...she was probably being relieved that finally she get to go somewhere which would appreciate her help and would pay her reasonably well for that same help, instead of rotting away in a place where connections and being a government scholar matters THAN WHETHER U CAN PERFORM IN THE ACTUAL WORK.<br><br>ELITISTS are the ones who chase us off from our homeland  because they believe we are sheep but they forgot people have minds of their own and skills which other countries want . ELITISTS are the ones born with  yje silver spoon ,  connections  and power while the rest of us have to build our lives from the start. ELITISTS are the ones who encourage foreign talent to take out high paying jobs so that singaporeans like you have to work overseas for the $$$ .  HELLO....go talk to the real elitists who call singaporeans stupid while they bask in their millions.  THe elitists need more humility than any of us in the forums ...go tell it to their faces - I dare you .  Of course u know what happens - they shut u up and continue on their elitists way .<br><br></strong>[/b]</blockquote>I stated earlier that if you have the chance to move..great and all the best..<br>but your issues seem to be diffrent and I totally agree with what you are<br>saying (?) that the forign talent (?)

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KarismaPurdue:</div><div class="quote_body">IÂ’ve read through the replies and frankly am not surprised by the replies but pleased the admin staff have not banned me for being Â‘tabooÂ’. It is the same old Â“letÂ’s hunt in packsÂ” mentality.<br><br>Meaning, this guy is the baddie, letÂ’s all gang up and Flame him which is a typical response in an immature board or should I say board comprising immature members. I was under the impression we would get a fair discussion in Club 30 as I thought it comprises of members above 29??? I stand corrected if itÂ’s not.. maybe you should change it to Club Elite or Club Elite Wannabe? Just a suggestion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Â…<br><br>WhatÂ’s so difficult about flaming the baddie or making juvenile remarks like heÂ’s Mummy is still nursing him? Nothing, it is sooo easy isnÂ’t it? ItÂ’s easy because you are in the mainstream.<br><br>So, whatÂ’s difficult to do in a board like this? WhatÂ’s difficult to do is going against the grain which typifies Singapore, go against the grain? Ohh! Hmm?!<br><br>Look back on your posts, did you have the courage to go against the grain in this thread or any other? I am sure many of you who have posted your replies will in you heart of hearts say no which typifies a mentality which will not suit you overseas where you have to be a #2 dragon.. a house lizardÂ…roll with the times and when the shit hits, drop your tail and hope. Why? because you are a foreigner with yellow skin.. just like me. Without your normal support group.<br><br>Which brings me to theÂ‘green eyedÂ’ issue. Frankly IÂ’m a Singaporean who has worked overseas for close to 9 years, most of it in Genoble, France. And many a time I have wished that things would be different and I could be back home making just enough to get by and feed my kids who I see every once in a while and being in my comfort zone with friends and family. So your issue of being jealous is Â‘not gravyÂ’.<br><br>Let me ask you something which any Singaporean overseas asks him or herself in quiet or troubled timesÂ…why? Why do I have to work away from my comfort zone? And the answer?...$$$. So what IÂ’m saying is, practice some humility (esp in a SG themed board), just because youÂ’re going away or are working away  (and in this case studying away) doesnÂ’t mean you are superior or any better than the other guy selling noodles in Toa Payoh. In fact, I am sure that the day will come when you long for the comfort zone which is Singapore (with all itÂ’s overweight baggage).<br><br>So, in closing.. you have the opportunity to go away, thatÂ’s great, but be humble, it doesnÂ’t automically make you a winner, donÂ’t be an elitist (in a SG themed board).<br><br>(base edited to themed in last sentence)<br></div></blockquote>Independent of anyone else who has written in response to you and to whom I have written in response to, I will say the following:<br><br>First, I am puzzled about the source from which you have derived this conclusion of elitism.  Rhonda has posted a few threads asking for advice about what she has to do and prepare for when she moves to Melbourne.  Is asking for advice a reflection of elitism?  That would be a very hard case to argue, would it not, since invitation of advice requires humility?<br><br>Is her enthusiasm for her impending move a sign of elitism?  She's obviously excited about what promises to be a great new adventure, without expressing any sense of being any better than anyone who will remain in Singapore.  Where is the elitism in being enthussiastic?<br><br>And what's elitist about soup?  Now that's just plain silly.<br><br>I'm saddened that you choose to be unhappy about your circumstances.  After all, I assume that you have chosen to work in France for substantial compensation, and there are plenty of people who seem to like Europe and might think that living there for some time might be a good thing.  As such, I expect that one could read your woes about being stuck in France instead of scratching for a living in Singapore as being somewhat trite, and dare I say, elitist.<br><br>Speaking for myself, I have absolutely no regrets about being wherever I am at any point in time, because I have it witin my power to choose where to be.  My heart is in Australia - I am free-sprirted, with a healthy disrespect for authority, and when I am there I find myself in good company.  Singapore is where I grew up and learned the majority of my principles, and I still enjoy the company of people who have accompanied me through the journey of discovering those principles, as well as that of new friends who share the same perspective.  I'm happy to be wherever I happen to be on any given day, be it Melbourne, Singapore, Los Angeles or Kanchanaburi.  Am I elitist for enjoying a flute of Veuve-Cliquot?  Am I forgiven when I have a Tiger with my old friend who works at Keppel Distripark or a Mekong with a Thai aircrewman who is generous enough to share his bottle with me in the middle of nowhere?<br><br>I'm doubly saddened when I read of your experience of being treated as second-class in France. I myself have been fortunate enough to have been treated with decency, if not genuine friendship, in all my 11 years in Australia.  And yes, I have been there when things go wrong with a lot of sh!t and a very big fan, and my cohort in Australia has seen Franklin's wisdom in preferring to hang together instead of hanging separately, regardless of colour of skin.  Quite contrary to your proposition, I am certainly not out of my comfort zone in Australia, or the United States, or in Singapore.  I have people that I can call genuine in all of these places and a few others, and that is comfort enough for me.  Put simply, I make myself comfortable wherever I am.<br><br>I'm not certain of the grain that you speak of.  If anything, a fair few of the people on this forum weathered the former Prime Minister's rant about quitters, and all of the slings and arrows of people from the old country who argued that it is better to be home with one's own kind.  These people need do nothing more to prove their bona fides as individuals who had the courage to go against the grain and listen to their better judgement instead to carve their own paths in life.  In a place like SGForums, the grain in fact militates against going overseas.<br><br>With all due respect, Purdue, from what you have written and from the examples that you have put forward, there does not seem to be adequate evidence supporting your claim that elitism exists here.  For such a case to be made, there has to be a statement, or at the very least clear implication, of a class distinction between people who are doing something or going somewhere, in contrast with those who are not.  Rhonda's posts about her move to Melbourne have not included any such statement or implication, so if you do assert that elitism exists here, I'd ask you to kindly cite examples of class differences expressed in the threads specified in your first post in this thread.</div>
