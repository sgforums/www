I'm not saying his definition is wrong, mind you (Live and let live, man!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) but it's just not the same as the generally known and accepted definition (Ok, fine if I'm accused of being wrong to accept the dictionary's definition   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ).<br><br>And then you have those animal who simply rode on the opportunity to pick up old fights and personal attacks, and post irrelevant nonsense which are of no consequence to anybody else.<br><br>Personally, while I've not met Rhonda or anybody else in this forum, I'm happy for Rhonda that she can pursue her own goals and fulfill her dreams after all her hard work and sacrifice.
