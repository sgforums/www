            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KarismaPurdue:</div><div class="quote_body">IÂ’ve read through the replies and frankly am not surprised by the replies but pleased the admin staff have not banned me for being Â‘tabooÂ’. It is the same old Â“letÂ’s hunt in packsÂ” mentality.<br><br>Meaning, this guy is the baddie, letÂ’s all gang up and Flame him which is a typical response in an immature board or should I say board comprising immature members. I was under the impression we would get a fair discussion in Club 30 as I thought it comprises of members above 29??? I stand corrected if itÂ’s not.. maybe you should change it to Club Elite or Club Elite Wannabe? Just a suggestion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Â…<br><br>WhatÂ’s so difficult about flaming the baddie or making juvenile remarks like heÂ’s Mummy is still nursing him? Nothing, it is sooo easy isnÂ’t it? ItÂ’s easy because you are in the mainstream.<br><br>So, whatÂ’s difficult to do in a board like this? WhatÂ’s difficult to do is going against the grain which typifies Singapore, go against the grain? Ohh! Hmm?!<br><br>Look back on your posts, did you have the courage to go against the grain in this thread or any other? I am sure many of you who have posted your replies will in you heart of hearts say no which typifies a mentality which will not suit you overseas where you have to be a #2 dragon.. a house lizardÂ…roll with the times and when the shit hits, drop your tail and hope. Why? because you are a foreigner with yellow skin.. just like me. Without your normal support group.<br><br>Which brings me to theÂ‘green eyedÂ’ issue. Frankly IÂ’m a Singaporean who has worked overseas for close to 9 years, most of it in Genoble, France. And many a time I have wished that things would be different and I could be back home making just enough to get by and feed my kids who I see every once in a while and being in my comfort zone with friends and family. So your issue of being jealous is Â‘not gravyÂ’.<br><br>Let me ask you something which any Singaporean overseas asks him or herself in quiet or troubled timesÂ…why? Why do I have to work away from my comfort zone? And the answer?...$$$. So what IÂ’m saying is, practice some humility (esp in a SG themed board), just because youÂ’re going away or are working away  (and in this case studying away) doesnÂ’t mean you are superior or any better than the other guy selling noodles in Toa Payoh. In fact, I am sure that the day will come when you long for the comfort zone which is Singapore (with all itÂ’s overweight baggage).<br><br>So, in closing.. you have the opportunity to go away, thatÂ’s great, but be humble, it doesnÂ’t automically make you a winner, donÂ’t be an elitist (in a SG themed board).<br><br>(base edited to themed in last sentence)<br></div></blockquote>You see Club 30s regulars as being elitist. Yet when asked about how deviant your idea of what "elitism" is from what everyone general agrees is, you claim that it is how you personally define it. But why stop here? Going along the same line of thought I can define any group of friends with shared interest as being elitist.<br><br>Compared to most of the people in sgforums, I am but a humble newbie. But even I could see that Club 30s people aren't exactly snobbish or arrogant. They simply share interests that are different from other singaporeans. So what is wrong with sharing opinions, discussions and ideas on their interests on the forum? Like you said earlier this is a forum. You discuss ideas, crap or whatever you wish on a forum. So please be open about this.<br><br>Club 30 was born and is part of sgforum so what right do you have to tell them to take their discussion elsewhere just because you get a feeling that it is "insensitive" to most singaporeans? Are you psychic and able to instantaneously establish mind links to all singaporeans so that you will know how they feel about issues in general? Or do you think fellow Singaporeans will get "jealous"?<br><br>If you want to diss then how about other special interest boards? There are many other forums that regulars discussing ins and outs about the "high life" that many "average" singaporeans might not be interested in.<br>Are they elitist as well? How about forums on certain rock bands? Forums that focus only on politics? Forums that discuss model collections? Does the average singaporean build models, discuss about a particular rock band and hold in depth political discussions?<br><br>Are you really that objective in your discussion? Your first thread has a mocking tone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are some things I feel I HAVE to say in here.<br><br>I DID wonder if Gazelle ought to be banned but that was because he continually tried to start a flame war with Gedanken by insulting him, and one fine day, after reading a particularly rude post, I just couldn't take it anymore, and wondered how we should go about this.<br><br>And then, I received advice from several seasoned forumites that it's no use getting people banned because they'll just resurrect themselves using another nick.  So, fine, I decided to take their advice and let the whole issue rest.  I was just hoping that Gaz would also be mature about this whole thing, and not stoke the fire again because after that incident, Gaz DID post in here a few times and I didn't call for a ban or raise a ruckus because then, he just shared his opinions without insulting anyone in here, which was fine by me.  Afterall, this forum thrives on an exchange of opinions.<br><br>So, Gaz, mock all you like about my 'failed' attempt to stop your obnoxious behaviour in here.  It was my decision to heed the advice given to me by folks who have been in sgForums longer than I have and oops!  I've done it again!  I've become a member of the elite again by asking people for advice, darnit!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>And Purdue, I do not know you, and neither do you know me.  For a stranger to come down so harshly on another stranger, based solely on a few recent threads, just doesn't reflect maturity and open-mindedness.  We can all see your painful attempts to disguise your personal jibes at me with supposed civility, but please... we aren't dumb.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Like I've said before, gee, I must be a dumb blonde, cause I sure didn't know that asking experienced folks for advice was a friggin' sin!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I live by the belief that the folks around me, have unique experiences, knowledge, and wisdom.  I love this diversity, and the folks who know me here, know for a fact that I love to ask questions and dig for details and information.  To me, it is an active learning process.  There is just too much you can learn from experienced folks, and yes, I do want to assimilate all that information so that I can gain from the knowledge and know what to do, what to avoid, and make sure that when I move to Melbourne alone, I won't land myself in dire straits because of being ill-informed, not doing my research, etc.<br><br>There is a rich minefield of information right in front of me, by way of the folks here, who are well-travelled and whom I have grown to respect deeply.   If wanting to tap into the info and experience goldmine is equivalent of being an elitist, then, ok, I'm totally guilty of being one, and unashamably so!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>If you find any of the threads in here frivolous, do what most of us do when we find similarly frivolous threads in the forum - we ignore it, and move on to something more interesting.  I might not like your posts / tone / style of writing, but instead of picking up sword and trying to be quarrelsome and antagonistic, I choose to focus on other threads that catch my attention.  You seem to like to talk about maturity, well then, surprise!  Maturity also encompass an ability to live and let live, to see things from several other points of view, etc.<br><br>An innocent thread seeking advice, has certainly produced unexpected responses.  Purdue, if you had made use of your working experience in a foreign land, and given me advice about how you survived the four seasons, as well as what to take note of when migrating, I would be more than indebted to you.  However, your version of maturity has instead, compelled you to start some sort of personal attack on me, and more than a few of us suspect that your agenda is self-serving, or should I suggest, self-consoling?<br><br>I will continue to post threads as and when I wish to, and I don't give a rat's ass whether you find them to be frivolous or not.  My conscience is clear, thus I have no fear.<br><br>If you wish to offer migratory advice in here, I'll be more than happy to listen and perhaps, apply your tips.  However, if you're here to ignite some flame war, then, please don't talk to us about maturity, because then, it would be extremely clear that that very quality has evaded you.</div>
