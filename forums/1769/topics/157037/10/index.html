I'm not avoiding the confrontation - hell, I'm inviting you to do it.<br><br>Now, instead of doing what you said you would, i.e. posting a scan of your first-class ticket, you're whinging away about me looking down on you.  Where's the ticket you bragged about?  Is it like all of your other claims that you can't back up?<br><br>You've talked the talk, but I don't see the walk - where's that ticket, or are you stuck because your bluff's been called? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
