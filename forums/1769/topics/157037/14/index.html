This is sad. They do not understand by switching to the defensive approach - they only prove to others how sad and pathetic their lives . Defensive tactics are usually reserved for someone who has something to hide , so there is really no point in asking them to tell the truth because it could have disappeared somewhere in the multitude of lies they created.<br><br>Provocation is the way to deal with such people - the more they lash out the weaker their position is .

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, at this juncture, we're going round in circles.

Nobody else actually seems to benefit from his producing the picture.<br>5) In sum, we're spending a lot of posts for no gain, except possibly our own amusement at watching Gazelle squirm.<br><br>We've reached a point where old material is being rehased repeatedly, which makes a serious dent in the entertainment value of this thread.  Therefore, I put the vote to the floor that we've had our giggle at Gazelle's expense and he's still failed to produce the goods, so we may as well let him off the hook and simply assume he's impotent.<br><br>What say you all?</div>
