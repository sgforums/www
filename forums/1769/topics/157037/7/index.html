            <div class='col-md body'>IÂ’ve read through the replies and frankly am not surprised by the replies but pleased the admin staff have not banned me for being Â‘tabooÂ’. It is the same old Â“letÂ’s hunt in packsÂ” mentality.<br><br>Meaning, this guy is the baddie, letÂ’s all gang up and Flame him which is a typical response in an immature board or should I say board comprising immature members. I was under the impression we would get a fair discussion in Club 30 as I thought it comprises of members above 29??? I stand corrected if itÂ’s not.. maybe you should change it to Club Elite or Club Elite Wannabe? Just a suggestion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Â…<br><br>WhatÂ’s so difficult about flaming the baddie or making juvenile remarks like heÂ’s Mummy is still nursing him? Nothing, it is sooo easy isnÂ’t it? ItÂ’s easy because you are in the mainstream.<br><br>So, whatÂ’s difficult to do in a board like this? WhatÂ’s difficult to do is going against the grain which typifies Singapore, go against the grain? Ohh! Hmm?!<br><br>Look back on your posts, did you have the courage to go against the grain in this thread or any other? I am sure many of you who have posted your replies will in you heart of hearts say no which typifies a mentality which will not suit you overseas where you have to be a #2 dragon.. a house lizardÂ…roll with the times and when the shit hits, drop your tail and hope. Why? because you are a foreigner with yellow skin.. just like me. Without your normal support group.<br><br>Which brings me to theÂ‘green eyedÂ’ issue. Frankly IÂ’m a Singaporean who has worked overseas for close to 9 years, most of it in Genoble, France. And many a time I have wished that things would be different and I could be back home making just enough to get by and feed my kids who I see every once in a while and being in my comfort zone with friends and family. So your issue of being jealous is Â‘not gravyÂ’.<br><br>Let me ask you something which any Singaporean overseas asks him or herself in quiet or troubled timesÂ…why? Why do I have to work away from my comfort zone? And the answer?...$$$. So what IÂ’m saying is, practice some humility (esp in a SG themed board), just because youÂ’re going away or are working away  (and in this case studying away) doesnÂ’t mean you are superior or any better than the other guy selling noodles in Toa Payoh. In fact, I am sure that the day will come when you long for the comfort zone which is Singapore (with all itÂ’s overweight baggage).<br><br>So, in closing.. you have the opportunity to go away, thatÂ’s great, but be humble, it doesnÂ’t automically make you a winner, donÂ’t be an elitist (in a SG themed board).<br><br>(base edited to themed in last sentence)<br></div>
