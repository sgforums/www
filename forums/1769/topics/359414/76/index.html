This went on until about 2am, after that, the people in the next room spent the whole night shouting and slamming doors until 7am. <br><br>"We were woken at 10.55am by the cleaner literally banging our door down to tell us it was time to leave, this was after we had less than 4 hours sleep because of all the noise. <span style="color: #0000ff;">I couldnt use the shower as only a trickle of water would come out and the water in the sink was scalding ho</span>t."</p>
