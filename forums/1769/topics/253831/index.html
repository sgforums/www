Judges has allowed for the couples to work out what are assets, what are to be given instead of allowing just plain taking.<br><br>Marriage cert to prove love?  Nah. Its just to prove a marriage.<br><br>Wedding dinners?  Dunno. Its a handed down practise and definitely not about announcing to friends and relatives.  And its just an excuse to celebrate and gather everyone around!<br><br>Previously, marrying couple gives each other families cakes to distribute to friends and relatives to announce a marriage.  So.....isnt that enough of a informing?<br><br>We had allow for commercialization to overshadow what a celebration a marriage is.  To take the plunge to live life as a couple.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It does appear that some people are a tad more suited for marriage than others.<br><br>Some couples get hitched, and then they fall into their new roles comfortably.  Better still, they have the same goals of having kids, starting their own families, and their value systems tend to be similar so other than a few hiccups along the way, which is inevitable in any relationship, they seem to thrive well as a couple.<br><br>Others get hitched without really understanding the full implications of it, and are thus not really prepared for the ensuing responsibilities, roles and expectations.  They start to feel stifled / get scared / feel inadequate or overwhelmed, and then they start acting like a frightened, cornered and captured animal!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Also, sometimes, you don't really know a person until after marriage.  If differences weren't already obvious pre-marriage, it'll definitely become glaringly obvious after.<br><br>I guess one just have to be careful about making the right choices.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Then again, I'm sure that if you asked those who are divorced, at the time of marriage, they thought that they had made the 'right' choice, so sigh... it's just not easy...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
