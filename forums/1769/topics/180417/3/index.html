I feel a bit awkward for them too. I mean, i wonder if they KNOW this is how most people will respond to them too... like u know.. a mixture of embarassment and awkwardness. Most of the time I will just be noncommittal. I won't pretend to say I have NEVER bitched abt my supervisor or my boss before... but most of the time, they know EXACTLY why I am pissed off with them already anyway.

(Its basically a work plan) So even though I was having difficulty with mine, I didn't dare to ask anymore. UNtil one day my asst asked why didn't I borrow one from my peers.<br><br>And I just said "donno leh.. i think issit they don't really like to lend me cos they are worried I will just copy?"<br>She said: "whatever gaveu that idea?? You can borrow from anyone!"<br>I said : "oh but I tried and.."

If you had revealed the name your assistant might have well told everyone, including the person you named, possibly starting with the line"I've got something to tell you but don't tell anyone else hor...." And before you know it, the whole company knows. I'd just rather approach the person directly and ask for the file. I blame your supervisor in this case for not being able to control her subordinates.<br><br>Worst line I've ever heard,and more than once too<br><br>"XXX told me not to tell anyone but I'm telling you hor, don't tell anyone else or XXX OK?....."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>At work, I've also put the foot down on gossip like this. Anytime anyone approaches me with that line, I cut them off and tell them I'm not interested to know. I'm always given a suprised and disappointed expression from those people when I do that.</div>
