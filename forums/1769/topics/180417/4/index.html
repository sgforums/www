            <div class='col-md body'>I have no problems with your comments <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In fact I do respect those that have been discarded by gahment but choose to stay cause of their affinity...I have lots of friends out there like you and I treasure them<br><br>On the other hand, I also have seen and talked to people who are like me, no affinity whatsoever.....and they choose to take that plunge...remember our forefathers are also migrants and you probably would not be here if they chose to keep with their affinity to China, India etc<br><br>Am just merely offering my suggestions that there is a whole big world out there....besides I am sure not all would just 'escape' at the slightest hint of adversity. There are also those who have checked their own backyard and done their research but have not affinity anymore.....like me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
