            <div class='col-md body'>Oh there was once when I was still in love with my crush...he gave me this keychain when he went on travels...nothing special about the keychain, it is something you would normally get for a friend as souvenir. But I really treasured it because it was from him...and carried it with me wherever I went. So one day I was running to catch a bus and I must have dropped it on the way. When I found out I was so upset that all my friends went out with me in the dark(already night time when I found out) to search for the keychain(to avoid suspiscion, I lied to them that a very important key was attached to the keychain...so makes it seems like I am looking for the key instead of the keychain lol). But in the end, never found it but the good thing was my crush spent the whole night consoling me... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I think a few of you here would know what I'm referring to.  The material things I lost during that period included all my kitchen appliances and wares, which had to be hurriedly given away to my neighbours then, and which up till today, I've never got round to replacing.
