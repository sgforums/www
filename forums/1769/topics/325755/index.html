              <p>Well usually there are 2 reasons for wanting to marry a dying man</p>

              <p>Yeah! I only knew about his saint Jack.</p>
              <p>What happened was I went to my regular tailor in Bangkok. Was talking to the boss then one ang moh came in. I dun even know who the hell he is and he started talking to the boss about amending his suit blah blah.... then while waiting, he started talking to me about what I did in BKK etc...then he asked me where I am from, I said Singapore. And thats where it all started and he started talking about his time in NUS, living in Singapore the pre-1965 period and why he wrote Saint Jack and how it got banned and later allowed to sell in Singapore again and abit of his married life and now he is staying in Hawaii if I did not remember wrongly. We even talked about Lee Kuan Yew haha! Cos the boss of the tailor shop belongs to the same dialect clan with Lee and he has a clan book that talks about the famous people in their clan so he took it out and show us and we started talking about the old times..of cos i did not know too much what happen before the 1970s haha</p>
              <p>Was a very nice person to talk to. And if I knew he was such a famous writer who wrote so many books, I would have ask him for his autograph haha...i tot he was just an academic who wrote the occassional book</p>

              talked about Lee Kuan Yew haha! Cos the boss of the tailor shop
              belongs to the same dialect clan with Lee and he has a clan book
              that talks about the famous people in their clan so he took it out
              and show us and we started talking about the old times..of cos i
              did not know too much what happen before the 1970s haha</p>
              <p>Was a very nice person to talk to. And if I knew he was such a
              famous writer who wrote so many books, I would have ask him for his
              autograph haha...i tot he was just an academic who wrote the
              occassional book</p>
