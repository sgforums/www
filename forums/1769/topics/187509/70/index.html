            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Japan to sell whale to hospitals, bars after expanding kill </strong><br><br>Wed May 10, 1:12 PM ET<br><br>TOKYO (AFP) - Japan will try to sell whale meat at cheaper prices to hospitals, bars and restaurants after expanding its hunt in defiance of international protests, a fisheries official said.<br><br>Environmentalists, who believe Japan's hunt is cruel and driving the mammals to extinction, have already been outraged by the glut of whale meat and the growing number of schools putting it on the menu.<br><br>The marketing drive will be part of the mission of a new whale meat trading company set up on May 1 by Japanese government agencies.<br><br>"Despite an increase in the supply of whale meat in recent years, our distribution channel was severely regulated and inefficient," said Hideki Moronuki, chief of the whaling section of the Fisheries Agency.<br><br>"We expect the new company to explore different sales routes including hospitals, popular bars and restaurant chains," he said.<br><br>"As whale meat is full of protein and low-fat -- good traits for health -- the new sales company is targeting hospitals as one of its consumers," he said.<br><br>"We hope whale meat will be enjoyed by as many people as possible at a lot cheaper price, hopefully at the same price as tuna."<br><br>Japan last year doubled its annual kill to about 850 minke whales and extended the hunt to other whales considered endangered.<br><br>Arguing that whale meat is part of its traditional diet, Japan has studiously ignored international protests, including Greenpeace and other environmentalists who dogged the Japanese fleet in the Antarctic from December.<br><br>But in a rare victory, fishing giant Nissui and four other firms recently donated their shareholdings in an existing whale company to the government after Greenpeace launched a pressure campaign targeting their other products overseas.<br><br>Japan officially stopped whaling in the 1987-1988 season in line with an international moratorium.<br><br>But it has since used a loophole that allows "research" whaling, while making no secret that the meat ends up on Japanese dinner tables.<br><br>"It is a common knowledge for biologists that research with killing is necessary to know basic information of whales such as age and sex," Moronuki said, in a position disputed by Western scientists.<br><br>Before the suspension of commercial whaling, Japan killed 20,000 tons worth of the meat each year.<br><br>The figure dropped dramatically to 1,500 tons immediately after the ban, but has risen to 3,000 tons in the 2000 fiscal year and 4,000 tons in the last fiscal year, Moronuki said.<br><br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060510/sc_afp/japanenvironmentwhales_060510171258" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060510/sc_afp/japanenvironmentwhales_060510171258</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Australia says Japan recruiting commercial whaling allies </strong><br><br>1 hour, 29 minutes ago<br><br>SYDNEY (AFP) - Australia accused Japan and other pro-whaling nations of recruiting poor countries to back their push for a resumption of commercial whaling at an international conference next month.<br><br>Environment Minister Ian Campbell said he fears pro-whaling nations could get the numbers to push through their commercial goal at the next meeting of the     International Whaling Commission (IWC) in the Caribbean starting June 16.<br><br>Campbell was at UN headquarters in New York this week for talks with allies about trying to block an IWC vote in favor of a return to commercial whaling.<br><br>"We've met with nations who are on our side, going through potential swinging votes and looking at what we can do to try and get that last couple of votes we need on the side of whale conservation," Campbell told ABC radio.<br><br>"The news from those countries is that our worst fears about potential recruitment of pro-whaling nations is going on," he said.<br><br>"We won't probably know how many nations have been recruited by the whalers until the eve of the conference," he said.<br><br>Opponents of commercial whaling have accused Japan and other pro-whaling nations of using financial aid as a lever to convince poor developing nations, particularly small island states in the Pacific and Caribbean, to back them at the 66-member IWC.<br><br>At the previous IWC meeting last June in     South Korea, pro-conservation nations led by Australia only narrowly defeated a Japanese-backed proposal to end a 20-year-old moratorium on commercial whaling.<br><br>Campbell said he expected another "tough" battle this year, although the recruiting success of the pro-whaling nations will likely only be known on the eve of the IWC meeting, which will take place on the island of St Kitts.<br><br>"Literally the night before I left Perth to fly to Korea for the whaling commission meeting last year, three nations were added to the roll," he said.<br><br>"You have to work on the basis that that may occur again, and of course speculation about the tactics that are used to recruit people is only just that, speculation."<br><br>Campbell said he expected this year's vote to be "as tight as ever".<br><br>"If there are last-minute additions to the roll from the whaling nations, that will make it particularly difficult," he said.<br><br>"It's an incredibly important environmental and conservation issue for humanity, it's not something that's an easy fight, but it's something that we'll keep fighting till we win."<br><br><a href="http://&lt;br%20/&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060511/sc_afp/australiajapanwhalingenvironment_060511043459" rel="nofollow"><br>http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060511/sc_afp/australiajapanwhalingenvironment_060511043459</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Japan to Boost Whale Sales, Hoping to Whet Demand </strong><br><br>JAPAN: May 11, 2006<br><br>TOKYO - In an effort to whet an appetite for whale among younger consumers, a new Japanese company is set to expand sales of the meat to include school lunches and some family-oriented restaurant chains.<br><br>The move is likely to outrage anti-whaling nations and environmental groups, who have long charged that Japan's programme of what it calls research whaling is really commercial whaling in disguise.<br>Tokyo, which maintains that eating whale is a treasured cultural tradition, abandoned commercial whaling in 1986 in line with an international ban. It began research whaling the next year and has called for a return to limited commercial whaling.<br><br>Much of the meat from Japan's whaling ends up on the tables of gourmet restaurants, but the now-limited supply has made it a pricey delicacy. Young people especially tend to opt for steak and hamburgers rather than raw whale meat or boiled blubber.<br><br>To broaden sales of whale meat, a new company has been set up following the return of Japan's whaling fleet last month from a hunt in which the take of minke whales nearly doubled from the previous year.<br><br>"Up to now, the amount of whale meat was limited, so ordinary people couldn't really get their hands on it," said Noriyoshi Hattori, director of the Institute of Cetacean Research, which conducts Japan's whaling programme.<br><br>He added that Japan was not trying to promote the eating of whale, merely to maintain its traditional culture.<br><br>"But if people can eat whale from a young age, they'll become used to it," he said. "We just want people to enjoy whale."<br><br>A THOUSAND TONS<br><br>The new company will start business late next month and hopes to sell 1,000 tons of whale meat over the next year.<br><br>Whale up to now has been allocated to each region of Japan and sold through limited channels, but the new firm plans to sell directly to places such as hospitals, companies that provide school lunches, and restaurant chains catering to families.<br><br>It also plans to make sales over the Internet.<br><br>Japan blames whales for declining fish catches. It supports protection of endangered species but argues that others, such as the minke, are numerous enough to be hunted within limits.<br><br>Japan's take of whale on its Antarctic hunt that just ended nearly doubled to 850 minke whales. Its vessels also brought back, for the first time, 10 fin whales -- which conservationists say are endangered.<br><br>"Given that our take of whale has doubled this past year, it would be difficult to sell it through the routes we have used up to now," Hattori said, adding that school lunch companies would be charged lower prices for the meat.<br><br>"We have to preserve this sort of traditional food culture among children."<br><br>Greenpeace condemned the new company.<br><br>"This isn't just scientific research anymore but clearly suggests commercial whaling," said Junichi Sato, campaign director at Greenpeace Japan. "Especially since they took nearly 1,000 whales, including endangered species."<br><br>Story by Elaine Lies<br><br>REUTERS NEWS SERVICE<br><br><a href="http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/36297/story.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/36297/story.htm</a></div>
