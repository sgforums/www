            <div class='col-md body'>TCM is very different from westerm medicine as western medicine believe in treating only the symptom and they do not believe that the body system is interlink together in a way that anything happen to certain organ can affect the remaining ones . While TCM acknowledge that the body consist of ying n yang elements which are delicately balanced within our internal organs . As such TCM is able to treat problems down to the root instead of just the symtoms but of cos slower then western medicine . And also a very skilled TCM doctor can tell your health much more then a western doctor can without having to go through so many test . One example is to detect whether a person is pregnant anot just by taking your pulse without having to go for pregnancy test or using test kit . I have a female chinese TCm doctor that can tell alot of your health just by taking my pulse . She was the one who told me to go for a full blood test because she can sense i have extremely high cholestrol content in my body without even having to go for any test and something is very wrong with my health as later i found out that my health is in the red light as not only i have bad case of thyroid but also have 1500 mg of cholestrol which is very dangerouse . And she even help my brother to cut down his cholestrol much faster then the western drug given by the western doctor . This i am very sure cos i myself also take the medicine which is in granules form in a satched but tasted very sour . My cholestrol lvl lower down much faster then the western drug which my specialise also dumb struck over how did i lower it down so quickly . And due to my old chronic ankle injury which western dctor keep giving me pain killer for it citing obese as reason , she gave me the medicine which really can stop the pain for abt 3 months even when i stop taking it . Usually normal pain killer can only ease the pain for a few hrs but hers can cure it for months before it came back agn .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In short think ok , if TCM is really as useless as what those western doctors have said , then how is it able to survive untill now which is already a few thousand years and now even gaining more and more recognition for it . I have been for cupping and acupuncture . cupping usually is used to remove stagnant blood in your body by pricking a few holes on your skin then use the cups to suck it out and is also used to treat rheumatism by absobing the excess moisture in your body that causes rheumatism .  As for acupunture as chinese TCM believe that there are channels in which our " inner energy " flows similar to those chakra channel for naruto anime or so called neigong in those gungfu movies . There is a saying in chinese medicine whereby " if it pains then it is not flowing smoothly , and if it there is no pain means everything is flowing smoothly " . So in acupuncture they study all this meridiens in the body and to regulate them using the fine needles to " adjust " the flow . Like when a muscle is cramped , it means the muscle is very tense and the blood is unable to flow out so they will use fine needle to sooth it then when the muscle relax itself the blood will flow smoothly agn . Acupunctures are noted for their speedy ability to sooth pains much faster then taking medicines usually within a few minutes after treatments you can feel the difference .</div>

I've recently come across something very similar, but seems much easier for everyone to do, no need to be some gongfu grandmaster or TCM expert. It is about simpler ways to stimulate the acupressure points and meridian, such as massage, gua sha, etc. Good thing about techniques like massaging is that it reduces the need to be super accurate, as required in acupuncture, hence making it easy for anyone to do. May not be as powerful as acupuncutre, but definitely worth trying for everyday health improvement and maintenance.<br><br>I'm still reading up and finding out more about this area. The book I'm currently reading is in chinese, translated title "Meridians of the Human Body: User Manual". Really facinating!</div>

I think if you want to learn all those stuff in detail, it will take 6 years or so to learn from TCM college or Chung Hwa Medical Institute in Singapore. If you survive that, you'll get some diploma at the end of it all. Courses are in Chinese only though.<br><br>If you are worried about paying a bomb or getting "bullied", you can try attending some courses conducted at Community Centres. If you search around People's Association website, there's some short courses related to how to prepare some chinese herbal diets, gua sha, meridian massage, etc. They should be cheap, and probably screened by the PA to throw out all the bullies! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
