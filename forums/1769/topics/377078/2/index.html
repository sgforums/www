              <p>Here's the common getting married because:</p>
              <p>1) I am pregnant.</p>
              <p>2) Either one of us need to run away from our parents</p>
              <p>3) My mama says she wants to see grandchildren before she dies.</p>
              <p>4) Going overseas to study, and needing your family to sponsor me to follow you.</p>
              <p>5) I want to keep my hdb flat after my wife/husband divorce me, and I do not have the finances or age to keep the flat as a single owner yet.</p>
              <p>6) My mama is old, I am old.  I need you (viet/china) to help look after my aged parents and myself.  Or in some of recently heard cases when a Singaporean ah pek tells his sister in the bus, overheard by some club 30 fellas ("But she says she loves me!) </p>
              <p>(My own experience was:  She was conned to marry her china b/f or husband when she was very young, and when the guy died, she has to come to singapore to find a job as a waitress  to support her two children, father, father in law, mother, mother in law, brothers and all those extended family siblings. Note:  China men all  seems to dies off very young.)</p>

              <p>One thing I noticed as I got older was that girls who were getting older, read- late 20's and 30's were marrying guys who they wouldnt have even considered 2 to 3 years beforehand. It was pretty obvious to anyone who knew them that she was settling in order to not miss out.</p>
              <p>I know some people who settled and they arent happy. Sure, they have the social comfort of not being single, but they arent happy. They just carry on with life and look after the kids.</p>
              <p>My question to those who "settle" for a guy, instead of getting the guy they'd really like to have (or, if you're a guy, and you settled for your "next best" wife), is did you tell your spouse that you would prefer someone else, but you want to get married, so settled for them?</p>

              <p>Nope. I'm not that desperate to get married.</p>
              <p>If I didn't meet my husband, I wouldn't have gotten married. I don't believe in settling for a guy so that I'm not left on the shelf.</p>
              <p>Ironically, we actually planned to get married later but due to us buying a flat we like earlier than expected, we got married earlier, which on hindsight is a good thing coz flats are so bloody expensive now.</p>

              <p>How many of us are born with the amazing decision making skills such that the person whom we marry will be our 'first choice' in relationships? Or have such a stagnant life that our choices should never change?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, 2nd choice or 3rd choice or 4th choice - doesn't necessarily mean it isn't the BEST choice!</p>
              <p>So it doesn't mean that if someone chooses a person he/she might not have chosen before, it means he/she is settling. It merely means that with the additional life experience, the choices have changed.</p>
              <p>And unless the couple continue to put in effort to MAKE this decision work out (whether your partner is first or second or whaatever), else no matter first or last choice, a marriage would never work.</p>

              <p>Used to date a girl before my wife. She was good to me in every aspect but somehow though we came to marriage discussion, I didn't feel in love. Then came my wife. In fact, every aspect of our character shows we are at conflict but we got married. I believe there's no such things as "opportunity cost" when marriage is involved. I can lose everything in this world but I know they can be gotten back but I will never get my dear wife again. Nowadays we still argue intensely over issues but no matter what might occur, I treasure my marriage and adore my wife.</p>
              <p>Everytime my wife asked me if she's pretty, I assured her, "Of course you are. The prettiest in fact. Why would I settle for second best?"</p>
