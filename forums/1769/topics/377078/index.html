              <p>One thing I noticed as I got older was that girls who were getting older, read- late 20's and 30's were marrying guys who they wouldnt have even considered 2 to 3 years beforehand. It was pretty obvious to anyone who knew them that she was settling in order to not miss out.</p>
              <p>I know some people who settled and they arent happy. Sure, they have the social comfort of not being single, but they arent happy. They just carry on with life and look after the kids.</p>
              <p>My question to those who "settle" for a guy, instead of getting the guy they'd really like to have (or, if you're a guy, and you settled for your "next best" wife), is did you tell your spouse that you would prefer someone else, but you want to get married, so settled for them?</p>

              <p>One thing I noticed as I got older was that girls who were getting older, read- late 20's and 30's were marrying guys who they wouldnt have even considered 2 to 3 years beforehand. It was pretty obvious to anyone who knew them that she was settling in order to not miss out.</p>
              <p>I know some people who settled and they arent happy. Sure, they have the social comfort of not being single, but they arent happy. They just carry on with life and look after the kids.</p>
              <p>My question to those who "settle" for a guy, instead of getting the guy they'd really like to have (or, if you're a guy, and you settled for your "next best" wife), is did you tell your spouse that you would prefer someone else, but you want to get married, so settled for them?</p>
