Those fellas in that thread see a problem, point out the problem to someone else, and expect those other people (in this case the UN) to solve Singapore's problems for us.<br><br>In the end, they fail to realise that in doing so, they have absolved themselves of their responsibility towards Singapore. I can agree that the MIW is doing a lot of things wrong, but hey, it could have been a lot worse. Instead of trying to get the UN to solve our problems for us, we should be focused on solving them ourselves. We should take responsibility for our own problems and not expect others to solve them for us.<br><br>And at the end of the day, those problems really ARE petty when you try to look at the bigger picture.
