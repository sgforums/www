(my daddy's a teacher too ) ... but i suppose it comes with the job ... personal attacks are one thing ... but restricting student's freedom of expression is another ... respect is a two way street ... remember that video from RI that showed a poor student being blasted by the teacher ? ... if the teachers can't even respect their student as individuals, how can they expect the same in return ? ... and how the students would turn out then ? ... my father's an ITE teacher, and his regular rant is against secondary school teachers, .... of how some poor student were already "written off" by their former secondary schools long ago ... (he actually had a poor student once who can't perform 1/4 + 1/4 .... chap was marked as a trouble maker and a poor student, as such his former teachers never paid much attention to him .... he was "written off" ...... ).<br><br>I shall always remember some teachers fondly ... as motivators, someone who believed in what they were doing .... for the others ... i think it would be better for them to find some other careers, to save their own sanity ... and their students too ...</div>
