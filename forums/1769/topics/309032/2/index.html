              <p>sense of humour wins. I like understated humour - the type where the guy knows he is amuusing without trying too hard.. and.. someone who gives me an interesting new perspective of things. Confidence comes a good close second - someone who can be a comfortable observer and be involved without needing to be the centre of attention.</p>

              <p>I remember this incident a few years back when I was in Raffles
              City, having dinner with my course mates, and I was cracking jokes
              and laughing out loud.  Our group was having noisy fun, and I
              was the ringleader of sorts.  Then suddenly, this ang moh
              walked past our table, looked at me and smiled right at me! 
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  And the coincidental thing was, at that
              time, we were actually conversing over IRC and because we had not
              met then, he didn't know that he was smiling at me, and vice
              versa!  It was only later that night, when we talked about
              what we had done that evening and he said he was at Raffles City
              and there was this cute girl having loads of fun cracking jokes
              with her friend etc etc that I just HAD to ask, "So what was she
              wearing?!" and it turned out it was him walking in front of our
              table and smiling at me!!!  I mean, how coincidental is
              that?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Girls who are confident, but not over-confident. Smart too, but i would like them to be genuinely silly at times. Able to hold a conversation well. Preferably good in english, speaks english.</p>

              <p>Other than that, he has to be confident, knows what he want. And a kind, considerate soul. He must also be able to communicate with me on the same level.</p>
