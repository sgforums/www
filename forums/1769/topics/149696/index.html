What type of job are you specifically applying for?<br><br>Strengths - I'd usually say that I've got a combination of technical &amp; people skills, am adept at using technology and at the same time, good with people (be they colleagues, bosses, or customers).  I'm also good at working in a team, or working independently.  (Trust me, employers love to hear that sorta thing! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br><br>Weaknesses - umm... dun say time management to this one.  That will surely NOT get you the job! I'll say that my weakness is that I'm too impatient, and wanna get things done fast - sometimes even faster than my colleagues, but have seen a way around it - that is, to help my colleagues along the way so as to speed up things.<br><br>What makes me suitable for this job - I'd usually speak on each point of the selection criteria and emphasize how I can do each of them well.  Maybe also say that I'm hardworking, loyal, and flexible too.<br><br>Perhaps you could also get hold of books on interview techniques to help you along, from the library or bookshops:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Brilliant interview : what employers want to hear and how to say it / Ros Jay<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Great answers to tough interview questions / Martin John Yate<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 24 hours to the perfect interview : quick steps for planning, organizing, and preparing for the interview that gets the job / Matthew J.
