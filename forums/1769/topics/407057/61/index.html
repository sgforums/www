              <p>There is no real need to sacrifice meat.... if anything, you need the protein.</p>
              <p>Rather, it is all about making healthier choices and watching what you eat. No point eating like a mouse on weekdays only to eat like a horse on weekends.</p>
              <p>Keep a journal of everything that you eat and drink, and note down the calorie content. Compare it against your Basal Metabolic Rate and exercise output - aim to have your calorie input lower than your output.</p>

              <div>There is no such thing, the reason why you are fat and flabby is because your muscles are covered by a thick layer of fat and no amount of spot reduction exercises will make your muscle definition clearer especially your fat and flabby stomach. I will train you for free for a year if you can send me a recent picture of your fat a** and proof to me you can get wash board abs in a month by doing just 100 crunches a day. You need to stop eating Sugar and crap for 2 secs, that will help.</div>

              <div><em></em></div>
              <div>If it is so easy to get big just by lifting some puny amount of weight, then you should either be the next Powerlifting champion or International BodyBuilding Champ. If it is that easy to get big then people wouldnt have to resort to anabolic steroids and they should turn to you for advice instead. Or you should stop walking because while walking, you legs are carrying your bodyweight which is way more than you will ever carry as a novice and that will make the legs big so I strongly encourage you get a wheel chair and make it an electrical one so you dont have to use your arms to push the wheels resulting in freaky big arms. Your body looks big, fat and flabby because you need to stop eating so much sugar and crap for 2 secs.</div>
              <div><em><strong>3.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> I have got bad genes. Despite training hard and eating well I am still fat.</span></strong></em></div>

              <div>In this case I would strongly encourage you get a shot gun, shoot yourself in the head and pray that you will get better genes in your next life. You need to seriously relook and change your perception of training hard and eating well. Brisk walking or slow jogging for 30minutes is not hard training, its called time wasting and you seriously need to STOP EATING SUGAR and<strong><em> </em>CRAP FOR 2 SECS.</strong></div>

              <div>Its like telling me you want to be only a little bit pregnant. Your body is one so you train it as one. If you keep training your upper body and neglecting your lower torso, you will end up looking like an orange supported by a pair of chopsticks and the only thing good about this is that you can save alot of money by buying kids size pants. But it only takes a strong breeze or my powerful legs to topple you. and then you will look like an orange rolling on the ground trying to get up but you cant because your centre of mass is so far off.</div>

              <p>Yeah, and one of the main problems with sugar and hfcs, is that it doesn't make you full, stimulates the appetite and makes you want to eat more. Protein, fiber and fat on the other hand fill you up pretty quickly.</p>
              <p>And  sugar, when not consumed soon after a tough workout, causes wild blood sugar spikes. which is a bad thing. </p>
