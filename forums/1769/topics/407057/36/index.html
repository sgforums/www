              <p>on my way home, took a bus from near Fullerton, hop onto the bus, only me and a old couple and a young couple.  we started chatting and they are very happy with the show... they are pleased with their goodie bags.  the old uncle even offered me his programme book..<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>but i do admit, the goodie bag is very nice and useful. old uncle said good for grocery and old auntie beaming away, nodding her head <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I forsee today as a crummy day.</p>
              <p>As I said on Twitter Acid, it's a sign that times are still bad and not like what the newspaper say.</p>
              <p>Anyway I do agree that times are good, but it's for the rich. The lower income people will always fall through the cracks.</p>
              <p>It's not like the YOG will benefit them. Like say in Thailand for example, it will benefit the poor because they don't clamp down so hard on the vendors etc.</p>
              <p>Over here I bet if you have some food &amp; drink stall you have to bid for it and what shit.</p>
              <p>Doesn't help that now with the casinos, a lot of retirees are just gambling their life savings away.</p>

              <p>And as I mentioned before, in other countries, major sporting events usual result in improved roads and facilities. The response here might've been better if that was the case but we've had to compromise and put up with double-standards. And if I dared to, I'd wager that NTU will pass on the cost of setting up the fences and cleaning up the hostels to its students.</p>

              <p>Well, it's the army that's behind this. Even its own internal activities and events are plagued by last-minute changes, wayang and cock-ups.</p>

              <p>And as I mentioned before, in other countries, major sporting
              events usual result in improved roads and facilities. The response
              here might've been better if that was the case but we've had to
              compromise and put up with double-standards. And if I dared to, I'd
              wager that NTU will pass on the cost of setting up the fences and
              cleaning up the hostels to its students.</p>

              <p>End result: you get hordes of students trying to board the limited number of buses. I've been at NUS for six years, and I've never seen anything like it.</p>

              <p>I think the most cock news I read lately is the one by CNN that their survey says motorist rather give way to the YOG bus than kenna fine and demerit points</p>

              <p>My nephew attended a seminar at RWS by our ministar Lim. He came back and asked if it was true that 60% of the people don't pay tax. I asked him if he knew what GST stands for?</p>
              <p>Can you believe that from the ministar?</p>
