              <p>Okay, he didn't meet his O Level goals, but in the end, he did manage to get into a JC, and he has already spent eight months in JC. So what is the problem, really?</p>
              <p>If he was saying that he got kicked out of JC because of poor O Level results, I can understand..... but <em>this</em>?</p>

              <p><br>A lot has to do with parents, and their "expectations".</p>
              <p>If anything, their "good intent" kills off the kid's brain cells most of the time.</p>
              <p>I had to teach sec 3 physics to such a kid before and its simply stressful and unfulfilling.</p>
              <p>I was so happy that I got fired through no fault of mine. Can you imagine trying to teach a kid who's less interested to learn than the parent?</p>
