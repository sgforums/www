              <p>oh yeah, speaking of travel agencies.</p>
              <p>my folks booked a two weeks long tour of US and canada last
              month, intending to go for a break after seeing to my sister's
              wedding ....</p>
              <p>along the way assorted members of the aunty brigade decided to
              tag along till there were 14 members in the group. Deposit paid,
              all members confirmed.</p>
              <p>shortly after the deposit was paid, the airlines announced
              widespread shortages of capacities and that ticket prices were
              going up 20 to 40% ....</p>
              <p>ho ! ... then the trouble started ..... delay here, dally there
              .... one of the aunties was a malaysian, and the travel agency was
              supposed to handle the visa ..... they just hemmed and hawed ....
              and finally got an appointment at the US embassy 2 DAYS before
              departure, when the visa takes around 5 days to process ? .....</p>
              <p>so the tour agency said, sorry, not our fault, this aunty can't
              go .... and since she's got to drop out, the group can't be formed
              ....we can either return you the deposit, or transfer you over to
              another date, each pax $750 extra in light of new air ticket
              charges .....</p>
              <p>bloody hell .... it's apparent they were trying to bust this
              group up cos this group confirmed the tour at old air ticket
              prices, which the agency couldn't get anymore ..... since it's
              eating into their profit, they don't want to take you either
              ....</p>
              <p>*ptui ! ....</p>

              <p>the bus driver suddenly stopped and realised what happened.. and pulled out his mobile phone...</p>
              <p>after about 10 seconds, the bus driver, hands shaking said to my friend " can you call for me... my hands are shaking" (in hokkien)</p>

              <p>FS and I don't even bother with 95 half the time.</p>
              <p>When going to school, we just let all those cuckoos cram themselves into 95 while we get a nice, comfortable journey on 198. Come on, a short walk from the AYE to Science doesn't hurt anyone, no?</p>
              <p>While going home, we don't even bother waiting for 95 unless if it's during off-peak hours. Half the buses don't even bother to stop because they have already been packed by people boarding at YIH and University Hall.</p>
              <p>So we would just cross the AYE and take 198. A five-minute walk is hardly a burden.</p>
