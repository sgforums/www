On Non-Elite Day, all Ministers and Perm Secs will give up driving for 1 day to join the sweaty, smelly non-elites in taking public transportation.<br><br>2. Admin Service officers will spend 1 day looking for work in the private sector, so that they can learn about their lack of employability and how their salaries donÂ’t deserve to be pegged to top private sector salaries.<br><br>3. Senior Ministers will not lecture Singaporeans for 1 day on the virtues of globalization.<br><br>4. Gahmen will waive GST for 1 day, because the lower income groups spend a disproportionate part of their income on GST.<br><br>5. Istana Kitchen will prepare a special version of mee siam without hum so that the Istana residents and staff can taste how mee siam is really served outside its gates.<br><br>6. NS-dodgers living overseas will be allowed to return to Singapore to do BMT for 1 day.<br><br>7. Ruffles JC will require all its students to wear Bata shoes to school, like the rest of Singapore.<br><br>8. Singapore Propaganda Holdings (SPH) will stop disseminating propaganda for 1 day. thereby reducing number of pages to just foreign news and the ads.
