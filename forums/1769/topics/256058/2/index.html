Are you applying that talent in your profession now?  Do you think that you'll eventually consider switching careers so that you can make use of your talent someday?<br><strong><span style="color: #A52A2A;"></span></strong><br>not something that i think can be applied to my current trade, will probably switch career soon but definately not because of my "talent"<br><br>3.
