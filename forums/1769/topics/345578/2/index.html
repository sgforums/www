              <p>Since young, I must have been very outgoing.. cos I lived in a sort of 'kampung' area where kids are running around without their parents since pretty young</p>
              <p>SO when I went to preschool, i didn't even notice my parents left. Too busy snatching the other kids' toys to play.It's like WOW SO MANY TOYS!!!</p>
              <p>Having said that, I did remember feeling very weird why some of the other kids were bawling their hearts out.I even rem asking one of them why she is crying.</p>
              <p>Oh but I hated kiddy day care. one of them leave me with clear memories of getting all the kids to strip, then sitting on the floor naked while the nannies hose us down like animals one by one. I refused to strip and was counselled by the teachers. I JUST REFUSED.</p>
              <p>I rem even in Primary 1, got one girl in my class who was so stressed that she would pee on her chair constantly cos too scared to ask teacher permission to go toilet.</p>
