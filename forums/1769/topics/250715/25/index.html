"Our politicians will just have to find vocations to which we are better suited, such as, oh, making butter cookies or drawing offensive cartoons. Or perhaps we should all emigrate to Singapore and learn how to run a great , democratic government."<br><br>Unconfirmed rumors claim that other European monarchs are contemplating the same measures, most notably the Kings of Sweden and Norway and the Queen of Britain.<br><br>In related news, Minister Lim Sway Sway said that Singaporeans knew the difference between clean and dirty wages, because Singapore is a money laundering centre.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

We knew they were head hunters because they were wielding spears and shields, had nose rings and a string of shrunken heads round their neck."<br><br>Exactly how they are getting to Singapore is unclear, but apparently they are traveling in canoes, island hopping along the Indonesian Archipelago.<br><br>Â“Good heads can fetch a very high price in Papua New GuineaÂ”, says tribesman Micari Motubo, Â“but unfortunately, they are hard to find in Papua New Guinea so we have to go elsewhere for the best quality. And we hear Singaporeans give really good head."<br><br>Fearing a brain drain, Minister Hock informed Parliament that no civil servant heads are reported missing but emphasized that Â“we cannot afford to lose a single head. They are all needed here in Singapore and the growth of the economy is at risk if too many good heads are taken away to other countries."<br><br>"Phew!" said Mr. Chin Pang Sim, a civil servant at the Ministry of Manpower. "Luckily we're not known for having hearts, otherwise heart hunters will also come after us."<br><br>When the news was reported that head hunters were after our 'sewer serpents', most Singaporeans reacted by saying, "Your head, lah!"<br></div>
