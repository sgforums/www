            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....something worth a mention.<br><br>Last thursday, was meeting my father and I made that angmoh boi tag along cos i tought to introduce him to father and hopefully father can take on that lost boi as a apprentice in his business.<br><br>Father's business involved building shipyards, repairing fishing boat engines and buy and sell generators to negotiating for gold sand digger ships &amp; timber.<br><br>Father dont want me involved in the business because he felt that its no place for a female.  The only female in these oily, dirty, rough &amp; tumble industry was a old fiesty lady with lots of capital support and strong macho backings.<br><br>and no matter what, females in the shipping engineering business has still some kind of taboo. (mind you, there is still malaysian kelongs that will refuse females from boarding their kelongs.)<br><br>So I tot to bring him a apprentice who will also need his help to venture out into a new work environment.<br><br>ANYWAY......I was being lor soh.....<br><br>Father and angmoh boi chit chatted and it turns out his late mother was a peranakan. From Malacca.<br><br>Father then mentioned that one of our grandmothers is also peranakan from Malacca.<br><br>No wonder my sister has brown hair and light brown eyes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Though all of us looks distinctly chinese/japanese.</div>
