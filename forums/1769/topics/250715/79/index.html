Yes... overexposure can lead to cancer.  In fact, Radiotherapists and Radiologists and all other staff who work in the Radiography Dept have to put on lead vests if they come into close contact with X-rays or stand behind a lead panel when taking X-Rays.  They also have to wear a special tag on their coat which absorbs radiation and indicates when they have had more exposure than is comfortable, then they will be reassigned to other tasks for a period.<br><br>Bear, I'm quite surprised no precautions are being taken for you guys!</div>
