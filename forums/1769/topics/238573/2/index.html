Civil servants may opt for a special 15-month extended plan (or $400 monthly)<br><br>There is a baby bonus for those who give birth to their first child within two years of marriage.<br><br>Couples who give birth to their first child within 12 months of marriage will be given a baby bonus of $1,000. Those who do so within 24 months will get $500.<br><br>Without the promotion, a China bride package costs $9,000 and does not include the $1,999 red packet, the instalment scheme and baby bonus.<br><br>In launching this interest-free instalment and catchy $1 promotion, Mr Wong is well aware of the potential backlash.<br><br>While potential clients will no doubt welcome the offer, some people have raised a cautionary flag. (See report on facing page.)<br><br>But as competition looms and industry players get more aggressive, Mr Wong sees the need to up the ante and offer something different to potential grooms.<br><br><strong>BOLD MOVE</strong><br><br>The $1 offer is a bold move for a once-conservative matchmaking industry, which started out by matchmaking men with brides from China.<br><br>Over the years, market forces and demand have driven agency owners to look to Vietnam, Cambodia and Kalimantan for more brides.<br><br>But Mr Wong is confident that his 'good intentions' will not be missed.<br><br>He said: 'The $2,000 token sum we collect upfront is to prevent people from abusing the system.<br><br>'We will be conducting the same checks as we do for all our packages - extensive interviews, character checks, income stability and so on.'<br><br>His agency is the only matchmaking outfit with CaseTrust accreditation - an accreditation scheme for retail and service sectors promoting fair and ethical business practices so that consumers can buy with confidence.<br><br>While Vietnamese brides are still hot favourites among many Singapore bachelors, Mr Wong noted that there is a growing number who are enquiring about China brides again.<br><br>Since last June, four in 10 customers who approached him ended up choosing a China bride. The rest chose Vietnamese women.<br><br>These China brides work and live in small towns and have never travelled outside of China.<br><br>Most work as retail assistants, factory production operators and restaurant waitresses, and earn between 800 yuan ($160) and 1,000 yuan a month.<br><br>Mr Tan, a civil servant in his late 40s, has already snapped up the $1 offer. He is earning about $3,000 a month.<br><br>He said: 'I've been putting off marriage for many years, and my mother has been nagging at me to settle down.<br><br>'It hit me that I'm not getting any younger, so when I approached the agency and learnt about this offer, I took it up.'<br><br>Mr Tan, who claimed he has never been in a relationship, doesn't see the $1 offer as a dollar value placed on his potential bride-to-be.<br><br>Yet he admitted that if he successfully found a bride, he would 'hide the truth' about how they met from his friends and colleagues.<br><br>He said: 'Other people might think that I'm paying for a wife and gossip about it, but I'm really paying for the agency's service.<br><br>'I can afford to pay for the package upfront, but since there's this interest-free instalment, I might as well take advantage of it.'<br><br><strong>Counsellor: Don't put monetary value on marriage </strong><br><br>CLEVER marketing gimmick, or a slap to the institution of marriage?<br><br>This is the question which ran through the minds of some people we asked.<br><br>And while some, like MP Halimah Yacob, didn't think a gimmick would push people into marriage, others had their reservations.<br><br>Family counsellor and therapist Charles Lee warned about having monetary values attached to a marriage and children.<br><br>Said Mr Lee: 'People should marry and have kids because they are emotionally and psychologically prepared, not because there is a monetary incentive dangled before them.'<br><br>Even Madam Halimah cautioned that going too far with promotions could be hurtful.<br><br>'We should not treat a marriage or the woman we want to marry as a product,' she said. 'It will cheapen the institution of marriage and demean the woman.'<br><br>Still, she acknowledged that most people are mature enough to think for themselves.<br><br>'People will get married and have kids when they are ready to, not because of a promotion like that,' she said.<br><br>'The $1 scheme is a creative and innovative way of attracting customers, but I don't think it will be the most important factor for rational people looking at marriage.'<br><br>Added Mr Lee: 'It is ultimately up to the consumer to be aware of the pitfalls, and be discerning enough to know if a particular scheme is suitable for him or her.'<br><br>As for whether the scheme could hurt the marriage, counsellor and psychologist Harry Low didn't think it would have much impact.<br><br>He said: 'If you want to hurt someone, you don't have to say you married her for only $1 or any other amount.<br><br>'Monetary value or worth is not the only thing you can use to hurt someone.'<br></div>

Civil servants may opt for a special 15-month extended plan (or $400 monthly)<br><br>There is a baby bonus for those who give birth to their first child within two years of marriage.<br><br>Couples who give birth to their first child within 12 months of marriage will be given a baby bonus of $1,000. Those who do so within 24 months will get $500.<br><br>Without the promotion, a China bride package costs $9,000 and does not include the $1,999 red packet, the instalment scheme and baby bonus.<br><br>In launching this interest-free instalment and catchy $1 promotion, Mr Wong is well aware of the potential backlash.<br><br>While potential clients will no doubt welcome the offer, some people have raised a cautionary flag. (See report on facing page.)<br><br>But as competition looms and industry players get more aggressive, Mr Wong sees the need to up the ante and offer something different to potential grooms.<br><br><strong>BOLD MOVE</strong><br><br>The $1 offer is a bold move for a once-conservative matchmaking industry, which started out by matchmaking men with brides from China.<br><br>Over the years, market forces and demand have driven agency owners to look to Vietnam, Cambodia and Kalimantan for more brides.<br><br>But Mr Wong is confident that his 'good intentions' will not be missed.<br><br>He said: 'The $2,000 token sum we collect upfront is to prevent people from abusing the system.<br><br>'We will be conducting the same checks as we do for all our packages - extensive interviews, character checks, income stability and so on.'<br><br>His agency is the only matchmaking outfit with CaseTrust accreditation - an accreditation scheme for retail and service sectors promoting fair and ethical business practices so that consumers can buy with confidence.<br><br>While Vietnamese brides are still hot favourites among many Singapore bachelors, Mr Wong noted that there is a growing number who are enquiring about China brides again.<br><br>Since last June, four in 10 customers who approached him ended up choosing a China bride. The rest chose Vietnamese women.<br><br>These China brides work and live in small towns and have never travelled outside of China.<br><br>Most work as retail assistants, factory production operators and restaurant waitresses, and earn between 800 yuan ($160) and 1,000 yuan a month.<br><br>Mr Tan, a civil servant in his late 40s, has already snapped up the $1 offer. He is earning about $3,000 a month.<br><br>He said: 'I've been putting off marriage for many years, and my mother has been nagging at me to settle down.<br><br>'It hit me that I'm not getting any younger, so when I approached the agency and learnt about this offer, I took it up.'<br><br>Mr Tan, who claimed he has never been in a relationship, doesn't see the $1 offer as a dollar value placed on his potential bride-to-be.<br><br>Yet he admitted that if he successfully found a bride, he would 'hide the truth' about how they met from his friends and colleagues.<br><br>He said: 'Other people might think that I'm paying for a wife and gossip about it, but I'm really paying for the agency's service.<br><br>'I can afford to pay for the package upfront, but since there's this interest-free instalment, I might as well take advantage of it.'<br><br><strong>Counsellor: Don't put monetary value on marriage </strong><br><br>CLEVER marketing gimmick, or a slap to the institution of marriage?<br><br>This is the question which ran through the minds of some people we asked.<br><br>And while some, like MP Halimah Yacob, didn't think a gimmick would push people into marriage, others had their reservations.<br><br>Family counsellor and therapist Charles Lee warned about having monetary values attached to a marriage and children.<br><br>Said Mr Lee: 'People should marry and have kids because they are emotionally and psychologically prepared, not because there is a monetary incentive dangled before them.'<br><br>Even Madam Halimah cautioned that going too far with promotions could be hurtful.<br><br>'We should not treat a marriage or the woman we want to marry as a product,' she said. 'It will cheapen the institution of marriage and demean the woman.'<br><br>Still, she acknowledged that most people are mature enough to think for themselves.<br><br>'People will get married and have kids when they are ready to, not because of a promotion like that,' she said.<br><br>'The $1 scheme is a creative and innovative way of attracting customers, but I don't think it will be the most important factor for rational people looking at marriage.'<br><br>Added Mr Lee: 'It is ultimately up to the consumer to be aware of the pitfalls, and be discerning enough to know if a particular scheme is suitable for him or her.'<br><br>As for whether the scheme could hurt the marriage, counsellor and psychologist Harry Low didn't think it would have much impact.<br><br>He said: 'If you want to hurt someone, you don't have to say you married her for only $1 or any other amount.<br><br>'Monetary value or worth is not the only thing you can use to hurt someone.'<br>[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>That is just so wrong...........</div>
