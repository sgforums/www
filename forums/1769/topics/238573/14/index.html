It just ain't worth it!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Starving yourself to death when it isn't famine!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I think it was on the TV or in the newspapers or science mags where I read that when the anorexics start starving themselves, the body's store of fat gets depleted, and then the muscles get broken down to provide the needed energy and the brain tissues also gradually gets targetted to provide energy.  The brain therefore undergoes some form of 'damage' which leaves anorexic sufferers unable to understand and grasp the concept that they are too skinny.  Sometimes, it's not that they won't reverse the cycle... it's that they've gone way too far to reverse it.  Cognitively, they just cannot differentiate anymore.  And this downward spiral only stops when the anorexic breathes her last...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

I know a female friend of mine who was a part-time model. She was under constant pressure to lose weight even though she was in the normal range.<br><br>She ended up being an exercise freak who would spend hours at end at a California Fitness gym and became bulimic - she would binge on large amounts of food at a go and throw up the whole thing.<br><br>She finally had the good sense to leave the modelling industry and seek help for her eating problems. She now eats regular, moderate meals.</div>
