I gave a 2 mths notice as required. They owed me 7days Annual leave and 2 days of public holidays.<br><br>2 weeks before, I submitted both a faxed and original copy of my leave application from 7th till 11th of july to her.<br><br>Last week when I tendered my resignation, I reminded her about my leave. She said got manpower shortage and she would call me in 3 days time. I told her if really got problem then I only need 7th, 8th and the 9th of july (urgent). In fact I can even take my off day on the 7th, so I would be taking leave on only 8th and 9th.<br><br>3 days passed but still no word.<br><br>So on monday I tried calling her. To no avail.<br><br>Yesterday I called her. She told me she couldnt give to me at one shot. I said its okae. I can split it up. I only need the above dates. She then tell me not sufficient manpower. I said its okae. i can arrange from another outlet. She then "ahh...uh...I going back office, I call you later"<br><br>That was 2pm. I received no calls from her at all. I tried both her hp and office from 5pm onwards. She refuses to answer.<br><br>Today, I tried calling her from 12pm. Every hour I called her hp and office, hoping she would answer. But NOoooooOO answer at all. I thought "okae, maybe she's at a REALLY LONG meeting" That was until 5pm when a colleague from another outlet called and informed us that she had called him. I was like ?????<br><br>930pm. My Shop IC managed to get through to her and reminded her AGAIN that since from tomorrow I would be off and from friday I would be on Leave, there would be insufficent manpower at the outlet. Currently, there's only my Shop IC and me working in this huge outlet which means he would be ALONE.(damn pathetic yeah ? Cos they couldnt hire ppl and they cant retain the staff  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br>SHe told him she will arrange for ONE staff to be here tomorrow. He asked "then her leave ?" She tells him "No manpower" and hung up.<br><br>????????????<br><br>I called her back immediately. I made about 10 calls. She never answered. I leave urgent messages on her hp but she ignores them.<br><br>If that was you, would you be angry ???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I mean, come on, she is the area manager right ?
