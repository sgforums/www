Here's a short write-up on him :<br><br>"Kent M Keith wrote his "paradoxical commandments" when he was 19 as a challenge to "always do what is right and good and true, even if others don't appreciate it.''  They were first published by Harvard Student Agencies in 1968.  More than 25 years later, Keith discovered that these inspirational words had spread around the world and were found hanging on the wall of Mother Teresa's children's home in Calcutta.  Keith's new book, ''Anyway : The Paradoxical Commandments'' explores the ideas behind the commandments and what it means to live them.''<br><br>So, I guess Mother Teresa didn't write that!     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
