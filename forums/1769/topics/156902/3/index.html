With programs like Skype, you can also cut down on your overseas call costs - these days I talk with all my business contacts using Skype for free.  Depending on your level of usage, you can get broadband access at a reasonable price, and ADSL modems are reasonably cheap too.  I brought an ADSL modem over from Singapore and somehow it didn't like the Australian network, so I picked up a new one locally for about $80.<br><br>As for appliances, secondhand ywould probably be the best way to go.
