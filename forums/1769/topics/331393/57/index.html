              <p>there was a time when tanks get by without the use of threat
              meter~ ok can wack the boss now full sunders up~ maybe that tank
              got by on that.. tho now blizz adding it into the ui is a nice step
              forward u can now see message when you are threat high or low etc.
               the inbuild calendar is also nice now wonder why it took them
              so long to get it in :/ now if they can work on their default map
              or button bar it just sucks balls..</p>
              <p>tare u meant soul shatter? most dps classes have a threat wipe

              Potency: The additional crit bonus is now consumed immediately on cast

              Bomb: Mana cost reduced to be the same as Arcane Explosion.. It no
              longer causes the caster to stand up when the final explosion occurs
              and it is now possible for each mage to have Living Bomb active on a
              target. </li>
              <li>Master of Elements: Now works with Living Bomb. </li>
              <li>Molten Fury: This talent no longer prevents Ice Lance ranks 2 and 3 from dealing triple damage against frozen targets. </li>
              <li>Reduced the mana cost of Fireball, Frostbolt, Frostfire Bolt, Arcane Blast, Arcane Missiles, and Arcane Explosion. </li>
