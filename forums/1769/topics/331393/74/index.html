              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Kel'thuzad, Sartharion, and Malygos world first kill by TwentyFifthNovember</strong></span><br>You might remember <a href="http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=25825.0"><strong>this news</strong></a> from a few days ago, most of the members from the top PvE guilds
              Nihilum and SK-Gaming merged in a single guild temporarily called <a href="http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/"><strong>TwentyFifthNovember</strong></a>. <br><br>The
              question is, how much time will it take to see them getting world first
              kills on raid bosses ? Easy, about 65 Hours and 30 minutes. Wrath of
              the Lich King was activated on european servers at 22:00 CEST and <a href="http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/"><strong>TwentyFifthNovember</strong></a> killed Kel'thuzad today at 15:30 CEST, and they also killed Sartharion
              the Onyx Guardian before that. Only Malygos was left and he just died
              at 18:45 CEST. <br><br>Yes we're talking about 25 man raid instances,
              it took them less than 3 days (68 Hours and 30 minutes) to get enough
              people to build a decent raid and down these bosses, it looks like the
              competition won't be easy in the future. It also means that they
              already cleared all the PvE content in Wrath of the Lich King and will
              have to wait for the next content patch 3.1 to have a chance to explore
              the Ulduar Raid instance. <br><br>Below is a small statement from their site.<br><br><em>We
              are proud to declare that all WOTLK PVE raid content has now been
              cleared. This is both a moment of triumph and a cause for concern. The
              question in all our minds right now is if we could do this, how soon
              until the rest of the top guilds in the world clear all the raid
              content that WOTLK has to offer? Did Blizzard miscalculated in the
              tuning of these encounters? Or is this Blizzard folding under the
              weight of a large casual player base that demands to be on equal
              footing with end-game raiders?<br><br>Malygos down…</em></p>

              <p>imho, the game is as easy as the more time you spent on it, its inversely proportional. more time spent, more practice, more chances to get better items etc. are the bc instances easy when they are first out? they are pretty easy now im sure. so i do hope wotlk instances will still be a challenge for most players. but the world first guilds they are making these statements makes me read them like they are just gloating. basing their first kill on unrealistic, punishing routines.</p>
