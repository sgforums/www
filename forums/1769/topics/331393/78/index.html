              We do have plans to improve these, but we don't think your dps is so
              awful that you will have difficulty leveling. Certain classes and specs
              have always excelled at leveling, which means others are going to be
              slower. If your leveling rate is too low for your comfort, you can

              have made so many Feral threads that I actually chilled on it a little
              because there were so many cries of favoritism. But I think on
              reflection, and as this thread suggests, I can't win on that regard so
              I might as well just reply to whatever threads I want to. <br><br>If
              your Ulduar gear has more armor on it than your Naxx gear (and it
              does), then it scales. You still need rings, necks and trinkets with
              tanking stats on them. You are just free now to look at other things
              beyond just the bonus armor value (which is still useful BTW).<br><br>Your
              Dodge diminishes, but it diminishes slower than warrior Dodge, since
              it's all you have. You get a huge benefit to Stamina (around 50%), so
              it scales very well.<br><br>We're not that worried with what Feral
              tanking stats will be in later raid content, but as always, if one
              class ends up outstripping the others, we'll compensate for it. (<a href="http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12666299730-cry-more--response.html"><strong><span style="color: white;">Source</span></strong></a>)<br><br><span style="color: white;"><strong>Swipe</strong></span><br>One
              quick question. I'm sure you've seen all the threads-- do you still
              believe bears are adequate AE tanks? Can you please answer our concerns
              with swipe's limitations and thorns' lack of scaling?<br><br>Thorns
              really isn't designed to be something like Damage Shield. That is an
              avenue to explore if bears started to fall behind for any reason.<br><br>I
              don't personally have any difficulty using Swipe (and I've tried all
              four AE abilities). It requires slightly more positioning to use, but
              not so much that I really fear that bears won't be brought on raids.
              Although I understand why Ferals like to downplay it, warriors do have
              concerns that bears will be more desired because of heals, Innervate
              and Rebirth. It's going to be difficult to really make everything
              identical, and that's not really the goal.

              <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">
              <li>Do we think hunters were underpowered in the previous Arena seasons? Yes.</li>
              <li>Do we think they will continue to be underpowered? We don't know yet.</li>
              <li>ZOMG
              didn't the beta prove that hunters are still underpowered? This
              requires more explanation. PvP relationships are notoriously difficult
              to theorycraft. Mostly it just takes a lot of games. While we had some
              talented players in beta, it's still a very small sample size. Nobody
              was playing with their "real" character. Few players went through the
              effort to gear up (meaning enchant, gem and try out options) the way
              they will on Live. The balance in beta was changing very rapidly,
              including many bug fixes. We did give hunters some new abilities, some
              of them potent, and we did change several other aspects of combat that
              will affect balance. Hunter dps is by most accounts on the top of the
              charts in PvE, so clearly the problem is more complex than just buffing
              dps. We also realize that PvP balance can change over time without us
              doing anything? How can that be? Well, players experiment and adapt.
              New strategies and counters arise. Now that isn't an excuse for us to
              never address balance problems, but it is an acknowledgement that
              balance is dynamic, not static, even without our involvement.</li>
              <li>Will
              we take steps to adjust hunters if they continue to be weak in Arenas?
              Yes. This is absolutely a concern of ours. To some extent my reputation
              is on the line here because I keep trying to assure players that we
              will make adjustments, and I know you'll throw it back in my face if we
              don't deliver. The game has only been out for a few days though, so
              it's just premature to make sweeping changes yet. I realize some
              knowledgeable hunters are convinced the changes we made were not
              enough. At the end of the day though, it is us, not the players, who
              need to make decisions about game design. We will always listen to your
              feedback when making our decisions though. (<a href="http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12661298386-hunters-will-be-fine-in-arena--80.html"><strong><span style="color: white;">Source</span></strong></a>)</li>

              are several similar threads on Prot paladin issues so forgive me for
              only responding to this one. My thanks also go out to other players who
              have tried to respond here. I will comment on a couple of things --<br><br>Righteous
              Defense -- We're not sure yet if we want to change this ability
              (possibly through glyph) or just add a normal taunt (for free -- not
              the 11 point talent). Both designs have their advantages.<br><br>Health
              -- While I do think the "huge differences" between warrior and paladin
              health pools are a wee bit exaggerated, we do have an opportunity to
              provide paladins with a little more health when we change Divine
              Protection and Divine Shield. The benefit of Sacred Duty to remove the
              attack speed penalty will be unnecessary with this change, so we
              thought we might add additional Stam to this talent instead. (The
              cooldown could stay the same.)<br><br>We're keeping a close eye on tank performance in general as players start to run the Northrend instances. (<a href="http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12643744594-tankadins-arent-very-happy-gc.html"><strong><span style="color: white;">Source</span></strong></a>)<br><br><span style="color: white;"><strong>Tanking and TPS</strong></span><br>Seriously
              though, it was the latter. The TPS may be an issue or it may not be.
              Players sometimes get worried about scaling (which is a totally valid
              thing to think about), but forget that some relationships won't show up
              in the current expansion. To use an extreme example, if one class
              outstrips another class when both have 20,000 attack power, then it's
              not something we're really worried about.<br><br>I will also add that
              paladin TPS started to eclipse warrior TPS in Black Temple just because
              the former scaled so well. A lot of the warrior threat at the time was
              just +threat abilities, while the paladins did more damage to generate
              more threat. They were really only limited by the lack of gear.<br><br>I don't point that out to say it will or won't be a problem. I just point it out to point it out.

But I think on reflection, and as this thread suggests, I can't win on that regard so I might as well just reply to whatever threads I want to.<br><br>If your Ulduar gear has more armor on it than your Naxx gear (and it does), then it scales. You still need rings, necks and trinkets with tanking stats on them. You are just free now to look at other things beyond just the bonus armor value (which is still useful BTW).<br><br>Your Dodge diminishes, but it diminishes slower than warrior Dodge, since it's all you have. You get a huge benefit to Stamina (around 50%), so it scales very well.<br><br>We're not that worried with what Feral tanking stats will be in later raid content, but as always, if one class ends up outstripping the others, we'll compensate for it.

I'm sure you've seen all the threads-- do you still believe bears are adequate AE tanks? Can you please answer our concerns with swipe's limitations and thorns' lack of scaling?<br><br>Thorns really isn't designed to be something like Damage Shield. That is an avenue to explore if bears started to fall behind for any reason.<br><br>I don't personally have any difficulty using Swipe (and I've tried all four AE abilities). It requires slightly more positioning to use, but not so much that I really fear that bears won't be brought on raids. Although I understand why Ferals like to downplay it, warriors do have concerns that bears will be more desired because of heals, Innervate and Rebirth. It's going to be difficult to really make everything identical, and that's not really the goal.

              <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">
              <li>Do we think hunters were underpowered in the previous Arena seasons? Yes.</li>
              <li>Do we think they will continue to be underpowered? We don't know yet.</li>
              <li>ZOMG didn't the beta prove that hunters are still underpowered? This requires more explanation. PvP relationships are notoriously difficult to theorycraft. Mostly it just takes a lot of games. While we had some talented players in beta, it's still a very small sample size. Nobody was playing with their "real" character. Few players went through the effort to gear up (meaning enchant, gem and try out options) the way they will on Live. The balance in beta was changing very rapidly, including many bug fixes. We did give hunters some new abilities, some of them potent, and we did change several other aspects of combat that will affect balance. Hunter dps is by most accounts on the top of the charts in PvE, so clearly the problem is more complex than just buffing dps. We also realize that PvP balance can change over time without us doing anything? How can that be? Well, players experiment and adapt. New strategies and counters arise. Now that isn't an excuse for us to never address balance problems, but it is an acknowledgement that balance is dynamic, not static, even without our involvement.</li>
              <li>Will we take steps to adjust hunters if they continue to be weak in Arenas? Yes. This is absolutely a concern of ours. To some extent my reputation is on the line here because I keep trying to assure players that we will make adjustments, and I know you'll throw it back in my face if we don't deliver. The game has only been out for a few days though, so it's just premature to make sweeping changes yet. I realize some knowledgeable hunters are convinced the changes we made were not enough. At the end of the day though, it is us, not the players, who need to make decisions about game design. We will always listen to your feedback when making our decisions though.

(9095)</span></a></strong>)<br><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Protection Tree</strong></span><br>There are several similar threads on Prot paladin issues so forgive me for only responding to this one. My thanks also go out to other players who have tried to respond here. I will comment on a couple of things --<br><br>Righteous Defense -- We're not sure yet if we want to change this ability (possibly through glyph) or just add a normal taunt (for free -- not the 11 point talent). Both designs have their advantages.<br><br>Health -- While I do think the "huge differences" between warrior and paladin health pools are a wee bit exaggerated, we do have an opportunity to provide paladins with a little more health when we change Divine Protection and Divine Shield. The benefit of Sacred Duty to remove the attack speed penalty will be unnecessary with this change, so we thought we might add additional Stam to this talent instead. (The cooldown could stay the same.)<br><br>We're keeping a close eye on tank performance in general as players start to run the Northrend instances. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12643744594-tankadins-arent-very-happy-gc.html"><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">Source</span></strong></a>)<br><br><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Tanking and TPS</strong></span><br>Seriously though, it was the latter. The TPS may be an issue or it may not be. Players sometimes get worried about scaling (which is a totally valid thing to think about), but forget that some relationships won't show up in the current expansion. To use an extreme example, if one class outstrips another class when both have 20,000 attack power, then it's not something we're really worried about.<br><br>I will also add that paladin TPS started to eclipse warrior TPS in Black Temple just because the former scaled so well. A lot of the warrior threat at the time was just +threat abilities, while the paladins did more damage to generate more threat. They were really only limited by the lack of gear.<br><br>I don't point that out to say it will or won't be a problem. I just point it out to point it out.

              <p>hihi, </p>
              <p>no lah, the reason i ask is precisely that lor. because if i am not wrong, dps gets new skills moving on to lvl 80 and that will add much dps im sure. i dunno if mage gets new skills tho but for druids yes.</p>
              <p>tanks usually have some innates to add threat to the damage they do so the more dps they do the more threat they generate as well.</p>
