              <p>I love the Laksa Yong Tau Fu at Dai Pai Dong!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif">  The Prawn Hor Fun is also very good!  The first time I tried it a few weeks ago, I counted 13 medium crunchy prawns, a heap of bok choy, and a very generous scoop of gravy, which was a tad too saltish. </p>
              <p>I love their big meat pao and their char siew pao too.  Their cheong fun is also not bad.  Their congee is way too saltish though. </p>
              <p>The grocery shops at Boxhill seem to be more hygienic than the Vietnamese ones in Victoria St. </p>

              <p>My first two years here, in Winter, I had small nosebleeds which clotted up my nostrils so bad I had to excuse myself every once in a while to blow my nose.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>The last winter, which was my third, I noticed that the incidence of nosebleeds had dropped drastically.  I guess I'm slowly getting used to it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif">  I love all Seasons here except Summer and I love Winter the best.  Late Autumn and Early Spring can be tricky cause of the heavy rain with strong winds that sometimes occur. </p>

              <p>This non-ending drought is really affecting produce and grocery prices.  My bro and family were extremely shocked at how expensive dairy products, bread, and even meat and vegetables and fruits are here.  They had expected that the prices would be much lower because the produce are all grown here.</p>
              <p>I'm still fretting over the price increase for Longans - AUD 11-12 / kg last year, but this year, it's AUD 16 / kg!  No makan longans this year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p>It is a record alright!  Today's newspaper declared it as 46.4 deg C.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>Strangely enough, because I kept my windows closed from the early morn, my apt never got as warm as it did during the heat wave. I guess the trick is to not let the wind blow hot air into the apt at all. </p>
              <p>I think it'll be worse next year.  It seems to get worse with each passing year!</p>
