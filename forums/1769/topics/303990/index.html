Do you take your grandparents for outings now?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">well, my grandparents weren't that mobile to start out with.. but i would like to think that they liked the food i brought them to eat when they were still around</span><br><br><strong>2. Alone or with your family?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">with the family</span><br><br><strong>3. Would you take your grandparents alone?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">i would but grandma would ask why the rest of the family wasn't going</span><br><br><strong>4. Usually how long would each outing last?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">not that long... at that time, grandma wasn't the most hale and hearty person around</span><br><br><strong>5. What sort of activity would you go for each outing?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">usually bring her out for a big meal or to go look around places like a shopping mall or the zoo or something like that</span><br><br><strong>6. If you do not take your grandparents for outing now, what is preventing you from doing so? (Unless they have passed away of course.)</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">they've passed on..</span><br><br><strong>7. Which locations would you think you would be interested to take your grandparents to?</strong><br>a) Chinatown Heritage Centre<br>b) Zoo/Night Safari<br>c) Sentosa<br>d) Botanic Gardens<br>e) Suggest others?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">places like malls seem good because they can look around.. i find that my grandma liked looking at new things.. and things we took for granted..</span><br><br><strong>8. If there is a social program which ties up youths who would like to take their grandparents out to these outings with subsidised tickets/group discounts, would you be interested? </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">it'll be wonderful.. for families that care, it'll be something which can be used to talk grandfolks into going along because they seem to usually be reluctant</span><br><br><strong>9. Would you get to know other youths on this program, or prefer to stick to yourself and grandparents?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">i'm not a youth anymore.. but it would be wonderful.. the older folks can interact with each other and the youths can widen their circle of friends too</span><br><br><strong>10. If transport is provided from meeting point - to outings - meeting point?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">again, it'll be wonderful.. not everyone drives and older folks tend to not be so mobile</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1. Do you take your grandparents for outings now?</strong><br>No longer.

Alone or with your family?</strong><br>With the family<br><br><strong>3.

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Do you take your grandparents for outings now?<br>My hubby and his family took his grandma to the zoo when she was still alive.<br><br>2. Alone or with your family?<br>With family.<br><br>3. Would you take your grandparents alone?<br>No, not because I don't like to spend time alone with them but because it's more fun to have the rest of the family.<br><br>I did take his grandma alone to do some grocery shopping.<br><br>4. Usually how long would each outing last?<br>At least 3 hours.<br><br>5. What sort of activity would you go for each outing?<br>Zoo and restaurants<br><br>6. If you do not take your grandparents for outing now, what is preventing you from doing so? (Unless they have passed away of course.)<br>Mobility.  At least at the zoo (Australia), wheelchair is available for hire so it's not a big deal.<br><br>7. Which locations would you think you would be interested to take your grandparents to?<br>a) Chinatown Heritage Centre<br>b) Zoo (Depends how old the grandparents are, I don't think night safari is good as they can't see very well and they can easily trip over)<br>c) Sentosa<br>d) Botanic Gardens<br>e) Restaurants<br><br>8. If there is a social program which ties up youths who would like to take their grandparents out to these outings with subsidised tickets/group discounts, would you be interested?<br>N/A since I am living in Oz.<br><br>9.

If transport is provided from meeting point - to outings - meeting point?<br>It doesn't matter.<br><br>I believe the relationship between the grandparents and grandchildren starts with the relationship between the parents and children.  If the parents are not showing good example infront of their children, they are not likely to learn to respect the grandparents.<br><br></div>

We used to take my paternal grandma out on makan trips or movie outings but since she became confined to a wheelchair, she refuses to go out with us.<br><br>Maternal grandma, nope.  Simply because she lives too far way and uncle and family bring her out instead.<br><br>2. Alone or with your family?<br>With domestic help and family.<br><br>3. Would you take your grandparents alone?<br>Nope.  Won't be able to cope because she has limited mobility now.  Besides, she is close to the domestic help and likes her to tag along.<br><br>4. Usually how long would each outing last?<br>When we used to go out, about 3 hours.  Longer if we're on a movie outing + dinner.<br><br>5. What sort of activity would you go for each outing?<br>Makan outings or Movie outings!  Grocery shopping outings.  Watch the Orchard Road Christmas lights outing!<br><br>6. If you do not take your grandparents for outing now, what is preventing you from doing so? (Unless they have passed away of course.)<br>Paternal grandma refuses to go out now because she's confined to a wheelchair.
