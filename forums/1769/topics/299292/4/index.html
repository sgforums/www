Its date of origin is unknown, although ceramics dating to about 1000 BC have been found in the city. The epic Mahabharata calls it Girivraja and recounts the story of its king, Jarasandha, and his battle with the Pandava brothers and their allies Krishna<br><br><img src="http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/7496/dsc00782pl0.jpg"></div>

We had to walk some 4km downhill on steep steps and uneven rocks<br><br>The hill is listed in Buddhist canonical texts as one of the places stayed in by the Buddha when at Rajgir; and several notable events, including an attempt on his life by his evil cousin Devadatta occurred there. The Mahayana tradition goes further; a number of its major texts, most famously the Lotus Sutra, were supposedly delivered as sermons there.

            <div class='col-md body'>This place is Venuvana. It used to be a bamboo grove where the Buddha stayed. Although this bamboos were no longer original, I have a special liking for this place as one of my favourite discourse "Sammanapala Sutta - The Fruit of a Comtemplative Life" was taught here.<br><br>A brief story of what happened in this discourse: - King Agajasatu of the Magada Kingdom killed his father in order to seize the throne. After he seized the throne, he felt uneasy throughout and decided to listen to a talk. Some of his Minister suggested him to listen to this speakers and that speaker but he turned them down. Just then, one Minister suggested hearing the Buddha out since he was in the bamboo grove.<br><br>He agreed and with 500 soldiers proceed to the bamboo grove in chariots and elephants until the chariots cannot go further and they had to walk some distance. As they were walking, the King became suspicious of his Minister because he was told there were 1250 monks with the Buddha but the place was so quite as if nobody was around. He asked the Minister if he was out to kill him but the Minister adviced him to walk further. There he met the Buddha and asked about the Fruits.<br><br>Finally at the end of the talked, he understood but because of his deed, he couldn't turn back. Anyway years later, he received the same treatment as he was imprisoned by his son who seized the throne from him.<br><br><img src="http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/2072/dsc00824wk7.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sal or Sakhu (Shorea robusta) is another most important timber species in Madhya Pradesh. It is a large evergreen tree belonging to the family dipterocarpaceae. It white flowers gives off sweet fragrance smell during the summer. It was said that the Buddha laid between 2 sal trees and passed on. Although this is not the original tree, the presence of the trees brings memory to the discourse.<br><br><img src="http://img125.imageshack.us/img125/3531/dsc00874uw7.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inside the parinirvna temple lies a colossal monolithic red sandstone carving of the reclining Buddha by a 5th century greek artists. This beautiful carving offers 3 different views in different directions.<br><br>If you look from the legs positions, the statue gives you the look of a passed on person. If you look from the torso position, the statue gives you the look of a sick person. If you look from the head position, the statue gives you a similing person. Such is the beauty of the artist artwork.<br><br>As I have mentioned that this is a redstone, devotees have pasted gold leaves out of devotion but have thus damaged the originality of the artwork. Worst, there was a vietnamese devotee who sprinkle perfume on the statue but was scolded by my teacher for causing the damage to such great artwork.<br><br><img src="http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj256/seveneleven_photoalbum/India/DSC00879.jpg"></div>
