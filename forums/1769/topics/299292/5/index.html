One night, Queen Maya had a dream than a six tasked white elephant decended from the sky into her womb. Months later, she became pregant with a child. During the Buddha's time, when a woman going to give birth to a child, she had to go back to her mother's house to do that. So Queen Maya travelled back to her homeland Koliyan Kingdom. On her way to Lumbini, she gave birth to a boy Prince Siddhatta on a full moon night. This day is widely celebrated by Buddhist as Vesak or Wesak Day. It commenerates the Birth, Englightenment and Death of the Buddha.<br><br>The little pillar on the left is the Asoka Pillar and the Temple on the right is the MayaDevi Temple.<br><br>One interesting story that happened here was a war between the Sakayan and the Koliyan over water because of a drought. The Buddha appeared before the great armies and asked the reasons for the fight. When he was told it was over water, he asked them the value of water and blood. when they told him that blood is more valuable then water, he asked them if it was worth it to shed blood because of water thus averting a war<br><br><img src="http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj256/seveneleven_photoalbum/India/DSC00922.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sarvasti - This is located in Maheth and known as Pakki Kuti. It was identified as Stupa of Angulimala.<br><br>Story time....<br><br>Angulimala was a student of a Brahmin and because of his intelligence and hardworking, he was well like by his guru. This however made the other students jealous and they spread rumours that Angulimala was seducing the guru wife. The jealous guru told Angulimala that his training was over and that he must repay him by giving him a present that is made up of 1000 fingers of 1000 people and made into a necklace. (Anguli means finger and mala means ring or necklace). During that time, a brahmin student was taught that the teacher is alway right and that he had to obey the guru.<br><br>So he started to become a highway robber killing people for the finger to be made into a necklace. He was said to be strong and fast that he could kill an elephant and outrun a horse. He was said to have killed 999 people and that the king had send his army to capture him. The Buddha knew that he could now be taught so he appeared before Angulimala. So when Angulimala saw the Buddha, he started to chase him but could never catch up with him. He stood there and shouted to the Buddha to stop but while walking on, the Budhha told him the he had stopped and the Angulimala should stop instead. On further queries, the Buddha told him to stop harming being. Then Angulimala vowed to stop killing and became a disiciple of the Buddha. On the way back, the Buddha met the king who told him that they are looking for the killer Angulimala and when the Buddha showed him Angulimala, they decided to forgive him since he had stopped killing.<br><br><img src="http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj256/seveneleven_photoalbum/India/DSC00967.jpg"></div>
