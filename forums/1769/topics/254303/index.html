            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, in The New Paper, I read a touching account of a lady and her li'l son who waited for the people who cleared rubbish in her neighbourhood to turn up so they could give them packets of cold Ribena drinks just to show appreciation for the work that they do.<br><br>I don't think I can reproduce the article written by Leong Ching in its entirety, though I really wish I could cause it is such a meaningful article, but here is an excerpt :<br><br>""Remember, when the truck comes by later, the uncles will come and pick up our rubbish.  It will be smelly but please don't shout that it's smelly," I told him.<br><br>""Why?" he asked.<br><br>""Otherwise, they will be sad," I told him.<br><br>""Why?" he asked.<br><br>""Because they are doing something miportant to us, and they get thirsty, So we are helping by giving them a drink.  We don't want them to feel that they are doing something that is smelly," I explained desperately.<br><br>Wow!  You see a lot of people walking past the rubbish trucks / trolleys with utter disdain on their faces.  We seldom hear of, nor see a fellow Singaporean teaching his/her children to respect the domestic help, much less a 'waste management worker'.  I really applaud this lady for teaching her son to respect all humans, regardless of status, race, and occupation.  Too many parents pass teach their children, either consciously or unwittingly, to segregate between the have's and have-not's, the 'successful' and the 'failures' in society.  We definitely need more enlightened parents like this lady around to ensure that our society remains gracious!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>This is definitely something to think about as we go about our busy lives.</div>

I guess that's the crux of your question.

I looked around at the med students... most of them looked like they came from well-to-do families.  A few of them appeared to be a bit arrogant and haughty, from the way they behaved.  Out of the whole lot of them, only ONE bothered to talk to an ah pek to reassure him and when his classmates all moved off, he stayed behind to button up the ah pek's shirt and say "Thanks!" to the ah pek for allowing them to put their stethoscopes to his chest for a listen.<br><br>I couldn't resist but to go up to him and tell him that because you see the ah pek as a human being first and foremost, you will do very well as a doctor, never lose that caring aspect of being a doctor.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
