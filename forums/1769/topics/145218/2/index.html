I don't agree with company loyalty anymore. I think it's an old concept meant for folks back in the 70s who actually had to band and work together to make money. We don't do that nowadays, it's usually a close to strictly employer/employee relationship nowadays, what with all the faceless corporations and all. If you're an accountant/lawyer you'd understand the importance of your personal market value to the company.<br><br>Sure sure we could spend all the time here talking about how folks in their 30s are finding it hard to find proper reemployment, how unfair companies are, discrimination etc. but it's not going to change the fact these people are jobless.<br><br>Anyway, to cite a real simple example, some dude from my company job hopped back into where i used to work, each time with a better salary and higher position. and he was musing about how he might actually have been retrenched in the several restructuring exercises the company has gone through. qualifications aside, it's really about moving on.<br><br>Interestingly enough, singaporeans who leave singapore and return as an expatriate tend to earn a much higher pay. just ask those psc bond breakers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Even if it's like a supermart checkout counter position?  This will keep an income coming in whilst you continue your job search.<br><br>I'm sure there's a need for Night shift cashiers and counter staff, but you must need to get out of your comfort zone (sorry to use that cliche) for those jobs.<br><br>I think after the initial period of enjoying  your newfound freedom with abandonment, it's best to quickly get a job, sometimes, even, any job, just so you'll not end up getting demoralised and that you'll be occupied.  Keeping busy can be therapeutic at times.<br><br>dragg, hope that you'll soon have good news to share with us!</div>
