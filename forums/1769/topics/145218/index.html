My<br>instruction was then very simple, throw away all job<br>applications from anyone age 32 and above! I did as told, but I was<br>puzzled why they do that and why they hired an oldman like me temporarily<br>to do the sorting job. After pondering for a while, well<br>maybe they just want to keep it hush hush, and an oldman as temp will<br>not talk, and even if he talks no one notices! Such practices suck, but<br>Singapore condoned it, so it perpetuates!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the young tends to try to  'reinvent the wheel' They always think the older people doesn't know nuts and try to start everything from scratch because they need to prove themselves.<br><br>I think it is very much based on the industry and the nature of job because for some work, older people are really much more suitable for it though I wouldn't even consider 32 old at all!!!<br><br>I have a huge shining example on how management made a huge multi-million boo boo and practically all the young staff ran away because they didn't want to clean up the shit. Older staff tends to stay on because it is harder for them to get a job outside and is much more willing to take hardship.<br><br>Of course you have those stubborn ones but you can't condemn the whole flock because of a few black uns.<br><br>Btw, I am not 30 yet  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
