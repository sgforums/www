            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, that famous Shut Up song from Black Eyed Peas.<br><br>I think we should learn to Shuddup AND TURN OFF THAT CELLPHONE when we're :<br><br>- in the cinemas and the lights have dimmed and the movie has already started;<br><br>- in the libraries; and<br><br>- when performances are going on.<br><br>I dread it whenever school's out because the cinemas will be filled to the brim with schoolkids who turn up in large groups and cannot stop yakking yakking, acting cute, providing stupid extra sound effects, and making their comments loudly.  Then, there are still the idiots who will have an entire conversation on their cellphones in the cinema, in the middle of a movie!!!  When you turn to give them dirty looks, instead of looking apologetic, they have this bloody defiant look.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  Bleah!</div>

There's nothing to show off unless you composed that ringtone so I don't care if it's the latest chinese / english / japanese hit song, just don't blast it to max volume and let it ring on and on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Wah...

The word "educated" in singapore should be lightly used...I recently might some science undergrads from NUS who didnt know who Freud was... well he would be from the psycholgy fields but I would have expected them to at least have some cursory knowledge of who he was...not a clue...unfortunately many are educated only in the text book sense, not in general knowledge, social ettiquette and basic human civility to each other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard that in Japan, they install some mechanism that prevents cellphone signals from reaching concert halls... why can't we do the same here in Singapore?

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not rascist, but I tend to find that it's the Asian people who have no 'social etiquette' when it comes to using their mobile phones... many times its Asian people who have their phones ringing at concerts, churches, cinemas!! No wonder some ang mohs tend to hate us <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Also I find it very annoying that when you're having lunch/dinner with someone, their mobile phone rings &amp; they just pick it up &amp; yak away without even bothering to say 'sorry, I'll just be a minute', or 'sorry about that'.  It is kinda rude!!! (sorry if I've stepped on anyone's toes here, just venting out my frustration :p)</div>

I resisted having a cellphone myself for the longest time!  People were carrying handphones around for years before I got my very first Nokia.  haha!  And that was because my mom INSISTED that I get one so she could contact me when I was in nursing school.  At that time, I mostly use it to SMS / call project team mates to arrange for project discussions and such.  Also to yak to SL!  hehehe!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Nowadays, my handphone is mostly silent, the way I like it.  Youngsters nowadays, don't think they can survive without their handphones.<br><br>You know, not only do people not observe proper handphone etiquette, they blatantly look back at you unrepentently when you throw them dirty looks in the cinemas, etc.  What the ....!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>SL, I don't think you're discriminating because it appears to be true.  Just like in the predominantly white countries, you don't get problems with people parking in the handicapped parking lots because the bystanders would take social responsibility and collectively give the offender hell so he/she would be so pai seh and never forget the lesson.  Here, if anyone blatantly parks in the lot, who bothers?  Worse, the offender, if approached would probably start acting all aggressive saying 'intellectual, logical' stuff like 'So?  It was an empty lot and I'm rushing for a very important meeting and need the space for only X minutes and besides, do you see any handicapped people around?' that kinda thing.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   Guilty, but still loud-mouthed and totally unrepentant.<br><br>Social responsibility, I think, is the remedy for social ills.  If EVERY SINGLE ONE of the cinema patrons group together and SHUSH the offending handphone user collectively, do you think he would still have the gumption to continue the conversation?  Next time, when you're in the theater / cinema / wherever and someone uses his/her handphone, either stand up and reprimand the offender or, applaud the one who dares to stand up!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
