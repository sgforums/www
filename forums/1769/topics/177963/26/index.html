Mike to Susan: you have all my pants <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>next is Bree who is having issues with an overreacting, control-freak mother-in-law.. who is overreacting in order to gain everyone's sympathy.. she's pissed off by her MIL<br><br>then Gabrielle is getting a cheque from Carlos who is in jail... next scene, he's being menaced by some dude in jail who makes him give his girlfriend $7k for a boob job.. Gabrielle talks the gf out of it and Carlos gets the crap beaten out of him.. Gabrielle still refuses (the moneygrabber that she is) to give the gf any money <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Lynette is having issues with Tom.. she's a control freak but he's a slob.. the house is a mess.. so she plots to have him clean the house by setting a mouse loose in the house secretly..<br><br>cut back to Bree who is having lunch with her MIL.. Lynette comes over and the MIL overreacts and gets slapped by Bree <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Edie comes over to Susan and starts harping on about how Karl says she's the best he's ever had and Susan loses it and tells Edie that Karl wanted to get back with her but was rebuffed and therefore Edie is just "convenient for Karl".. and after a while, Edie is run over by Susan who is trying to continue the argument.. her tibia is broken <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> (later in the prog, Susan says she sent over roses and Edie gets her fingers ripped open by the thorns)<br><br>back in the Scavo household, Tom freaks out and cleans the whole house.. but Lynette has a guilty conscience when Tom told her he smashed the mouse with a shovel.. a few times until it died..<br><br>in the meantime, Betty (the new neighbour with a maniac in the cellar) goes to a shrink to get some sedatives to place in the food of the maniac...<br><br>and there, Mary Alice Young says that it's all about control.. because "the loss of control means we put our fates into the hands of others and that is scary" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>there.. a precis of the whole episode <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
