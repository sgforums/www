              <p>Hi All</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not sure if this post is going to mean anything, but at 27, I worry alot about my future. Some say, you are only 27, why worry? 22 was like yesterday, to come think of it. It's only 3 years to 30! It feels very close!</p>
              <p>I do not feel that there is any job security, or brightness over the future. I have no house, car, money... All I have is lots of PCs and body fats.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I am trying to get a yardstick for the magic number, but anyone here can guide me to much "safer" 30? Something like saving how much, investing how much, getting some assets?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for advice.</p>

              <p>I wished to get married, but single hood seems best for me so far. My ex-gf gave me a nightmare.If there is one thing I love to do, it actually is writing programmes. Computer programmes.... my passion! If possible, code till the die I lie in the coffin.</p>
              <p>I know what I want to do, and how to get there. But more of like..... if things do not turn out the way I want it to be, what else? If 3 years from now, AI is born no programmers are required, most probably I might end up sweeping the roadside!</p>

              <p>I wonder if it's a Singaporean thing to be so concerned with age because here in Melbourne, I see lots of people in their 40's,  50's and beyond, still enjoying life and living life to the fullest! </p>
              <p>It really boils down to one's attitude.  Who dictated that by the age of 30, we MUST be married / own an apartment or at least paying the mortgage for an apartment / have $10K in the bank, etc etc?  Honestly, milestones that used to be achievable by the age of 30 are now pushed further back simply because :</p>
              <p>- people invest more years in getting that degree and etc, and some, like moi, never seem to stop studying!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  And then upon graduation, one is slapped with heavy study loans to repay, which will definitely set one's financial goals back by a few years at least;</p>
              <p>- 'modest' inflation over the years make it harder and harder to achieve certain goals like paying off your home / car / foreign wife; </p>
              <p>- people have more and more complicated dating and mating agenda's, there are more and more commitmentphobics, and there are a growing no. who actually relish being single!  Therefore, it seems to be harder to get married TO THE RIGHT ONE and settle down;  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>- our grandparents don't think twice about having children.  Now, there are people who staunchly refuse to have children or face infertility issues, etc. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, what used to apply to our grandparents' and our parents' era, the yardsticks they used to define 'success', no longer holds true for our generation and beyond. </p>
              <p>I see young Aussies saving hard only to splurge it all on travelling and never really bothering about mortgages till much later in life; I also see young Aussies getting married and having babieS and getting strapped down with mortgages, car loans, credit card debts, and then there are Aussies in their 40's and 50's who are still renting with no future intention to purchase their own property, etc etc.  They live their lives as they see fit, with no pressure to conform to any societal norms. </p>
              <p>There is a rising wave here of people in their 40's speed-dating and getting hitched not long after, plunging headlong into mortgages, and having babies.  The statistics were impressive enough for the local newspaper magazine supplement to spotlight the new-wave practice. </p>
              <p>Back to a more personal level, I think if I had gotten married and settled down when I was in my late 20's, I wouldn't be where I am right now.  I wouldn't have been able to switch careers, wouldn't have been able to pursue all the courses I did, and wouldn't be able to pursue my career development dreams, which is now, a bona fide Works In Progress!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  To achieve my immediate goals, I won't achieve the savings I want in the time frame I deem 'ideal', nor will I build the investment portfolio I desire, and I can forget about getting my own car or apartment at least until 2010 and beyond.  Does it bother me?  It used to, because I am afterall, a 'typical Singaporean' in some ways!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  But, I feel happier and more secure now, knowing that by the age of 50, I will be able to retire or semi-retire, and live the humble, comfortable life that I have single-handedly worked for.</p>
              <p>Heard of the phrase, "40's are the new 30's"?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>and for those who think, "oh i'm getting 30, i must get married and have kids"... well, i can only say, i pity ur spouse and kids... u didn't have them cos u want to, u have them cos IT'S TIME to... it's a sad life, if u are just living for the "norm" that OTHERS set... live YOUR life does mean living FOR yourself...</p>

              <p><br>Yeah i was waiting for someone to flame/criticize me. Dont live for the "norm". Living for yourself is best. One may be 40yrs old, single but happy. Another may be 30yrs old, married with children but not happy at all.</p>

              <p>I'm in my late 40's. I used to be a civil servant where the iron rice bowl was. But i left them in my mid 30's because I was not happy with what I was doing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But look to what happend to my ex-colleague who are still there. Jobs are no longer secure. some had their SRS (special resignation scheme) while others become obselete when their special skill become obselete with their equipment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you seek security in your job, upgrade your skill. Especially in your field of work.Set yardstick if you like but live your best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you seek  security in saving, do put aside some saving for yourself if you can. Start saving,  little by little an ocean is formed </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you seek happiness, learn to be contented. Happiness is not just about money. happiness is to be with your loved one, watching them grow. Happiness is to be healthy and to be able to be with good friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Learn to be contented and be less worrysome. If you like to read, may I recommend you this book, "How to stop worrying and start living"</p>

              <p>Perhaps, I am not prepared to enter 30 yet. Rather, it is the mindset!</p>
              <p>You see, I had been thinking about these problems since I was 25.</p>
              <p>Not such a high flying career, not much money, do have some stocks and finance planners to take care of some long term money issues.</p>
              <p>Am not married, and will take things easy and let nature takes its course. I am definitely not rushing to get married by 30! Enjoying my singlehood. Please do not misunderstand. :-)</p>
              <p>What Elindra said is what I am worried about, digging for a job at 30s. I am much more worried about money, because my dad left early, due to illness. The financial strain on my mother was a killer. 200k++ for medical bills. I asked myself, if one day my mother or siblings end up in hospital and in need of money, how can I help? If I am sick 1 day, will my family be able to cope?</p>
              <p><br>Maybe I am worrying too much, but I do hope to listen to some advice on handling the number 3, since I still have some time to prepare. Afterall, I am Singaporean... Kiasu, Kiasee and some time later probably kia bor...</p>

              <p>Btw does your family have health insurance in case something happens?</p>
              <p>I know for me and my husband we are both covered by our company insurance and also our own insurance for both accident and health  as a buffer.</p>
              <p>I don't know about his parents but mine are covered too.</p>

              <p>Whereby I can pay in cash and medisave to fully cover my mother, and fully cover her medical expenses. I am not sure if he meant 100% of medical covered, including staying at private hospitals. I hope it's true. Anyone want to comment or have ideas on what the policy is?</p>
              <p>For brother and sister, I should prepare a sum of cash for them, just in case they need it.</p>
              <p>Myself...... Perhaps I just worry too much. Cos I just dump my money into stock market, don't want to look at it cos most likely in the red. It will grow back eventually.  :)</p>
              <p>I hope, and pray, that I can do something I like as a job, and that will be programming.
