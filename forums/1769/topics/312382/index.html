              <p>I read this article in the newspaper today and had a good giggle here and there.  I thought of Bear and av, who swoon over this self-proclaimed domestic goddess, and thought it would be a great idea to have this article here for all to read.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>always loved her way with words not what she looked like..  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>who else would have gotten away with "<em>you are now on your way to gorgeousness</em>"</p>

              <p>which is why Bourdain is amazing to watch too.. the way he speaks about his travels... the words used.. comes across as a man who doesn't believe in his own press and puts on a cynical front which few believe in, searching for something... to transcend himself..</p>

              <p>Bourdain I love.  Bourdain's exciting, adventurous, no-holds-barred.  I loved him from the moment I read his first book. </p>
              <p>Rachel I love too, cause she's natural, unaffected, spontaneous, and high-energy.</p>
              <p>Gordon Ramsey I love, for his frank, tell-it-like-it-is devil-may-care attitude.  And oh, of course for that notorious fiery temper and that incessant cussing!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>Jean-Georges Vongerichten I definitely swoon over, because I stepped into one of his restaurants in NYC and had the absolute best time ever!  His food is simply amazing, despite the fact that he didn't prepare them himself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  He did come up with dozens of East-West fusion recipes that worked so well, it made me cry to eat the food!  I wish the experience never ended!</p>

              <p>Incidentally, since coming here, I tend love the working-class British here, as well as migrants from America and the European countries much more than the fair-dinkum Aussies.  I definitely love the Malaysians here as well, but the Singaporeans aren't so welcoming and sometimes, amongst the Asian migrants, there's this one-upmanship thing going on, which is tiresome.</p>

              <p>Me too!  Me too!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  I made a huge mistake of coming here although I really wanted to go to the States, just to appease my mom, who was nagging incessantly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  (Mom's nagging is quite toxic one... can cause nasty headaches, heart palpitations, cold sweat, and involuntary shivering... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">)</p>
              <p>I thought that the Aussies should be open-minded, since there are so many races and nationalities here.  I thought they'd be more like the Americans.  But, nah...</p>
              <p>I had a good laugh the other day when SL's cousin, who has lived here her whole life and is like a yellow-skinned fairdinkum Aussie, tell me that she has met quite a few Brits who complain to her of the Aussies being 'racist'!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  They also told her that because we're Asians, if we talk of discrimination, everyone would empathise.  However, because they are Brits, when they complain of discrimination or 'racism', people won't even give them time of day!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Poor sods!</p>

              <p>Alright, when you buy onions and garlic, they may appear 'clean', but there's always dirt and itty bits of soil somewhere.  It's always good to give them a quick rinse, especially if you're using them skin on. </p>
              <p>I just watched Nigella cooking on the food channel where she sliced huge Bombay onions in the skin to pop them onto the roasting pan.  Thing is, the skin had itty bits of brown dirt on, and she didn't even bother to wipe nor wash them off!  Just slice slice, then pop in the pan, where everything infused into the juices when roasting!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't be partial to soil-infused juices!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>And next thing you know, she took a bundle of parsley, and just twisted a general handful of leaves off the stem, and without rinsing them whatsoever, proceeded to slice up red onions, again without bothering to do a quick rinse, and toss the whole caboodle together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Hygiene when cooking, my dear!  Basic hygiene.  Unlike cows and rabbits and what other manner of herbivores, soil isn't meant to be part of our diet!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
