            <div class='col-md body'>Awhile back, I dunno if anyone remembers this, someone came here saying that the Tsunami was a sign that God wanted to punish the non-christians? Remember how many of us came out saying that was way too insensitive and a whole load of bull crap? While my heart goes out to the people of Louisiana and New Orleans, I have to use this opportunity to point out that someone could use this in the same way in saying Allah is punishing the non-muslims. I am sure most people can see the stupidity and meaness of spirit in making statements like this, and that using religion to gloat over others' suffering just because they aren't the same religion as u is plain stupid.<br><br>On another note, notice that 2/3 of the Louisiana National Guard is in Iraq and the short form of New Orleans is NO...<br><br>a xtian friend was saying to me that he wonders if this isn't God's way of telling Bush that God is saying the whole American affair in Iraq is a big NO NO. just an interesting thought, not my personal opinion tho.</div>

Look at the americans now, their nation is supposed to be the most civilised and cultured in the world, all those years of culturing, educating the peoples down the sewers overnight.<br><br>This goes to show that even with all the laws and civility, technology and education all around us it does not make any difference...we humans are uncivilised tribal barbarians, given the time and opportunity we will demonstrate it.</div>

Many who could have been were not.<br><br>That's to the government's shame.<br><br>We, who are from New Orleans, are no less American than those who live on the Great Plains or along the Atlantic Seaboard.<br><br>We're no less important than those from the Pacific Northwest or Appalachia.<br><br>Our people deserved to be rescued.<br><br>No expense should have been spared.<br><br>No excuses should have been voiced. Especially not one as preposterous as the claim that New Orleans couldn't be reached.<br><br>Mr. President, we sincerely hope you fulfill your promise to make our beloved communities work right once again.<br><br>When you do, we will be the first to applaud.</strong><br><br>The Times-Picayune, based in New Orleans, never stopped publishing during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The company fled its downtown office Tuesday and printed online editions of the paper until Friday when it resumed printing. The 16-page Friday paper was finished at the printing facilities of The Houma Courier, about 60 miles from New Orleans.<br></span><br><br>Article was taken from : <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3339750" rel="nofollow">http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3339750</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hurricane Katrina: Why is the Red Cross not in New Orleans?</strong><br><br>* Acess to New Orleans is controlled by the National Guard and local authorities and while we are in constant contact with them, we simply cannot enter New Orleans against their orders.<br><br>* <span style="color: red;">The state Homeland Security Department had requested--and continues to request--that the American Red Cross not come back into New Orleans following the hurricane. Our presence would keep people from evacuating and encourage others to come into the city.</span><br><br>* The Red Cross has been meeting the needs of thousands of New Orleans residents in some 90 shelters throughout the state of Louisiana and elsewhere since before landfall. All told, the Red Cross is today operating 149 shelters for almost 93,000 residents.<br><br>* The Red Cross shares the nationÂ’s anguish over the worsening situation inside the city. We will continue to work under the direction of the military, state and local authorities and to focus all our efforts on our lifesaving mission of feeding and sheltering.<br><br>* The Red Cross does not conduct search and rescue operations. We are an organization of civilian volunteers and cannot get relief aid into any location until the local authorities say it is safe and provide us with security and access.<br><br>* The original plan was to evacuate all the residents of New Orleans to safe places outside the city. With the hurricane bearing down, the city government decided to open a shelter of last resort in the Superdome downtown. We applaud this decision and believe it saved a significant number of lives.<br><br>* As the remaining people are evacuated from New Orleans, the most appropriate role for the Red Cross is to provide a safe place for people to stay and to see that their emergency needs are met. We are fully staffed and equipped to handle these individuals once they are evacuated.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://www.redcross.org/faq/0,1096,0_682_4524,00.html#4524" rel="nofollow">The Red Cross</a>)<br><br>HUH? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's really amazing to see the richest, most powerful nation in the world, not being able to get its own house in order in a time of crisis. Like the Chinese saying goes: feng1 shui3 lun3 liu2 juan4 (fortunes go around in cycles).<br><br>The fact that these places are located where they are, being low-lying and near the sea, means they will always be vulnerable to the forces of nature. It's only a matter of time before damage occurs. This is logic, or physical geography, nothing to do with religion. The same thing applies to the locations affected by the tsunami - Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, etc.</div>

Remember how many of us came out saying that was way too insensitive and a whole load of bull crap? While my heart goes out to the people of Louisiana and New Orleans, I have to use this opportunity to point out that someone could use this in the same way in saying Allah is punishing the non-muslims. I am sure most people can see the stupidity and meaness of spirit in making statements like this, and that using religion to gloat over others' suffering just because they aren't the same religion as u is plain stupid.<br><br>On another note, notice that 2/3 of the Louisiana National Guard is in Iraq and the short form of New Orleans is NO...<br><br>a xtian friend was saying to me that he wonders if this isn't God's way of telling Bush that God is saying the whole American affair in Iraq is a big NO NO. just an interesting thought, not my personal opinion tho.</div></blockquote>how come u talk about this in club 30??<br>if u talking about religion, go to a religious forum, not here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
