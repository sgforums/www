            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, my intention here is not to apportion blame to the ruling party.  My intention in starting this thread is simply to share the eye-opening experience I had in living in a democratic country.  Having grown up in Singapore, watching the ads that I've included was an enlightening experience.<br><br>There are things that they've done wrong, but there are also plenty that they have done right.  In a nutshell, I have not appreciated things back home until coming here, encountering the system, and then realising how efficient and productive Singapore truly is.<br><br>Sadly, a lot of Singaporeans have a penchant to whinge and keep asking for more without looking at what's been dished out already and realising that when we really have it good, to a certain extent.<br><br>Case in point, whenever I come across friendly Aussies who have visited Singapore, they usually say, "Singapore is such a lovely country!  What made you come here?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Quite a large no. of them have pretty high regards for our little island.<br><br>I never appreciated the stuff that I took for granted back home until I left for foreign soil.  I used to think the grass was greener on the other side because I used to belong to the group that whinged loudly.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   Now, I can only say that no matter where you move to in the world, there will always be good and bad, it's just what you make out of your circumstances.  Some things are better here, others are better back home.  It all boils down to us making the best of our current situation.  No matter where we are, we just have to roll up our sleeves and make things work.<br><br>I was foolish, and I think I didn't take the advise of a few forumites seriously then, because I couldn't see my own flaws.  Now, I think that Singapore, Inc. is doing pretty alright for a tiny little nation.  I look around at all the other foreigners here in Melbourne, and I always feel proud to say that I'm from Singapore.<br><br></div>
