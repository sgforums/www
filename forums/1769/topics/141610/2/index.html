            <div class='col-md body'>My city is populated with taxi drivers of eastern middle and indian origins, bringing with them their customs, music and driving habits, with a degree or two for good measures. Most think of driving as a blood sport, champion technique is to pull out wildly to overtake and slamming back sharply into the lane. Others indicate their intention to overtake by bleeping their horns, wing mirrors are strictly decorative. It is the grumpiest drivers who know the city best, in the same way some women know the layout of their local grocery stores.<br>Some drove as if they were in a hurry to receive their eternal rewards from Allah or Krishna, while I gripped the arm rest like it was a lifeboat on the Titanic. Phew....it was something of a relief when I do arrived at my destination.<br>From their cabins came Hindi or Arabic film music screeching at enough volume to wake up the dead then kill them again. At least the driver appreciates his music while I olerate it. Some speak to me in English, probably a near version of it, as I had difficulties making out what was said.<br>I have never found out why they scrutinised my fair skin as if searching for a clue to solve one of life's mysterious or why they wear their shoes with the back tucked in to make them look like slippers. However, taxi drivers work long hours, it would kill a person of lesser vitality. Three cheers to them!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I love to talk to the taxi drivers when I'm taking rides.  They are quite chatty and sometimes, it kills the boredom of the ride, especially if it's a long one.  Most of them are nice folks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>When I flag down a cab in my uniform, they seem to be a tad nicer to me, just cuz they know I'm a 'missy'.  They'll always ask how long I've been working as a nurse, do I like the job, do I meet nasty folks at work, etc etc.  Recently, one of them told me about how his wife was worried for a friend who just came down with stomach cancer and wanted to find out more.  A lot of times, I end up taking the opportunity to educate them a little on health issues.  hehe!<br><br>Sometimes, they'll ask if I'm married or not.  Depending on my mood, I'll give them one of several answers - 'fei fei bu mei, mei ren yao' / 'xian zai de nan ren hen nan xiang xing' / 'yao chu guo le, bu yao fu dan' / 'xian zai qing qing song song hen kwai le, jie le huen hui you xing de wen ti', etc etc etc.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Sometimes, they'll say the 'ji you du li sheng huo' is much better.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>There are a few drivers who will slow down once they start talking to you.  Only in those circumstance would I try to talk less because I don't wanna long, slow ride.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Taxi rides can be quite fun!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some taxi drivers may appear to be quite oblivious to every other vehicle around them, they may step on the accelerator hard as if crushig venomous snakes underfoot, they may even approach each rise in gradient like an enemy. Once they started talking, I couldn't shut them up even if what was said got more and more disjointed. That whatever they said was nothing I understood simplified my transaction with the middle eastern drivers. Some dished out unsolicited advice liberally, I should begin calling him my psychiatrist.<br>Pakistani drivers gossip about Indian movie characters who are either heros or villians and they are infinitely more ridiculous, more evil, more long suffering and more ugly than anybody I had ever encountered in my dull life. Some of them work out the fare as though it is a feat which seems to require the mind of an accountant.<br>The indifferent transport system serving my city is terrible on any day of the week. Without taxi drivers the work force would perished and civilization crumble. Despite their peculiar habits, I appreciate the service they provide.</div>

He met his match when one of drivers got angry n followed my ride from jurong to west coast. while i was alighting,the driver managed to catch up and a big quarrel started between him and the cabbie. I wonder what happened to the cabbie? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>I met 1 who horns @ every chance he gets whenever he spots "potential hazards" like for eg. Car changing lane ahead *HORN*, car entering expressway *HORN* (yet his cab is on the 2nd lane?!), pedestrian jaywalking 100m ahead.. *HORN*!? I mean.. we'r not even NEAR those "hazards"!

            <div class='col-md body'>I tired to talk to the cabby most of the time, unless when I am dog tired and need to catch a wink during the ride.<br><br>As I am out of the country most of the time, I find that they are a good source of information for informal updates.  Also they provide the "man on the street" view of the current affairs.<br><br>the other thing is that when u r talking to them, they tend to drive slower and keep them awake as well<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>most taxi drivers that i had met are quite wise n friendly and sometimes there are lots n lots of topics to talk about. Maybe some of those unfriendly just having problems on their own. There's one day i met quite an unfriendly one.. but turns out that he had just lost someone and ended up talk with me becoz he's doin lonely work n no ppl to talk with...<br><br>But i DONT THINK SO for Taxi drivers in malaysia... Mostly very rude and they CHEAT... They do something with the meter... One day from A to B is Rm 12.. another day may ended up Rm 16 - 20... From what i had experienced there.. ALL young indian taxi drivers cheat.</div>
