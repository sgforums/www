            <div class='col-md body'>I tried something new today, after deciding that waiting 25 minutes for the bus outside the camp was too much of a pain this evening (impatient me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ). I waited by the roadside, and showed a thumbs-up - the most commonly used sign by hitchhikers - to the cars passing by. I knew that it isn't a big thing here but I gave it a go.<br><br>The reaction of the first driver was unexpected...she looked as if I was offering a plate of pickled cockroaches. The cars after that simply didn't slow down....30-odd cars passed, and none of them stopped. Needless to say, the bus finally arrived and I boarded it.<br><br>I guess many drivers here aren't so trusting. That, or I'm not a gorgeous bombshell, my location was bad (I wasn't too far from the bus stop actually, and on the opposite side), or they expected me to smell foul. I could write something about it.<br><br>Drivers (and anyone who cares to answer): Would you stop for a hitchhiker and give him a lift, here or anywhere in the world? And how risky do you think the practice is?<br><br>P.S. I don't know anyone in my wing who drives to and from the camp yet...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am most likely to give a lift to a woman on her own during daylight hours, engaging in casual conversation, the ones made at airports or waiting at the doctors' office. The trip may be a touch uncomfortable without the exchange of pleasantries. Being female and alone is no threat to anyone. I have been proven wrong. A young thai lady requested a lift as she was new to the city, when she alighted so did my newly purchased books. Human nature defies rationalisation!<br><br>I almost never give a lift to couples, regardless of gender. When there is the two of them, I discard the thought of harm to the environment to the wind. An interminable line of cars on the motorway, all goingthe same direction, all carrying one person, I don't think of the gasoline consumed or the carbon monoxide produced. I know I am unable to deal with a couple in the event of an untowards incident.<br><br>I don't ever give a lift to anyone when I am running behind schedule. Time passes quickly when you are racing against it. The mother of all hold ups, road works, lane closures and bottlenecks. I drive as if I am in a hurry to receive my eternal rewards when  am running late</div>
