Sometimes, it's really really hard to communicate and you have to use some sort of board with alphabets written and point to each row and alphabet and spell out the words one-by-one before you knew what they wanted.<br><br><span style="color: red;">When I was sent to nurse a patient with an 'unknown' disease for a period of time once, I was so fearful.  Because the diagnosis was 'unknown' and the colleagues she had come into contact with were falling ill one-by-one, it was really frightening.  We couldn't enter her room without the full safety gear, ie. the goggles, the N95 mask, the disposable hair cover, the full disposable gown, and double-gloved, and it was hot under that gear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  </span><br><br>I nursed her for weeks and I remember having a nightmare where I woke up in her room, critically ill myself, with a breathing tube, not able to talk, people looking at me from the glass wall but not able to come in... and I was crying and crying thinking, "Noo... don't let me catch her disease, please!!"

It's hard to accept it when our body parts fail us, but gradually, we'll have to accept that we cannot change anything but our attitudes and live on for ourselves, for our family, for our friends, and most importantly, for God.<br><br>elindra, I encourage you and Chris to visit your friend as often as you can.  A lot of times, they get visitors in the beginning, then the visitors slowly trickle to a stop, and they're left feeling all alone and forgotten.  That's what my friend, who had Leukemia and died told us.  She cried and said that in the first week or so, EVERYONE came to visit her and she felt so loved.
