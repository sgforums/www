            <div class='col-md body'>We visited his friend in hospital yesterday. He has been in hospital for 3.5 months from a motorbike accident. No one knows exactly what happened though some eye witnesses said that he lost control of the bike and crashed.<br><br>He is still young (27 yrs old) with a good career and future ahead of him but now he is bedridden and can't even breathe properly (throat was cut to insert airtube <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ). We're not even sure if he will be paralysed waist down as he is just slowly regaining control of his limbs. He can only move his arms now, though he still can't use his hands.<br><br>Makes you wonder if sometimes you just take things in life for granted till you lose 'normal rights' to them. We are all praying for his fast recovery as he is the only child in his family as well.<br><br></div>
