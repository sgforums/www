            <div class='col-md body'>I've had the interesting experience of witnessing a family cutting off a male relative from their lives when he contracted Aids.<br><br>There were no visits, no calls, just some interest and concern from afar, though I'm not sure if that's entirely good-willed or plain kaypohness.  They were quite a close-knit family before this.<br><br>It was discovered that the guy contracted it from paid sex, though not sure if he had a regular habit for it.  So his family had the attitude of "he brought it on himself", "he's a bad person", and basically abandoned him.<br><br>On the day of his cremation, his wife turned up in a black outfit - black tight capri pants and a fitting, somewhat revealing tank top - not exactly conventional attire for a widow at her husband's funeral.  I've always wondered what she thought about the whole thing.  Maybe she felt she had something to prove.</div>

It will be difficult to adjust, if indeed he is a parapelgic, but it is still possible to live a full life as one. There is always a situation that is worse, not much comfort i uderstand, but i believe the problem he will face is one of acceptance,anger and guilt.<br><br>From experience i find that anger and guilt is the hardest to handle, i have had clients whom had lost their sight and still after many years are very angry, making the next phase of their recovery very difficult.<br><br>I have no one to whom to pray to, but as a fellow human being wish him well</div>
