            <div class='col-md body'>I believe everyone should have the experience of witnessing the 'Ugly Singaporean' when travelling abroad. I do understand that there are always black sheep amongst every flock but I think the percentage should be pretty high when foreigners start to perceive Singaporeans to have certain boorish traits.<br><br>Would this be the case whereby we are so busy educating and upgrading and fighting to be on top of the food chain that we forget about courtesy and grace, resulting into boorish, self-centered and lacking in social grace personalities.<br><br>Thought about this when talking to a Thai customer today. It can be majorly embarressing when travelling and your fellow Singaporean acts in a rude boorish manner and thinks that he is right overseas and every single neighbouring country around us is dirt.<br><br>I have been accused of being unSingaporean because I do not exhibit those traits that our neighbours have started to associate with all Singaporeans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> so much so that people always ask me,"Where are you from? Hong Kong?? Malaysia?? Japan??"<br><br>Anyway this is just my 2 cents. What do you guys think?</div>

My own stereotype is 'All Koreans are boorish louts' thanks to many bad gaming experiences and irl experiences with them.<br><br>The thing is that alot of people have the 'ME ME ME' mentality and that results in really boorish behaviour and yes....that elitist mentality too. Seriously countries like Thailand are progressing so fast that if we do not get off our high horses and surge ahead, they might just leave us choking in a cloud of dust.</div>
