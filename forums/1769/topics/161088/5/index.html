The least we can do is to give them another chance, share that whatever the person (who somehow wasn't groomed at home and didn't go to school) was doing wasn't right, and hope he/she and others have the humility to learn. If he/she is too proud and self-righteous, then what other way do we show our disapproval of such behaviour?<br><br>On another note, it's shocking that there are people who've been through school (and even to university) but behave as if that education didn't count, both here and abroad.
