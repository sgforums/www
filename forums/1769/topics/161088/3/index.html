            <div class='col-md body'>Hence I used the maxim, "when in Rome, do as the Romans do." Which also means dressing down if your fellow guests are doing so. Of course, if you can't afford a suit or forgot to bring one along for the trip, few will find fault with you.<br><br>I admit I wasn't clear enough in my previous post. I doubt this behaviour is acceptable anywhere in the world:<br><br>- (At a buffet spread) Piling food on your plate, and then refusing to eat more than a little bit<br>- Breaking your hosts' crockery when you're impatient<br>- Holding a sit-down protest in an airplane or a theatre because of something which irritated you<br>- Littering (eveyone else around you might be doing it but you know better)<br>- Picking and destroying flora and fauna from a nature reserve park (in spite of the signs around you)<br><br>It's all stuff we've encountered before or read in the papers. We're focusing on this in this thread (as opposed to how you should spoon your soup, follow superstitious practices or speak to one another). And such behaviour is disgraceful when we talk about being a gracious society and a first-world nation.<br><br>True, there are white people and other Asians who also behave like imbeciles on our soil, but we're guilty of it as well. "You see the speck in your neighbour's eye, but you don't see the log in your own eye." A log because such manners are unworthy of our (presumed) upbringing, we treat our own people the same, we criticise visitors and yet we want to be a top tourist attraction.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Not wasting food? the west throw away all their fish head, pig intestine etc, they only consume the crawl of the crab and throw away the body. that is consider wasting food if you speak to any asian.<br><br>one can only dress "appropriately" if you have got the money to buy a nice suit, leather shoe, leather belt, nice watch, nice collar shirt.

            <div class='col-md body'>Humm. Agree and disagree. When you say cultured or Uncultured - the question is... what culture are you referring to?<br><br>Often we take our cue from western countries and forget that traditionally it is the Asians that are famous for their rites.<br><br>The Indians have Namaste in greeting to show equality and brotherhood.<br>The Japanese bow. The Chinese have an entire bible on 'li ly' rites on what to do between people of different positions and status. We can go on and on.<br><br>However, as we grow to 'despise' our feudalistic roots, we appear to 'forget' that the Asians have every bit of right to be polite in our own way as it is for the Occidental! It doesn't NEED to be servile - for some reason Oriental courtesy always seem to be associated with service. And we dont have to just 'learn' from the 'westerners', we can start by learning from ourselves - Asian-style humility, diplomacy, courtesy and hospitality.<br><br>With regard to comment about westerners not having the 'holier-than-thou' attitude.. i beg to differ. Lots of them do - they just show it differently.<br><br></div>
