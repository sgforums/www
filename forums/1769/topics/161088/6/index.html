            <div class='col-md body'>OLONGAPO, Philippines: Six US Marines accused of raping a Filipina woman are to appear before prosecutors in what is seen as a litmus test for a treaty that protects American troops serving here.<br><br>The six are in US custody and are expected to deny allegations by a 22-year-old Filipina that they raped her in a van earlier this month.<br><br>The servicemen were part of a US contingent that was taking part in joint exercises in the former US naval base of Subic at the time.<br><br>The case has drawn widespread media attention in this former American colony and human rights advocates say it has opened up old wounds caused by past abuses.<br><br>US diplomats have refused to turn the men over to Philippine authorities and have invoked the "visiting forces agreement."<br><br>The treaty, forged in 1998, grants limited immunity to criminal prosecution to US troops when they are engaged in joint manoeuvres in this country.<br><br>"This is a test case for the VFA. This is the first time that we are investigating US servicemen under the treaty," prosecutor Raymond Viray told AFP here as he prepared for the hearing, expected to begin at 0630 GMT.<br><br>"We expect the soldiers and their lawyers to be here, and we will also be presenting five witnesses with corroborative statements backing up the alleged victim," he said.<br><br>The Americans were expected to deny any wrongdoing. Another round of investigations is set for November 29, after which prosecutors will determine whether there is probable cause to charge them in court.<br><br>If a case against them is established, the soldiers would be arrested and detained in local courts and tried in the Philippines. Rape is punishable by life imprisonment or death, if there are aggravating circumstances.<br><br>Viray said one of the six US servicemen he identified as Albert Lara has specifically asked to be able to challenge the alleged victim -- whose identity has been withheld -- face-to-face before the prosecutor.<br><br>Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo has asked the US embassy to turn over the suspects, citing the sensitivity of the case.<br><br>"The United States government has been made fully aware of the importance that the Philippine government and the Filipino people are giving to this case, as well as our sentiments and position that the Philippines has primary jurisdiction," Romulo said.<br><br>On Wednesday, leftist militants converged outside the prosecutors' offices in Olongapo, carrying banners and shouted slogans calling for the Americans to leave the Philippines.<br><br>- AFP/ir<br></div>

Yes, they attend instituitions from Primary all the way to tertiary, but they are not abit educated (which explains their uncultured-ness).<br><br>Then again, these acts of uncultured-ness are not only spotted in Singapore. It happens everywhere else, just a matter of varying degrees and I agree that in China, things can get a lot WORSE (esp. when it comes to using the public toilets ... yucks).<br><br>Hence to some extent, we should consider ourselves lucky in some sense.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>
