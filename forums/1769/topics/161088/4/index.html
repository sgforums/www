After all, Bill Clinton and his travelling company made Jamie Oliver change the menu upon their arrival at the restaurant (when they had agreed on another weeks ago and the restaurant had already prepared it). And then we have criminals but it's easier for us to think they're a tiny minority among all peoples (unless that country has a notriety for criminal activity, like Colombia).<br><br>But isn't there something very wrong when your seniors tell you, when you're a visitor, NEVER to admit that you're Singaporean (unless you know how to conduct yourself)? That's because there's a significant number of us who make a right embarrassment of themselves on the international scene.</div>

After all, Bill Clinton and his travelling company made Jamie Oliver change the menu upon their arrival at the restaurant (when they had agreed on another weeks ago and the restaurant had already prepared it). And then we have criminals but it's easier for us to think they're a tiny minority among all peoples (unless that country has a notriety for criminal activity, like Colombia).<br><br>But isn't there something very wrong when your seniors tell you, when you're a visitor, NEVER to admit that you're Singaporean (unless you know how to conduct yourself)? That's because there's a significant number of us who make a right embarrassment of themselves on the international scene.</div></blockquote>I am proud of Singapore history and I am proud of my parents and grandparents who have help to build this country. I am proud that my city is so damn clean and organized. I am proud that singapore road condition is so good that I feel like buying a 19" rims for my car. I am proud that if I have money in Singapore I can use it to the fullest without the fear of being kidnap. I am proud because so many foreigners are trying to be a PR and citizen on this country. I am proud that singapore have to much things in such a small country. I am proud that the culture in this country is so diversify and yet there are no racial problem. I am proud because Singaporeans are welcome in so many countries in the world and we dont even need VISA to travel to 90% of the countries in this world. I am proud that Singapore has the best airport and the airline in the world. I am proud that Singapore is country with one of the highest per capital income. I am proud that Singapore are so generous with comes to making donation...and the list will go on...<br><br>Why are you asking such a dumb questions? You not a Singaporean?<br><br></div>
