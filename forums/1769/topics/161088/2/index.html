They work alongside us, providing basic care to the patients, and they are very invaluable to us.  They are inevitably more mature, and since they had job experiences elsewhere already, most of them came in because they are compassionate towards those who are ill and disabled.<br><br>Amongst those I've met are folks who used to work in hotels, including one who was some customer service supervisor or asst manager calibre, others who were clerks, sales personnel, etc.</div>

They have specialized training and are prepared to take up the heavy responsibility of diagnosis and treatment of patients. Patients with chronic illnesses are referred to them after their conditions have been stabilized by the consultants and I think this system does work well. They are allowed to prescribe medication as well but if the patient's condition changes, they would refer them back to the doctors.<br><br>I have mooted this idea in Singapore before but the senior nurses did not like the idea. They did not want to accept the medico-legal liability that comes with the heavier responsibility. But you cannot have one without the other. Nurse practitioners are better paid and certainly highly respected by both patients and consultants, but like doctors, they can be sued if they were negligent.<br><br>Ordinary nurses in the UK administer intravenous drugs whilst I have heard that  nurses in Singapore do not want to handle that. There is a risk that if nurses decline more responsibilities whilst healthcare assistants take on more of their duties, the time will come when the scope of nursing in Singapore becomes extremely limited.<br><br>You come across as someone who entered the profession with altruistic reasons. Would you and others like you be interested in going beyond administrative duties and cleaning wounds? Healthcare assistants can be trained to dispense medication, change dressings, record TPR readings, accompany patients for tests and be certified in basic trauma and cardiac life support. Surely nurses must aspire to do more?<br><br></div>
