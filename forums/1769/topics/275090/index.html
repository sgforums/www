            <div class='col-md body'>yesterday, i went to the supermarket to pick up some office supplies (snacks) as well as some shaving balm... so i went to Giant at IMM.. being a sunday it was crowded as heck.. but i observed a few things..<br><br>- some asswipe went to the 10 items or less express counter, decided his basket had too many things, and abandoned all his frozen food at the side of the lane.. that included ice cream, frozen chicken parts and frozen vegetables<br><br>- having 2 brats and your wife with you does not allow you over 30 items in your blasted shopping cart and going to the express lane<br><br>- lining up with no items and then getting the rest of your family to keep running up and adding more and more things for the cashier while making others wait is just not on<br><br>- brats who run up and down the aisles screaming in a very crowded supermarket should be gagged, tied up and locked up in a room<br><br>- sampling about 5 mangosteens while feeding your loin-dropping bits of it while buying about 10 mangosteens is just downright unreasonable<br><br>- ripping apart the packaging of various toiletries to smell them is just rude<br><br>then i went to Best to see if i could get cheapo 5.1 speakers for my DVD player.. a few more things i noticed..<br><br>- store clerks were congregating together (about 6 of them) and chatting while there were people who looked lost with a product<br><br>- allowing your brat to bash (literally) at the demo X-Box 360 while looking on indulgently is irresponsible as heck<br><br>- like in a supermarket, you do not open up sealed boxes of accessories to 'examine' them if you have not bought it<br><br>- the store should teach the store clerks about the product instead of saying "i don't know" or worse, just stare at you blankly when you need help...<br><br>generally at the mall, people seemed to be in a rush and some were downright obnoxious..<br><br>- a couple with a trolley were waiting for the lift by themselves, and i joined them.. a huge group (i think an extended family) came, and when the lift came, they just barged in and filled the lift, without waiting for those inside to come out and they just cut in front of the couple and me who were waiting way before them...<br><br>- loud conversations over the mobile phone is bad enough without using hokkien profanities with every other word.. and he wasn't even arguing.. he was laughing while cussing...<br><br>- the use benches or seats to put food litter like bones or crumbs is a sign of bad upbringing<br><br>sometimes, i wonder what happened to basic courtesy?<br><br>there.. my rant of the day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no public courtesy...it's a sad reflection of society. And this is just the supermarket.<br><br>Another example of ugly behaviour by kiasu folks:<br>- opening up boxes of soft fruits (eg kiwis, plums) that had been packed in transparent boxes, then pick and choose individual fruit for his/her own box, and leaving the rest of the boxes opened afterwards.<br><br>- leaving frozen food to defrost in the other sections e.g. toiletries section<br><br>- this is a favourite of the lao auntie / lao uncle mindset (young or old) - poking their fingers into every fruit, food item or commodity without buying.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I think our living in clinically clean Singapore in little boxes we call homes made us very protective of our personal spaces. All these unfavourable physical contact with strangers, and worse, aural invasion (we can't CONTROL what we hear can we?) of our personal space can be very disturbing and frustrating to us. Many Singaporeans can't even stand strangers even looking at them.<br><br>When I go to crowded place, I don't even need unpleasant situations to give me a headache. Just the presence of the crowd breaks me down slowly.<br><br>And yet, In many bazaars around the world, this squeezing, pushing, shoving, shouting and bargaining is very typical. I think in places where people live much closer together, and who are able to establish a deeper bond between neighbours, tolerate this type of 'invasion' better.<br></div>

They are just.... small people thinking they can take advantage of a big corporation. A lot of people actually think this way. They don't think their behaviour has any problem socially because it doesn't hurt other people, just some nameless big company who has so much money what's a few mangosteens!?<br><br>Same goes for the people who 'check' their packages. Most are unfamiliar with the products. I would also guess that they would come from lower income family with a fear of buying a 'wrong' item.<br><br>This really happens becos Auntie A and Uncle B did not have the benefit of being exposed to the ethics of big supermarket shopping. The change in 'shopping experience' in just 20 years can be difficult for them.<br><br>I'm not defending offensive behaviour. I just feel that for many older aunties and uncles, reality had changed so much in their life spans that many simply can't catch up. This causes the disparity on accepted social behaviour, that's all.<br><br></div>
