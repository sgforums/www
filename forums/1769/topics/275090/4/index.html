So many ride on the wrong side, others simply stop suddenly in the middle, other ride so fast and lose control and may just are plain stupid and down right dumb.

            <div class='col-md body'>I still rem this one time, i was in a supermarket trying to bag some fruit and suddenly i heard excuse me, excuse me! Well it is crowded, so i am not sure if I am blocking the way, but I intend to finish bagging it before moving to a corner. But guess what, some auntie from behind just shovel her way through, knocking me over. When I turn back to look, she actually cursed and swear at me for not giving way!! Does shouting "excuse me" twice mean u get to own the F#$king market?<br><br>Think s'pore is bad? even tried HK? A few month ago while touring Hong Kong, I was again shovel aside from behind while walking on the street. Turn out I wasn't walking fast enough. I am 1.83m walking normal pace. Best thing that follow is, that fellow actually curse me for walking too slow and blocking her way!! Wtf, that auntie knocking into me from "behind" and even dare to swear at me? Dun she know that eye dun grow at the back of head?<br><br>I told all these to fren from m'sia and they said they have worse. This fren told me that there was this one time while she was walking by the road side in M'sia, a motorcycle drive by and it pillion try to snatch her hand bag. Coz she hear the approaching engine sound, she kinda side step a bit, hence the pillion miss the bag. Then the motorcycle actually slowed down and the pillion turn around and show her the middle finger, curse and swear before speeding off again.<br><br>So i guess u dun have to be in the wrong in order to be the one cursing and swearing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reading about such obnoxious behaviour and experiencing it myself makes my blood boil.

            <div class='col-md body'>My 5 cents worth:<br><br>if we do see something that affects us so much, that we feel is such bad behaviour - then tell it directly to the people involved in the best possible way we can. Afterall, its no point pointing fingers at the same society we are all a part of, and feeling ashamed by compatriots behaviour when many of us are made complicit by our silence.<br><br>We all rant and that's good because it gives us an outlet to release our frustration but the righteous indignation is only constructive if we work to improve the graciousness of our society as a WHOLE. Can we be both gracious and assertive in our beliefs to what makes this place a better place?<br><br>And for anyone who thinks it is 'none of my business' how other people behave, then well, they have no right to complain becos it isn't THEIR business is it? Its this whole 'none of my business' and 'don't be kaypo' attitude that makes unacceptable behaviour prevalent.<br><br>Speak up!! If you see something inappropriate, TELL the person directly how you feel. You don't have to be rude to be honest. In fact, i don't believe that bad behaviour from someone else is an excuse for rudeness. We all lose control when we are angry at times (i have lots of times man!!!), but just pointing out that someone else's rudeness does not give us the right to be rude in return.<br><br>We all became who we are through opportunities to learn, through our family, friends, environments. Somehow, somewhere down the road - these people either were not given these opportunities or missed the lessons. Teach them dont just bitch about them.<br><br>Of course you can still bitch about them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> just don't start believing that its pointless to change them.<br><br>And if you are already speaking up, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> great! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Don't lose faith in humankind.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was a point in time however where I realised that I have to protect myself and keep my stress levels and blood pressure down. The other option would be closing an eye to such behaviour, but that would be the beginning of apathy. I don't want to lapse into that sort of attitude either.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShrodingersCat:</div><div class="quote_body">if we do see something that affects us so much, that we feel is such bad behaviour - then tell it directly to the people involved in the best possible way we can.
