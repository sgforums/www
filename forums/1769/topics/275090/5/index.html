The ah beng husband or the ah lian wife.. they smoke in the lift with or without their bunch of untaught children. The kids will play jumping on the floor throughout the day and into late nights and the adults would invite all their ah beng friends and pretty much like open gambling den and play majong.<br><br>When once I told the husband that its dangerous to smoke in lift.
