Here's more info from my bank:<br>Money Market Savings Account (MMSA)<br>With our MMSA, you earn more than with a share savings account, but the number of transactions per month is limited. The MMSA requires a minimum opening deposit of $2,500.<br><br>You can access your account with special MMSA checks, online access, ATMs or phone. You can make no more than six total withdrawals per calendar month, and only three can be by check.<br>Tiered rates are based on money market environment and may change weekly. Rate applies to the entire balance, not just the amount over the tier threshold.<br>Dividends are compounded and paid monthly.<br>There is no set term.<br><br>What is a Money Market Savings Account?<br>An account with higher earnings potential than a share savings account, but more limited access due to federal regulations.<br><br>What are the limits on how many withdrawals you can make per month?<br>You can write only three MMSA checks per month, or make six withdrawals using any combination of three or fewer checks, the Automated Clearing House (electronic debits), phone, fax, Internet or automatic transfers. There are no monthly limits on the number of transfers or withdrawals made in person at a branch, through an ATM or by mail. Note: checks are included in monthly totals based on the date they are paid, not on the date written.<br></div>
