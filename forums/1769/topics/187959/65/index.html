About time the PAP has credible opposition. So what do you think the rest of the country feel about LTK?<br><br>Re: Dragon Prince. Aiyah. This was so obvious from the start. That Lau Goh was the benchwarmer. If what you say is true, I think their transparency in giving him the boot is just disgusting and ungrateful. Sounds so shady.<br><br>I hadn't realised that Chiam See Tong is in his 70s. Time flies! I still remember the day he captured Potong Pasir.</div>
