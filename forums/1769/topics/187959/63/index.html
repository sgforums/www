Very handy to have around the house, yes? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Fortunately, it didn't snow here over the weekend, so Fatum is off the hook. We're finally getting into the 60s and 70s during the day; I hope it stays like that for the rest of the summer, as I cannot stand hot weather.<br><br>I participated in a shooting competition at our club on Saturday. Didn't do too well, and that event took up most of the day. On Sunday I changed the oil in my summer vehicle, and ran into a small problem while removing the oil filter. That task, which should have taken no more than a half hour, ballooned into a two-hour task and resulted in my ruining a perfectly good t-shirt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Then on Sunday night I was invited to have dinner at a good friend's house. His 85-year-old father had come from the east coast to visit him; he was a WW2 vet who had flown B24 bombers over Europe, and had us absolutely riveted with accounts of his experiences during that time.</div></blockquote>Yes, hubby is really handy and hardworking.  But honestly, when I see him work hard, my heart pain leh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   So, usually, when he comes back indoors, I'll fixed him a nice tall glass of that sng kum chui.  Product of M'sia.  Very nice.  Lime and honey.<br><br>Wow!  Shooting competition!!!  Maybe it was your first outing of the year?  But I think, most importantly is we enjoy doing the sport bah.  Like if I play badly in a game, I still remember to have fun.<br><br>Aiyoh eh ah, ruin your T ah?  How come didn't take it to the body shop?<br><br>Hooo........I would love to be in your company too.  I love to listen to personal account.  Their history is so priceless.
