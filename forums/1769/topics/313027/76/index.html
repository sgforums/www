              <p>still, isnt it an insult? and i mean does all work really requires your degree to be put to use? so many times people end up studying what they don't need. if he starts off with 1k+ but with guaranteed high increment its still ok but i doubt so anyway. its paying an ITE grad.</p>
              <p>just ask him to drive taxi, can at least earn 2k+ also.</p>
