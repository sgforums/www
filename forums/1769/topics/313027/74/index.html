              <p>Fatum, recently, I sat down to keep a poor lonely old patient company and he started telling me about his pets.  He said all his life, he's owned dogs and cats.  He's had them since he was a young boy.  And you know what, he said that the dogs and cats make good companions but the cats are definitely smarter. </p>
              <p>He remembers a few of his dogs being smart, some were loyal but blissfully dumb, but ALL the cats were intelligent. </p>

              <p>Forget it.  Most man will say yes, only to slowly find excuses to disappear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  He might do it initially, but the more masculine, ie. the more testosterone in him, the higher the tendency to wander off conveniently when he smells poop!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>So are cats. </p>
              <p>For someone who's never even owned a cat before, you're  making terribly biased statements.  Feral adult cats will be aggressive and sly and will scratch / bite to protect themselves.  However, cats reared by humans from when they were kittens can be very sweet and dog-like.</p>
              <p>Cody, Suzie, Kitty, Meiji, Marcus and Sophie were extremely loyal and grateful, especially Marcus and Cody.  They followed me around the house like they were dogs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>This thing about cats being arrogant, is untrue.  It's like saying dogs are stupid, which is untrue except for chihuahua's and small poodles.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              The mistress: Ah! me too, the other night I met my lover in the office and I was wearing the leather bodice, mega stilettos, mask over my eyes and a raincoat, when I opened the raincoat... he did not
              say anything.....but we had wild sex all night
              
               
              
              The married one: The other night I sent the kids to stay at my mothers for the night, I got myself ready: leather bodice, super stilettos and mask over my eyes....my husband comes back from work,
              opens the door and says: 'Hey Batman! What's for dinner?'

              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;">THOUSANDS of people across the country are skipping meals to pay rising rents, a housing affordability conference has been told.</strong></p>
              <p>And housing experts warn the home affordability crisis threatens to
                  destabilise the economy and drive the country into recession.</p>
              <p>Experts told a housing conference in Sydney yesterday that
                  Australia faced great social unrest and human suffering as well as
                  chronic labour shortages without affordable housing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23257090-952,00.html#submit-feedback"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Do you skip meals to meet rent or mortgage payments? Tell us about it</strong></span></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Professor Terry Burke of the <a href="http://www.ahuri.edu.au/">Australian Housing and Urban Research Unit</a> presented the research, which showed 26 per cent of low-income renters
                  sometimes go without food and 42 per cent of low-income renters cannot
                  afford school excursions, Fairfax reported.</p>
              <p>Professor Rachel Gatt, an affordable housing policy expert from
                  Tufts University, Massachusetts, said the housing affordability
                  equation was brutally simple.</p>
              <p>"Either wages have to stay high enough so people can afford to buy
                  housing on the private market or if the private market is not able to
                  meet the housing challenge then you need to have government subsidies,"
                  she told reporters.</p>
              <p>"If you don't have affordable housing, and if your wages don't keep
                  pace with the cost of housing, you are going to find people doubling up
                  with relatives, turning into homeless people and creating a great deal
                  of social unrest and human suffering than what you have now."</p>
              <p><strong>Stamp out duties</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23257083-3102,00.html">federal opposition has called on federal and state governments to cut land tax and stamp duty</a> to help boost rental stock.</p>
              <p>Opposition frontbencher Greg Hunt today said this week's national
                  housing conference was an ideal opportunity for federal Housing
                  Minister Tanya Plibersek to address land tax and stamp duty, to lessen
                  the burden and help increase the stock of homes available for rent.</p>
              <p>"These are killers for people and what they do is decrease the
                  rental stock," Mr Hunt, opposition spokesman for Climate Change,
                  Environment and Urban Water, told the Seven Network.</p>
              <p>"A lot of people have said we're not willing to pay the cost of
                  holding a rental property if we're whacked with a huge land tax or we
                  have to deal with stamp duty and today is the day, Tanya, stamp duty,
                  land tax and more land releases - you have a great opportunity."</p>
              <p><strong>First time help</strong></p>
              <p>Ms Plibersek said a lot of people had taken money out of investment
                  property and put it into superannuation when favourable tax treatment
                  was introduced last year under the previous government.</p>
              <p>She said the Rudd government had committed to introducing the first home saver account to help people into their first house.</p>
              <p>"We know that as a proportion of all home buyers, first home buyers
                  have shrunk as a proportion, so we want to help them save through a
                  superannuation-style savings account," Ms Plibersek told the Seven
                  Network.</p>
              <p>"We've also got a national rental affordability scheme, 50,000 new
                  rental properties, because there is a terrible shortage all around the
                  country."</p>
              <p>Labor says the Howard government failed to acknowledge the rental
                  crisis, despite knowing more than two years ago that more than one
                  third of renters were suffering from rental stress</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite this, inflation rates are set to rise yet AGAIN, for the 5th or 6th time in two years!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png">  Mortgage rates will increase as a result, which means, less disposable income for all.</p>
