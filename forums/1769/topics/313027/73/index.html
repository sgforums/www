              <p>Actually, now that I'm grown up, sometimes, out of the blue, I'd tell either mom or grandma, "Did you remember that incident when I (insert account of incident) and you (insert punishement meted out)?" and often, they look shocked that : 1) I can remember what happened when I was THAT young; 2) they actually punished me the way they did; and 3) they might have traumatised me THAT much as to let me recall the incidents crystal clear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>My brother, on the other hand, doesn't recall a thing.  I think he deals with it by forgetting. </p>

              <p>I was quite the nazi-big sister back then.  Now my siblings, sister especially, tell me how traumatized she was when under my care.  She can recall me dishing out punishment and being a stern teacher etc and says that I've scarred her for life :P </p>
              <p>Sounds almost like borderline abuse although I maintain till now it's just tough love LOL  I can't recall all of the incidents she mention &amp; am genuinely surprised that she remembers them to such detail.  I go "Oh did I do that?? "   Which proves that sometimes, adults don't realise the kind of effect they have over children (overly-sensitive or not is another matter).</p>

              <p>Imagine, after you have a baby, 24/7, it will be all about the baby. </p>
              <p>When baby becomes a tot, you can't let the kiddo out of your sight.  Just one minute out of sight, and the whole house can get burnt down! </p>
              <p>And then when they attend Primary School, after you return home from work, you can't watch TV and relax after dinner, because you have to help them with their schoolwork and make sure they get good grades. </p>
              <p>And all the time you have to work hard and save hard because University fees aren't going to get cheaper. </p>
              <p>When they start dating and hanging out late with their buddies, you pray that they are out with 'good' kids and not getting drunk, getting knocked up, and worse, getting into drugs!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  You also hope that if they won't liquidate the family wealth if they have a Supp card.  If they drive, you hope they will never get into any accident.</p>
              <p>When they graduate, you have to help them out as they start out and  hope they will be successful in their career.  Time and again, you will need to bail them out financially.  When they get married, you will DEFINITELY need to pay through your nose to contribute to their wedding celebrations because as the years go by, it will definitely get costlier and costlier.  You might also need to use a good portion of your CPF money to help them get their new house and give them a  headstart.  If you like your son/daughter-in-law, fine.  Otherwise...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>And all that, because of the biological urge to start a family.</p>
              <p>Methinks, me prefers a simpler, quieter, less complicated life!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"></p>

              <p>When mom and I had one of our heart-to-heart talks a few years ago, she told me that I was a very happy and darling toddler that was very popular with the neighbours and relatives, until my younger bro popped out.  After that, I became an absolute terror, either endlessly seeking attention, or withdrawing into some corner away from everyone who's inevitably doting on the new baby.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> </p>
              <p>I was a Mr Jekyll and Dr Hyde when it came to my bro.  I had my Nazi-Sister from Hell moments where pure jealousy turned into rage and yeah... borderline abuse.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png">  There were also moments where I loved my bro to death and wanted to protect him and watch over him. </p>
              <p>Yeah, my mom didn't realise the impact of her actions on me.  She was stunned beyond words.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I remember very vividly one night, sitting at the kitchen table slaving over my Primary 2 English workbook, asking my mom, "Mom, how do you spell 'Giraffe'?"</p>
              <p>Mom, after a hard day at work, muttered, "G-i-r-a-f-f-e!" impatiently and too quickly.  I asked her again, she got more impatient.  I held my pencil, stared at the red rubber tip, still didn't catch, gulped and decided to ask her a 3rd time... SLAP!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>I still remember how that stung!  The heat rushed to my cheek, and the hot tears gushed out but I just quietly sobbed, pencil still being held upright.  She told me I was 'so stupid, 'Giraffe' also don't know how to spell', 'jiak liao bi', etc etc. </p>
              <p>Primary 2... just eight years old, but till today, I remember. </p>
              <p>I asked her, "Did you remember hitting me over the word, 'Giraffe'?" and she went, "HUH?!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>To her, it was just an outburst because she was tired that night so her temper was short.  To me, it was nothing short of traumatic.</p>
