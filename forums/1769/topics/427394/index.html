              <p>Wow.... I'm speechless. From PRC to our neighbour</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="bd">
              <p>George Town (The Star/ANN) - Malaysian enforcement officers have carted away 378 eggs from three stalls at the <span id="lw_1302234138_0" class="yshortcuts">Pulau Tikus</span> market following claims that fakes were being sold there.</p>
              <p>Seven officers from the <span id="lw_1302234138_6" class="yshortcuts">Penang</span> Domestic Affairs, Co-operatives and Consumerism Department seized three trays comprising 90 eggs from each of the stalls.</p>
              <p>A four-member team from the <span id="lw_1302234138_4" class="yshortcuts">State Health Department</span> has also collected more samples.</p>
              <p>The seizures came in the wake of Thursday's news report that fake eggs, allegedly filled with chemicals, were found in the state of Penang.</p>
              <p>Consumers Association of Penang (CAP) president S.M. Mohamed Idris said a housewife complained that she bought a tray of 30 eggs for 11 ringgit at the market but found they did not smell like real eggs and were tasteless.</p>
              <p>A Domestic Trade Department spokesman said the samples would be sent to the Chemistry Department or the <span id="lw_1302234138_7" class="yshortcuts">Veterinary Services Department</span> for analysis.</p>
              <p>He said the case, a first of its kind, would be investigated under Section 3 (1)(b) of the Trade Description Act 1972.</p>
              <p>A Health Department spokesman said they received instructions to investigate following numerous complaints and news reports.</p>
              <p>Egg seller Lim Beng Poh, in her 60s, said eggs at her stall were from her brother Lim Chong Teng's poultry farm in Titi Serong, <span id="lw_1302234138_8" class="yshortcuts">Balik Pulau</span>.</p>
              <p>"We are sure the fake eggs are not from our stall," she said.</p>
              <p>At the farm, Chong Teng's wife Tham Siew Kean, 50, said they reared 7,000 <span id="lw_1302234138_9" class="yshortcuts">chickens</span> which produced about 5,000 eggs a day.</p>
              <p>Another egg seller Tan Shuan Soon, 56, dismissed the reports of fake eggs, claiming that an egg's texture would change between seven and 10 days.</p>
              <p>The Star reporter tasted a <span id="lw_1302234138_1" class="yshortcuts">boiled egg</span> at the CAP's office and found that it was "not awful but tasteless".</p>
              <p>"Unlike the real ones that have the smell of an egg being boiled, the fake ones were odourless," she said.</p>
              <p>Mohd Idris tried to separate the <span id="lw_1302234138_3" class="yshortcuts">yolk</span> from the <span id="lw_1302234138_2" class="yshortcuts">egg white</span> but the yolk broke into smaller pieces.</p>
              <p>"In a real egg, the yolk can easily be removed whole," she said.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">DNA result on 'fake' eggs will be known on Monday</h1>
              <p>KUANTAN - THE result of DNA tests on the eggs seized from Penang's 
              Pulau Tikus market will be known on Monday, Health Minister Datuk Seri 
              Liow Tiong Lai said.</p>
              <p>'This will determine whether they are real or fake once and for all,' said Datuk Liow.</p>
              <p>He said preliminary analysis had found the protein content, yolk and 
              shell's calcium of the seized eggs to be no different from ordinary 
              eggs.</p>
              <p>'We have to be sure, so the Chemistry Department is now doing DNA tests on the eggs,' Datuk Liow added.</p>
              <p>The eggs were seized following complaints by a housewife and
               the Consumers Association of Penang (CAP) that fake eggs were being 
              sold at the market.</p>
              <p>Datuk Liow urged the public not to panic, saying that Malaysia did not import eggs but rather, exported them. -- THE STAR/ANN</p>

              <p>on one hand, you have to take your hat off at the brillant mind that hatched the fake egg idea ...... I mean, who'd have thought of it ?</p>
