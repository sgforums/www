              <p><br>I once told myself that if I didn't like someone I'm working with, and the person too, shows no partcular liking also, then I'll maintain the relationship as a purely working one.</p>
              <p>I couldn't have been more wrong.</p>
              <p>You should try harder in your overtures towards those who you feel harbour resentment towards you. It helps a lot! Not only because you might be able to win him over, but because, also in the practical sense, you might win support from other colleagues who might be watching. They're most probably aware of any frictions and might sympathise with you in that way.</p>

              You don't need to be pally with everyone. You probably just need 1-2 very good friends. And in time, once you get to know everyone, you'll figure out who this 1-2 people.
              
              Look at it this way, you're new, not used to how things are, your colleagues are also having to adjust having someone new in the office. They're probably a bit apprehensive. So both sides are still trying to find the comfortable zone.

              <p>I must say that I was pretty lucky in my 1st job. I came away from that place, with colleagues becoming real friends..</p>
              <p>but then my current job is totally different. I initiated lunch with different groups of people at 1st because when i started, i was a one-man show in my dept .. so i felt quite alone too.. anyway .. after these years in my current job i still feel lonely, coz these colleagues definitely can't progress into real friends.. but its alright la..  </p>
