            <div class='col-md body'>okie.. here's my report after watching the show.<br><br>in the past month there has been 3 mysterious death after running. 1 was a BMT Instructor, 19 years old. Died after a 5km run. 1 was an army regular, 30+, died during a run in Jurong camp. the last one was a PE teacher in a Primary sch, 27, just married. Died after going for a jog with his wife.<br><br>All 3 were fit and had not suffering from any illness the time of death. Except for the last one, who had a history of diabetes, but was said to have recovered enough. All the runs were not considered to be strenuous. So that rules out that it was complication over flu or if it was a heat stroke.<br><br>According to the doctor, the 2nd one was caused by myocardiac infarction. (rhonda, any idea?) The 1st one was caused by cardiorespiratory arrest.. which basically is a catch-all phrase that means the doc does not know what the heck is wrong.<br><br>In 2003-2005, there has been an increase to about 600+ cases of cardiac arrest among young ppl below 45.<br><br><strong>Possible Cause</strong><br>According to the doc interviewed, what he suspects was that a heart fipulation (sp?) occured, i.e. one of the valves were blocked, which causes the heart to vibrate erratically, and stopped. Within 10min, the heart has to be electrically shocked to revive, otherwise, the survival rate is less than 20%.<br><br><strong>Precautions</strong><br>Even though such incidents may sound scary, but the doc do recommend people to exercise regularly. Exercising reduces the risk of a clog artery that will lead to heart attack. But to prevent such things from happening, there are some precautions you can take.<br><br>- Increase your exercise routine in gradually. When you do too much in a short period of time, it puts on too much stress to the heart and it is not used to that kind of load.<br>- He suggested that a small part of these cases (about 20%) is genetic. So, if there are any history of cardiac problem that runs in your family, be careful when you run.<br>- Also, if you're a smoker, have diabetes, or high blood pressure, stop when you feel any discomfort, and consult a doctor immediately.<br>- One thing i would like to add is.. remember to warm down after a strenuous exercise! Don't drink cold water immediately, or bend over or lie down after a run. It causes your body to cool down too fast and your heart rate to decrease too rapidly!<br><br>okie, end of report.

Died after a 5km run. 1 was an army regular, 30+, died during a run in Jurong camp. the last one was a PE teacher in a Primary sch, 27, just married. Died after going for a jog with his wife.<br><br>All 3 were fit and had not suffering from any illness the time of death. Except for the last one, who had a history of diabetes, but was said to have recovered enough. All the runs were not considered to be strenuous. So that rules out that it was complication over flu or if it was a heat stroke.<br><br>According to the doctor, the 2nd one was caused by myocardiac infarction. (rhonda, any idea?) The 1st one was caused by cardiorespiratory arrest.. which basically is a catch-all phrase that means the doc does not know what the heck is wrong.<br><br><span style="color: #1874CD;">A 'Myocardiac Infarction' is what's known commonly as a 'heart attack'.  For one of various reasons, the heart muscles stopped getting oxygenated blood and the muscles stopped functioning and thus, the heart stopped beating.  Sometimes, there are existing blockages in our arteries that we aren't aware of and exercise could have dislodged them or bits of them and they could have travelled up the bloodstream where they became lodged in a narrower artery and caused obstruction.  If it's a bad obstruction, the bloodflow to the heart muscles stop and it triggers an MI.</span><br><br>In 2003-2005, there has been an increase to about 600+ cases of cardiac arrest among young ppl below 45.<br><br>[b]Possible Cause</strong><br>According to the doc interviewed, what he suspects was that a heart fipulation (sp?) occured, i.e. one of the valves were blocked, which causes the heart to vibrate erratically, and stopped. Within 10min, the heart has to be electrically shocked to revive, otherwise, the survival rate is less than 20%.<br><br><span style="color: #1874CD;">It's a 'Heart Fibrillation'.  Imagine you trying to start your engine whilst it makes that choking noise... that's kinda an equivalent to a 'heart fibrillation'.  Over in the US, malls and oher public buildings and places have begun to acquire portable defibrillators which can be accessed quickly in times of emergency to save lives.  In fact, they are incorporating the use of the portable defibrillators in a few of their basic First Aid courses too.  We should start doing that here too, and hopefully, soon.  BTW, a defibrillator is that machine with the two paddles you place on the patient's chest and the doc goes 'Stand Clear!' before he presses the button and the fella suddenly jolts up as an electric current passes through his chest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </span><br><br><strong>Precautions</strong><br>Even though such incidents may sound scary, but the doc do recommend people to exercise regularly. Exercising reduces the risk of a clog artery that will lead to heart attack. But to prevent such things from happening, there are some precautions you can take.<br><br>- Increase your exercise routine in gradually. When you do too much in a short period of time, it puts on too much stress to the heart and it is not used to that kind of load.<br>- He suggested that a small part of these cases (about 20%) is genetic. So, if there are any history of cardiac problem that runs in your family, be careful when you run.<br>- Also, if you're a smoker, have diabetes, or high blood pressure, stop when you feel any discomfort, and consult a doctor immediately.<br>- One thing i would like to add is.. remember to warm down after a strenuous exercise! Don't drink cold water immediately, or bend over or lie down after a run. It causes your body to cool down too fast and your heart rate to decrease too rapidly!<br><br>okie, end of report.
