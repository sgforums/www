            <div class='col-md body'>I've felt a very strong undercurrent of racism in Singapore in recent years. Maybe I was too ignorant to feel that before, and wasn't at the forefront. There is very strong racial pride in Singapore when it comes to being prejudiced in Singapore, even to the extent of saying another particular race is inferior. I think everyone has prejudices, but the limit's really up to the point where you actually believe that your race and genes are superior to another. I'm sick of staying in Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can we hope to eliminate racism?  Maybe.  Are we going to get rid of general prejudice and discrimination?  I doubt it - the tendency to discriminate is something that is at the core of human existence.<br><br>One explanation of this tendency is that humans base their identity on the groups that they belong to, be it race, social class, occupation or some other facet of their existence.  The long and short of it is that they need to maintain their self-esteem, and therefore attempt to develop the best possible image of the groups that they belong to.  If they can't make their group look good, they make other groups look bad and tell themselves, "Thank God I'm not one of them".  Since the 1950's, when Henri Tajfel first put his theory forward, this tendency has been substantiated in a fairly large volume of research.<br><br>So what's the bottom line?  Those who are prejudiced have little, in anything, good to see about themselves, so they need to reinforce their fragile egos with stereotypes and prejudices.  Losers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We can hope that racism will be eventually be eliminated from the hearts of men..... but unfortunately, that can never happen.<br><br>I've encountered far too many cases of racism in my life to accept that Singapore is a racist-free country.<br><br>Back in school, some of my Malay friends would mock me for mixing around with the Chinese - my classmates. They wonder with whom my loyalties lie with.<br><br>I was shattered when I was blocked from joining the Navy. My sergeant explained that "I'm supposed to tell you that there are no Muslim cookhouses in naval bases.... but I guess you know the real reason."<br><br>I still get odd stares when I date my female Chinese friends.<br><br>I got mocked by the Malays- my own race- when I tell them that I liked a Chinese girl. 'WHAT!?!? Your own race is not good enough for you is it?!?!'<br><br>I got mocked some Chinese guys when I told them the same thing. 'Wah lau! You're limiting opportunities for us, you know! Can't you just stick to your own race?'<br><br>NOTE: I said the previous statement to some of the forummites I met at the sgforums.com BBQ last year, and that was the response I got.<br><br>Perhaps one day they will learn. It may never happen, but we can still hope.</div>
