            <div class='col-md body'>AFP<br>Police detain Aussie "bear" as Queen starts Singapore visit<br><br>Fri Mar 17, 5:47 AM ET<br><br>SINGAPORE (AFP) - Singapore police detained an Australian animal-rights activist dressed in a bear suit as Queen Elizabeth II began a sentimental state visit to this former British colony.<br><br>Jodi Ruckley, a 33-year-old Sydney activist from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), was questioned after she wore the bear suit and displayed a placard saying "God save the bears" near the Istana palace.<br><br>The protest had no effect on the schedule of the queen, who reviewed a guard of honour at the Istana and met Singapore President S.R. Nathan.<br><br>Queen Elizabeth is on her first visit since 1989 to Singapore, where lasting reminders of Britain's imperial glory remain although much has changed in bilateral relations since Singapore's independence in 1965.<br><br>The protester, Ruckley, said after being released that her brief detention had prevented her from making the queen aware of PETA's opposition to the use of Canadian black bear pelts for the Queen's Guards' ceremonial bearskin hats.<br><br>Ruckley said police had released her with a warning but, in a call to AFP, she threatened renewed protests during the queen's two-day visit, saying she was prepared to risk further police action on behalf of the bears.<br><br>"To tell you the truth it is risky but... that's nothing compared to what they're going through," she said.<br><br>Protests are banned in tightly-governed Singapore unless organisers obtain a police permit in advance.<br><br>The brief demonstration occurred just hours before the queen's husband Prince Philip attended the formal opening of environmental group WWF International's office in Singapore.<br><br>He is the president emeritus of the organisation, which also works for the protection of endangered species.<br><br>"We are not giving up till they change to synthetic fur," PETA spokesman Jason Baker told reporters of the bear-inspired protests.<br><br>Earlier protests staged here by PETA have been against fastfood chain KFC and the treatment of sheep in Australia.<br><br>A police spokesman said the PETA demonstrator was released after being taken away in a police van.<br><br>"Officers interviewed the person and checked on her to find out the purpose of her being there. Thereafter, she was advised to leave as it was inappropriate for her to be there," the spokesman said.<br><br>Later Friday the queen toured one of the public housing blocks, where most Singaporeans live. A child presented her with a shawl and the queen had a reunion with a Singaporean family she first met in 1972, and she served a rattan ball during a traditional Malay game known as sepak takraw.<br><br>After a state banquet Friday night, the queen's visit is to conclude Saturday with her awarding the winner's cup at the Queen Elizabeth II horse race at the Singapore Turf Club.<br><br>It is her third visit to the former British colony where, according to a veteran Singaporean diplomat, she enjoys "universal" respect and admiration.<br><br>"The queen is no stranger to Singapore and Singaporeans are familiar with the very high standards she has steadfastly and regally maintained in office despite the changing times and the difficulties in her own personal life," the diplomat told AFP.<br><br>"Especially for the older Singaporeans, who have grown with the queen, her majesty is one lovely person. She is also seen as the person who single-handedly, with her unquestionable integrity and enormous diplomatic skills, has kept the monarchy alive and respected," he added.<br><br>The United States and China have long eclipsed Britain in importance to Singapore, and Singapore's political and judicial systems have evolved away from the British standard. But the two countries still enjoy strong diplomatic, economic, military and cultural ties.<br>--<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
