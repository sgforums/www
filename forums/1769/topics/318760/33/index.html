              <p>Okay..... some weird things are happening.....</p>
              <p>My ICT is next month.</p>
              <p>Some medics received a call-up to go for the medic's refresher course earlier this month.</p>
              <p>Some other medics (myself included) did not receive the call-up. Instead, we received a letter ordering us to go for the course during the first two days of the ICT next month.</p>
              <p>I bumped into yet another medic just now.... he didn't receive either notice. Instead, he got a call from MINDEF, accusing him of AWOL from the earlier call-up (which he didn't receive at all).</p>
              <p>Obviously, he's raising a major stink over this.</p>

              <p>I can still remember some major screw-up for my first ICT....</p>
              <p>The medic refresher course was held during my exams, whereas the ICT was held over the holidays. So I applied for deferment for the refresher course, and not for the ICT. I received the deferment approval for the refresher course a few days later.</p>
              <p>But then, a few days after that, I received yet another letter stating that I had been granted deferment from the ICT as well.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
              <p>I called up the NS hotline, and I ordered the poor fella at the other end of the line to investigate. I wanted to go for ICT simply because I want to clear the 10-year cycle ASAP.</p>
              <p>In the end, it turns out that the second letter was sent by mistake, and that I would have to turn up for ICT after all.</p>
              <p>I barked at the fella: 'The letter was signed by a MAJ!!!! Damnit, how screwed up are you guys if a MAJ can endorse such a screwed-up letter?!?!?!'</p>

              <p>some children i know got infected with HFMD at a public pool..</p>
              <p>i think contact tracing showed that the parents of the "infecting" children knew that their child had HFMD... but brought them to the swimming pool anyway...</p>
              <p>i wonder.. i see a lot of parents bringing their children in prams with that fever patch attached to their children's foreheads... sometimes i want to go up to them and rant at them to leave their child at home to rest and look after the child instead of dragging the sick child all over the place with them</p>
