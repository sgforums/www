              <p>I was never sent to the principal's office before but I did get called there during Sec 4 over this issue which blew out of proportion (super drama)</p>
              <p>See, my Principal wanted everyone in the Arts stream to drop Geography by force (I believe so as to raise the grading average) for the 'O's but I don't want to do that, and many people don't wanna do that either because Geography is a freaking easy subject to score and she is just scraping it because of some farktards.</p>
              <p>Anyway, me with the itchy backside started a mass appeal thingy getting signatures (students &amp; their parents) to appeal against this tyrannical decision.</p>
              <p>Of course, that B***H threw out the appeal and called for my mum. Anyway so my mum came and the group of  us were outside her office. Mum went in first and when she came out I asked "How was it?" My mum told me she didn't even have a chance to speak because my principal just went on and on and wanted to see me.</p>
              <p>Ok, so I went in alone and she was trying to sell me this pile of crap which seriously are just lame excuses on why all of us have to drop Geography. I tried to speak and present my case but the stupid B***H kept interrupting and cutting me off.</p>
              <p>Being young, stupid, impulsive and super bad tempered (hey I was a teenager). I banged the table, look her in the eye and screamed something like, "I don't understand how you can even believe the fucking crap coming out of your mouth and for fuck's sake you are so bloody rude interruping and cutting off someone when they are talking. I can't believe how come a stupid bitch like you is a principal'!!!!! (Open door, slams the door and storms out of the office)</p>
              <p>(BTW I did use the F word on that stupid cow)</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think the matter blew out so huge she didn't take any action against me :P All the teachers in the office were watching :P</p>
              <p>My mum's friend who was a teacher adv her to write to the MOE and we did and she had to scrap the stupid drop Geography for O's thingy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Funny thing was about a year after I graduated, I bumped into my Geography teacher on the bus and she said she was secretly glad that time I did what I did :P</p>
              <p>On hindsight, it was incredibly stupid of me coz I could have gotten a black mark. I don't think I have the guts to do the same thing now if I was put in the same situation but for some reason back then, it was something I felt very strongly against and yes I was young, stupid and impulsive :P</p>

              <p>strangely the best principals i had was in my two primary schools</p>
              <p>when i was studying in a primary school in malaysia, my headmaster (Cikgu Besar) was also the stationer and the moral ed teacher</p>
              <p>like, morning, he will come teach us moral ed, check our fingernails, then recess time open a store full of stationery and sell us basic stuff like pencils, erasers, exercise books, usually we get free second hand textbooks passed down from seniors, but for some of us who can afford it, he will help us get new textbooks from the next town, i think he oversee the library, cant remember much</p>
              <p>my primary school principal in singapore was a one hell of a cool guy, he is more like a father figure, giving second chance to those poor in studies, go to classes and tell us his life story..like if there was no rice back at home last time, they survive only on soy sauce, seriously</p>
              <p>when i moved in to the school, it was just newly merged with another school, both from the villages in Choa Chu Kang..his inspiration for the school logo? once he came down from the HDB staircase and saw one boy drawing a superman logo..voila....</p>
              <p>ok, nuthing to say abt my secondary sch principal, elitist, enough said</p>
              <p>also nuthing to say about my JC principal, whose speech every morning make us cringe in pain!!!</p>
