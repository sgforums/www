            <div class='col-md body'>If you are 30 or older you will think this is hilarious!!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When I was a kid, adults used to bore me to tears with their<br>&gt; tedious diatribes about how hard things were when they were<br>&gt; growing up; what with walking twenty-five miles to school<br>&gt; every morning .... up hill BOTH ways .. yadda, yadda, yadda<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And I remember promising myself that when I grew up, there was<br>&gt; no way in hell I was going to lay a bunch of crap like that on<br>&gt; kids about how hard I had it and how easy they've got it!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But now that...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I'm over the ripe old age of thirty, I can't help but look<br>&gt; around and notice the youth of today. You've got it so easy!<br>&gt; I mean, compared to my childhood, you live in a damn Utopia!<br>&gt; And I hate to say it but you kids today you don't know how<br>&gt; good you've got it!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I mean, when I was a kid we didn't have The Internet. If we<br>&gt; wanted to know something, we had to go to the damn library and<br>&gt; look it up ourselves, in the card catalog!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There was no email! ! We had to actually write somebody a<br>&gt; letter ... with a pen! Then you had to walk all the way across<br>&gt; the street and put it in the mailbox and it would take like a<br>&gt; week to get there!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There were no MP3's or Napsters! You wanted to steal music, you<br>&gt; had to hitchhike to the damn record store and shoplift it yourself!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Or you had to wait around all day to tape it off the radio and<br>&gt; the DJ'd usually talk over the beginning and @#*% it all up!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We didn't have fancy crap like Call Waiting! If you were on the<br>&gt; phone and somebody else called they got a busy signal, that's it!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And we didn't have fancy Caller ID Boxes either! When the phone<br>&gt; rang, you had no idea who it was! It could be your school, your<br>&gt; mom, your boss, your bookie, your drug dealer, a collections agent,<br>&gt; you just didn't know!!! You had to pick it up and take your chances,<br>&gt; mister!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We didn't have any fancy Sony Playstation video games with<br>&gt; high-resolution 3-D graphics! We had the Atari 2600! With games<br>&gt; like "Space Invaders" and "asteroids" and the graphics sucked ass!<br>&gt; Your guy was a little square! You actually had to use your<br>imagination!<br>&gt; And there were no multiple levels or screens, it was just one screen<br>&gt; forever! And you could never win. The game just kept getting harder<br>and<br>&gt; harder<br>&gt; and faster and faster until you died! . Just like LIFE!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When you went to the movie theater there no such thing as stadium<br>&gt; seating! All the seats were the same height! If a tall guy or some<br>&gt; old broad with a hat sat in front of you and you couldn't see, you<br>&gt; were just screwed!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sure, we had cable television, but back then that was only like 15<br>&gt; channels and there was no onscreen menu and no remote control! You<br>&gt; had to use a little book called a TV Guide to find out what was on!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You were screwed when it came to channel surfing! You had to get off<br>&gt; your ass and walk over to the TV to change the channel and there was<br>&gt; no Cartoon Network either! You could only get cartoons on Saturday<br>&gt; Morning. Do you hear what I'm saying!?! We had to wait ALL WEEK for<br>&gt; cartoons, you spoiled little rat-bastards!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And we didn't have microwaves, if we wanted to heat something up, we<br>&gt; had to use the stove or go build a frigging fire ... imagine that!<br>&gt; If we wanted popcorn, we had to use that stupid JiffyPop thing and<br>&gt; shake it over the stove forever like an idiot.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That's exactly what I'm talking about! You kids today have got it<br>too<br>&gt; easy. You're spoiled.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You guys wouldn't have lasted five minutes back in 1980!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Regards,<br>&gt; The over 30 Crowd<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
