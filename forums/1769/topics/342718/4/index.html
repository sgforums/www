For my server alliance are total kiddo, they do stupid stuff .. if u wanna be alliance u can try 4Justice's server cos so far i got a few friends from alliance joining horde and they got nothing good to said about alliance.</p>

              <p>I dont think hordes who are crazily geared and then lol @ u while they gank u are any more mature. Both side also got good and bad, people just dont remember the good and remember the bad. Then since u guys choose horde, u dont want to appear silly so u block out all the bad of the horde and say u got nothing good to say about ally. I mean, if I decide to abandon ally and play horde even if horde is bad I would still say horde is good too, just so I dont appear to have made a bad decision. I've tried horde side, and its as bad. People squabble during BGs etc, idiots spamming trade, whats diff? You say horde is good cause yr mind is made up. You know what they say, the most devout believers are the converts. You're a horde convert, so anything bad on horde side u block out, ignore, same with anything good on ally side. Truth is both side are equally bad.</p>

              <p>Well, I also know hordes who've done the same. So pray tell, how does that make horde better? Most horde players I know seem to enjoy antagonising other people for kicks. A lot of people rolling horde give reasons like "I wanna look more badass/evil" which, as a motivation, is really not a good reflection of the sort of person he/she is. I even had this horde who back during TBC the skyguard quest to get aether rays, he would purposely follow and then when u get the ray down to low health to catch it, he will purposely kill yr ray. Yea horde is better. Tell me another one. Like I said, u've all choosen horde so now u die die convince yrself horde is better. Truth is, u're all wrong.</p>

              <p>I dont need to. I KNOW how bad hordes can be, but of course horde players who rerolled from ally will be biased and only say ally bad. Otherwise they look silly right? Reroll to a side just as bad, if im those who rerolled and find that horde also equally sux, I'd also fanatically insist horde is good to avoid looking dumb.</p>

              <p>I would respect yr choice to play hordes but u guys are here always saying ally bad etc and how ally = kill on sight and all that. Come on, if I ever rerolled on yr server and happen to wander by would u kill me too even if im minding my own business just because u guys meet some bad allys and decide to stoop to their level by declaring all ally = kill on sight?</p>
              <p>If u want yr decision to play horde respected u ought to stop slamming ally. This is not so much a club 30 WoW discussion thread as a club 30 horde supremacist thread lol. I cant even say I believe midlusionz when he says he ganks those who gank them. Ally = kill on sight leh, u sure u're only ganking those who gank u?</p>

              <p>And you dont need to have 25 lvl 70s to observe how people are. say u have a lvl 30 and u meet a horde in ashenvale. chances are that they're the alt of someone who has a lvl 80, and the way they behave will translate to what sort of person they are.  And whatever level u are, u can still see what's being said in trade.</p>
