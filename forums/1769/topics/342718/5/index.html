              believe midlusionz when he says he ganks those who gank them. Ally
              = kill on sight leh, u sure u're only ganking those who gank u?</p>

              <p>Then go back later lor. Or reroll on PvE server. I've always wondered about people who like PvP servers. They seem to enjoy antagonising other people. I've always said the true measure of how someone is, is in how they behave online in virtual environments, when social consequences are taken away and they're literally "let off their leash". How a person behaves once taken out of a social context, how much self control they display really says a lot about the genuine person residing inside behind the layers of masks we have to put on to face society.</p>

              <p>no, PvP can be confined to places like wintergrasp, BGs, doesnt have to be about griefing play. Even soldiers of old know that you dont always fight, and that even people who're your enemy deserve some professionalism and civility when theres no aggresion called for.</p>

              <p>I agree. 1st bit of unbiased opinion I've seen here. Griefers exist on both sides, ally or horde. I see no point being the aggressor. I would help horde players whenever I can, be it quests, group quests, or even accidental aggros on elite mobs.</p>

              <p>Its not flaming if someone provides a sorely needed counter-view to balance the bias. It's not flaming to speak fairly about something that has been receiving prejudiced coverage thus far. If you cannot tahan a bit of justice and fairness and see it as flaming, it's really not my fault, I only point out where people are being biased and unfair, and attempt to restore some balance by providing fair counter-views.</p>
