            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, one of my ex-boyfriends was eight years my junior.  That was because we didn't know each other's age until much much later.  We got along super fine, shared so many similar interests it was almost freaky, and were passionate about the same stuff too!  He was even studying to be a Doctor then, and we spent hours yakking about medical stuff, food, cooking, yada-yada-yada non-stop!  Then one fine day, after he told me he liked me, we realised that we had such a HUGE age gap!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I found it hard to accept in the beginning but truth be told, I couldn't ignore the fact that we got along swell and all that.  So, I finally decided to take a deep breath, and plunge into the deep unknown.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>The lesson I've learnt is, to never apply conservative rules sometimes.  If it works, it works, even if it means you ignored the steps written in the 'manual'.  You just can't be rigid in relationships.<br><br>And, btw, age is never a true reflection of maturity!  I've met people in their early 20's who are more mature than others in their late 30's.  It's the experience, the background, the hardships, the character, the attitude, etc etc that shapes the person, definitely NOT age per se.<br><br>BUT, all said, I'd still say NO! to dating a teenage guy.  It's just .... bbbbrrrrrrrr!!!!...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am not making this up...its really true..<br><br>I had sex with one of my aunts' friend when i was 16 back in the late 90s..she was 31 and somewhat attractive..<br>here;s it how it started, the firs ttime i met her and thereafter she started to get super friendly and such and told me things about girls ect...Nothing dirty but i suspect she wants to feel young again as evident from her actions..always acting cute, commenting my looks ec...I too like older women cause they have more developed bodied and better in bed....I think they want to feel young too with a younger guy...younger guy likes to be teached by older lady about sex....its jsut so arousing to be taught by an older lady... .......so once we were alone in her house i held her hand and seduced her....she responded immediately...That was the best sex of my life.....she perfectly knew how to do it.... younger girls just lay there like a wet mop.....<br><br>She then otld me if i needed anything i can give her a call.....after that we used to have sex a few times per week...each time it always gets better....i started to fall in love with her....i told her abt it and she said i am too young and the r/s we were having is purely sexual.... And that others may view it as wrong but she said its up to how one wants to live his or her life...so long its universally moral and not in the eyes of people who want to set rules for us..<br>at the same time my older sister got suspicious of this relationship as she saw us being intimate in a park b4 but soon i broke off with her before my parent knew of it who may KPKB<br><br>later i found out that she is not even attached at her age cause she wants to concentrate on her career.....i pondered abt it.....i think she is the type of lady who doesnt want to settle down but just wants instant gratification and young guys will satisfy what she is looking 4...She told me herself that it was her first time having sex in her life with me...I asked her how come, she replied she was not into these type of these when she was younger cause she was studious and and nerdy.....and some guys have approached her before. but she rejected....Confirmed this with my aunt who is her classmate and friends since uni....till now i cannot forget the sexual pangs i had when were in the affair...i used to think abt her and sex all the time in school at the time....even the young gals in my school were not attractive to me as i have tasted the forbidden fruit...<br><br>I miss those times we would meet up in her home for sex and intimacy..she really took care of me..she would pay for my cab fare to get home, make food for me in her house.......now how many gals my age at the time would do that?<br><br>I dont regret feeling cheap or anything like that..i felt like a real man..this is what real manhood is about..not some 18 years old BGR boy chasing after girl in JC/poly shyt.....<br><br>The last i ever heard of her is that she migrated to Aus wif her parents...</div>
