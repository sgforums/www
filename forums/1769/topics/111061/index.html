            <div class='col-md body'>The Viscount de Chegny, Raoul.  Why?  Because :<br><br>1)  We were childhood sweethearts and I'm a sentimental fool;<br>2)  I don't wish to live in the underground with the Phantom where there's no light and where conditions seem ideal for the breeding of new germs and such;  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>3)  The Phantom is pretty blood-thirsty;  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>4)  His obsession with Christine is a tad scary... I mean, he even had a mannequin made in her likeness all dressed up as a bride!  Eeeeeks!  And with that hidden mirror-door of his right in Christine's room, he can easily peek at her when she's undressing!!  Aaaiiieeeee!!  Ham Sup Kwei!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>5)  This Phantom probably has deep, underlying emotional and psychological problems and is better off spending time with a psychologist;<br>6)  He cannot go out on dates with me!  No shopping, no movies, no dining...  too boring!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>hehehehehehe.... Kops, enough reasons or not?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I would, however, feel sorry for the Phantom.  I'll maybe da-pao nice food from outside for him and bring him a copy of Today newspaper everyday to tempt him to take his first step out of that self-imposed underground dungeon.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Oi, Bear, I know you are DYING to share your feelings about the movie with us!  hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>SL, you watched the movie with your husband too, right?</div>
