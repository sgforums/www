Then as you get to know the stallholders well, they will start to tell you which are their freshest items, give you better prices, make good recommendations, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>However, if I cooked on weekday evenings after work, I'd just hop into the supermart after work to grab whatever I needed before rushing straight home to whip up a quick meal.

When I was staying at Marsiling, I remember walking over to the Woodlands wet market once, arriving there at about 6:25am, and when I went over to the seafood section, I saw the stallholder uncle displaying fish and the fishes were actually STILL GASPING FOR BREATH!!!!  They were THAT fresh!!!  My word!  I HAD to get those fishes that day!  My ex and I had steamed fish that day - one of the best ways to cook super fresh fish!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess stuff that you can find in wet markets and not in supermarts could be stuff like :<br><br>- Vegetarian Products<br>You know, those gluten stuff?  Mock whatever-meat.  And my favourite, vegetarian ham from Taiwan.<br><br>- Fresh Yong Tau Foo<br>Those in supermarts are usually pre-selected and pre-packed and often, not very fresh.  So, limited by choice and freshness.<br><br>- Certain dried foods<br>Supermarts don't offer the various grades of kang hee (dried anchovies) for instance.  In wet markets, you have the tiny ones, the small ones, the medium ones, the medium ones that have been beheaded and cleaned, the larger ones, the better grade ones, etc...  I guess that'll apply for other dried products like dried octopus, dried cuttlefish, etc.<br><br>- Achar (Pickled Vegetables)<br>In wet markets, the stalls selling the tau poks and noodles would usually sell their nice, home-made achar in inflated plastic bags.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I used to buy them as snacks for the day.  hehe!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Can't think of anything else right now but will add on to the list when I can recall more items.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Mock whatever-meat.  And my favourite, vegetarian ham from Taiwan.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">In supermarkets it is either in cans or frozen</span><br><br>- Fresh Yong Tau Foo<br>Those in supermarts are usually pre-selected and pre-packed and often, not very fresh.  So, limited by choice and freshness.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Believe it or not I have never bought Yong Tau Foo in a wet market or supermarket. Never used in any of my dishes before unless you consider fishballs under Yong Tau Foo than I get my fav fishballs from the wet market.</span><br><br>- Certain dried foods<br>Supermarts don't offer the various grades of kang hee (dried anchovies) for instance.  In wet markets, you have the tiny ones, the small ones, the medium ones, the medium ones that have been beheaded and cleaned, the larger ones, the better grade ones, etc...  I guess that'll apply for other dried products like dried octopus, dried cuttlefish, etc.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Don't use these either. My mum don't either so...no diff for us but some supermarkets have the different grades. Don't ask me about freshness coz I have no idea</span><br><br>- Achar (Pickled Vegetables)<br>In wet markets, the stalls selling the tau poks and noodles would usually sell their nice, home-made achar in inflated plastic bags.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I used to buy them as snacks for the day.  hehe!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">They have this in the supermarket as well but we hardly eat achar</span><br><br>Can't think of anything else right now but will add on to the list when I can recall more items.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
