              <p>Andy is the man responsible for yesterday's 2-inch thick pizza.  And he got pretty upset several of you commenters weren't feeling his efforts.  So, to spite you, he made a bigger, 7 pound, 4.5-inch thick pizza yesterday.  Take that, naysayer!</p>
              <blockquote>Okay, I saw that my pizza I posted a couple of hours ago
              got posted on Geekologie, that's cool, I read that blog on a daily
              basis. But apparently most of the readers over there wasn't that
              impressed. And some even thought it was fake, and that's just
              ridiculous. So I felt I had to do another thick pizza. So here we go:
              <p><br> 340g pineapple (190 kcal)<br> 70g asparagus (14 kcal)<br> 360g bacon (1152 kcal)<br> 750g cheese (2700 kcal)<br> 275g majonays (1980 kcal)<br> 170g shrimp (145 kcal)<br> 400g ham (520 kcal)<br> 200g salami (780 kcal)<br> 600g tomato paste + dough (1098 kcal)<br> 1 egg (90 kcal)</p>
              <p>All in all, this bad boy has 8669 kcal in it and weigh 7.08 lbs (3215g)</p>

              <p>I think I speak for us all when I say, it's about damn time.  This 12-volt pizza oven plugs right into a car's cigarette lighter
              or power point so you can cook a breakfast pizza on your commute to
              work. Or a dinner pizza on your way home! Or burn your car to the
              ground! The $36 oven is a real product and I just bought two. One for
              the front seat, and one for the kids in the back. What in the -- damnit
              kids, I smell burning army men! <em>*sniff*</em> I'm just so proud.</p>

              <p>In an ironic twist, an emotionless robot has been programmed to physically display emotions using it's face
              and body. It is one of the scariest looking robobastards I've seen and
              IT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ITS ACTIONS MEAN. It's like asking a robot if

              <p>they may be india indians, indian labourers seem to be a lot more hardworking than the banglas I have observed, these banglas move about as if they are drugged ...</p>
              <p>and ah tiongs, must see province also .... this time these fellows are from some interior place, more hardworking than the last batch ... the last batch one moves quickly only when it's nearing knock off ... so they can claim OT ....</p>
