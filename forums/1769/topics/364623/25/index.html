              <p>it's possible. the only issue is how bad do you think the situation is. For example if this h1n1 stays as easily spread and also as undetectable + is as deadly as sars, it might be practical to do so.</p>
              <p>and you don't need to qurantine those that just pass through as they pose no danger to singaporeans. Only those that are coming into singapore proper (none-transit) will need to be qurantined. Add to that the decrease in number of peopl who would come in due to these restrictions. The number will be manageable.</p>
              <p>The main consideration is really how you weigh the risk of loss of lives vs the economic cost of doing so. Currently the risk of losing lives is low. You'll probably lose less than 5 lives so they judge that the 5 lives are not worth as much as the potential losses from the qurantining <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              they pose no danger to singaporeans. Only those that are coming
              into singapore proper (none-transit) will need to be qurantined.
              Add to that the decrease in number of peopl who would come in due
              to these restrictions. The number will be manageable.</p>
              <p>The main consideration is really how you weigh the risk of loss
              of lives vs the economic cost of doing so. Currently the risk of
              losing lives is low. You'll probably lose less than 5 lives so they
              judge that the 5 lives are not worth as much as the potential
              losses from the qurantining <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>you could do concentrate camps if there is really a need to. And of course the number of people coming in will drop due to the restrictions.</p>
              <p>As I said, it's about how bad the situation becomes. just for exaple, if it developes into a case where any one within 10 metres without a full containment suit will die 7 days later. do you think it'll be worthwhile doing that? I'll say probably yes.</p>
