We're plain-speaking, we're friendly. It's using the vernacular," Bailey told reporters.<br><br>While the "shrimp on the barbie" campaign attracted thousands of tourists, its crassness caused many Australians to cringe.<br><br>It was followed in 1995 by a A$100 million ($74 million) campaign -- then Australia's biggest single marketing and advertising campaign -- which sought to convince the world Australia also had culture.<br><br>Bailey said Australia's tourism industry was worth A$73 billion and employed 500,000 Australians.<br><br>Taken from:<br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060223/od_nm/australia_ads_dc;_ylt=Aj4W1OlWoQmgPFCDP2IOqubtiBIF;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA--" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060223/od_nm/australia_ads_dc;_ylt=Aj4W1OlWoQmgPFCDP2IOqubtiBIF;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA--</a><br>[/b]</blockquote>oh this... been running in UK for a couple of months now. I thot the "where the bloody hell are u" sounded like a mouthful. Would be nicer to just ask "where the hell are u?". Sounds smoother</div>
