            <div class='col-md body'>long ago when i was alot younger, i saw gay men as being weak. but later on in life when I actually got to know a few friends BEFORE finding out they were gay, I  realised that they're, on the average, alot braver than you or I. It's not easy to out yourself, society doesn't like it, your friends might shun you, your mum might throw a hissy fit etc etc ... how many guys u think can take that on a daily basis and still find it within them to go about their daily lives?<br><br>whether it's a lifestyle choice or genetic, give your gay friends and acquaintences (how do you spell this lol) the same respect that you would your straight ones IMO. If you're not comfy to meet up, just tell him that, he'll prolly understand it and then things won't be so awkward anymore.<br><br>besides, gay men tend to have alot more female friends than you'd like to believe ... and some of them are prolly pretty, straight, well stacked &amp; well, you get the drift lol!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>TX</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've nothing against gay men. It's the lesbians i have a problem. Namely those who get all riled up and spout crap like "we are human beings too, we have our rights", "EFF OFF if you're a hater" and similar nonsense. I've known a few who go to church often. When i asked one of them what did she think about homosexuality in the Bible, she gives me this oh-so-weary tone and says "Jesus loves me for who i am, hate the sin but love the sinner."<br><br>I HATE it how they twist these phrases to suit them.

There was actually one lesbian couple in particular, who were so commited and devoted to each other that they made me think, hmmm...

Homosexuals are most likely people who couldn't find fulfillment in heterosexual relationships and/or they identify much better with people of the same sex.<br><br>I have my views about homosexuality, but I shan't impose them on anyone other than myself.  I have discovered that by not judging them, but to get to know them as an individual first, you can end up with another buddy to add to your list.

I do have lesbian friends too but not very close.<br><br>Just because they are homosexual, it doesn't mean they are going to be attracted to anyone of the same gender especially if they already knew you're straight.<br><br>While they might have different sexual preference, they are just another human being and do know how to respect their friends.<br><br>So don't worry about your gay friend.
