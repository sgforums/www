              <p>Basket.... IPT just now was a major f*ckup....</p>
              <p>First, the PTI was not happy with how some people were not taking circuit training seriously.... in the end, it was cut short and replaced with chinups + interval training, which lengthened the training time without helping as much as circuit training would have.....</p>
              <p>Then, some retard went MIA halfway through. The PTI already warned us before that they would count strength every now and then to make sure that no one would chao keng and hide one corner. Since someone went missing, we wasted even more time having to form up and find out the name of the bugger who went missing.</p>
              <p>Since that bugger wanted to chao keng, the PTI declared that his entire IPT would be forfeited. Good riddance.</p>

              <p>I really don't know what goes through their minds.... I always feel that the approach to RT/IPT should always be the same as the general approach to NS: Since you're already being forced to do it, you might as well just make the most of it and come out with something.</p>
              <p>Got circuit training, just do it as best as you can. The PTI already said that quality is always better than quantity, and he can accept us doing fewer reps if we can do them well. The problem was, some people were clearly just doing it on a 'relac-relac' basis without even trying.</p>
              <p>And then that bugger who went MIA was just asking for it. Today's training was 3/4 done already.... just tahan a bit more, also cannot ah?</p>

              <p>Yeah I know, it's just three more to pass.... but in the chance that I can't improve on my chinups in time, at least my rear end is covered.</p>
              <p>Besides, I figured that I'm going to need to train anyway for IPPT.... so why not I do it in camp, under the proper supervision of army PTIs, with free medical coverage in case of injuries, and the bonus of protection from RT in case I fail?</p>
              <p>IPT is now much more flexible also.... I can go for any session of my choice within a five-week period as long as there is at least one day's rest in between each session.</p>

              <p>Lots of sessions.... but you can only do eight sessions within a five-week timeframe, which itself must be within nine months of your birthday.</p>

              <p>Chinups.... can only do two now.....</p>
              <p>Yeah I know, it's just three more to pass.... but in the chance
              that I can't improve on my chinups in time, at least my rear end is
              covered.</p>
              <p>Besides, I figured that I'm going to need to train anyway for
              IPPT.... so why not I do it in camp, under the proper supervision
              of army PTIs, with free medical coverage in case of injuries, and
              the bonus of protection from RT in case I fail?</p>
              <p>IPT is now much more flexible also.... I can go for any session
              of my choice within a five-week period as long as there is at least
              one day's rest in between each session.</p>

              <p>I really don't know what goes through their minds.... I always feel that the approach to RT/IPT should always be the same as the general approach to NS: Since you're already being forced to do it, you might as well just make the most of it and come out with something.</p>
              <p>Got circuit training, just do it as best as you can. The PTI already said that quality is always better than quantity, and he can accept us doing fewer reps if we can do them well. The problem was, some people were clearly just doing it on a 'relac-relac' basis without even trying.</p>
              <p>And then that bugger who went MIA was just asking for it. Today's training was 3/4 done already.... just tahan a bit more, also cannot ah?</p>
              <p>And even if he had an emergency, he could have just approached the PTI... at worst, only this session would have been forfeited, and at best, the PTI may let him outpro early!</p>
