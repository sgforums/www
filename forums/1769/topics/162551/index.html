            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>I always find it strange and uneasy whenever I see Gurkha policemen, often armed with sub-machine guns, deployed to provide guard duty in some public places. It creates a disquieting atmosphere.<br><br>I notice that Gurkhas are increasingly deployed in more vital installations such as ferry terminals, Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints, the homes of high-level government officers, and some foreign properties.<br><br>I can understand the need to increase the level of security in the light of the increased terrorist threat. But why use the Gurkhas? Why don't we use our own Singapore policemen?<br><br>The only reason I can be think of is that the government trusts the Gurkhas and considers them highly-skilled, given their discipline, courage and dedication.<br><br>But this begs a question: are we not having many well-trained police officers who are equally tough, skilled and most of all, loyal?<br><br>As I see it, deploying the Gurkhas in public places gives a wrong signal to Singaporeans about Singapore's ability to protect its own citizens with its own security people.<br><br>Worse, it gives foreign visitors an impression that Singapore is not capable of providing its own security personnel and has to employ Gurkhas to protect the country.<br><br>Looking back, the Gurkha contingent was first introduced in Singapore in 1949 by the British government to battle the communist threat and racial violence.<br><br>At that time, the local police were perceived to be biased towards their own communities and the deployment of the Gurkha contingent was essential as it carried out its duties impartially when dealing with civil disturbances. But it's been 40 years since Singapore's independence. What is the logic for the government to continue relying on the Gurkhas to protect our people and assets?<br><br>As Singapore is now more developed, the government has built up a strong and multi-ethnic police force that is efficient, trustworthy, impartial and loyal.<br><br>It has an elite police tactical unit (PTU) that is used to manage serious situations such as civil unrest and cases involving firearms. Many in the older generations will surely remember these feared PTU officers, then called the reserve unit, with their batons and body shields during those turbulence years in the 60s.<br><br>After the 9/11 incident, the police has started deploying the PTU since 2004 to patrol more public places such as Orchard Road and Holland Road to address terrorism concerns.<br><br>If the PTU officers can be used in such places, they should be used in other key installations as well instead of deploying the Gurkhas. The Gurkhas should be reserved for cases involving major security threats only. We should and must be able to protect our own people.<br><br>Seah Leong Khai<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look, i doubt it is because the Gurkhas are tougher or are more disciplined. These are traits that can be trained.<br><br>I -think- the real reason for using Gurkhas is that they:<br><br>1. are Relatively Cheap<br>2. are Expendable in that there are not many people (in Singapore) who will *really* grieve for them when they get hurt or die whilst on duties.<br>3. are likely to have less ties to singaporeans. This would make them very useful in more delicate situations. Eg. In situations where SAF soldiers and the police are not really inclined to do their jobs. I know that I would, as an NSman be very reluctant to follow orders that i feel are clearly against the well-being of the state and the people.<br><br>4. Yes, i think tradition and the myth attached to them might have something to do with it as well. This, however, is probably one of the least significant motivation for using them.<br><br>I think the writer is making a fuss over nothing though. Its like some people have nothing better to do than to try and get their names published in the local paper so that they too can have their 15 mins of fame. But hey, its a free(ish) country.</div>
