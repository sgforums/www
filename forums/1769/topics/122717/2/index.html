You will be given anaesthetic eye drops. My op was in the afternoon, and when I woke up the next morning after an early night, my vision was almost 100% clear. The world does seem more beautiful and ugly (in terms of intensity). I had to undergo Lasik because of a certain problem. I was wearing glasses all along. If i wanted to correct a cetain problem of mine, I should do Lasik first. So i did.</div>

In the medical profession, 'new' procedures mean that it hasn't been around long enough for us to totally understand ALL the possible side effects the op will cause.  I mean, we don't know if 20 or 30 years down the road, there'll be any sort of adverse effects because it hasn't been around long enough for us to fully understand it thoroughly.  In that sense, it's still in its infancy.  It is 'safe', but we have not understood ALL there is to know about it... yet.<br><br>Just bumped into an SNEC doc today and was DYING to ask her about her views on Lasik but she was very busy.
