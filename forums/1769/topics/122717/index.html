            <div class='col-md body'>Been an avid follower of Lasik surgery, Its all boil down to whether you are willing to take the risk. For these eye surgeons they think its not worth it.. IMO if you can live with your lens , forget about the ops cos its irreversible.........</div>

Of course I'll ask them!  They usually just smile at me or, they'll look conspiratorily at each other, and smile.<br><br>Like what seancannot said, stick to your specs or lenses if you can.<br><br>And guys, I want to elaborate on what I meant when I said that Lasik is still a relatively new procedure.  In the medical profession, 'new' procedures mean that it hasn't been around long enough for us to totally understand ALL the possible side effects the op will cause.  I mean, we don't know if 20 or 30 years down the road, there'll be any sort of adverse effects because it hasn't been around long enough for us to fully understand it thoroughly.  In that sense, it's still in its infancy.  It is 'safe', but we have not understood ALL there is to know about it... yet.<br><br>Just bumped into an SNEC doc today and was DYING to ask her about her views on Lasik but she was very busy.  Sigh... some other time, perhaps!</div>
