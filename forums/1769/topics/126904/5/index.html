            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br><br>Sorry for my blanket statement about S$2.5k/mth being a little on the low side. I guess we do need to take it in context. I'm referring to my friends who are all mostly uni grads (or dip to degree) and who are perhaps more fortunate in light  that there are other grads who are not drawing similar salaries.<br><br>I guess the sector you work in makes a difference as well. The financial sector, for example, tends to pay better. Certain types of engineering (chemical for eg.) as well. I'm sure there are others.<br><br>Singapore has such a competitive (kiasu) culture and everyone wants to be ahead. There's almost no end to any comparison. Sad actually. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Ultimately, I think it's most important that one strives to do the best he/she can. There's also some luck element involved in our careers. Some may prefer to refer to "luck" as good timing. For example, I didn't go on to the Uni after NS but chose to join the financial sector in some crazy job I knew nuts about. Fortunately, it has been the best thing in my life.<br><br>Everyone should strive to upgrade his skill set. Don't plan on remaining employed the rest of your lives! Try and envision yourselves doing a business or improving your lot somehow.<br><br>I'm working on mine now... are you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
