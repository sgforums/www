Like to some, they consider 2k alot of money, whereas to some, 5k is pittance.</div>

If attached, put your all into the relationship.  Either ways, make the most of what you have and live in and for the moment.<br><br>It's not some competition where you 'win' by meeting the financial criteria to attract women.

            <div class='col-md body'>I not saying girl are materilistic , just that a guy need to make a certain amount of money to give her a certain level of security.rite??. I agree when pple are younger they would think so long the passion there , money is immaterial that kind of thing.. but that wont last..<br><br>my ex is an exmaple, when I got to know she was just a fresh grad.. over time she told me her needs and expectation have changed..She wanted me to plan for our future .. rather than just laze around.. she wanted me to get a 2nd job or learn a skill..but I told I was tired out from all the hard works.....I fully understand and agree with her .. i cant blame her.<br><br>even if I am a girl I will not choose somebody who cannot provide for me how can there be happiness if there are no $$ and the road ahead is going to be a tedious ones... for someone like my case  with 2. K take home pay. I expended my salary every month .. contribute to family alone 1.2K.. left with $800 for my own..  think i am classify as a low income earner for my age<br><br>IMO for a guy, he has to taek home at least 3k such that he can provide a certain level of comfort for his loved ones in today Singapore where the livng standard is so high 3k is a benchmark! .. dun flame me!</div>
