            <div class='col-md body'>seancannot, I'm glad you brought your problem out in the open for discussion and to listen to the views and opinions of others so that you can make the 'best', most well-informed decision after considering all that.<br><br>You situation does sound tough.  I never knew how tough a life some Singaporeans lead until I entered nursing.  It was only then that I realised some families are really struggling and still leading a hand-to-mouth existence.  Having a chronically ill family member can really place a huge burden on the entire family, especially if those taken ill were sole breadwinners.  I'm all too familiar with the various poverty levels that require the assistance and intervention of Medical Social Workers.<br><br>And then, there are my colleagues, a few of whom already find themselves supporting the family at a young age.  Sometimes, I am astounded that we might be earning close to the same amount but their monthly wages get stretched that much more and gets shared amongst quite a few family members.  It was a real eye-opener and has made me appreciate the little that I do have because hey, things could have been much much worse.<br><br>The cost of living here is high, but the key phrase is, to live within your means.  There are ways and means to cut costs,  you just need to be frugal.  And covet not ostentatious items or needless indulgences.<br><br>I think you really need to reflect on some of the advice that's been given to you here.  I especially like the proactive and constructive comments given by ilovemyrolex.  Read what he has posted again and reflect on it.  You can change your situation for the better but it does take time and effort but you must be determined to do it.<br><br>Solve your immediate problems first and I think at this stage, finding a girl should be the last thing on your mind.  I'm sure you feel lonely and would love to have someone stand by you, encouraging you and all that but there's a time and place for everything and I guess this is not the right time yet.<br><br>Not all women here are as materialistic as you make us out to be.  For you info, I struggled with my ex and we had our fair share of 'poverty days' sooo bad, I break out in cold sweat and a shudder just thinking about it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>So, first things first, seancannot.  And, as my ex used to say, if you've hit rock-bottom, console yourself that it can never get any worse and therefore, it can only get better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  And like what one of Eric Draven's favourite songs say, 'It Can't Rain All The Time'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And please, nobody feel scared of complaining in Club 30, as Elindra pointed out.  I'd rather lend my ears to someone who needs to rant and rave than to have that person turn to undesirable ways of relieving stress.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. interesting topic.<br><br>I know a couple of gals who would probably like their late 20s/early 30s guy (be it ideal/potential or current boyfriend) to have a gross monthly salary of S$4000 and up. I'm sure they would be willing to go a little lower on their expectations if they really liked a guy.<br><br>S$2500 does seem a little on the low side for a 30+ year old guy.<br>Don't be discouraged however! What's most important is that you seek to improve your lot and have the brains/common sense. It's pointless to have a guy who can earn S$4k+ and yet doesn't know how to manage his finances.<br><br>I know a guy who used to earn like S$6-7k+ a mth and above yet didn't have much savings at all. It's also important to have your priorities right. Money management is a huge topic.<br><br>I know many Singaporeans are happy to service house and car loans with a S$3-4k salary. Personally, I don't even think one should own a car unless he takes home a 5 figure monthly salary but hey different strokes for different people.<br><br>Try to work on your career prospects thru that CV. Also look at alternative forms of returns. It is wise to aspire not to be a slave to one job your whole life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

For these graduates in this bracket, if you happen to be earning more than SGD3K per month, consider yourself one of the blessed few.<br><br>Most if not all companies are beginning to restructure their pay scales such that unless you can add value (very significantly!) to the company's business or are such a valuable asset to the company, your pay will likely remain the same or with little change for the next few years.<br><br>Given the nature of change in the economy where jobs come and go every few years, you will likely be earning a salary range of SGD2 to 4K for most of your working life.  You will likely be working in different industries and using different sets of skills learnt throughtout your career.   Pay wise, why should a company pay you a higher than necessary salary when you are forced to switch industries due to economic restructuring?  Eg. after 5 years, you change your job from an engineer to say the service industry (read IR here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>Thinking of earning SGD8K or more a month ?  Those days are gone unless you are the few cream of the crop in the civil service or private sector and can rise to senior management positions.<br><br>For the majority, we will be flitting from industry to industry, picking up different skills just enough to stay alive in today's world.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.<br><br></div>
