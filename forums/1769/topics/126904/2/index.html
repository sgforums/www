            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mr Seancannot,<br><br>If you are a gal, would you fall for someone like yourself? If i'm one, I wouldn't.<br><br>But it wouldn't be due to the following:<br>1. Not good looking and a wimpy body (just imagine a Lee Guo huang)<br>2.made 2.5 K, not a stable job (contract basis)<br>3. not romantic, undecisive and wishy washy<br>4. No car nor house<br>5. Just a diploma<br><br>I think your problem lies in your very <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">own perception</span> of your self worth</strong>.  If you don't even love yourself (or find yourself loveable), how would any one to love you?<br><br>If you want to compare to Lee Guo Huang, he so cannot make it, also made it. Why? Because he believe he can make it.  Therein lies the difference.  Besides, I believe you are more educated than that Beng, so what's the ploblem?<br><br>Do you want to remain like that? or Wallow in self-pity and post on this forum about being who you are (or are not)? where you are (or where you are not)? how much (or little) you make? or not owning what you don't own?<br><br>Or <span style="color: red;"><strong> are you going to stand up and make things happen?</strong></span><br><br>I am not trying to flame you.  I just hope from the bottom of my heart you STAND UP and make a man out of yourself.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are somethings that may help you start:</span><br><br>If you're not good looking, you can't change your face, but you can work on your grooming and have a healthy body.<br><br>If you think $2500 is not enough, go find a job that pays better.  I know its easier said than done and most of our fellow forumites have also made their point that if you use money as bait, you'd probably get money-grabbing chicks.<br><br>No one is born a romantic, and it takes <strong>effort</strong> to do special things for someone.<br><br>If you know you are undecisive, read books to help you make decision.<br><br>I don't know what you do with your money, but wealth and possession take time to accumulate.  Maybe you want to talk to someone to help you plan your finances?<br><br>Just a diploma? Get a degree!  Although I'm sure a lot of employers would appreciate work experience than a piece of paper, having both experience and paper wouldn't hurt, would it?<br><br>I know then you'd probably say it's going to cost money and you don't have time.... but hey! it's <strong>your</strong> life!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by seancannot:</div><div class="quote_body">Gals out there can you really tell me from the bottom of your heart would you choose someone with quality as below<br><br>1.

Whining doesn't make a difference. You can whine for years, or don't whine at all, it does not make a difference to your lifestyle. People who are suffering more didn't wince a bit, why should someone who suffered less whine the whole day instead of working hard to change their lives?<br><br>Of course, you're entitled to believe that ranting is a given. Whether you suffer more or less, crying doesn't change anything to improve your financial situation.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
