I had mentioned that the hubster was in the area undergoing military instruction and wanted to take the opportunity to take in the nation's memorials. I guess my letter played on their patriotic spirit. Either that or they took pity on me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Either way, I'm the winner.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
