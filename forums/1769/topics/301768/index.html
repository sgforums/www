            <div class='col-md body'>Your Unconscious Mind Is Most Driven by Curiosity.<br><br>You are full of questions about life, people, and your own potential. You spend more time than others imagining the possibilities for your life Â– and you're open to things others are too afraid to consider. You have an almost physical need to know and do more. It's only through new experiences that you feel a greater understanding of yourself and the world.<br><br>You also have a rebellious streak that shows up when you feel unable to truly influence the world or circumstances around you. Your appetite for novel experiences also shows an openness others don't have, but wish they did.

            <div class='col-md body'>Your Unconscious Mind Is Most Driven by Self-protection.<br>Self-protection<br><br>You are emotionally reserved and private. You typically keep your cool during arguments and rarely reveal personal information that you later regret. On the surface, you appear very serene. Inside however, you may sometimes feel detached or disconnected from the world around you. The advantage of this is that you are not the sort of person to easily lose your temper.<br><br>You think about things rationally rather than get swept up in emotions. You also remain calm in the toughest of situations. Your psyche is very unique; the more you learn about it, the more you will understand who you really are...<br></div>
