They do not have a desire to be in the spotlight. However, they can be very successful at promoting those who are.<br><br>Virgos are meticulous, practical perfectionists. They abhor sloppiness and disorganization. They are sometimes seen as being far too picky. However, when you want a job done right the first time get a Virgo to do it. Some Virgos are not above using an inability to achieve perfection as the excuse for their own idleness and unproductiveness, but this is out of character with their true nature.<br><br>Virgos have an inner drive to serve others, which must be met for them to be happy. They love to apply their analytical skills to solving the problems of others. They are generally perceived to be quite witty and entertaining, if a tad too critical. Because Virgos are worriers, they are prone to hypochondria. Virgos love material possessions and find it hard to accept anything that is not of the very best quality available.<br>The Virgo In Love:<br>Virgo is particular, practical and realistic rather than romantic. Virgos are slow-burning fuses in the art of lovemaking. Once properly ignited, situations can lead to an explosion of white heat that takes quite a while to cool down. They are, however, very fastidious and critical of the personal habits of others, which can be a big turn-off and prevent them from achieving a fulfilling relationship, or even participating at all in the messy business of involvement.<br><br>They are unwilling to discuss their innermost feelings with anyone save a very trusted confidante or lover. Anyone who wishes to get to know them deeply must be prepared to persevere, in which case they will prove a lifelong friend and ally or lover. Once Virgos have committed themselves to a lover, anyone showing interest in their lover is likely to spark a bout of jealousy. Overall, Virgos are devoted and readily willing to serve their mates.<br>Famous Virgos Include:<br>Lauren Bacall, Michael Jackson, D. H. Lawrence, Queen Elizabeth I, Sophia Loren, Sean Connery, Lily Tomlin, Raquel Welch, Grandma Moses, Tolstoy, H. L. Mencken, John Coltrane, Pavlov, Warren Buffett and Liliuokalani<br>Ideal Jobs Include:<br>Virgos are well-suited to be chemists, doctors, investigators, nutritionists, veterinarians, managers and entrepreneurs.<br>Lucky Numbers:<br>6, 15, 24, 33, 42, 51<br>Planet: Mercury<br>Star Stone: Sardonyx<br>Element: Earth<br><br># Symbol : Virgin<br># Ruling Planet: Mercury<br># Keywords: analytical, meticulous, modest<br># Polarity: Negative<br># Duality or Gender: Feminine<br># Element: Earth<br># Quality: Mutable<br># Body Areas: Nervous System<br># Countries: Mesopatamia, Virgin Islands, Brazil, Crete<br># and Turkey<br># Cities: Paris, Athens, Boston, Corinth and Jerusalem<br># Stone: Sardonyx<br># Colors: Brown, dark grey and deep navy blue<br># Similarity to Chinese Sign : ROOSTER<br><br>http://www.sexualastrology.com/zodiac_horoscope_virgo.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Astrological Characteristics Libra:<br>The LIBRA  Sept. 23 - Oct. 23<br>Diplomaitic, Urbane, Romantic, Charming, Easygoing, Sociable, Idealistic and Peaceable<br>Indecisive, Changeable, Gullible, Easily Infuenced, Flirtatious and Self-Indulgent<br>Librans are the Zodiac's seekers of balance, harmony and justice. Librans do best when paired up with others. They do not really care to be alone. Those they pair with can count on them to be fair and avoid conflict if possible.<br><br>Often Libras may seem a bit indecisive. This is because in their efforts to be fair they must study every angle of a situation before making a decision. They really are out to do what is best for all. Libras are master strategists and organizers. Librans are friendly, sociable and can charm anyone who engages them in conversation. When bored they quickly become lethargic and may need those around them to supply the spark to get them back on track.<br><br>Librans love to know everything about the people around them. They are always diplomatic and not averse to compromise--particularly if it will avoid discord. While Librans may not be team leaders, they can be counted on to plan any project's steps well. Their sense of fairness will also help lessen the number of conflicts that arise between project members. Libra's great gift to us all is we can trust them to be unbiased in their decisions at all times.<br>The Libra In Love:<br>Librans love the home and marriage. Time with their lover and family makes them feel complete. To a large extent their love relationship will become their identity. Libras can be very sensual and eager to explore both the spiritual and physical limits of their relationships.<br><br>Shaping their relationship and creating entrancing moments is where the Libra focuses its creativity. Their ultimate goal is pleasure and harmony. Libras prefer to be the pursued, rather than pursue. The more attention their mate pours upon them, the happier they will be.<br><br>Librans are best involved with a special person who understands their need for romance and their search for the perfect environment. They are co-operative, imaginative and willing to experiment with all manner of relationship styles. The happy Libra is one whose relationship is not simply a coupling, but the joining of two people to go through life as one.<br>Famous Librans Include:<br>Eisenhower, Olivia Newtown-John, Sarah Berhardt, Mohandas Gandhi, Franz Liszt, Bruce Springsteen, Brigitte Bardot, Eleanor Roosevelt, Paul Simon, Noah Webster, Ralph Lauren, and Michael Crichton<br>Ideal Jobs Include:<br>Librans are well-suited to careers as diplomats, judges, public relations consultants, counsellors, psychologists and artists.<br>Lucky Numbers:<br>7, 16, 25, 34, 43, 52<br>Planet: Venus<br>Star Stone: Sapphire<br>Element: Air<br><br># Symbol : Scales<br># Ruling Planet: Venus<br># Keywords: Balanced, romantic, easygoing<br># Polarity: Positive<br># Duality or Gender: Masculine<br># Element: Air<br># Quality: Cardinal<br># Body Areas: Kidneys<br># Countries: Tibet, Austria, China, South-Pacific Islands,<br># Upper Egypt and Japan<br># Cities: Vienna, Copenhagen, Leeds, Nottingham and<br># Lisbon<br># Stone: Sapphire<br># Colors: Pale blues, pinks and various shades of green<br># Similarity to Chinese Sign : DOG<br><br>http://www.sexualastrology.com/zodiac_horoscope_libra.html<br><br>Bear...this is for you.</div>

Roosters are observers with logical solutions to every problem Roosters are smooth talkers who want to be in the know at all times. You like to be in the Â“thick of thingsÂ”. Very straightforward, you say what's on your mind and always keep your word. You tend to be very private and hide your feelings when you have found love. Avoid this tendency at all costs. Beware of your tendency to be self-centered and remain open to criticism when you feel itÂ’s ultimately to your benefit. Though you can be critical at times, you are a warm person at heart. Some people maintain that you can be tough to live and work with. You secretly desire stability, sentiment and lots of tender loving care. When you find the right person, you will reciprocate with acts of kindness in return. You will attract a trusting partner who will bend over backward to please you. You could marry in your later years.<br><br>Famous Rooster People: Suharto, Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov, D. H.
