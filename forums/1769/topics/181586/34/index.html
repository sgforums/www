I was very religious, watching their show. Bought almost all of their cassette tapes. Pirated back then only $2.50.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> You know, I never got to skate, roller or on ice, at Leisure Drome. Parents just never bothered and when I got older, the place just fell out of favour, turned into a ghost town. Remember when 10 cents got you a small glass of fake birds nest drink? Loved that.<br><br>My school was in Upp. S'goon so that was my kampong. Didn't really hang out at the old MPH though I remember it well. Didn't even go to the old National Library if you can imagine that. My fave haunt was the NIB in S'goon Gardens.</div>
