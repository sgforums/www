Worse, sounds like she just doesn't care.

Wait till I tell you what she has me doing tomorrow. I'm supposed to work from 9-1. She wrote the schedule before she knew that the store will open at 7am tomorrow. I'm super duper angry over this but I know that she didn't do this on purpose so I'm just biting the bullet. So I'm going in at 6am, clocking out at 715am on to run home so that I can drive the kids to school. Then I have to be back at work at 815am to continue where I left off. WTH?!?!?!?!!?<br><br>She's been giving me more than my requested for 20 hours a week because of all the part timers, I'm the most responsible. While I appreciate that, I really don't like working for 38 hours. Or being on my feet for 12 hours. That's it, come the end of the season, I quit!!!!!!</div>

For one thing, the Nursing School in Singapore has world-class facilities and the training, esp the hands-on training, is stricter and much tougher.  The nursing grads here are really... tor huay (vomit blood, aka cikit tarah) because they are so 'cushioned'!  They make a mistake, the nurses go, "It's alright, it's ok... yada yada" but back in Singapore, you get an earful and you'll be reduced to tears from the scolding but you know what, you learn important, vital lessons you never ever forget, which is what you need in Nursing!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   The grads here are so blardy arrogant, it's unbelievable!<br><br>Love the lifestyle and options and relative 'freedom' in the workplace, hate the standards, the cost and the general inconvenience and close-mindedness here.

Smart move!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I envy the people from China and Malaysia and the Philippines - their currency is so low compared to the A$ that it's really to their advantage to work here.  All my Filipino colleagues are working hard to pay off land and property back in the Philippines!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>The S$ is so strong that it doesn't make a scant bit of difference for me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div></blockquote>Haiz, don't talk to me about $$$. After buying this place, we are in deep debt. And it doesn't look like we're going to be able to dig ourselves out of this for a long time. Everytime a tiny bit of cash frees up, something else comes up so I can't throw that into the mortgage. Take the most recent episode for instance, I've had to dump the cash into paying for my bloody dental implant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
