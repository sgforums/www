            <div class='col-md body'>I think everyone does dream, but if you goes into a deep sleep, you won't be able to remember your dream clearly when you wake up...<br><br>Hmm there was two dreams which I have remembered until today...yea, they were both in colors...first one was I went into a huge mansion, carpeted and then walked into a room full with books...then suddenly I was outside the house. But thing is, it was not a mansion anymore when I was looking at it from the outside. It looked like a very big dilapidated house...kinda freaky. Then I went to look up the dream dictionary(there was a period when I was very interested in all these kinda things, I even made a speech on dreams once <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and it says going into a library or room full wif books means u will never get married!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Then the way your house looks actually portrays your health state...<br><br>Second dream...I dreamed of a race uphill with some of my friends, the hill was really steep and there was a waterfall that cuts thru it...and we were running up beside the waterfall! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Physically impossible...but I guess this dream signifies reaching out for your dream. And at that time I was struggling to pass my high school exam...<br><br>One interesting fact...the basis for chemistry of aromatic compounds came from the dream of benzene ring(in the form of a snake eating its own tail) by Friedrich August <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
