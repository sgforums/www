            <div class='col-md body'>.... I went fishing alone at the Bedok Jetty. Awhile later, I caught a shark ( size of an adult ), it was green in colour and got two legs. People started to crowd around me and the shark. Suddenly the shark stood up, bite and gobbled up all the people, except me.The shark looked at me and smile, but i ran for my life, with the shark right behind me. I ran all the way to The Lagoon Hawker Center....<br><br>..... At the centre, I realised the shark was not to be found, so i ordered a bottle of Tiger beer to quench my thirst. After a few drinks the shark reappeared...... but he said "" Hehe.. let's be friend ok?" I said ok.... then we sat down together and ordered more beer. We drank till midnight, and the shark said he was hungry.... so i decided to ordered some food....satay, char kuey teow, roti prata... BUt the shark refused to eat... I asked him what he wanted then ..... He said......" I WANT TO EAT YOU!!!!" He opened his saliva dripping jaws (a la Aliens ) and lunged towards me. I caught hold of an empty beer bottle and smash it on the shark's head...nothing happened...He jumped on to me again, and this time i am too drunk to fight back, he bite and tore me to pieces..... I ssssssscreammmmm!!!!<br><br>.... I woke up... checked my body...Phewww!! still in one piece.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Tell us how sweet / scary / weird  your dreams were.<br><br>Also, out of curiosity, do you dream in black-and-white or in colour?  Apparently, there are people who don't see colour in their dreams.  Me?  I dream in technicolour!  woohoo!!  My brain is a Sony Vega TV with brilliant colours!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Also, do you have difficulties remembering your dreams?  And what, in your opinion, triggers dreams?<br><br>I noticed that if I think a lot about something before I fall asleep, I'll dream of that thing / person.  If I had supper before sleeping, I'll also have awful nightmares.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Does this happen to you too?<br><br></div></blockquote>if yr's is a sony vega, mine's a cheapo china brand tv...made 20 years ago.<br><br>usually out of focus, grainy and lacklustre colours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two nights ago, I had a very strange 'dream' that scared the hell outta me!<br><br>I was on Night Duty and it was a lull moment and somehow, I fell asleep without knowing it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  Then, I started to 'dream'...<br><br>I dreamt I was sitting right where I was, writing my report, suddenly, I heard this very loud and spooky old lady's voice in Hokkien, it filled up the entire place!  The old lady was mumbling on and on about her unhappiness whilst she was hospitalised!  She was probably on a feeding tube because she grumbled about us not giving her food but kept pumping stupid milk into that silly tube, how she was so ill she couldn't get up to walk about and we had to restrain her when she tried to pull out her tubes, etc etc.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I then 'saw' myself in the same place, asleep.  I tried to move and wake up or yell to my colleague sitting just beside me but I couldn't move, couldn't wake up, couldn't even utter a word!  Finally, I mustered enough 'strength' to call out, 'AAAaaaahhh!' and then everything slowly faded into the 'background' and I woke up!<br><br>I looked over at my colleague with shock all over my face but she was writing her report like nothing had happened.  I asked, 'Didn't you hear me scream?  Didn't you see me squirm?'  She said, 'Huh?  Nothing!  Not a peep from you!'  Then I told her what happened and she said I must have had a 'visitation' in my dream because there are so many apparitions in hospital, that can happen sometimes when they're trying to communicate with us.<br><br>I was  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>AAAaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Last night, had a really really weird dream...<br><br>I dreamt that Singapore was being invaded by aliens exactly like those in the movie, 'War of the Worlds'.  I was running along this familiar road near Mei Ling Street en route to Alexandra Rd, hiding from the tall machines.  I saw a group of folks standing by the bus stop, paralysed by fear so I joined them and squeezed to the back.  Then, we all gasped as one huge alien machine loomed right before us!<br><br>Instead of zapping people to ashes, these machines would grab folks and place them somewhere inside them!  I came close to being grabbed a few times but I squirmed and ran and yelled my way outta the grip.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I ran all the way up some hill and there was this athletic chap there who kept yelling to me to run faster!<br><br>We hid in the void deck of a block of flats and watched the machines snatching more and more folks.  We were so near the aliens but somehow, they couldn't see us.  PHEW!!!<br><br>We were thinking of what we could do to escape... and then, I suddenly woke up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I woke up with all my muscles tensed up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I knew I shouldn't have had supper last night.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  I always kena punished with nightmares if I eat too late.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
