It seems that for my last two paydays, they accidentally credited money that was meant for another guy's account into my account. WTF.<br><br>And when that guy didn't get his expected pay, he lodged a report with MOM. And the investigation traced the error to the said supervisor who credited money to the wrong account.<br><br>I didn't really suspect anything because it was more or less in the ballpark of what I was expecting to get. I didn't get the pay statement, because the pay came in AFTER I had quit my job. Now they want me to come down to their Vivocity office ASAP to help clear things out.<br><br>WTF... this means that I actually have LESS money than what I thought I have at the moment. And this translates to my having to review my planned expenditure, and so on. And not to mention the fact that I went for a holiday because I felt that I had enough savings to fund it.<br><br>Heck, the fact that I have to go all the way down to Vivocity to help sort things is a sacrifice in itself.... I already have enough things to do without having to do that as well.<br><br>WTF WTF WTF........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>why do you have to go down?

And before that can happen, they need to hammer out exactly how much the overpayment was. And I need to personally countercheck that with whatever's in my account - if they can overcredit payment into my account, who's to say that they overcalculated the amount that I'm supposed to pay out?<br><br>Heck, even if they were to tell me the exact overpayment over the phone, I would still have to go to the ATM and credit the amount to the other guy. That in itself is already a waste of my time and effort - and not to mention, the psychological factor of having held on to money that was not supposed to have been mine to begin with, as well as the effects it had on my personal spending since then.<br><br>If I really wanted to be a big b*stard, I could have simply ignored the calls and made the supervisor pay the fella with her own money.... but then again, it wouldn't be fair for me to hold on to money which I never really did earn.<br><br>So I'll just go down there on Thursday.... and I won't leave till I'm assured that a few heads will undergo rolling motion.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>Read my edited text in my earlier post.
