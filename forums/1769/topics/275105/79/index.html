Downloaders, meanwhile, have defended their actions, citing the poor quality of OdexÂ’s products, with pixelised images, poor audio dubbing and incomprehensible subtitles. The pirated copies of the titles are apparently superior, coming from foreign versions of the products, or where fans have substituted their own subtitles, a practice known as Â‘fansubsÂ’. Fans are furious at OdexÂ’s legal actions, as they claim it is a way for them to profit despite peddling substandard products. In a notorious instance, Odex apparently compelled a 9 year old to pay them damages of $2,000 in instalments. Meanwhile, the managing director of Odex has also been the subject of death threats.<br><br>This feud has now spilled over from the anime domain into the realm of womenÂ’s sanitary products.<br><br>According to Ms. Tamporn Maxipad, the regional agent for Kotex, Â“The online rage being directed against Odex is affecting the public perception of Kotex.Â”<br><br>Ms Maxipad explained that this was not only because of the similar-sounding names, but because many irate anime fans were calling Odex management Â“bloody chee byesÂ” in numerous online forums.<br><br>Â“As you know, bloody chee byes are KotexÂ’s core business,Â” said Ms Maxipad gravely. Â“We cannot allow this accidental link between OdexÂ’s poor image and our core business to affect KotexÂ’s brand reputation. Period.Â”<br><br>Ms Maxipad has filed a complaint about the Odex case with CASE, the consumer protection agency, and urged Odex to tend to its poor public image swiftly.<br><br>Currently, sales of Kotex have not been affected yet, but Ms Maxipad says that, Â“We have to staunch any potential flow in case we start bleeding profits and start going into the red.Â”<br><br>When contacted, a spokesman for Odex stated, Â“We want doÂ’nt to be peoples sueing but downloadingÂ’s can not. Else our sales going be downly. But trying best we to mess this settle</div>
