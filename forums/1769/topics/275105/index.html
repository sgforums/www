Based on the the reported compensation of between $3,000 and $5,000 per person, this would net Odex something between $9 million and $15 million.<br>.<br>Is this sum to compensate royalties, investigation costs or administration charges?<br>.<br>Is it also Odex's prerogative to impose a 10-per-cent interest rate on instalment arrangements for people Â— often minors Â— who cannot afford such payment?<br>.<br>Second, Odex is not the sole distributor of all Japanese animation in Singapore. Poh Kim and Blue Max also license popular series such as Bleach and Naruto respectively, while some titles remain completely unlicensed.<br>.<br>Unfortunately, there is no way for the average Internet user to know which series come under Odex. Its website is perennially under construction and the only unofficial list is one compiled by netizens on Wikipedia.<br>.<br>How can Singaporeans respect Odex's copyrights when they do not even know what Odex has rights over?<br>.<br>In addition, an extensive list of licensed Japanese animation can be found on the website of Anti-Video Piracy Association Singapore, or Avpas.<br>.<br>However, it appears from visits to local shops around Singapore that most of these series are simply not, if ever, released for sale.<br>.<br>A reasonable production time-lag is acceptable but when the wait is four years and counting, this business practice becomes rather dubious.<br>.<br>Lastly, Odex explained that it was compelled to take further action when rampant downloading persisted even after Odex sent letters to 17 illegal downloaders in May this year.<br>.<br>Does this mean that those who heeded the warning will not be penalised if they stopped promptly from May?<br>.<br>It is imperative that these issues are addressed if Singapore wishes to remain a clear, transparent and intellectual property-abiding nation.
