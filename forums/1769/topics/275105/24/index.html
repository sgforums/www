The problem then snowballs from there when other finance houses and investors get into the picture. why is that not considered a time bomb waiting to go off? Once people start defaulting on their loans then hong gan already.<br><br>Is it because they know the federal reserves/central bansk will bail them out?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here's the scoop... it's all to do with the money markets..<br><br>you know about banks buying each others' stuff... like say, i'm this el-crapo bank in the US and i keep lending these inbred rednecks who spend the money not on their home loan but on moonshine and lard...<br><br>i've got this huge account full of these ill-conceived loans.. so to keep from going under, i sell these things to another bank for, say.. 70% of the face value.. the other bank then assumes the risk..<br><br>everyone goes on an orgy of selling crap in the money market keeping the best performing (thus stable and profitable loans) accounts for themselves.. these instruments become part of everyone's portfolio..<br><br>so, when the &amp;$*# hits the fan, and one segment dies (in here, the sub-prime market).. that part of my portfolio just became worthless... my portfolio is now not worth as much.. people try to sell the stuff... others who have my instruments in their own portfolio will be in trouble too.. and their price drops..<br><br>it starts an ugly downward spiral where the rats start to leave the sinking ship.. and it affects the price of the company..<br><br>now companies require credit and liquidity to operate.. and if their net worth starts plummetting, banks (which are already in trouble) will start calling in the debt.. killing the companies as credit and liquidity dries up..<br><br>once the companies start dying, panic comes in and the other banks start to call in their debts, killing even more companies, which in turn will kill the banks.. which will kill the economy...<br><br>the central bank pumps liquidity into the system in order to stop this from happening..<br><br>all in all, it's simple.. the money markets, banking system, companies and corporates are run by people who will not hesitate to slit your throat in order to survive one more minute even if they know that their long-term survival is dependent on you...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by av98m:</div><div class="quote_body"><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_business/view/295355/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_business/view/295355/1/.html</a><br><br>OK, for those who are versed in economics and finance, can you please enlighten me as to WHY its a good thing for central banks to bail people out everytime the shit hits the fan?

            <div class='col-md body'>oh.. and why they keep making these loans or doing business with the inbred rednecks who will spend money for their medication on moonshine, is because short term profits pay off big and pay off now...<br><br>someone else will pick up the pieces because the thing will fall apart a couple of years later... after the banker has gotten his couple of million-dollar bonuses, his promotion to VP, his ferrari, his trophy wife and a penthouse for his mistress...</div>
