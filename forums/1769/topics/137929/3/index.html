            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey, mistyblue, like you, I live alone and rent the entire unit.  It costs a huge bomb and takes up a large portion of my income but I'd still rather live alone.  I had not-so-nice experiences living with others too.  Besides, I love the privacy and freedom of living alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>It's a monthly struggle ... but I would have it no other way.  </div></blockquote>Yeah man. I really got frustrated at the end and decided to rent out the entire unit.  I rather the struggle than to live with others.<br><br>With PRC, they are horrible, disgusting flatmates with their adulterous men and children in tow. With a 1st time M'sian girl, she wanted everything her way, to the entend of destroying furniture, dirty the common places and refused to clean up, have immigration issues, and very dishonest with a bad temper to boot. She destroyed my toilet fixture because she was angry. Hell I gave in till I could not and the landlady though I was making up stories till she had to deal with her directly.<br><br>The landlady wanted to make more money and kept reminind me that I made her waste money by renting 1 room and leaving the rest empty thus making her life difficult. Actually I am paying above market for that room. So she decided since the rest of the house is her although I still maintained everything, she made arrangements to produce dumplings for her to sell in my unit. She chalked up power/water bills - about 150 (when I moved in I footed 250 because the landlady never pay utilities for nearly 3 months - I don't like to live without utilities but the landlady never paid back).<br><br>I footed it cause she denied that making dumplings would use much water or electricity. Every night I had to clean up the oil, wash everything. It was also very near my exams when she did this. At then end, I had to scrub down the whole place as dumpling are very oily and the grime left over is so thick I had to use bleech. Later I had to set up roach traps, ants poison and spray down the place cause I got mossie attacks. So I thought, no matter what I do, I live under someone's roof. As long as these people do not get the money, they make the trouble for me. I am endlessly cleaning up and putting up with someone somehow or the other just so to "share" a unit. These peoplke think I need them and they lorded over me telling me, what I can or cannot do instead and what I should do to give way to them.<br><br>There is really no peace of mind as these people do not respect the place or work involved to ensure the environment is clean comfortable. Nor do they respect you as a co-tanent and inform you when they bring guests and these people strut around as if they entered a brothel or hotel. When I tell them off that I co-rent the place,  I get threatened verbally for fighting over my rights.<br><br>In truth, I am a very quiet and clean neighbour. Even this current neighbour  plays majong late and have babies crying or whatever. They almost know my daily schedule and know I am not the sort to bring bad things and influences to the house. They kinda appreciated it that I brought peace and consistency to the place.  I even wash their corridor for them and watch over everytime the landlady wanted to change the windows of toilet. Frankly, in everyone of my rentals, the landlady all cannot bear to let me go cause I am really no trouble to them and in fact left the place cleaner and better than they rented to me.<br><br>Hence I decided, I rather live alone and plan out the path towards a roof ownership. Best is that I can rent from HDB but I doubt HDB would ever allow that. Alternative is to search for a lower cost unit in future that is equally comfortable.  sg is quiet mecenary. Never met a good person.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For a single, you need to be 35 year old to buy a HDB flat... Alternatively, you can get a private apartment anytime, but only if you can afford it...<br><br>$600 to rent a whole unit is quite cheap! Although the living conditions are not exactly ideal... Perhaps you should snoop around for other places with similar rental cost... From the way you described it, you've got landlord and co-tenants from hell!</div>
