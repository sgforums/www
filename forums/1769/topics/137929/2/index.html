Not trying to sound like a smarty pants but I thought I detected a hint of sadness.<br><br>Perhaps don't zero in on marriage.  How about just having friends and then see where it takes you?  What I mean is don't take your lady friends as marriage prospect first lah.  Just enjoy the friendship and hopefully if time can blossom it into a relationship, then that's great, right?<br><br>I have a girlfriend in her early 50s and she is still single but has been attached for about close to 20 years.  But her Finnish b/f do not live with her.  They have separate homes but come together every now and then.  So, it's more like a companion type of relationship.  They enjoy doing things together, but yet enjoy their space.<br><br>The owner of my son's piano school is the same.  After a couple of failed marriages and a few failed r/s, he now resigns to just companionship.  For him, lagi "kay kou".  He wouldn't let his lady friends sleeps over.  Because  over here ah, if your partner live with you for over six months, can be considered common law wife/husband.  Entitled to half your assets, if break up.<br><br>Enjoy each day because it will become your history/past tomorrow.

There are pros and cons to both sides.<br><br>When you're living alone, there'll be times when you feel desolate and deserted and unloved and you'll feel like crying your heart out and yearn for companionship.<br><br>Then, when you get married or have someone else sharing your home, you'll start to grumble about how they do this and that wrong, how their living habits irk you, how you wish you had some alone time, how their music is too loud and yucky, etc etc.<br><br>Wanda made a good point when she said that we have to accept our situation and be content.  A lot of times in life, we find ourselves in situations that are less than ideal and we start to fret, get all flustered and start feeling miserable.  I guess what's important is to learn to be self-sufficient.  Learn to love your own company.  Even when you eventually get married, or even if you find a live-in companion, there will be moments when you're not alone anymore, but you feel lonely.  Even soul mates need time away from each other and there will be times when the soul feels lonely and desolate.<br><br>I do get hit bad at times by a desolate feeling, but I always tell myself that life swings like a pendulum, and that you just have to accept the good times with the bad.  Granted sometimes, it feels as if the pendulum has swung over to the 'bad' side and has become frozen in time there, suspended there, prolonging the bad times but, it always swings right back to the good side.<br><br>Just like that song in 'The Crow', 'It won't rain all the time'!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Hang in there!</div>

It costs a huge bomb and takes up a large portion of my income but I'd still rather live alone.  I had not-so-nice experiences living with others too.  Besides, I love the privacy and freedom of living alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>It's a monthly struggle ... but I would have it no other way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The perils of having a flatmate is that whether you want to or not, to one extent or another, proximity means everyone knows at least a little of each other's business. When you live this close, tolerance isn't a virtue, it is essential. Space it seemed exists only as something to be shared.<br><br>Looking for some ways to assuage the loneliness? You can be in a room filled with people and yet feel alone and lonely. If you decorate a simple room with a single chrysanthemum, it will concentrate the mind and consecrate the flower. It pulls you back to a simpler time when small pleasures were big and old sensations new.</div>
