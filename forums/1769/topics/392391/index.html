              <p>This topic is in the headlines today in The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Generally, I feel that if one is a good customer, the chances of one getting good service is greater.  Afterall, some customers can be rude and unreasonable and although service staff should be professional and take all these in their stride, they are afterall human, and lapses in quality can occur.</p>
              <p>However, what irritates me is when I go up to a counter and say "Hi!" and smile to the cashiers and there is almost always no response, no smile in return.  Sometimes, they look at me like I'm crazy.  I'm so used to this common courtesy over in Melbourne that it's a bit jarring in the beginning.  Yet, I still can't say that this is something I have grown used to here, neither do I think that it's something that we should get used to because a "Hi!" doesn't cost anything and it's really basic courtesy, acknowledging someone's presence and sending a greeting their way, before proceeding with the transaction. </p>
              <p>I still say "Hi!" and smile at the cashiers and counter staff but I no longer anticipate reciprocative courtesy.  That says a lot for the level of service here, especially through the eyes of foreigners from certain countries.</p>

              <p>Yeah!  You at least get a "Hi!".  Even in supermarts like Coles or budget department stores like K-Mart, you always get a "Hi!" and I find that if you just make a general comment about the day / weather / whatever, the staff feels happier.  The thing is,  you don't necessarily delay the transaction - it still takes the same amount of time to finish - but the difference is, the entire transaction can be done in dour silence with a sour face or it can be breezily completed with smiles and basic courtesy from both the customer and the staff. </p>
              <p>About crossing roads... I've noticed that these days, people cross the roads wayang-style... slow and as if they own the roads.  The pedestrians don't seem to bother if there are cars around or not and quite a few times my dad had to slow down to a crawl just to accommodate pedestrians who cross the road and take their time to 'gelek pantak' (shake their bums).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Kinda like human peacocks taking their own sweet time to cross their grandfathers' roads!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i have to disagree .. a lot of the coffee places, they are decent in their service not because of whether the staff are local or not ... more to that its their company's culture. Look at starbucks .. most of their outlets, their service staff are usually quite friendly and they greet u and wat not ..</p>

              <p>They are understaffed.  I won't expect staff working under pressure to provide good service.  I think management has to realise that if you're serious about good service, you cannot understaff the joints.</p>

              <p>I believe understaffing is one of the problems. The workers are overloaded at the expense of cutting cost. If such practices still carrys on, 10 years down the road, Singapore will be kicked out of the top 10 in many trades &amp; industries. By then all the productivity &amp; quality campaign by the WDA will be crap.</p>

              <p>I used to like That CD Shop because their staff used to be very friendly and cheerful.  I used to frequent them and even got their member card because I really loved that shop.</p>
              <p>I returned to the branch in Great World City twice and twice, even though I was served by different girls, they were uniformly unsmiling and unresponsive, even though I said "Hi!" to them.  I spent quite a lot there but it sure wasn't a happy experience.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p>Back home, I do acknowledge service staff (including bus drivers) who greet me. It's only the right thing to do to reply and not treat them as if they're invisible until you need them. However a lot of customers behave as if they're no different from the buzzer at the entrance.</p>
              <p>The service staff here in the US almost always greet you, ask how you are and sometimes inquire if everything's alright. I feel comfortable being frank with them but I usually have to put on a front with the "how are you doing" bit. Even if it was a rubbish day you feel compelled to somehow make it sound like it's going to get better.</p>
              <p>Polish and Finnish service standards varied widely depending on where I went. Misunderstandings happen, and both sides go away feeling worse off. Generally though they know what they're selling or doing thoroughly, and like the Americans let you taste and test things to a reasonable extent.</p>
              <p>In order for our service standards to improve, we need to pay them better and give them better working conditions. They should also have more autonomy when it comes to dealings with customers - they can't always be checking with superiors or sticking with rules. Unreasonable customers exist everywhere but the least that we can do is to treat them with more respect.</p>
