I find it rather deceiving as they try to make it look like it's a good deal but by the time you add up the taxes and service charge it's no longer a good deal.  Also, you can't estimate how much cash you need to have if you are planning to pay by cash  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> .<br><br>What do you think?
