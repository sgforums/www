It's a stereotype that people who hold such jobs are of a lesser breed. Perhaps they were unable to further their studies, are carrying on a family business or were unable to find better jobs.

What's the point of getting married if it means that you'll only be with each other when it's time to sleep?  That's not being a husband-and-wife, that's more like being bed partners only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>So, I'd try to avoid workaholics because I want a close relationship, and not just get married for the sake of getting married.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I like to be close-close and love deep-deep one!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Then again, if you married the man out of love, and he later became busy due to his career, which is in turn due to his motivation to provide a comfortable lifestyle for you and the kids, then you can't really blame him because he's working hard for his family.  In such cases, I'd just give him a nudge and say, 'Oi!  Time for a vacation!  Time for a date and some TMM!'.  It's always good to communicate openly, especially about each other's needs, instead of quietly harbouring resentment and silently seething in anger.</div>

And when I get married, my husband and I will both be cleaners when we clean our house together.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>OK, seriously, it depends on why he chose the job.  Is he a road sweeper cause he was a litterbug and is doing that whaddayacallit, some compulsory community service thingy?  Or, is he one because he is not suitable for other jobs due to a lack of education?  If it's the latter, then, was he uneducated due to poor family circumstances or due to laziness?<br>In my working life, I come across a lot of people from 'humble' or, as you say here, 'unglam' vocations and background and to be honest with you, career is no reflection of a person's moral character.  I've had a crush on a car mechanic once because he was a friendly, cheerful, simple and honest chap who was diligently taking night classes to upgrade himself.

And recently, I had to nurse a construction worker from China and when his wife and sis-in-law finally managed to raise the funds to fly themselves down from China, we found out that he's a great man who single-handedly provided for his wife, and her family, on top of his own parents.  I salute a man like that - a man of good moral character making a good honest living.<br></span><br></div></blockquote>I guess the first thing I look at would be whether there's good, open communication and good vibes and chemistry with the bloke, rather than his vocation.<br><br>Afterall, when your gaze first locked on each other, you might not even know each other's profession yet!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Besides, it's all a matter of perspective too!

This is absolutely ridiculous. Germs can be removed from bathing, and anyway, bacteria is everywhere around us.
