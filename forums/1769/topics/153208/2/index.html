Remember recently somebody posted this case on pregnant women being sacked from job.<br><br>Ok... fine.  People get sacked when they don't perform.  But it is natural that pregnant women tend to perform less and slower in their job due to the physical constraint.  So what does this mean?<br><br>Working women should not give birth at all?  I can't help, but to agree with that.<br><br>In some countries, pregnant workers are protected by labour law.  But it is not happening in Singapore.  We only see our govt pushing us to produce and multiply by giving us the "carrot".  Sorry lah.  I have done the calculation and the "carrot" is not attractive to me AT ALL.  I am a very practical and calculative person as far as the govt policy is concerned.<br><br>Govt is using so much money to give us that not-so-attractive-to-me carrot.  Why not use that money to please the companies instead?  This way, companies are happy.  They see no reason to sack the pregnant women.  Instead they will try every way to keep them in order to get the "baby bonus" from govt.  (If it is given to the company, maybe it should be renamed something else) .  On top of that, companies may even come up with their own "carrot" to encourage their married female staff to have kids.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore isn't the only country being affected by this trend. Many developed countries are also experiencing the same problem. Eg, Australia, Japan. There are many factors influencing this trend.<br><br>1. Standard of living. As things get more and more expensiv, parents cannot afford to have as many children as they like. Imagine the investment needed to raise a baby to a working adult. Trust me its not cheap.<br><br>2. Modernisation of times. As the cultural ideas and perception starts to change so does the way people do things. Women nowadays are very much career driven as their male counterparts and alot are opting to have children later. Alot later than their mothers. But unfortunately due to the biological aspect being unchanged it produced problems. As women gets older so does their chances of miscarriage or infertility. So therefore it lessens the chances of producing a healthier baby able to survive.<br><br>3. Conditions of enviroment. Mortality rates are also a factor. In countries where death is common and the norm, families have more children for the sake of survival. The more children the more possibility of survival. Number playing.<br><br>I am sure alot of other factors are invovled but I am too lazy to think of them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Haha.<br><br>Great One</div>

For eg.  when the family visits a loved one in hospital, very often, the parents do not care whilst their kids run up and down the hospital corridors, in and out of the rooms, being rowdy and running into people, generally making a nuisance of themselves.  They're running around like blind missiles and someday, some accident is going to happen when they run into a post-op patient or worse, an elderly post-op patient, walking along the corridor with a walking frame, doing his physio.<br><br>If they can't even control their children, PLEASE, for the sake of public safety, DO NOT have babies!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
