The grey population can also work longer into their old age, so as not to increase the burden on the shrinking younger population.<br><br>I believe that the main factor contributing to our lower birth rate is our preoccupation with work and career. Every couple wants to be a dual income family in order to afford that car or condo sooner, or to guard against a recession. Starting a family is not a priority. It is a trade-off that we make for our economic growth. Lazier societies in other countries have slower economic growth but higher birthrates.</div>

They are always on a constant fear that the investors and companies here will one day all move out of Singapore.  As it is, most of the MNC have already moved part of their sg operations to overseas like China, Philippines, India and Australia.<br><br>So to summarise what I have suggested:<br><br>two points:<br>1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pay the employers "baby bonus" in a way to reward them for keeping the pregnant workers or encourage them to encourage their female workers to produce and multiply. </span> The bonus has to be paid in instalments over a period of time (let's say one year) so that it will take a longer time for the employers to receive the full amount.  In the midst of the instalment, should the female staff be terminated or resign on their own, the payment will be stopped.  This will also indirectly encourage working mothers to continue working and contribute to the company or the society.<br><br>2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Govt to pay welfare to pregnant woman who can find jobs or lost their current job after they have been certified pregnant by the doctor.</span>  Women who are in between jobs will not want to make babies for fear that they will lose their job during probation period if they happen to be pregnant.  So they will postpone their baby making plan till they find a job.  When they land on a job, again, they will postpone the plan.  Why?  Cuz most employers will not like to see their new staff going on maternity leave or MC too often (to go for checkup) within the first 12 months of employment.  </div></blockquote>have you ever wonder how lesser people from countries can still afford to have so many children?<br><br>The problem doesnt lies with the government, but more on your willingness to sacrifice the 5 Cs for your children.<br><br></div>

I mean are they really top-notch when sg ppl have to stoop so low such as to cheat bus fares if they've got money to spare,I mean,would u go stealing chocolates in a 7-eleven outlet when u've got a million bucks in your nets account to foot that 'peanuts' worth of bill?answer is NO,also,our govt. gives us jobs redesigned and its wad?A sgporeans dream job supposedly?I mean why in the world are so many peeps voting our govt for asking us to fit into the mould of their gosh,'slavery'? oh yeah,I just wanna add that our parliament also has got White Man serving as MP,so indirectly saying that 'foreigners' also can be our MPs and heads of states wad,just look at US,ARNOLD SCHW...I dont know how to spell his whole name,pardon my ignorance<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
