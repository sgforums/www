            <div class='col-md body'>Often effective UV protection need not be expensive or laborious. Sometimes a change of lifestyle habits will do. Below are some common rules-of-thumb that you can adopt to reduce the harm caused by UV rays:<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>1</strong></span>. Avoid the sun between 10am to 4pm, when UV rays are at their strongest.<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>2</strong></span>.   Wear a broad-brimmed hat to shield your head, face and neck. Wear long-  sleeves, long pants and skirts to offer protection to your limbs.<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>3</strong></span>. Darker fabric colours offer better UV protection than lighter colours; tightly-woven fabric materials are a plus.<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>4</strong></span>. Wear sunglasses with effective UV protection. Note that darker glasses need not mean better protection. (In fact, by cutting down the amount of light reaching your eyes, your pupils dilate thereby increasing the potential for UV damage!)<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>5</strong></span>. When working in offices, stay away from windows. Research has shown ordinary dual-pane glass allows 62% of UV light to pass through.<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>6</strong></span>. It is a fallacy that staying underwater helps in avoiding UV rays. Water reflects an additional 5% of UV rays back at you.<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>7</strong></span>. Many people conscientiously apply sunscreen to their body, only to neglect areas such as the lips and hair. Use a lip gloss with SPF and a protective hair spray for maximum UV defence.<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>8</strong></span>. Use sunscreens with the appropriate SPF factor. For office use, a SPF 8 sunscreen may be adequate for a quick hop to lunch but if you have sensitive skin or works directly under the sun, a higher SPF is warranted.<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>9</strong></span>. Use waterproof sunscreen if you intend to swim. Note that toweling removes sunscreen from your skin. A second application may be required.<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><strong>10</strong></span>. Apply sunscreen 30 minutes prior to any activity. For sufficient coverage, apply sunscreen (measured in terms of S$1 coin-sized blob) to parts of your body as shown below:<br><img src="http://orb-z.com/image/applysize.gif"><br><br><strong>Melanoma Â– Skin Cancer by the Sun</strong><br>Melanoma is a very serious form of skin cancer. It is initiated in Â‘melanocytesÂ’ Â– cells that produce the substance melanin, giving our skin the tan colour. In men, melanoma is found most often on the area between the shoulder and hips and on the head and neck. In women, melanoma often develops in the legs. It affects all age groups and is one of the most common cancers among young adults. Melanoma is thought to be associated with prolonged exposure to the sun.<br><br>In the early stages, melanoma can often be cured. However, without early diagnosis and treatment, the cancerous cells may spread to other parts of the body, hence reducing the chances of recovery. Melanoma can appear as a new mole, or develop slowly in or near an existing mole. Spots on the skin that are changing size, shape and colour must be evaluated promptly. If in doubt, seek a medical opinion. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.melanoma.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.melanoma.com</a>.<br><br>In our next article, let us discuss about our prized follicles - our hair and the punishment it suffers from constant sun exposure.<br><br><strong>Sun Maven Tip for the Consumer:</strong><br>Using a tanning bed is akin to sunbathing in the Sahara desert. Studies have found the UV exposure in most cases to be even higher than that of the mid-summer sun. For those who wish to be bronzed without the ill effects, fake tanning is the answer. Fake tanning involves spraying a tan colouring onto the body. A professional beautician should be able to mimic a natural tan as though you have been frolicking in the Hawaiian sun.</div>
