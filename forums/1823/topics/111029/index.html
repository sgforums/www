I'm going to have a beer."<br><br>The wife said, "You want a beer, my love?" She opened the door to the refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer, brands from 12 different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.<br><br>The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could think of saying was, "Yes, lolly pop...but at the bar...you know...they have frozen glasses..."<br><br>He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by saying, "You want a frozen glass, puppy face?" She took a huge beer mug out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it.<br><br>The husband, looking a bit pale, said, "Yes, tootsie roll, but at the bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long, I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"<br><br>"You want hors d'oeuvres, poochi pooh?" She opened the oven and took out 5 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in blankets, mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.<br><br>"But my sweet honey... at the bar... you know... there's swearing, dirty words and all that..."<br><br>"You want dirty words, cutie pie?...<br><br>"LISTEN UP, DICKHEAD!

On the third tee, the wife slices her shot right through the large front window of the biggest house along the course. They walk up, knock on the door, and hear a voice say, "Come on in." Opening the door, they see glass everywhere and a broken bottle lying on the floor.<br><br>A man on the couch says, "Are you the people who broke my window?" The husband begins to apologize, but the man cuts him off. "Actually, I want to thank youÂ—IÂ’m a genie who was trapped in that bottle, and your wayward shot released me. IÂ’m allowed to grant three wishes, so what IÂ’d like to do is give each of you one wish, and IÂ’ll keep the last one for myself."<br><br>"Fantastic!" says the husband. "I want a million dollars a year for the rest of my life."<br><br>"No problem," says the genie, "itÂ’s the least I could do. And you, maÂ’am, what do you want?"<br><br>"I want a house in every country in the world," says the wife.<br><br>"Consider it done," the genie replies, turning back to the man. "And now for my wish. Because IÂ’ve been trapped in that bottle, I havenÂ’t had sex in a really long time. My wish is to sleep with your wife."<br><br>The husband takes a long look at his wife and says, "Well, we did get a lot of money and all those houses. If you donÂ’t mind, honey, I donÂ’t either."<br><br>The wife agrees, and the genie takes her upstairs, where he ravishes her for three hours. After heÂ’s through, the genie rolls over, looks at the wife, and asks, "How old is your husband, anyway?"<br><br>"Thirty-five," she replies.<br><br>"And he still believes in genies?"<br></div>
