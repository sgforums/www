            <div class='col-md body'>It was on 14 April 1912 that Britain's luxury liner Titanic struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic, sinking within hours. The ship carried too few lifeboats and only 705 of the 2207 people aboard survived. The terrible fate of the Titanic horrified people the world over, yet to some, including one of its victims, it was not entirely a surprise.<br><br>In 1892 English jounalise W.T. Stead had published a magazine story titled "From the Old World to the New", which described an ocean liner picking up survivors from an iceberg collision in the Atlantic Ocean, a disaster in which many lives were lost because insufficient lifeboats were on board. The fictitious captain's name was E.J. Smith -- the captain of the Titanic was also named E.J. Smith.<br><br>In a talk in 1909 Stead, a committed spiritualist, had attacked the Society for Psychical Research, comparing their methods to rescuers who, instead of throwing a drowning man a life preserver, demanded proof of his identity before saving him. Stead put himself into his example: "Who are you? What is your name?" "I and Stead! W.T. Stead! I am drowning here in the sea." Stead drowned in the Atlantic when the Titanic went down.<br><br>Morgan Robertson's 1898 novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Futility</span> also included the fatal encounter of an iceberg and a luxury liner -- this time, the Titan, in the month of April. Said to be unsinkable, the Titan did not carry enough lifeboats for all its passengers and crew. Robertson's Titan foreshadowed the Titanic in such details as its displacement, three propellers, two masts and passenger capacity of 3000. But it must be said that as a sailor and a shipping expert, Robertson was familiar with ships and collision with icebergs were not unknown.<br><br>Yet a number of people claimed to have premonitions of the Titanic's sinking. Author Stead himself received a letter from a clergyman who warned him not to board the ship. Colin Macdonald, assigned as the Titanic's second engineer, refused three times to sign on because of a hunch that something terrible would happen. Some would-be passengers, including banker J. Pierpoint Morgan, also decided not to travel. Psychic V.N. Turvey, on 10 April, predicted that a great liner would soon go down. And on the night of the disaster, an English boy named J.P.J. Chapman reportedly had a vision of the event as it occurred. The child recalled, "The small boats, the drowning people, the wreckage just faded away." In fact as in fiction, the great ship had gone to its destiny.<br><br>***end***</div>
