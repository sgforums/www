            <div class='col-md body'>This was seen on Ebay!!<br><br>"I don't have enough space here to tell the complete story behind this, so I will briefly go over it. Back in the early 1980's, while out metal detecting, I came across and old abandoned cemetery with the foundation of a homesite or Church or something nearby. While searching around the foundation, my detector indicated there was something in the ground close by the southwest corner of the foundation. After digging down about 2 feet my shovel struck a wooden box that had nearly rotted out. The metal hinges and hasp were about all that was left of it. I thought I had discovered a fortune! Boy, did that ever turn out to be wrong!! There were 2 jars and an old journal in the box. The jars had some strange writing and symbols on them. While getting the jars out of the ground, I dropped one and it broke. A black mist or something seeped out of it. I should have known something was wrong right then and covered the find back up but being young and foolish I didn't. I left the broken jar with what looked like a candle in it there where it fell and took the other one (see the pictures) and the old journal home. What I was able to read in the journal before the pages crumbled made the hair on the back of my neck stand up! That night, I had my first visit from what I can only describe as "The Black Thing". While lying in bed, this "thing" fell on me and it felt like I was being pushed down thru the bed and the floor, into a pit if you will! I struggled with it and managed to somehow escape its clutches. Since that time, I have been attacked twice more and both times the unopened jar was in the close vicinity. I and others have caught fleeting glimpses of a black shadowy thing out of the corners of our eyes as it would pass from one room to another. I finally talked to someone who is versed in these things and was told that the only way to rid myself of this thing was to pass the unopened jar on to someone else. Therefore, I am offering to you, if you dare, the "Ghost in the Jar". With it I am sure you will be getting the "Black Thing" also. If you are brave enough to want this, bid to your hearts desire! I am going to start the bidding at 99.00 and put a rather high reserve on it so only those with a real desire and want to will be able to purchase it! What you will recieve for your money is the jar pictured along with some of the original black and white photos depicted here and others. You will also recieve a complete written version of everything from the original finding of the jars and to the best of my recollection what was contained in the old journal. I will also tell you what I was able to find out about this from the person who told me to pass it on. Be advised that once you buy this it is yours and I will have nothing ever again to do with it! ALL SALES ARE FINAL! You must contact me within 24 hours of the close of the sale to make payment arrangements and to arrange for delivery which the buyer is liable for. This can NOT be shipped thru the Post Office. Either UPS or pay me to deliver it! Payment must be made within 7 days of the close of the auction. P.S. As to the photos running with this, please note the one with the what looks like figures in them at the cemetery. I discovered this after turning them in to be processed. I WAS ALONE AT THE CEMETERY THAT DAY! This too will be gone over in the written "Diary" which comes with the purchase. Remember, DON'T bid unless you are seriously wanting to own this as I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE THE TRANSACTION IS COMPLETE!<br><br>Due to the high amount of emails I've recieved concerning this item, I am going to try to answer some of your questions here. Number 1, No this is NOT a hoax, it is real. Yes, I have tried re-burying it but it did not work, it only made "The Black Thing" more active until I dug it back up. Yes, I COULD either give it away or sell it for a buck or two....I've had many opportunities over the years to do that very thing with friends or acquaintices. But, as I said, I want this thing to go to someone with either a knowledge of these things or to someone who is into the occult or whatever who might be able to control it or have some knowledge of what to do with it or do something with it! NOT someone who just wants to play at it! I feel that the best way to do this is to set a very high reserve so only someone SERIOUS about it can "OWN" it. As far as more of the story, the winning bidder will get the entire story, all the details including encounters others besides myself have had with it and what was told me about it and what to do to get rid of it! Some of you have emailed claiming to know what it is and some have called it an evil spirit, some a poltergeist, etc. I don't care what it is, I just want RID of it! Some of your emails I will try to answer personnally as soon as I have the time. Thanks for looking.<br><br><img src="http://ebay0.ipixmedia.com/abc/M28/_EBAY_63ecc43c540c6065ab34616d2d1f8aa7/i-1_B_L.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://ebay0.ipixmedia.com/abc/M28/_EBAY_63ecc43c540c6065ab34616d2d1f8aa7/i-2_B_L.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://ebay0.ipixmedia.com/abc/M28/_EBAY_63ecc43c540c6065ab34616d2d1f8aa7/i-3_B_L.JPG"><br><br>Current bid: US $90,000,100.0"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Thanks to The Bear for providing the info... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

This state of the art device detects all paranormal activity. It's easy to use, and the concept is quite simple. It can be put on whatever it is detecting or placed in a suspicious room. In 24 hours, if there is a ghost within 2 feet or so, the reaction will turn the test area an orange color, if not it will stay the same.  I have been doing research in the occult for several years and this is guaranteed to work. I don't know why anyone wouldn't have thought of it already.  You've all probably seen the ghost in a jar, well he can use this to confirm even further that the ghost actually is in the jar.  There is allot of material and proof describing how this works online, I've just made in into a convenient test strip.  Good luck bidding, and if you have any questions just contact me at psytekusa@hotmail.com"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
