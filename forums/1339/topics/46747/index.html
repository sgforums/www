            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted off SPI....pls share your views<br><br>"I'm a NSman who's camp is at Seletar East. Recently I went for my first ICT. We were given bunks in the block next to Blk 445 (I guess its Blk 446?). Our bunks were on the third floor. Upon arrival the first thing I wondered was why 2 or 3 bunks had their doors &amp; windows shut &amp; there were masking tape stuck on the doors in a "X" fashion. Some of those "X"s has words like "No entry" scribbled in ink. Judging from the faded ink, I'd guess those "X"s were there for quite some time. My first impression was that probably those bunks has faulty furniture or something. I peeked into the windows (they had louvered window panes) but it seemed like a normal bunk.<br><br>We only stayed in for one night but there were several nights when we had to stay back till quite late due to training. Each time I passed those bunks I found myself staring at them wondering why the "X"s were there. Suddenly it occurred to me that maybe those bunks were "dirty". That was scary 'cos our bunk was right beside it. I wanted to ask the "old bird" NSmen but decided not to. I figured that if they ended up telling me some spook tale, I'd probably run off &amp; get charged for AWOL!<br><br>Just wondering if anyone know about the bunks with the "X"s or has heard anything about them?"<br><br>I was also briefly in Seletar Camp...I heard that those bunks were used to house the former trainees from the Supply and Driving Schools...and my instructor there has also told me that people have seen and heard many "things" there...<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/spi/forum/038/DSCF0009_th.jpg"></div>
