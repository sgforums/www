            <div class='col-md body'>AHMEDABAD: The Shah family here got the opportunity of a lifetime to relive the big screen experience - only it wasn't some romantic fantasy but the worst horror film come to life as blood started oozing from the floor of their flat.<br><br>Police in Gujarat's principal city said in all probability the blood appeared to be human. The nightmare, that started on Wednesday morning, is still to be over for the Shah family, which finds itself surrounded by curious crowds after local papers reported the bizarre incident.<br><br>The family is seriously considering moving out of their home in Arvind Park Society in Maninagar, east Ahmedabad.<br><br>"I don't know how and why it happened. We are intrigued and terrified. What we have been watching in horror films is what we are witnessing," Hiralal Jethalal Shah told IANS on Thursday.<br><br>It all started at 7.45 a.m. on Wednesday when Shah was getting ready to leave home. He took his shirt off the hanger and found it stained with blood.<br><br>He alerted the other family members.<br><br>Shellshocked, the family followed the stains to the bathroom to find that blood was seeping through the cracks in the floor.<br><br>According to the Shah family, comprising 15 members, the blood continued to ooze for half an hour.<br><br>When the petrified family controlled itself somewhat, it reported the matter to the local police station.<br><br>On examination, police said it appeared to be human blood.<br><br>A Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team had visited the house and collected blood samples.<br><br>"Though the blood appears to be that of a human being, we have to carry out some more examinations before coming to any conclusion. This will take up to two days," said a FSL official.<br><br>Meanwhile, police officials called in labourers to dig the floor to arrive at the root of the mystery.<br><br>"We did not find any blood as we dug into the floor. It seemed the blood was there on the surface of the floor and not oozing from beneath," said an investigating officer.<br><br>But the family feels well and truly spooked.<br><br>"We have lived in this house for 35 years but this kind of incident or anything abnormal has happened for the first time," said Sanjay Shah.<br><br>Their home became a local tourist attraction as huge crowds gathered after reading about the extraordinary incident in local papers.<br><br>"It must be witchcraft or voodoo," commented somebody in the crowd.<br><br>"This house is haunted. It is karma, maybe something to do with deeds in the previous birth," said another.<br><br>The mystery continues until the police solve it.</div>
