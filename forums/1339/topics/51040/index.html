            <div class='col-md body'>BUT SORRY TO DISAPPOINT U ANTI_COCA-COLA PEEPS<br><br>Claim:   Coca-Cola's script logo was designed to reveal anti-Islamic messages in its mirror image.<br><br>Status:   False.<br><br>Origins:   No one is quite sure how this rumor got started, but many in the Middle East are now turning the Coca-Cola logo towards a mirror to examine it for anti-Islamic statements. According to the current bit of misinformation being touted as truth, the backwards script reads: "No to Mohammed, No to Mecca."<br><br>Although a backwards, fuzzy image of the Coca-Cola script logo does vaguely resemble some phrases in Arabic script, there's nothing to the claim that this phenomenon is the result of intentional design. As mentioned elsewhere in our collection of Cokelore, the elegantly-written "Coca-Cola" trademark was invented by Frank Mason Robinson in 1886 when he wrote the first label in flowing Spencerian script. Robinson was a partner with pharmacist John Pemberton (who made the first syrup), and it was also Robinson who gave the beverage its name.<br>It's ludicrous to imagine far back in 1886 a back-room chemist and his partner were evilly plotted to work a hidden anti-Muslim statement into a soft drink label. Those early Coke men had no reason to suppose that their concoction would someday come to be marketed internationally, in far-flung lands they'd never themselves visit, or that the dashed-off script of one of them would continue to adorn the product more than a century after it was first penned. Yet to give the rumor any credence, one has to believe all of that.<br><br>In May 2000, the Grand Mufti Sheik Nasser Farid Wassel, EgyptÂ’s most senior religious figure, gave his opinion on the matter. The artwork was also closely scrutinized by researchers and linguists at the IftaÂ’a Institute, a scholarly authority on Islamic law. All found no harm.<br><br>"The trademark does not injure Islam or Muslims directly or indirectly," the mufti ruled. In an official statement, he found that "the trademark was designed 114 years ago in the state of Georgia and was written in a foreign language, not in Arabic," and that "no one had objected until now."<br><br>Coca-Cola officials believe the lie started on the Internet. However it began, leaflets calling for a boycott of the U.S. on the basis of the rumor's premise have been distributed in schools and mosques in various regions of Egypt. In early 2000, the rumor was afoot in Saudi Arabia.<br><br>Such rumors are horribly damaging to any company they attach to, with Coca-Cola being no exception. In Egypt, a country where Coca-Cola is said to hold a 54% share of the soft drink market, Big Red has seen sales drop 10 to 15%. The company employs more than 10,000 workers in Egypt, and plummeting product sales over this lie mean those jobs are now at risk.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MORE COKE-LORES FOR U!!!!<br><br>Claim:   Coca-Cola used to contain cocaine.<br><br>Status:   True.<br><br>Origins:   Coca-Cola was named back in 1885 for its two "medicinal" ingredients: extract of coca leaves and kola nuts. Just how much cocaine was originally in the formulation is hard to determine, but the drink undeniably contained some cocaine in its early days. Frederick Allen describes the public attitude towards cocaine that existed as Coca-Cola's developers worked on perfecting their formula in 1891:<br>The first stirrings of a national debate had begun over the negative aspects of cocaine, and manufacturers were growing defensive over charges that use of their products might lead to "cocainism" or the "cocaine habit". The full-throated fury against cocaine was still a few years off, and Candler and Robinson were anxious to continue promoting the supposed benefits of the coca leaf, but there was no reason to risk putting more than a tiny bit of coca extract in their syrup. They cut the amount to a mere trace.<br>Allen also explains that cocaine continued to be an ingredient in the syrup in order to protect the trade name "Coca-Cola":<br>But neither could Candler take the simple step of eliminating the fluid extract of coca leaves from the formula. Candler believed that his product's name had to be descriptive, and that he must have at least some by-product of the coca leaf in the syrup (along with some kola) to protect his right to the name Coca-Cola. Protecting the name was critical. Candler had no patent on the syrup itself. Anyone could make an imitation. But no one could put the label "Coca-Cola" on an imitation so long as Candler owned the name. The name was the thing of real value, and the registered trademark was its only safeguard. Coca leaves had to stay in the syrup.<br>How much cocaine was in that "mere trace" is impossible to say, but we do know that by 1902 it was as little as 1/400 of a grain of cocaine per ounce of syrup. Coca-Cola didn't become completely cocaine-free until 1929, but there scarcely any of the drug left in the drink by then:<br>By Heath's calculation, the amount of ecgonine [an alkaloid in the coca leaf that could be synthesized to create cocaine] was infinitesimal: no more than one part in 50 million. In an entire year's supply of 25-odd million gallons of Coca-Cola syrup, Heath figured, there might be six-hundredths of an ounce of cocaine.<br>So,  yes, at one time there was cocaine in Coca-Cola. But before you're tempted to run off claiming Coca-Cola turned generations of drinkers into dope addicts, consider the following: back in 1885 it was far from uncommon to use cocaine in patent medicines (which is what Coca-Cola was originally marketed as) and other medical potions. When it first became general knowledge that cocaine could be harmful, the backroom chemists who comprised Coca-Cola at the time (long before it became the huge company we now know) did everything they could with the technology they had available at the time to remove every trace of cocaine from the beverage. What was left behind (until the technology improved enough for it all to be removed) wasn't enough to give a fly a buzz...<br><img src="http://snopes.com/cokelore/graphics/cocaine.gif"><br><br>WHY DID THEY HAD TO TAKE IT OUT?????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Claim:   When tipped on its side, Coca-Cola's distinctive script logo shows a figure snorting a line of cocaine, and this image was deliberately placed there by the artist as a sly reference to the product's containing cocaine.<br><br>Status:   False.<br><br>Origins:   Anything tipped on its side or viewed by hanging upside down like a bat can eventually appear to  look like something other than what it is. Sailing ships and romping kittens are routinely seen in clouds that scud by, but these sights are attributed to the active imaginations of the cloud-watchers, not laid at the feet of a mythical artist who deliberately hid them there. The same should be said of images "found" on product labels -- they say more about the imagination of the viewer than they do about what the company put there. Yet mistrust of corporations runs so high that the reasonable explanation of "I'm just seeing that" is quickly brushed aside in favor of the "I found the secret message!" one.<br><br>Coca-Cola's distinctive script logo was created by Frank Mason Robinson in 1886 when he wrote the first Coca-Cola label in flowing Spencerian script. Robinson was a partner with pharmacist John Pemberton (who made the first Coca-Cola syrup), and it was Robinson who gave the beverage its name. Robinson created the logo in 1886, at a time when cocaine was readily available in all manner of over-the-counter products. Unlike these days, however, when we think of cocaine as coming in the form of a fine, white powder that has to be snorted through a $100 bill, consumers of the 1880s knew the drug as a liquid. No one snorted cocaine in those days; they drank it. The idea that an artist would in 1886 incorporate into the logo a visual representation of a drug behavior that didn't then exist is a bit much to swallow.<br><img src="http://snopes.com/cokelore/graphics/snort.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Claim:   A tooth left in a glass of Coca-Cola will dissolve overnight.<br><br>Status:   False.<br><br>Origins:   I don't know of anyone who hasn't heard the rumor that too much Coca-Cola rots your innards, and the proof of this can be determined by dropping a baby tooth into a glass of it, then going back the next morning to find most of it eaten away. If Coca-Cola can dissolve a tooth overnight, imagine what it must be doing to your teeth, not to mention your stomach and digestive tract!<br><br>All such claims ignore a few salient points:<br><br>Coca-Cola  will not dissolve a tooth (or a nail, or a penny, or a piece of meat) overnight. Anyone who says it does hasn't actually tried such an experiment.<br><br>Coca-Cola contains acids (such as citric acid and phosphoric acid) which will eventually dissolve items such as teeth (given enough time), but so do plenty of other substances we commonly ingest (such as orange juice). The concentration of acid in these products is so low that our digestive systems are easily capable of coping with it with no harm to us.<br><br>The idea that any substance which can dissolve teeth must therefore damage our teeth if we drink it is nonsensical. We don't hold drinks in our mouths for days at a time -- any liquids we drink simply wash over our teeth very briefly, and our teeth are further protected by their enamel coating and the ameliorating effects of saliva.<br>Vince Staten describes the legendary version of this tale:<br>Perhaps you've heard the story. It goes something like this: At Harvard they left a fly in a Coke overnight and the next morning, the fly had been completely dissolved. The name of the university changes and so does the item to be soaked overnight, but the result is always the same: Coke eats it. The lesson is that if it does that to a fly, just think of what it does to your stomach.<br><br>To test this theory I swatted two flies: a test fly and a control fly. I put the test fly in a cup of Coke and let it soak for twenty-four hours. I put the control fly in a cup of Roto-Rooter drain cleaner and let it soak an equal length of time.<br><br>When I returned to the Coke fly the next day, I discovered, to my surprise, the fly floating around, unscathed. The Roto-Rooter fly, on the other hand, was dissolved down to a couple of tiny fly bits. The Roto-Rooter had also eaten through the bottom of the plastic cup.<br>Frederick Allen discusses the origins of this rumor in his book on Coca-Cola:<br>In the fall of 1950, a Cornell University professor named Clive M. McCay testified before a select committee in the U.S. House of Representatives that the sugar in Coke caused cavities. And, he said, the phosphoric acid was a dangerous additive. Giving a vivid account that instantly became part of the national folklore, Dr. McCay described how a tooth left in a glass of Coca-Cola would soften and begin to dissolve in a period of two days.<br><br>Coca-Cola's top chemist, Orville May, explained to Hobbs [then president of Coca-Cola] and the company's other executives that anything containing sugar and phosphoric acid -- fresh orange juice, for example -- would dissolve teeth over a period of time. The point was people did not hold food and beverages in their mouths for days on end. They swallowed, and their saliva washed away the sugar and acid before lasting damage was done. Otherwise the whole country would be toothless.<br>Mark Pendergrast tackles the same subject:<br>McCay made headlines with his allegations that Coke would eat away the marble steps of the Capitol Building and soften teeth placed in a glass of the beverage. "The molar teeth of rats were dissolved down to the gum line," McCay told the politicians, when "given nothing to drink except cola beverages for a period of six months."<br><br>In response, Coca-Cola's head chemist, Orville May, testified that McCay offered a "distorted picture" intended to frighten unsuspecting consumers. May pointed out that the .055 percent level of phosphoric acid was far below the 1.09 percent acid content of an orange and that McCay's studies ignored the neutralizing effect of saliva. Finally, he noted that orange juice or lemonade would also dissolve ten-penny nails and eat holes in the Capitol steps.<br>We have to agree with Vince Staten's conclusion:<br>I think there are two lessons here: Don't believe all those Coke stories you hear. And don't, for any reason, let a fly drink Roto-Rooter.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Claim:   The acids in Coca-Cola not only make it a handy household cleaning product, but harmful to drink as well.<br><br>Status:   False.<br><br>Example:   [Collected on the Internet, 2001]<br><br>1. In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.<br><br>2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days.<br><br>3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl . . . Let the "real thing" sit for one hour, then flush clean.<br><br>4. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china.<br><br>5. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.<br><br>6. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.<br><br>7. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes.<br><br>8. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan;rap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy.<br><br>9. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze fromyour windshield.<br><br>FYI:<br><br>1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days.<br><br>2. To carry Coca Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly Corrosive materials.<br><br>3. The distributors of coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years! Drink up! No joke. Think what coke and other soft drinks do to your teeth on a daily basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of coke in 24-48 hours<br><br>Origins:   Many of the entries above are just simple household tips involving Coca-Cola. That you can cook and clean with Coke is relatively meaningless from a safety standpoint -- you can use a wide array of common household substances (including water) for the same purposes; that doesn't necessarily make them dangerous. The fact is that all carbonated soft drinks contain carbonic acid, which is moderately useful for tasks such as removing stains and dissolving rust deposits (although plain soda water is much better for such purposes than Coca-Cola or other soft drinks, as it doesn't leave a sticky sugar residue behind). Carbonic acid is relatively weak, however, and people have been drinking carbonated water for many years with no detrimental effects.<br><br>The rest of the claims offered here are, in a word, stupid. Coca-Cola does contain small amounts of citric acid (from the orange, lemon, and lime oils in its formula) and phosphoric acid. However, all the insinuations about the dangers these acids might pose to people who drink Coca-Cola ignore a simple concept familiar to any first-year chemistry student: concentration. Coca-Cola contains less citric acid than orange juice does, and the concentration of phosphoric acid in Coke is far too small (a mere 11 to 13 grams per gallon of syrup, or about 0.20 to 0.30 per cent of the total formula) to cause harm. The only people who proffer the ridiculous statements that Coca-Cola will dissolve a steak, a tooth, or a nail in a day or two are people who have never actually tried any of these things, because they just don't happen. (Anyone who conducts these experiments will find himself at the end of two days with a whole tooth, a whole nail, and one very soggy t-bone.)<br><br>The next time you're stopped by a highway patrolman, try asking him if he's ever cleaned blood stains off a highway with Coca-Cola. If you're lucky, by the time he stops laughing he'll have forgotten about the citation he was going to give you.<br></div>
