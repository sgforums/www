              authentic, if occasionally crack-brained, suggestions for how we might go about 
              opening a dialogue with an alien civilization.<br><br></div>
              <div class="storybody">During the last few decades, the search for life beyond our 
              planet has focused almost exclusively on trying to find a signal in space from 
              an intelligent civilization. Such searches are becoming increasingly 
              sophisticated.<br><br>The SETI Institute, the world's best-known organization 
              dedicated to the search for alien life, recently unveiled plans to scan a 
              million stars over 10 billion communication channels at its Hat Creek radio 
              telescope facility north of Sacramento.<br><br>Now, the private Bay Area 
              organization has launched a companion project called Earth Speaks that asks 
              space enthusiasts around the world to think about what we should say when, or 
              if, we finally get that cosmic phone call.<br><br>"Most conversations about this 
              subject until now have been among academics," said Douglas Vakoch, who is 
              heading up the new effort at SETI, which stands for the Search for 
              Extraterrestrial Intelligence. "We want to really expand the 
              discussion."<br><br>Center director Jill Tarter, a lifelong alien hunter on whom 
              the Ellie Arroway character from the movie "Contact" was based, said there is no 
              simple answer. But it is vital, she said, that there be a global consensus on 
              what we say and do before it happens.<br><br>Based on the first few hundred 
              suggestions collected by the <a href="http://earthspeaks.seti.org/">Earth Speaks 
              website</a>, that consensus might be elusive. So far, the messages break down 
              into a few distinct categories. Some people want to throw a block party to 
              welcome the aliens to the neighborhood. Others, less trusting, would warn the 
              aliens that we've got guns and know how to use them.<br><br>Another group, 
              possibly influenced by having seen too many movies, would have us hide under the 
              bed until they go away. "If we discover intelligent life beyond Earth, we should 
              not reply -- we should freeze and play dead," wrote one 
              contributor.<br><br>There is a fourth category of people who refuse to take the 
              whole idea seriously. One tongue-in-cheek writer suggests we broadcast, "There's 
              nothing to see here. Move along."<br><br>SETI has no plans to actually send the 
              messages into space. Vakoch said that before anything like that is undertaken, 
              it should be subject to international discussion.<br><br>The first serious 
              effort to contact intelligent life outside Earth was made in 1974, using the big 
              radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. The three-minute transmission by a 
              group at Cornell University attempted to describe Earth and its inhabitants in 
              binary code.<br><br>Over the last few years, a Russian group has sent greetings 
              in Russian and English to targeted stars in our galactic neighborhood, 
              generating a major dust-up in the small but passionate SETI community. Critics 
              say the Russians are acting out of turn, without asking permission to open what 
              would amount to diplomatic relations with another civilization. The problem is 
              that nobody has the authority to grant permission.<br><br>Some observers say 
              there is no need for us to broadcast a message. We're already doing that in the 
              form of leakage into space of our radio and television signals. Those signals, 
              however, are much too weak to travel far. A coordinated communications effort 
              would require a powerful transmitter, a highly focused beam and a receiver 
              pointed in the right direction.<br><br>Tarter acknowledged that there is plenty 
              of reason to be cautious about replying to an alien signal.<br><br>"We're in an 
              asymmetric position," she said. "We don't know if there are other civilizations 
              out there, but if there are, we can be pretty sure we are the youngest." And, 
              therefore, the most vulnerable.<br><br>Earthlings have had the technology to 
              broadcast and receive electromagnetic waves for about a century. But the galaxy 
              has been around for billions of years.<br><br>Any civilization that contacts us 
              is likely to be much older.<br><br>"As the new kids on the block, we should 
              listen first" and reply later, Tarter said.<br></div>
