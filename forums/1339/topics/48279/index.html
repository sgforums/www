            <div class='col-md body'>"The lady in the color photo(below) is my Granny. She lived on her own until age 94, when her mind started to weaken and had to be moved to an assisted living home for her own safety. Naturally, she had difficulty with the move, and it was a strain on the whole family, particularly the first week. At the end of the first week, there was a picnic for the residents and their families. My mother and sister attended. They commented that Granny surprisingly had a very good day, especially after the terrible week she had, and saying that she would not go the picnic. My sister took two pictures that day, and this is one of them. It was taken on Sun. 8/17/97, and we think the man behind her is my Grandpa who passed away Sun. 8/14/84. We did not notice the man in the picture until Christmas Day, 2000 (Granny had since passed away 4/5/00), while browsing through some loose family photos at my parents' house. My sister thought it was such a nice picture of Granny, and so pleased that she had a good day that day, that she even made a copy for mom, but still, nobody noticed the man behind her for over three years! When I arrived at my parents' house that Christmas day, my sister handed me the picture and said, "Who do you think this man behind Granny looks like?" It took a few seconds (it seemed longer) for it to sink in. I was absolutely speechless. I sent along the black and white photos to show that it really looks like him. Could this be the reason that Granny had a good day - because Grandpa was looking over her? We are thinking that for the head and shoulder of this man to be this small in the picture, that he would have to be about 8 or 10 feet tall to even be visible directly behind Granny. I was also looking for the man's left leg to possibly be visible, but I don't see it.<br><br><img src="http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/granny_lg.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/granny2_lg.jpg"><br><br>There's also a little side story: Some weeks after this discovery, a cousin who had heard about the picture, asked me to email it to his office so he and his co-workers could look at it. As they were looking at it, they called me and said, "Did you see the face in the bushes?" I said, "No." They said, "Look above the red van. There is a face with kind of a shroud around it, looking at the man." Then I saw it, threw the snapshot down on the table and hurried away from it, 'cause now I was really freaked. We've been knocking this around for a couple years now, show it to co-workers, but have never really found anyone with experience in this field to bounce it off of."<br></div>
