            <div class='col-md body'>About being possessed....<br><br>I almost missed out this story.  I shall not use the real names of the staff.  Instead, I will use the following names:<br><br>Supervisor - Subramanian<br>Staff 1 (the one who kenna possessed) - Krishnan<br>Staff 2 - Ahmad<br><br>I was having lunch with Subramanian one day and he told us this incident.<br>Krishnan prayed to a tree next to an enclosure (I think it's tiger enclosure) to get a 4 D number.  Soon he struck with the number he got from the tree spirit.  But he forgot to thank the spirit.<br><br>For the following few days, he was speaking in chinese dialect (probably hokkien).  All the staff couldn't catch what he was saying cuz they were all Indians.  Then Ahmad went to report this to Subramanian.  Subramanian didn't believe and so he went to check on Krishnan.  He talked to Krishnan "Hey, are you ok?"  And Krishnan replied in chinese dialect again.  Nobody knew what to do with him.  After some days, Krishnan's father brought Krishnan to the tree with some incense and fruits.  Together they prayed to the tree to thank the tree for the lottery numbers.  After the short prayer, Krishnan got up, and said in Tamil "Ok Dad.  Let's go home now".<br><br>This was not the first story on Tree spirit in the zoo.  Another one that I heard before this one goes like this...<br><br>The first Chairman and Founder of the zoo Dr Ong passed away.  When he was around, he has loved the zoo so much that during his last days, his wife brought him on a wheelchair to walk around the zoo.  After he passed away, his wife bury his ash under one of the tree, near the reservoir and garden in the zoo.  One zoo keeper went to pray to the tree and got the lucky numbers to buy lottery.  As he has a lot of faith in Dr Ong's spirit, he placed a big bet on the 4D and managed to win a big sum of money when he struck the first prize.  After that, he quit the job and never had to work there again.</div>
