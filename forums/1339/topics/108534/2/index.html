That year, I think they have some halloween party.<br><br>Not sure what time the party ended that night.  But about two or more hours after it ended, a security officer doing graveyard shift at the zoo gate saw a man inside the zoo, near the entrance, tram station and the gift shop.  The location was quite near to the entrance, so the staff could see the man.<br><br>The man was squatting down next to a pillar shivering.  He walked near him and saw that the man had scars on his face.  He thought he was one of the halloween party participants.  He told him politely that the party was over and he had to leave the place.  The man got up and the staff walked him out of the zoo.  As the staff was walking with the man, he noticed something was not right.  The man was walking without having his feet touch the ground.  Basically the man was floating.  The staff remained calm and pointed out to the way to the bus stop.  The man just continued "walking" towards the bus stop.  The staff quickly turned around and walked back to his work station without turning back to see the man.</div>
