            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">One security officer once told me what happened during his graveyard shift at Night Safari....<br><br>The old amphitheatre used to be right behind the reception counter, which was where he would station after 12 midnight.  At about 1.30 am, he heard applause and cheering coming from the amphitheatre and he was sure there was nobody there.<br><br>More story to come....  stay tuned.  </div></blockquote>hmm my dad knows a few of the zoo keepers, but dunno if they r still there. His company was the one who did the ISO acredition for zoo n nite safari, so he got to know some of them, but i think those he knew from that those times r more or less gone. We got a special invite to the opening ceremony of the new show in the new ampitheatre inside the nite safari itself, and most of the staff had been replaced. otherwise can go check with them</div>
