            <div class='col-md body'>Felt very bo liao today..<br><br>so I went with 3 other frens to the WW2 underground bunker at Malta Cresent for some exploration.<br><br>Reached there at around 1045hrs...the sun was shining brightly and it was scorching hot...<br><br>Anyway this was the first time my friends have seen the bunker,while I have driven past there but never entered the bunker before. BTW this place is very near to Sembawang Park...<br><br>It was a hill-like structure and there were two chimney-like structure jutting out of the ground. We peered into the one on the left. The bunker was quite deep and there was lots of rubbish and debris on the bunker floor. Then we proceeded to the other chimney-like structure, which was like 20 to 30 metres away. There was a staircase leading down!<br><br>Anyway, being bo liao and curious, we climbed down the staircase. It was made of metal and quite rusty liao. I was the third guy to climb down. The granite slab which the top part of the staircase ws attached to was a bit broken liao. In addidtion to that, the first two steps were also quite badly corroded liao. So climbing down was quite difficult loh. My fren who leaned back while climbing down nearly fell down as the garnite slab shifted a bit under his weight.<br><br>Anyway, we all got down and looked around. The bunker was pitch dark and about 2 metres wide. My fren switched on his torch and led the way. The walls of the bunker was quite clean and new in a way....no graffiti and inverted pentagrams here, although we were expecting to find one. Roots and weeds were growing from the ceiling and walls. The floor was littered with cigarette butts. Obviously we were not the first ones here loh. The bunker was quite small actually. Lots of cobwebs on the walls and ceiling too.<br><br>We walked straight until we reached a wall, turned left and saw a small opening. If you were looking from the outside, you can also see this opening. However, if you look inside it looks very dark. We deduced that this was actually a air vent or a machine gun turret. Reaching the turet, we had to turn right again. At the end of the bunker was a stream of light from above. This was the other chimney-like structure we saw earlier.<br><br>The funny thing was from the outside the bunker looked so long and large,but when we were inside the bunker was like, so small. Contented that now we knew how the inside of the bunker looked like, we retracted our steps back to the first entrance and climbed back up the staircase.<br><br>Upon reaching outside, we all agreed that although there was nothing inside the bunker, we felt that the "Ying1 Qi4" was very strong. My friend then pointed out to me that there was a scratch on my left elbow. It was bleeding.<br><br>I hope that I grazed my elbow on the jagged granite slab while climbing out and was not cut by "something else"...<br><br>Anyway we were all contented and proud to announce that there are no ghosts or secret chambers inside...or least we didn't see any. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
