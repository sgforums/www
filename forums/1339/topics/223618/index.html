            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by valentinoo:</div><div class="quote_body">is it true that theres many haunted flats at Pasir Ris? any one has any story to share?<br><br>i know at block 400 ++ at tampines, the flat where a cabbie killed his whole family and then jumped down the flat..that one is haunted</div></blockquote>i was staying in pasir ris for about 6 years,since 1993.......somehow this rumour is quite true.<br><br>i am from a christian family,thus my mum would always put a cross on our main door.somehow in early 1998 when we are moving out after selling the five-room flat away,my mum removed the cross two week before moving out,and strange things start hapening.<br><br>I used to have the habit of watching tv till past midnight.That night happened that my mum was out-stationed,and my dad wasn't back yet.My grandma was sleeping with me in my room because there was air-con in my room.I have a small dog at home,which would also sleep with me in my room when my mum was not in.<br><br>That particular night,my dog just refused to accompany me out to the living room to watch tv.thus i started to feel that the dog might be able to sense something.....but i didn't want to missed that night's programme as there's my favourite artiste.So i opened my room door and when out into the living room.It was about 11.50pm......I can feel my hair stand when i walked out......then i on all the ceiling lights.Even there are 5 large bulbs,but the living room still seems to be so gloomy.Usually we wouldm only on 3 out of the 5 bulbs,the whole living room would be very brightly lighted....<br><br>I on the tv,and went to the toilet in my kitchen.Althought he kitchen was directly beside the living room,but it seems ok there. After that i went back to my living room and sit comfortably in my sofa,hlding my tv and vcr remote control,preparing to record the programme.The first 20 minutes was ok,until about 12.15am,i started to hear knocking on my balcony and living room windows.the balcony windows and living room windows are aligned in one straight line,but we stick those stickers on the windows glass so that nobody could see through.That night all the windows in the house were left closed,and i did not open it when i was watching tv.For the next 30 min,i could see shadows flying right and left,knocking on the windows.I know it isn't human,because my unit wasn't those corridor unit when our neighbours could walk passed.And mine is the 8th floor.Nobody could knock on the windows unless he or she could fly???<br><br>Finally the programme ended at 12.45am.Immediately i off the tv and the fan,dare not look back.I off the lights and rush into my bedroom as fast as i could,and locked my room door.I saw my dog still hiding under my bed,seems to be a little frightened.I did not sleep immediately,still wondering what was outside.<br><br>about 1.30am,i heard my dad opening the main door,then after that i dozed off.Next morning,i almost forgot the whole incident until my grandma mentioned that my dad  experienced  'something ' the night before.<br><br>He took a bath after he came back,then when he was about to sleep,he heard a woman crying very loudly.He thought it was my neighbour whom had a quarrel with her husband as sometimes they really did.So he open the window to check,all my neighbours seems aslept.The crying continued the whole night until 5+ in the morning.In the end he couldn't sleep at all.But something was really amiss.my room and just beside the masterbedroom,how come my grandma and i hear nothing at all?<br><br>eversince that incident,the new owner who bought over my house came a few times with their new-born baby,the baby cried everytime they enter the living room,and stopped crying immediately they went out to the corridor.After we moved out,many things happened when they moved in.Their maid even fell down and hurt herself badly while doing house work.....well,nothing could explained,but i guess everyone roughly knew what's that "thing"......to add on,the flat is in pasir ris st 11,and they have just bulid a nkf at the void deck........i don't want to mention the block number,but i assume some of those who stayed around there knows which block has an nkf at the void deck....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never heard of any haunted flats around Pasir Ris area.<br><br>But if say freak accidents around Pasir Ris, yes.<br><br>Don't be so surprised about it though... Singapore had gone through WWII, and lots of spirits wonder around. Most are harmless... just don't provoke them. And if you know of any haunted places... don't go there and play... explore all you can, but don't touch anything. You know what will happen if you do so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>My flat has a few. My grandma as well as me can see. My maternal grandma's house has another one (my maternal grandpa's spirit) and only I could see.<br><br>Can see pretend cannot see, if not, you go bonkers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
