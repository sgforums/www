            <div class='col-md body'>2 hours, 34 minutes ago  Add Oddly Enough - Reuters to My Yahoo!<br><br>SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuters) - Chilean scientists were baffled on Tuesday by a huge, gelatinous sea creature found washed up on the southern Pacific coast and were seeking international help identifying the mystery specimen.<br><br>The dead creature was mistaken for a beached whale when first reported about a week ago, but experts who went to see it said the 40-foot-long (12-meter) mass of decomposing lumpy gray flesh apparently was an invertebrate.<br><br>"We'd never before seen such a strange specimen, We don't know if it might be a giant squid that is missing some of its parts or maybe it's a new species," said Elsa Cabrera, a marine biologist and director of the Center for Cetacean Conservation in Santiago.<br><br>Photographs showed a round leathery substance like a mammoth jelly fish, about as long as a school bus.<br><br>Giant squid live at a depth of 9,500 feet and only rise to the surface when they die. Specimens have been known to be as long as 60 feet.<br><br>There was speculation that the mass might be a whale skin, but Cabrera said it was too big and did not have the right texture or smell.<br><br>Cabrera said she was contacting Chilean and international organizations in the hope that they could help shed some light on the find.<br><br>The Chilean Navy first spotted the mystery specimen along with another large mass, but the other dead animal turned out to be a dead humpback whale.<br><br><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=573&amp;ncid=757&amp;e=2&amp;u=/nm/20030702/od_nm/chile_science_dc" rel="nofollow">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=573&amp;ncid=757&amp;e=2&amp;u=/nm/20030702/od_nm/chile_science_dc</a></div>

Others have disputed his conclusions.<br><br>"We are working on sending the samples to laboratories that have different opinions on it," said Elsa Cabrera, director of the Center for Cetacean Conservation.<br><br>Cabrera and her team have been flooded with calls from around the world by people eager to know more about the "blob" or offering help. She plans to send tissue samples next week to laboratories in the United States, France and Italy.<br><br>"We're very pleased with the find because it has generated a huge amount of interest internationally," she said.<br><br>DNA sequencing is the best bet for identifying the specimen, but underfunded researchers in Chile said the samples taken so far were insufficient and new ones were needed.<br><br>"This is a very important find for science. We need to get down there as fast as possible so we don't lose the specimen," said Sergio Letelier, a researcher at the Museum of Natural History in Santiago.<br><br>"But we don't even have money for the bus, let alone a plane fare. It's pathetic," he added.<br><br></div>
