            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe I should start the ball rolling first  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ....<br>Here is an Urban Legend about a "ghostly bus" that I have heard many times...<br><br>One night, Mary(or watever name you like) was waiting at the bus stop as she had just finish attending a friend's party. Well, she left later than expected and was waiting for the last bus to arrive...<br><br>After waiting for quite a while, the bus she was planning to take arrived. She boarded the bus and paid her fare to the bus conductor(this story was obviously from a long time ago when there were still bus conductors collecting money from the passengers). She noticed that she was the only passenger on board...after choosing a comfortable seat, she fell asleep quickly as she was quite tired from all the partying..<br><br>After sleeping for a while, she woke up and noticed that the bus was moving very slowly...she looked out of the window and noticed that the surroundings were unfamiliar...she looked n front and noticed that both the driver and the conductor were gone! And here the bus was moving out of it's own accord!!She was scared stiff!!<br><br>After a while, she heard some hokkien swearing from behnd the bus...mustering al her courage, she reluctantly peeked behind via the rear window...and saw the bus driver and the conductor pushing the bus, swearing that the bus broke down at this unearthly hour!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read before a service 172 (Lim Chu Kang service) becomes ghost service 44 half-way thru the cementary. Also a long ago story where the conductor still exist.<br><br>Also, read before, there is this guy who once boarded the last bus, he is the first passenger to got on the bus and he boarded at the terminal, so when the bus left the terminal, there's only him and the driver (no more conductor), then strange thing happened, at the next stop, one passenger got on the bus, at the second stop, another one passenger got on the bus...this happen until the bus left its 49th stop, that is, there are now 50 passengers (plus that guy who board at the terminal) and one driver. Suddenly, the guy realised that, when the bus reached every stop, ONLY ONE passenger boarded the bus, and also NOT A SINGLE passenger has alighted the bus along the way.<br><br>Now, the bus is crowded with 51 people in it. But more strange things are going to happen.<br><br>The bus is arriving at the 50th stop, then, one passenger pressed the bell to alight (and now NO passenger boarded the bus), so when the bus came to the next stop, another one passenger alighted and nobody boarded the bus. This continued until the bus is only left with the guy and the driver. The guy is now very very scared...the bus will stop at the next stop (which is the LAST stop) before terminating at the terminal. So, he think, "Must I alight the bus? No way, I'm alighting at the terminal (his house is near the terminal) and not the next stop".<br><br>So, the bus reached its LAST stop. The bus stopped beside the stop and the driver opened the door. The driver looked at the guy and said: "Aren't you getting down the bus?". The guy is now too scared to say anything...he turned his head down, when he turned his head up, the driver is no-where in sight!!! Then, the door closed and the bus slowly proceed to the terminal, but NOBODY is driving the bus!!! The bus just moved by itself, the guy turned to look if the bus driver was outside the bus, there was NO ONE!!! What he could see are graveyards everywhere beside the road...and it is approaching midnight...and he remember very well (he is a regular passenger on this service) that buses of this service don't pass by any cementaries...the bus reached the terminal, he got off the bus, the terminal was very dark, he felt that he is the only person there, then suddenly someone called his name from behind, he turned to look back and  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!................................<br></div>
