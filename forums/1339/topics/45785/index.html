People in trains, mostly last trains stopping at these stations, report seeing headless apparitions walking down the aisle or hearing loud laughter.

Others felt Â‘someoneÂ’ following them from behind, but when they turned around, there was nothing. "<br><br>"A friend of mine told me about his encounter before. He was heading to a friendÂ’s house and he was walking alone in the underpass. He noticed a young Â‘girlÂ’ squatting against the wall in the far end of the underpass. But when he got nearer, the Â‘girlÂ’ simply vanished into thin air. My friend ran back to where he came from and called his friend to come and pick him up. "<br><br>"Before this, people have been telling me that one end of the underpass, the one leading to the sea, will always be dark, no matter what time is it or how good the lights are. ItÂ’s TRUE!! "<br><br>"I wanted to get back to East Coast Park but half way through the underpass, I noticed a long and hollow square tube in the ceiling. If IÂ’m not wrong, it indicates the central divider of the highway above. It is very dark and my first reaction was, Â“Wah! Surely got ghost inside.Â”<br><img src="http://www.sfogs.withinbudget.net/bs/bs14z1.jpg"><br>See it for yourself...and note the scratch marks on the wall...<br><br>"Rumours were that a murder took place in the bushes before. Allegedly, the body was dumped into the greens. Sometimes, people could hear noises in the bushes. "</div>
