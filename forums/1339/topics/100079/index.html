            <div class='col-md body'>This building is the icon of Taman Jurong back in the early days as it was the tallest building in Taman Jurong.<br><br>From what I heard (rumors):-<br>1.) The building is being plan to be redevelop into a commerical building or upgrade (cause it is a 1-rm flat)<br>2.) The lease to the NTUC, clinic, shops at 1st and 2nd floor has not expire yet<br><br>However, I do notice:-<br>1.) There is a recent bank renovation (early this year or late last year), I am not sure is it OUB or UOB or OCBC, the one just outside NTUC entrance.<br>2.) There are also constant mainteance work on the building itself.<br>So there might be plans to this building afterall.<br><br>If you want to have spooky stuff, this place might have something as this place is also a well-known place for suicide in the past (at least from what I heard from my Father). The most recent case is which a woman was throw off this building and the lover hid in the water tanks on the top floor during the police hunt.<br><br>For me, there are so many changes in Taman Jurong in the past 10 years and this building brings my childhood memories instead of any spooky stuff.</div>

Used to sit outside the NTUC eating ice-cream and looking up to the sky, that was framed by the diamond edge of the building.<br><br>Nothing mysterious about this........<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. i currently study to the school next to that place.. Jurong Secondary.<br><br>basically, they blocked off all the entrances and disabled all the lifts coz people were trying to get in. Mostly to do some graffiti graphics. (hehe) or to jump into those vacant lots inside to create like their own room or meeting place or sommat. That i know coz i know people who try that,<br><br>Spooky stuff? Not really but last time.. People could climb up to the roof and stuff. Just began to block the whole area up recently.<br><br>But that place has a kind of imprisonment kind of feelin. You really have to ask the shopkeepers from there if you wanna know more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
