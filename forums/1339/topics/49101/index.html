He then attacked her from behind, stabbing her a total of 22 times .<br><br>One wound, a deep gash to her chest through which the pensioner's heart was literally torn out, was 20 centimetres long and 23 centimetres wide.<br><br>Mr Thomas said that after killing Mrs Leyshon, the teenager ripped or cut off most of her clothing and put her body on a different armchair with her naked legs propped up on a stool. He then made several deep gashes along her legs, to drain blood into a small saucepan he had taken from the kitchen."<br><br><img src="http://www.ananova.com/images/news/mabelLeyshonPA334x500.jpg"><br>Mrs Leyshon...who was brutally murdered by a "vampire"</div>
