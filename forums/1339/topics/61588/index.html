            <div class='col-md body'>Check this dude's story out:<br><br>"Actually its more of an experience.

We scanned the area with our video camera and took some photos and moved on.<br><br>We then went up stairs to the 2nd story where we recorded strange sounds.... Sounds of trolley being pushed and moanings.( we later confirmed that we were the only ones there). As usual we took videos and pictures of the area and moved on.<br><br>We then stumbled into the operation theater(think it is) and the smell of blood hit us again but less pungent as in the morgue.<br><br>Next we went to the last storey( donno wat floor izzit) and the most happening things happened there. We got to saw small flashes of light and sounds of people talking. The next thing caused us to quickly exit the hospital and my friend almost shitted in his pants! Apparently one of my members suddenly felt very cold where the rest of us were sweating like pigs. Suddenly an invisible force brushed against him, causing him to loose balance and fall into the ground. He droppped his camera too. Next thing we did was to quickly walk down the stairs, get into my friend's car and drove to changi village.<br><br>Later on we developed the photos and we reviewed the shots taked, at the same time, listening to the tape recorde and the video camera.

We actually captured many sounds. Sounds of pple talking, moaning, screaming(faint and muffled) and the sound of trolleys pushing. After that experience which is our last, we splited and the group is now left with me.. the video and photos were distroyed by my other member beacuse he wanted to forget the whole incident. whats left is only the tape we recorded.<br><br>So my conclusion is that Old Changi Hospital is a very if not super haunted place. The rumours are true as we had experience it oursselves. We dont recommend people to go there either out of curiousity or for some cheap thrills, cos the spirits that haunt the place are quite strong(one of the strongest we encountered)."<br><br>OCH, being one of the more famous and reputedly more haunted places in S'pore, is a favourite haunt for spooks and explorers alike~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another good one~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>"This happen when i was about 15 or 16yrs old, still young and full of energy. I was at a friends (rewang) in English malay wedding preparation day at jurung west which i forgot the exact location.<br><br>It was around midnight and i was playing poker with a few friends, until at a point it was so bored i decided to do other things. Me and two of my freinds decided to take a walk. We went to the playground just round the corner but was dissapointed because there were already someone also part of our freinds sitting there. So we decided to change location and go to the rooftop instead. You know sometimes the rooftop door was not lock and we can actually go up there. But luck was not on our side and it was so frustrating when we reach at the top the door was lock. One of the guys decided that we should go to our wedding friends unit which on the 5th floor and find a place to sleep since it's already around almost 3am and we had a frustrating time not getting what we want to do. All of us agreed and we start our journey down the staircase.<br><br>When we reach the 6th floor, it came to our mind that we actually did not know exactly which unit it was, but we only knew it was on the 5th floor. So i decide that we split into two groups and meet up at the 6th floor again when found the unit. But my friend decide that we should look for it together, and we start from the other end of the block.<br><br>While we were walking in a straight row, i notice something on the next block which very near and visible. It was a lady dress in black and she had a very long hair, i could not tell whether she human or bla bla bla but it was a scary sight because she was holding on to the maingate just standing there and her hands are all black too. Suddenly my friends in front of me gave me a shock, he also saw it and was whispering to me ."Hey did u see at the next block?" I quickly told him told him "shhh keep quiet, just walk". It always been told that when you see something unusual, just keep quiet and walk. But the silence did not last long when my another friend suddenly with his' big mouth ' said, "Hey hey see there see there you see or not " pointing directly at that particular thing. And naturaly both of us look and what we saw was really chilling. The lady in black was actually scratching the door of that house violently and was also looking at us while doing it. The next thing i knew i was running to the staircase leaving my friends behind and i could hear one of my friend shouting or actualy crying "Tunggu, tunggu jangan tinggal aku!!!" in English "Wait wait don't leave me!!!". But i was running down like a flash.<br><br>When we were at the ground floor, we headed straight to the playground where most of our friends were and surprisingly when we reach there, everyone seems to look scared and were close together. Before we could tell them what happen, one of them told us that they saw someone looking at them from the rooftop, looks like a lady with long hair swaying and suddenly vanish just like that. The three of us just look at each other and then we told them we just saw that thing on the 5th floor at the same block. Just imagine if we were at the rooftop and the that thing is there too.............!"<br></div>

After that experience which is our last, we splited and the group is now left with me.. the video and photos were distroyed by my other member beacuse he wanted to forget the whole incident. whats left is only the tape we recorded.<br><br>So my conclusion is that Old Changi Hospital is a very if not super haunted place. The rumours are true as we had experience it oursselves. We dont recommend people to go there either out of curiousity or for some cheap thrills, cos the spirits that haunt the place are quite strong(one of the strongest we encountered)."<br><br>OCH, being one of the more famous and reputedly more haunted places in S'pore, is a favourite haunt for spooks and explorers alike~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>been there twice...............</div>
