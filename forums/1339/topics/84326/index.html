            <div class='col-md body'>Although I can't be 100% sure, I think the baby might be kept as a Toyol..<br>So, I did a search on the internet and here's the stuff i found regarding about Toyols..<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Toyol?</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.sfogs.com/history/toyol.gif"><br><br>"A very famous slave ghost, Toyol is the name given to this "being" that has been sadly abused by the power hungry, money crazed, egotistical humans and medicine-man in the South East Asia region of the world. It remains as a myth for the fear of retribution from the owner of the Toyol.<br><br>Toyol is a still born that is exhumed in the dead hours of the night. It is then brought back to life with incantations of the unholy and the sacrificial blood of a pure white rooster. Incense is also burned as an offering but doubt it has any merit to the gods(seems that the incense mask the reeking smell of death). Then it is housed in a large jar and set on an altar. It is then released from its jar after the bewitching hour and will heed any commands that the owner wishes it to execute.<br><br>Toyols will kill, steal, maim and create havoc in small villages. Easy to do because they are in actual fact a little fetus. After it has done its deeds it will come back to the owner. The only catch in owning one is that it has to be fed with the blood of a white rooster and incense at midnight. But beware that all it takes is for you to miss one meal and it'll go delirious and certain death will befall the owner.<br><br>If you try to get rid of it, it will come back to claim your life especially if you are a women ( women are said to give birth to toyols after 3 - 4 months , their stomachs bigger than usual ). Chinese call this 'kwee kia'.<br><br>It will always remain a myth for the fear of retribution from the owner of the Toyol."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Toyol's urn?</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.spi.com.sg/spi_files/haunted_bedok/pic/DSC03077.jpg"><br><span style="color: blue;">SPI conducted an investigation sometime ago in a Bedok flat and found this supposed Toyol Urn..</span><br><br>Here's the comments by the SPI Team on the urn -<br><br>"a sealed wooden bottle with a toddler's face on.  We could never figure what it was inside and what the bottle was used for.  It seemed as if something was inside, and the lid was tightly sealed.  Upon shaken, sounds of powder moving up and down could be heard from inside the bottle.  The bottle looked eerie although we thought it was for baby use because it has got a toddler's face on.  Suddenly we were reminded of something that Alice told us: "I suspect my mum keeps Toyols at home.."  Toyol is a baby's soul controlled by dark forces usually got recruited during his mother's abortion.  Popular in Thailand where the owner had to feed the Toyols by his own blood, and the Toyols will do obey to the master's commands.  We just put the bottle (or urn) right back to its place."</div>
