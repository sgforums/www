            <div class='col-md body'>There has been a lot of talk on the Internet about the possibility of Planet X, a tenth planet, and in particular the devastating effects it could have passing close to Earth. Websites have put forward a vast amount of text arguing for and against this scenario, much of it based on bad science.<br><br>Cheerful quote from site: "In June 2003 'Planet X' will get close to Earth. Its magnetic force will stop the Earth rotating for several days; it will cause huge earthquakes, volcanoes, Tsunamis and hurricanes all over the planet. Crops will fail, millions will stave. 90% of the planet's population will die. The force of it passing will cause the Earth's magnetic poles to shift."<br><br>What do they claim Planet X really is?<br>They say Planet X is the tenth planet in our solar system. It is not really a planet, actually a brown dwarf; a small, failed star. They give it a size of 4x that of Earth, but a density of 20x. It orbits our Sun and also a second star in our solar system that they claim exists. It travels very quickly when it passes close to either star, but slowly in between. This acceleration is caused by gravity and is exactly the sort of thing you see with comets - ever wondered why comets orbit our sun but only appear for a few days every few decades?<br><br>Are there more than 9 planets in our solar system?<br>Planet X is the name given to the 10th in our solar system, if one exists. For nearly a century, astronomers have been searching for it. Now, NASA claims they have no evidence for it existing, but admit it is possible. The Planet X scenario requires a large planet, which we would have seen Planet X if it were anywhere near Earth. Instead, they argue that it is normally travelling slowly, a vast distance away.<br><br>What do you think??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to biblical teaching, prediction of dates of end of world is not something from God.  If you can know which date it is, then you can be God???  Jesus forewarned His people not to listen to false prophets trying to deceive many by such speculations (which we can see those cults like to use) and tell us plainly that NOT EVEN THE SON HIMSELF, NOR THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN KNOWS BUT ONLY THE FATHER. so who do we think we are?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no one can predict the coming of Jesus and the end of the world. but when it happens. i dun tink a meteorite will blow earth to bits.. first will come 7 years tribulation, where satan, the prince of darkness, the devil will rule the world for 7 years. implementing the mark of the beast 666, those who do not have the mark, cannot buy or sell, and will be killed, but those who put on the mark on their hands or their head will not be admitted into the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>but this mark is not really legendary... think abt it... the world is starting to standardise money, plus with new technology, the developement of a bio microchip which can be inserted into the body system is really possible. which is happening anyway.<br><br>and the chip is actually undergoing design, which will remove the need for money.</div>
