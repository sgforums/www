The guns were destroyed before the surrender of the British army and the tunnels were sealed up after the war. Their location remained a secret until the Singapore Prisons Department rediscovered them in April 1991.<br><br>Today a replica of the monster gun and 15-inch shell sit at the Johore Battery and visitors are able to view the original tunnels through a reverse periscope at ground level. The dept of the tunnels can be experienced through an echo tube."<br><br>Hmm...more tunnels....too bad they are sealed up...like the labrador park ones....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.petrowilliamus.co.uk/murals/background/15in.jpg"><br>"On the evening of 7th February, the Japanese 5th Imperial Guards made a feint attack on Pulau Ubin. The Changi six inch guns, and guns from Pulau Tekong fired on them, but because of being poorly supplied with high explosive ammunition, the effect was not as good as it might have been. The main Japanese assault on Singapore began on the 8th February with a landing at Sarimbun on the western side of the island. Changi was the subject of an artillery barrage on that day and its guns replied with great intensity. The 15 inch guns of the Johore Battery later fired on Japanese forces at Tengah airfield on the other side of the island. Being coastal artillery, they were well supplied with armour piercing ammunition, but had no high explosive shells at all. Armour piercing ammunition would bury itself deep in the ground before exploding rendering it pretty well ineffective against troops. By the 12th February the situation in Singapore was desperate and Lt. General Percival ordered the Changi garrison to withdraw to Singapore town. Fortress Changi's role in the defence of Singapore was over. Before they withdrew, the Engineers blew up the guns which had been Changi's "raison d'etre". The 15 inch guns had fired 194 rounds of armour piercing ammunition at the Japanese forces. Not one singe round was fired against a naval target."<br><br></div>
