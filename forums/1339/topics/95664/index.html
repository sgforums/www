            <div class='col-md body'>hi one of these days pls walk behind Plaza sing (the exit at the 7-11 at PS) there u will see a old eerie looking building..... it is actually apartments.... really scary.. checked out the place i will soon post a few pictures... the bulding looks like it is alomost about to be torn down. but the amazing thing is that PEOPLE live there. looking at the place i can confirm that it has things. but when me and my fren tried to enter the guards stopped us.. really eerie. but when the guards have a toilet break usually at 1 am we sneaked in the funny thing is that u have to walk through the carpark to the lifts.. freaking scarry u can feel things imme.. this freaked both of us but to find the lift it is difficult by that time the guad was out had no choice had to leave as the police had been called down..<br><br>it is easy to enter as the guards are mostly old mans. tried to talk to one of the residents.. but did not understand english.. my guess is that no singaporeans live there.<br><br>(area)<br><br>it ps is in the town area so none my thing anything about it.. but this apartments r linked to the hill. with old scary looking trees. i can tell u that there is something there. confirmed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I checked out the place on <a href="http://can.com.sg" rel="nofollow">can.com.sg</a>, and it was listed as Cathay Apartments, which is linked to the old Cathay Building. The hill that it stands on is Mount Sophia.<br><br>Did some research on it and here's what I got:<br><br>From a blog of a MGS alumni<br>"The other day I was cutting my way from the old Cathay cinema towards Plaza Singapura when I stopped and saw something that brought back many fond memories of my mispent youth. tucked between what used to be Picturehouse (those of you of a certain vintage (sic) will remember this place) and Cathay Apartments is a nondescript flight of steps known fondly to students of MGS back when it was til at Mt Sophia as "The hundred steps'. it wasn't exactly one hundred, more like 97 or 98, but somewhere along the way, it was just stuck with the name."<br><br>"Memories of trudging up this flight of steps every morning came flooding back. It was a good short cut then, despite the early morning excercise. the other alternative would have been to walk all the way pass Paradiz centre and walk up Adis Road. sometimes, when we were feeling particularly lucky, we'd use the lift at Cathay Apartments. Just take the lift to the 7th floor, door open and we're right at the top. of course, the security there didn't take too kindly to the infringement and once in a while, Mrs Tham would announce over the PA during morning assembly that under no circumstances were we to use the elevators at Cathay Apartments to get to school. the girls will obey for about all of 2 weeks and after that, we'll be back again..."<br><br>"Picturehouse and Cathay cinema is now no longer. in its place, there's some construction going on. but it was really nice to see that the hundred steps has not succumbed to development in the ever changing landscape of singapore."<br><br><img src="http://68.111.183.100:88/~ting/blog/hundredsteps.jpg"></div>
