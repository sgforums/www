            <div class='col-md body'>This photo (close-up above, full image below) was taken May 25th 2003 at around 10 pm after we finished dining at a very popular steak house in old Montreal City while we were there on a weekend getaway. My wife took this photo, I tried to have her move closer in, I knew the flash would not carry the distance she was from us.<br><br>She wanted to catch the name and exterior of the historic building. A few days later when we were home, I decided to try some software programs to enhance the brightness and crop the picture. It still looked terrible, but something of interest appeared behind us. To me it looks like a man slightly turned with his back to us, he also appears to be at least 7 feet tall. He wasn't there when the photo was taken, I'm sure of that, someone that tall you notice. Kinda strange, this building dates back to the late 1600's.<br><br>--Terry<br>terrylee100@msn.com<br><br><img src="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/timages/page/ghostgiantxe.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/timages/page/ghostgiantx.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This picture of our band Myth was taken at the back of an abandoned ranch. When we took the picture, there was nothing unusual about it. But after developing the film we noticed an unusual, faint figure beside the pillar at the back of this particular picture. One of our early band members died in a tragic car accident while we were on the way to a stage performance. Jimmy, our bassist, was driving the van. All of us escaped with minor injuries, but Jimmy was unfortunate. We replaced him for another bassist. After some months we went to shoot for a music video in that abandoned ranch. After the shooting we were taking some photographs. We took only one picture which included all the band members. After developing the film this is the picture we got... When we saw the picture, we first thought that the figure at the back was one of the crew members. But later from the others we came to know that no one was standing there while the picture was being taken. Can anyone explain who he is?<br><br><img src="http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/jimmy_ghost_lg.jpg"></div>
