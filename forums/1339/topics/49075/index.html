            <div class='col-md body'>Alumni from the school tell some spooky tales from the place... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>"Sadly to say, the school had gone through major renovations throughout the years and most of the so called hauntu blocks are pulled down. the only surviving building would be the auditorium. Built around the 50s, this building has very weird structure, more like a maze with many eerie dark corners.<br><br>You can find stairways into underground doors that lead to underground classrooms. passages that lead you around the building to many secret exits. for once just before graduating, some of us broke in (dnt tell anyone) some of the locked doors and found that everything within remained perfectly still... an underground artroom with all the sculptures, drawings, materials. etc covered with dusts and cobs, a lion dance club room with the lions' heads still hanging on the walls..., magazines dating from the 60s to 70s. it just seems like everyone had evacuated the place and abandoning everything for the past decades to come.<br><br>the female toilets was usually closed with traces of many once pasted paper above the door. the only opened male toilet will give you hair-standing feeling for no reason and for no explanation, the huge windows were always purposely left wide-opened allowing people outside to peek in!<br><br>stories were told that melodies from the old piano above the audi stage were heard echoing down the hallway. nobody was there and the old piano was supposed to be untuned.  from one of our former music teacher, during one late evening while she and her students were rehearsing for a oncoming concert, they saw a glimpse of a white figure swooshing down from the upper sitting deck down to the back of the stage!<br><br>white figures were repeatedly seen and disappeared in split second by many others. maybe they saw such things bcuz their eyes have not focused properly on a particular light source?<br><br>though the auditorium is too renovated and everything has brightened up ever since, i think those things still remains there if they exist. do they?<br><br>for me, there isn't much hauntu experiences from the school. only once i saw an old man in pyjamas standing motionless on the road junction outside the school. it was just minutes before dawn break and i thought i saw no reflection on the mirror (those types of huge curving mirror to show blinds on the road) behind him!

            <div class='col-md body'>"I was an ex-student of CCHS(Main) and I have something to share regarding CCHS too. My friends and I experienced strange happenings during a camp and I still can't explain it till now.<br><br>It was school holidays and my ECA was holding our training camp in school. At night, we slept in our ECA room which occupied the entire back portion of the old Auditorium.<br><br>It was the second night, I couldn't get to sleep as one of the girls was snoring quite loudly. I tossed and turned but do not dare to get up as I heard of many hauntings in the auditorium especially the back stage (which was where we were sleeping). Then I felt movement from another friend of mine, we both realised that each of us was awake and so we sat up. More girls that were sleeping around the snoring girl felt the movement and got up too. Soon, there's like about 4 to 5 of us up and staring at the snoring girl.<br><br>We tried to wake her up and try all ways to stop her from snoring but she was sleeping so soundly that we gave up. So we were sitting at our respective position didn't know what to do next. Suddenly, all of us heard a strange noise. I don't know how to describe the noise but it sounded like someone breathing heavily as if having asthma attacks.<br><br>We were quite worried as we knew that one of the girls had asthma attack before. So one of my brave friend went towards the noise which was coming from near the window. But the moment she step at the position near the window, the noise stopped. It's really eerie as the room became so quite suddenly. My friend quickly got back to her place and everyone decided to just go back to sleep.<br><br>The next morning, we asked all the girls if anyone have difficulty breathing the previous night but no one admit. Even the girl that had asthma attack before claimed that she was sleeping soundly the previous night.....so what's the noise that we heard? Till now, no one knows the answer...."<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/spi/forum/036/DSC02389.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/spi/forum/036/DSC02380.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not really. Guess it is not really haunted.In fact i often go to the roof top for some personal space and i dun see any "person" there.<br><br>On the other hand, if you go to the admin block or the school pond at night, you will see a lot of happenings.People often witness a white figure walking around the school pond. And at the same time, a motionless floating object could be seen drifting inside the pond.<br><br>As for the admin block, some say that Tan Kah Kee's ghost is there.the eyes of his potrait always seem to be looking at different directions all the time.One of my classmates even said that he saw the potrait's mouth moving.On the female toilet at third floor, a ghost of a young girl resides there.Some teachers claimed to have seen her. Often, she will dissapear without a trace, leaving only a few strands of hair.<br><br>What was once the old library, where all the old chinese collections is also said to be haunted.However, ever since the renovation ended, no one have claimed to see any ghost around there.</div>
