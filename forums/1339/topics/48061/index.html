            <div class='col-md body'>More strange stuff from Ebay:<br><br>"One day I was surfing the web and I found a strange website.  A Chinese American guy told that he made the greatest invention ever...<br><br>The "Immortality Device".  Ridiculous, isn't it?<br><br>His simple device is supposed:<br>- to stop and reverse aging;<br>- to heal several diseases;<br>- to give a large amount of energy.<br><br>I imagine you are laughing at this, after all, that's exactly what I did when I read it!<br><br>However, I then noticed that...<br><br>This invention has a US Patent on it, # 5,989,178.<br>FDA (www.fda.gov) has NOT stopped his business.<br>(FDA is "Food and Drug Administration")<br><br>and...<br><br>This guy has testimonials up the ying-yang from satisfied customers!<br><br>Since I am into health and healing, and I had the magnets that are needed to build the device, I actually made one and tested it.  After a few minutes I felt an increase in my heart rate and a sensation of better blood circulation.<br><br>I wondered about this, because it was something I did not expect!<br><br>Usually magneto therapy causes little and doubtful effects, so it is not considered an effective medical therapy. However, this device has a specific combination of polarities and does produce a real effect on human body.<br><br>Later on I read almost every testimonial that he had, and actually many people report an increased heart rate and difficulty falling asleep during the first few days that they use the device.  People also report that this effect disappears after a few days and then an increased energy level and better health are felt.<br><br>After several weeks a real reversal in aging process becomes apparent!<br><br>Some people even report other results such as weight loss (reported by overweight people), and stopping or even reversing hair loss or hair whitening (reported by older people).<br><br>This really seemed incredible!<br><br>I built the one device by myself, then I talked to the inventor and had him send me a few of his devices, so I could to test them on several people.<br><br>Here are my results...<br><br>I found that 60% of people feel an immediate effect like I felt<br>(usually women are more sensitive than men)<br><br>The remaining 40% of people do not feel an immediate effect<br>(but they are lucky in my opinion, because this allows them to<br>sleep with the device on just the first night after they receive it!)<br><br>After a few days all people feel a general sensation of...<br><br>Well-being and better health!<br><br>This invention is not famous yet, and in my opinion, the reasons for this are...<br><br>The inventor is NOT a good businessman<br>(he IS a great and wonderful person, just not good at business)<br><br>His website is messy, not very pretty, and very un-professional.<br><br>There is no good theoretical explanation of the effectiveness of this device.<br><br>There "is" a non-scientific description about the interaction between his device and human body, as well as theories about a new Messiah, an imminent war between the USA and China, and other strange statements.<br><br>However, I did verify (much to my surprise)...<br><br>That this device works AND it is useful to mankind!<br><br>I also verified that the inventor is honest and charitable.<br><br>The device is made of two magnetic rings that you have to wear on your little fingers, with the right polarities.  Since I am convinced that these are effective, and do help people, I have worked out a special deal with the inventor and now have 100's of these devices available at the very special price of only $18.95.  Hopefully with my help, the inventor and his device will become well known throughout the world<br><br>According to Alex Chiu (the inventor), based on his testimonies, facts, and proofs, people are believed to be able to stay physically young forever by using his new invention "The Eternal Life Rings".  The Eternal Life Rings are to be worn on both small fingers of a person during sleep.  These rings consist of rare earth or ceramic magnets and plastic braces which hold magnets onto the fingers of the user. The inventor explained that the fingers and toes are the negative (-) and positive (+) terminals of your body."<br><br><img src="http://www.sunstoneherbals.com/auctions/images/handring.jpg"><br><br>"When placing the magnetic devices, the magnetic pole on the right side of the human body is opposite to the left side.   With a opposite pole on each side of the human body, blood circulation and electric current of the body are enhanced. The enhanced blood circulation and electric current increase metabolism in order to fight the aging process."<br><br><img src="http://www.sunstoneherbals.com/auctions/images/fingers.gif"><br><br>"The Eternal Life Rings are believed to allow humans to stay physically young forever or turn humans physically younger (Our lawyer told us to use the word "believe") and cure various diseases and handicaps as long as you wear the rings every night during sleep."<br><br><img src="http://www.sunstoneherbals.com/auctions/images/Wholes.jpg"><br><br>"Users say they...<br><br>Lose weight, feel younger, look younger, cure diseases,<br>lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, be energetic!<br><br>And based on my own personal experience...<br><br>I would have to whole heartedly agree with them!<br><br>I am making these rings available to the general public for the unbelievably low price of only $18.95 a set, in order to get the word out about the amazing inventor, and his awesome immortality rings.  All I ask is that after you have experienced the profound effects of the rings, that you email me with your testimonials, and try to tell a few friends about the them!<br><br>Each auction item is one pair of immortality rings<br>(two rings total, one for the left hand and one for the right hand)<br><br>These Rings Are Complete, And Ready To Wear<br><br>Please, consult with your doctor if you have any heart<br>problems or if you are pregnant before using this device."<br><br><img src="http://sunstoneherbals.com/images/guarantee1.gif"><br><br>"In other words, if for ANY REASON you are not happy with any of our products, just send us back the item(s) or the unused portion(s) within 30 days and we will refund your purchase price!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
