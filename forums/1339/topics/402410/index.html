              Thought I'd share this story I received in the mail with you guys:
              
              "Apparently this is a favourite story that spreaded like wildfire among Singaporean taxi drivers. It happened quite some time ago, when Punggol wasn't so well developed. This story certainly gives some food for thought for those presently staying in Punggol!
              
              It was a normal evening drive for taxi driver Ah Tan. The gloomy streetlights provided little illumination for the dark road in front of him. He had just dropped his last passengers for the day at a seafood restaurant at Punggol Point and was rushing back home to change shifts with his relief driver.
              
              While he was driving along the road, he took notice of a young lady at a bus-stop flagging for his taxi. He wanted to pick up the lady but he knew he would be late for changing shifts if he did so. Being a stickler for punctuality, he turned off his taxi light and carried on driving. He noticed that she was wearing a red T-shirt and black skirt but due to the poor lighting conditions, he could not see her face.
              
              When he passed by a bus-stop, he felt a sense of horror as he saw another lady flagging him down again, in the same red and black clothes! How could a lady move faster than the taxi? The distance between two sightings was about about half a kilometre apart! This time, he really felt terrified and floored the accelerator.
              
              Ah Tan would have never guessed what would happened next. As he sped along the road, he caught a flash of something in red running into his path, followed by a loud thump. His heart was thumping wildly as he saw the lady fly across his windscreen and land in a drain beside the road. 
              
              Ah Tan was not sure what to do now. Had he killed someone? Feeling guilty, he decided to make a report to the police. However, to his utmost horror, when the body of the lady in red was found, it was determined that her cause of death was not by a car accident but she was instead stabbed by a sharp object and bled to death in that very drain! She had already been dead for about three days, and the body had already started to decay.
              
              A week later, Ah Tan had begun to put the whole ordeal behind him. By some stroke of luck, he had won a big sum of money in 4-D after buying his taxi's number plate. Unfortunately, he fell down in the bathroom the next day and fractured his right arm. He had to be admitted to Changi Hospital for a few days.
              
              In the hospital, he started having nightmares about the young lady in red, who kept calling out to him "Ah Peh, li di si lo lai?"(Uncle, when are you coming down?). He really couldn't tolerate it anymore. Moreover, his arm had started to swell badly and even the doctors were puzzled about his worsening condition. 
              
              Fortunately, one of his friends, who was a Taoist priest, suggested that he give up his windfall winnings for the sake of "safety". He told Ah Tan that he could sense that the lady had serious grievances and has thus become a ferocious spirit.
              
              Since she could not avenge her own murder, Ah Tan was chosen to be the 'scapegoat' for her rebirth. The 4D winnings were to exchange for his life!
              
              Terrified, he decided to give up his winnings to The Community Chest. Strangely enough, he recovered rapidly and was soon back at work.
              
              Everything seemed to be over, shortly after he was discharged, his wife struck 4-D! 
              
              What transpired was, one day, his wife bought some vegetables from the market. She noticed that the newspaper used to wrap the vegetables actually contained the report of the young lady's murder case. She noticed the date on the newspaper and decided to try her luck at 4D and didn't expect to win. 
              
              Despite having a fierce argument between them, Ah Tan failed to convince his wife to donate the money to charity. Ah Tan was even more worried when his wife bought a red T-shirt and a black skirt similar to the dead girl's. She had seemingly gone mad, staring into blank space, talking to herself and having constant bad temper got hotter and hotter. One morning, Ah Tan heard her screaming in the kitchen. He managed to stop her in the nick of time just before she plunged a kitchen knife into her chest.she suddenly told Ah Tan that the life is meaningless'. This time Ah Tan was decisive, he donated all the money immediately. He also brought his wife to the temple where his friend worked at and asked the monks to pray and appease the young lady's tormented soul.
              
              After this incident, he stopped buying 4-D or being involved in any form of gambling. Subsequently, he also gave up his taxi-license for the trauma was too much for him to bear."
