(not sure how to spell)</div></blockquote>Australian aboriginal stories describe the bunyip as an evil spirit which dwells in creeks, swamps, and billabongs. The bunyip's loud bellowing cry terrifies the aborigines. They avoid water sources where they believe a bunyip might live. Some stories suggest the bunyip emerges at night principally to prey on women and children as well as animals.<br><br>Many white settlers also claimed encounters with the bunyip. While descriptions of the bunyip vary, most portray a creature with a hairy horse-like head and large body.<br><br>Aboriginal stories about the bunyip may reflect oral traditions of the diprotodon, a rhinosceros-sized herbivore. Diprotodon was the largest marsupial ever to have existed. Diprotodon is believed to have become extinct between fifteen and twenty thousand years ago. Memories of encounters between the aborigines and diprotodon might have been passed down through the centuries.<br><br>Modern encounters with the bunyip require a different explanation. One is that the diprotodon still exists. Another is that a large unknown animal is responsible for the sightings. A prosaic explanation is that sightings of Bunyips represent encounters with stray seals in inland waterholes and rivers. Another is that Bunyips are actually brigands or bums hiding in the outback.<br><br>The Bunyip features prominently in children's literature in Australia. The word "bunyip" has also taken on the meaning of "imposter" in Australian English.<br><br><img src="http://www.pibburns.com/cryptost/aus1379c.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Descriptions of Bunyips include a wide spectrum of appearances from animal to spirit. Some describe the Bunyip as a gorilla-type animal (kinda like bigfoot, or the Australian Yowie), while others say it is half animal, half human or spirit. Bunyips come in all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some are described to have long tails or necks, wings, claws, horns, trunks (like an elephant), fur, scales, fins, feathers...any combination of these.<br><br>Although scientists have found no physical evidence of Bunyips, they suggest it could have been a diprotodon, which became extinct 20,000 years ago.

The basilisk can run across the surface of water for short distances, using its hind legs and holding its body almost upright; the tail acts as a counterweight. It is also a good swimmer and climber. This cold-blooded animal is territorial.<br>Anatomy: Basilisks have teeth that are fused to the inner sides of their jaws. These reptiles have a long, whip-like tail, eyelids, four sprawling legs, and a body covered with overlapping scales. The body is laterally compressed (a cross-section of the body is tall and thin). The outer edges of the toes have long, fringe-like scales that help it walk on water. A large, flat, lobed crest adorns the back of the basilisk's head. Male basilisks also have a tall crest running along the back. Basilisks range from 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6 - 0.8 m) long; females are smaller than males.

            <div class='col-md body'>"Strange-But-Untrue Animals<br>Ancient seafarers exploring islands in the Caspian Sea, north of Iran, returned with tales of a strange beast that was half animal, half vegetable. They called it the "vegetable lamb." Supposedly, the lamb was permanently attached to the ground at the site where it was born. The sad creature would eat all the grass it could reach, and then die. Today, we know this weird animal was actually a small shrub, Cibotium barometz. When the plant's buds open, it resembles a woolly lamb.<br>Isn't it amazing how easily our eyes (and imaginations) can deceive us?<br><br>Stories about bizarre animals have appeared throughout history. Another example is the "barnacle tree." This tale originated in the 1100s. The tree was described as completely covered with sea barnacles. When they opened, baby geese poked their heads out. And when the geese reached maturity, they would drop into the ocean and swim away.<br><br>More amazing is the tale of Minhocao, or giant earthworm. In the 1800s, European science journals reported finding this creature in South America. It was said to be enormous - more than 150 feet long and 15 feet wide - and covered with bones that acted as armor. Skeptics suggested that people were probably seeing giant armadillos. (Giant earthworms do exist, but they're not that giant: One species in Australia grows to be 12 feet long.)<br><br>In 1995, the "hot-headed naked ice borer" made the news. The beast reportedly had a body temperature of 110 degrees F. This allowed it to melt ice. Supposedly, it lived in Antarctica in ice tunnels. When hungry, it would come up and hunt penguins.<br><br>The hot-headed naked ice borer, however, turned out to be an April Fool's day joke by Discover magazine. "<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by PaJeRoMiNi Ver 1.0:<br>[b]"This carcass was picked up by the Japanese fishing boat MS Zuiyomaru off the coast of Japan.  The carcass was covered with a fatty tissue which had badly decayed.  The creature weighed about 1 ton.  The Captain ordered it thrown back  because of it's smell so it was never closely examined.  Scientists studying the picture were unable to tell what kind of animal it was.  It does not resemble any known sea dwelling creature.  Skeptical scientists assumed it was a decayed  body of a basking shark.  Upon further examination, other biologists claim the size, fin placement, and overall appearance does not support the basking shark theory.  The sketch shown above is a drawing of what the creature would look like laid out flat.
