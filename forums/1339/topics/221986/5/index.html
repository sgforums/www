Its Paya Lebar command centre relies on patrolling teams and a CCTV system which sends out alerts when movement is detected. -- BRYAN VAN DER BEEK<br><br>FROM old army camps to schools, there are over 100 vacant state-owned properties - a number of which have attracted gangs of burglars.<br>In some odd instances, the intruders said they were checking if the sites were haunted.<br><br>In the last two months, the two security firms responsible for guarding such unoccupied buildings have encountered at least 20 intruders.<br><br>The thieves usually make off with copper wires, but they have looted metal signs and even trees.<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20061203/ST_IMAGES_NDBNSTATE3t.jpg"><br><br>GOTCHA!: Evtec's motion-activated cameras captured these images of two trespassers moving about an abandoned building. -- BRYAN VAN DER BEEK<br><br>The vacant sites - which also include police and fire stations and hospitals - are left empty while the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) scouts for new tenants, a process which could take several months or even years.<br><br>The entrances to these properties are padlocked.<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20061203/ST_IMAGES_NDBNSTATE2t.jpg"><br><br>GOTCHA!: Evtec's motion-activated cameras captured these images of two trespassers moving about an abandoned building. -- BRYAN VAN DER BEEK<br><br>In October, the SLA engaged two new security firms - Prime Security Services and Evtec Management Services - to guard the vacant premises.<br><br>Since then, Prime has foiled five burglaries while Evtec helped nab 15 culprits.<br><br>With copper prices having trebled and scrap-metal shops paying about $10 for a kilo of copper wire, most of the break-in thieves go for the wires.<br><br>Many construction sites and public buildings have also been targets of copper looting. In October, thieves made off with 27 copper lightning rods worth $13,500 from the Pasir Panjang Nursery.<br><br>Aluminium prices have also shot up, making window louvres, metal signs on walls and metal rubbish bins tempting targets for robbers.<br><br>The burglars come prepared with tools such as cutters, pliers and gloves. They climb over the gates or cut holes in the fences to squeeze through.<br><br>Prime's manager, Mr Jesu Kumar, said his men even came across a burglar who had removed air-conditioning units from the old Warren Golf and Country Club in Clementi.<br><br>Ms G. Pereira, managing director of Evtec, said thieves have taken sinks and toilet bowls as well. 'They will basically take anything that can fetch them some money,' she said.<br><br>There was an unusual case last month: Three men broke into the old Keat Hong army camp in Choa Chu Kang for its trees.<br><br>Using an electric saw, they had chopped down three trees before they were spotted by a security team from Evtec, which rushed down after the trio were spotted on closed-circuit television.<br><br>Two ran off but the one who was caught came up with a wild tale that they were selling the tree trunks to the zoo.<br><br>Every now and then, thrill-seekers also get caught - many said they were there to check out rumours that the sites were haunted.<br><br>An SLA spokesman said: 'When we come across activities by paranormal groups, we are not in favour of granting them permission to enter our vacant buildings in the interest of their personal safety as the buildings are not lit.'<br><br>The SLA said it takes trespassing on state properties seriously. Trespassers on state land can be jailed for up to six months and fined a maximum of $5,000. The court can also order that the culprit pays for any damage to the property.<br><br>The two security firms rely on technology to guard the vacant sites.<br><br>Evtec does not deploy guards on-site, but relies on patrolling teams and a CCTV system which displays images on a monitor screen when movement is detected on the premises.<br><br>Its command centre in Paya Lebar will then notify the nearest patrol team and call the police as well.<br><br>The surveillance set-up is so sensitive that even rustling leaves or strong winds could activate the CCTV pop-up alert.<br><br>Such a system requires only a few officers to monitor its array of up to 1,000 cameras.<br><br>If anyone tries to cut the wires linked to the CCTV system, the office will be alerted immediately.<br><br>Two groups of thieves did just that but were scared off by responding Evtec guards.<br><br>Evtec has recently added dogs to its patrol teams.<br><br>Prime stations a guard at each of its sites, and complements their presence with a shrill alarm triggered by heat sensors.<br><br>benjamin@sph.com.sg<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Due to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unsavoury characters</span>* who has been "<span style="font-style: italic;">spoiling market</span>" , for us genuine explorers who want just a look and feel of a place. I feel angry however at how inconsiderate they are.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">*People like those who go in to steal things, vandalize, behave like monkeys make hell alot of noise with disrespect to the place and surroundings.</span>)<br><br>I hope future explorations undertaken by anyone would be low profile and not against the law. You don't have to make a nuisance of yourself once you are at the location, or kicking doors, breaking windows, spraying paint, screaming shouting...etc etc.<br><br>Just take a look, remember the place, take photos if you have to, and leave the location in it's original state, be considerate for the next person who will visit.<br><br>Thanks.
