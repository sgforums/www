            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;">The following article was published in December 1998 in a highly popular paranormal magazine in Malaysia and Singapore. The article has been translated to English.</span></span><br><br>Page 1 of 4<br><br>Upon completing the dusk prayers, Mohd Sajuri Amron, 50, Village Chief of Kampung Tanjung Sepat, Kuala Langat, Selangor, rode his 100cc Yamaha motorbike to his oil palm plantation situated two kilometres from his house.<br><br>He went there with one objective - to see for himself allegations made by his fellow villagers that a strange, lighted object hovered over at the plantation everyday after sunset.<br><br>Just as he reached a junction that leads to the plantation, he applied the brakes. His motorbike nearly skidded. He was baffled. An object was seen hovering and emitting yellow lights around 200 to 300 metres above ground. No engine sounds was heard.<br><br>Out of curiosity, Sajuri observed the object with mixed feelings.<br><br>Â“Its shape was round and around 6 foot long. The yellow light emitted from the object was bright enough to light up the whole plantation,Â” told Sajuri.<br><br>Â“The object initially hovered over the forested area but soon changed directions and seemed heading towards where I was standing. It looked as if it was trying to land. Immediately I shouted AllahÂ’s name, trembling with fear,Â” added Sajuri.<br><br>However the object suddenly changed directions again. This time it turned left and vanished from sight.<br><br>Upon gaining control of himself, Sajuri asked himself. What did he just saw?!<br><br>Since then, Kampung Tanjung Sepat has been an attraction to all, including local and foreign media, whom had wanted to catch a glimpse of the object that was believed to be a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object). They camped almost every night at various locations where the object were said to have been sighted.<br><br>According to Sajuri, even though it happened way back in September 1995, the incident is still fresh in his memory. In fact he claimed that villagers still witnesses the mysterious on goings up to this day. He also claimed that a fellow villager, Rosli Kadir, had even seen the UFO creature.<br><br>According to Rosli, the creature was only half-a-metre tall and bald-headed. Its body was green in colour, red glaring eyes and a long neck. It doesnÂ’t have any eyebrows but his ears were big and long. Its mouth was round in shape and had thin, long arms and legs.<br><br>Will Tanjung Sepat be a spot for sighting UFOs once again?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 2 of 4<br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1999 Â– UFO Attacks!</span></span><br><br>Based on data and research gathered for 20 years as an independent researcher on UFOs, Ahmad Jamaluddin, the incident was not of a surprise to him as Malaysia has had numerous UFO sightings every year for a very long time.<br><br>Â“UFOs are not new to Malaysia. What happened at Tanjung Sepat was only one of the many sightings reported. Since 1909, as many as 170 sightings have been filed,Â” Ahmad said.<br><br>More surprisingly, investigations into the Tanjung Sepat incident had led Ahmad to believe that it might be a sign to what could happen next year.<br><br>Â“Next year, in 1999, I strongly believe that Malaysia could be a hotspot for UFO sightings,Â” he stressed.<br><br>When that happens, he said, many strange objects will be seen hovering in the sky, or even land at various locations across the country.<br><br>Â“The number of UFOs sighted will be greater than those sighted during the past years. That is the phenomenon we all will be able to witness next year. A phenomenon which all of us, including me have been waiting for Â– Malaysia being the focus of UFOs,Â” he added.<br><br>AhmadÂ’s allegations were based on concrete evidence and credible facts. Based on his intensive research for 20 years, he discovered that the presence of UFOs can be determined clearly by seasonal patterns and unique waves. A season can take up to ten years before it is repeated.<br><br>Â“Analysis on Â‘UFO wavesÂ’ showed that, between 1948 and 1988, Southeast Asia was Â‘visitedÂ’ by extraterrestrial creatures as many as 4 times. It started in the Philippines in 1948, Papua New Guinea in 1959, Malaysia in 1970 and returned to the Philippines in 1979. However the Â‘wavesÂ’ were not found in 1989. It might have Â‘visitedÂ’ the Indian Ocean at that time,Â” Ahmad said.<br><br>Â“In this decade, the Â‘wavesÂ’ had not yet been detected. On the basis of the research IÂ’ve done, I believe the UFOs will return to Southeast Asia in 1999 Â– and Malaysia in particular will be their target!Â”<br><br>Â“Nevertheless, if the UFOs are targeting other Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia wonÂ’t be spared either. Which means, the number of sightings in Malaysia might be less than that of the targeted country, but still higher when compared to the number of sightings in Malaysia previously,Â” he stressed.<br><br>Ahmad affirmed his theory by linking them with the earthquakes that happened on the island of Java in September and on the island of Talaud, Sulawesi in October. According to him, the Â‘UFO wavesÂ’ have got something to do with earthquakes.<br><br>Â‘The Â‘UFO wavesÂ’ which occurred in Southeast Asia in 1948, 1959, 1970 and 1979 all happened before or after and earthquake. In Tanjung Sepat, for example, the presence of the UFO was detected soon after an earthquake was reported in nearby Jambi, Indonesia,Â” he said. Tremors are frequently felt near the area where the UFO was sighted.<br><br>Based on the findings he had gathered, Ahmad found that UFOs is more frequently sighted along the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia as well as Sabah and Sarawak. Why? Because these areas lies close to the earthquake zones in the neighbouring countries.<br><br>With that, he believed the mentioned areas will likely be the hotspots for UFO sightings next year. Â“LetÂ’s wait and see what happensÂ… ,Â”Ahmad added.<br><br>Another local independent researcher, Steve Foley, supports AhmadÂ’s theory.<br><br>Â“AhmadÂ’s theories and predictions is credible as he is the only Malaysian who has been doing research on UFOs seriously and intensively over the past 20 years,Â” Foley said.<br><br>Â“His research has even been internationally acclaimed. He have contributed articles and commentaries to 16 magazines and produced 4 journals internationally. Obviously he wonÂ’t make those predictions blatantly. He has all the evidences and facts to back him up,Â” added Foley.</div>

Creatures like these are expected to Â‘visitÂ’ us.<br><br>Â“Most of the witnesses I spoke to had the same height description of the creatures. They are usually 5 to 8 cm high but there are some cases where some claimed to have seen creatures as high as 50 cm.Â”<br><br>Â“But what is clear is that, different witnesses gave different impressions on how the creatures really looked like. For example, on the afternoon of October 9, 1974, a witness from Kuantan, Pahang claimed that he saw a strange creature no bigger than his palm with his teeth shining,Â” Ahmad said.<br><br>The creatures that will come next year to Malaysia will most likely have a big head, like those witnesses by a few locals near Sarikei, Sarawak on August 22nd 1982.<br><br>Or they could be as high as 13cm, like those captured in October 1985 in Paka, Terengganu. 7 such creatures were said to have been captured that day, but 5 of them escaped while the remaining 2 was released a few days later.<br><br>Or they could be as big as a matchbox that measures around 5 cm. The creature was found in May 1991 by one of the villagers in Bukit Tunggal, Terengganu. The man claimed he successfully captured 2 such creatures.<br><br>There are also aliens with red eyes like those sighted on June 26th, 1990 by locals in Tapah, Perak. 2 years later, in May, locals in Sentul, Kuala Lumpur were told of the presence of strange creatures in their area.<br><br>Â“According to them, the creatures had human-like faces. Height was around 15cm and bald headed. Their bodies were green in colour and their limbs had only 3 fingers each. Their human-like eyes were red and their ears were pointed,Â” added Ahmad.<br><br>During the UFO season in 1970, Malaysia hosted the most number of UFO Â‘visitsÂ’ as compared to previous years. As many as 14 cases and nearly 30 reports of strange creature sightings were filed by witnesses. They were mostly sighted in August, with 9 cases. More startling, the UFOs sighted even during daylight.<br><br>Ahmad recorded various allegations by witnesses on that particular month.<br><br>Â“In August 1970, Zulkifli Ahmad, a 9 year old boy saw a small creature 8 cm tall while playing near his house in Alor Setar, Kedah.Â”<br><br>According to him, the creature wore a shiny, yellow-coloured outfit and ran when he tried to get near the creature,Â” Ahmad added.<br><br>On August 19th and 20th the same year, some students from Stowell Primary School, Bukit Mertajam, Penang claimed to have seen several strange creatures coming out from a spaceship. One of the creature had a horn on his head and wore a yellow-coloured outfit while the rest wore a blue-coloured one. The horned creature also carried a weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 4 of 4<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="large">Flying Saucers and Bright Lights</span></span><br><br>How will the UFOs look like when they pay us a Â‘visitÂ’? Will they be different from those sighted previously? A teacher from Sikamat, Negeri Sembilan, Viknesh Mahadevan was one of those who claimed to have sighted UFOs. The incident happened at 8pm on Saturday, January 18th 1997.<br><br>That night Viknesh saw 5 objects as big as a 10-cent coin hovering in the sky emitting yellowish-white lights.<br><br>Â‘The objects donÂ’t seemed to have any particular direction. ItÂ’s shape changed constantly at that time.  First it was long and next you know it, itÂ’s round, and then becomes long again,Â” said Viknesh recalling the incident.<br><br>After around 2 to 3 minutes hovering in the sky, the objects flew to the direction of the forest. On January 24th 1997, Viknesh decided to inform the media about the strange incident. To his surprise, he was told that many other witnesses from Mantin and Bukit Putus in Negeri Sembilan had also sighted similar objects in the sky.<br><br>More surprisingly, at about the same time Viknesh saw the UFOs in Sikamat, 7 similar objects was reportedly sighted hovering in the skies over Canada.<br><br>Foley himself had seen a UFO. He witnessed it on a night in 1996 while driving along the North-South Highway from Malacca to KL.<br><br>Â“I was alone at that time. Suddenly I saw a round object emitting a very bright white light flying above my car on the direction of KL.Â”<br><br>Â“It also seemed that the object had a white-coloured tail, like those of a comet. The light suddenly separated into 2. However I wasnÂ’t able to determine the size of the object as it was flying extremely fast, possibly at around 1,000 km per hour.Â”<br><br>Â“The strange object crossed ahead of me for a few minutes before vanishing,Â” Foley said. Based on the speed and altitude, Foley said. Based on the speed and altitude, Foley is sure that the object is indeed a UFO. He added that it was totally impossible for an aircraft at that low altitude to fly at speeds of more than 1,000 km per hour.<br><br>Objects sighted by Viknesh and Foley were of the same shape, like those sighted by other people, in Malaysia and the rest of the world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My father told me there were a couple of UFO sightings in the 1970s, including one whish was seen and heard by many people and reported in the chinese papers. Also there was one incident where students saw a UFO at their school field or something as well as aliens. They drew what they looked like but MOE dismissed it as their own imagination.</div>
