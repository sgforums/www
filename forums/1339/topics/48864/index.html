            <div class='col-md body'>"The 7 Urban Legends About the House on the Hill<br><br>The house sat up there alone. Nobody lived in it and nobody ever went inside. Children didn't play near it and didn't even like passing it. And nobody knew why. Even the old people didn't remember anybody ever living there and they didn't know why people kept away from it. It was an ordinary house, not like something from a horror movie. It was just a house. But nobody went near it.<br><br>1. Cries of a woman, or a baby?<br><br>From: Chung Chin Pang<br><br>People who did went by it by accident, hears cries of anguish coming out of the windows. The cries were unlike any they have ever heard. It sounded like howls of wolves but at the same time sounded like cries of a woman. Those who told these tales would die unexpectedly the next day. Local police, of course, dismissed these as rumours and nuisance.<br><br>One rainy night, a young Chinese boy, Clement, around the age of sixteen, went into the house as he wanted to seek for shelter. He did not know about the history of the house as he was a new migrant in town. He heard cries coming from a room on the second level. He thought that someone was in danger and decided go to into the room to check it out. As he went walking on the stairs, the musty and old wooden flooring broke down on his weight. Clement grew frightened. He thought, "How could someone get up there when the stairs are so easily broken? ".<br><br>Still, his curiosity got the better of him and he climbed up to the second level with an abandoned ladder on the first floor. When he was reaching room, the cries grew louder and louder with every step. He finally reached the room. He pushed open the door and was greeted by the most horrible sight. There was a cage in the middle of the room. In the cage was a baby who looked perfect in every way except that the head of the baby was as big as a cow. The baby turned and looked directly into ClementÂ’s eyes and smiled. It started to speak in a low voice, almost like the voice of a full-grown man, "Hi, Clement. How do you do?"<br><br>2. I .. saw .. floating .. people ..<br><br>From: Daboo<br><br>I was walking home alone under the misty moonlight when I saw a boy sitting on the bench with arms wrapping his legs looking all worn off and frightened.<br><br>"What's wrong?" I asked him.<br><br>"I..saw..floating people." He answered nervously.<br><br>I could see that he was shivering and had eyes that looked afraid. I calmed him down and asked him to lead me into this house. It was a bone-crunching experience for me and I was shivering too when I went up with the boy. Many people had told me different stories about this house and I wanted to find out what this house was all about - the truth.<br><br>We went in and the first thing that struck me was the terrible smell of the entire house. It had cobwebs all over the hall. Suddenly the boy whom I met went screaming and ran out of the house leaving all alone. I was scared, very scared.<br><br>I looked around the house and saw nothing that would scare the hell out of me. I continued searching for the "thing" that made the boy so afraid. Suddenly my heart skipped a bit when I saw this "thing". I was stunned. My heart was thumping so fast that it might be faster than the speed of bullet.<br><br>I stared at this white "thing" and did not dare to move a bit. After seconds, nothing moved and happened. Therefore I decided to check it out. I walked to the white "thing" slowly and realised that it was just a white mannequin. I continued searching on the second level and there was whole lot of white mannequins around that spooked me when I walked past them. I went up to the third level and it was much more spacious and no mannequins were around. Out of a sudden, a fat dirty ugly lady appeared in front of my very own eyes. I was shocked. I turned around and sped out of the house and to home. I was exhausted. I terrified. There was still a memory of the lady in my head that it cannot be got rid.<br><br>"Well, there is some truth in the house though." I thought to myself.<br><br>3. There lives a science freak<br><br>From: Chua Ming Jie<br><br>Actually, there was a story behind it.<br><br>Long ago, there was family living in the house. The only son named Johnny was a science-student who loved to do researches when he was young. He was from a rich family but his parents died when he was about to graduate from a famous local university. He stayed in the campus when he was studying in the university. He was friendly and helpful at that time. When his parents died, he was on a school trip. He received the news only when he was back. He was very sad. He went back to the house and tidy up the place. After this day, he studied very hard and managed to graduate with flying colours. His character had also been changed after the trip back home. He became selfish and self-centered. After his graduation, he went back to the house and never came out of that house again.<br><br>A few weeks later, the neighbours lived around the hill heard a big explosion from the house. But the house did not catch any fire. Some of his friends said he was doing his researches secretly and he wanted to invent a chemical to save his parents. Some said he was committing suicide in the house by using the explosion of the house. Nobody dared to go near the house. They said that house was haunted. Animals that were just around the house were dead without any reason. People concluded that any living things that went near the house would not survive. One day, there was a construction company wanted to tear down the house, as his boss did not believe the rumours. On that day when the group of workers heading towards the house, there was a heavy rain pour. It caused a landslide from the hill. It obstructs the only road to the house. The workers were so afraid and quit doing the job. Nobody wants to help the boss. The company cancelled the project in the end.<br><br>Coincidence? Rumours? No one knowsÂ… If you liked to know what had really happened, you may try to go there and find it out yourself.<br><br>4. The house is an experiment lab<br><br>From: Woo Zhi Hui<br><br>One stormy night, a group of teenagers from out of town ran into the house to seek shelter. "Hey James, let's seek shelter there" exclaimed Peter. James replied ''I don't know, everyone who has ever gone in there has said to have either died or if they made it have came out and had to go in a mental hospital because of all the things they saw". They did not know what is in the mystery house but they had to seek shelter no matter what because of the rain. Among them is a boy call Jason who is known for his bravery. He led them to explore the house and found themselves really lucky because the house was in great condition. Then they went further to even the basement of the house to find if there was any food.<br><br>Suddenly, they heard a loud bomb. They rushed down to where the sound came from, and saw a man with white beard in a white coat holding onto a flask of what seemed like chemicals. For a moment, they thought that they saw Einstein in person! Well, it only happened to be a scientist doing his experiment underground. He is trying to observe and find out whether men could live underground for years. That explains why nobody knew why there is no one living in the house, the old scientist has been living with the chemical substances that he had invented all these years! This is certainly a great discovery which can aid soldiers or spies who are in countries which are on war, to live in the underground and live there as long as up to five years just by living on a special kind of medicine called "antidote" made by the scientist. The antidote consists of various vitamins and minerals from various rare plants. One can live by just taking it.<br><br>In fact, the scientist enjoy living underground more and intended to live there for the rest of his life, but since the teenagers had found him, he had to reveal his discovery and invention to the world. After all, it would be a great contribution to mankind.<br><br>The house on the hill was actually the place where the old scientist does his experiments. Yet no one knew that there is someone living in the house.<br><br>5. The house is an inherited gift<br><br>From: Chan Bao Li<br><br>Why no one dares to go near it? No one knows, the children are not allowed to ask, the adults always tried to avoid the topic. Until one day, Melvin came. He claimed to received a letter, asking him to go to the house. The villagers advised him not to go, but he was determined to go, as the man had stated 'I will tell you the identity of your parents'. He was an orphan since young, brought up in an orphanage, except knowing that his surname is Rochelle, he knew nothing else about his own family.<br><br>Outside the abandoned mansion, Melvin was admiring its beauty. Although the building looked old, it was majestic. The flowers and trees surrounding the building were all bright and fresh. He wondered who the owner is, he had never even visited the village before, how could he have friends here?<br><br>"Hello! Anyone there?" he shouted but heard only his own echoes. He decided to explore the place himself. He seemed to know the way so well, but he had no previous memories about this house. Finally he stopped at a door, and a voice in his mind was pestering him to open the door, and he entered.<br><br>He was shocked when he saw an old man dressing in a long coat. He smiled to Melvin, and before Melvin could apologized about coming into his house without permission, he had spoken.<br><br>"Are you Melvin Rochelle?." He said in his cloaked voice.<br><br>Melvin nodded. The old man handed him a box.<br><br>He opened it, found a key, matching to the one he always had with him, and a letter, addressed to Melvin Rochelle. In the letter, it wrote:<br><br>Dear Melvin,<br><br>We can't tell you your identity, except that you are our only child. We now leave this house to you. Take care of yourself. Ok?<br><br>Your parents,<br>Katie and Robert Rochelle<br><br>Melvin read the letter again, then he looked up, and he asked, "are you sure this is for real? Who are you? Where are my parents?"<br><br>"I said it again, I was instructed not to tell you anything except passing this box to you. Now, my job is accomplished. It's time I should leave now. Take care." He said, turning and leave the house.<br><br>When Melvin turned and wanted to stop the old man for further questioning, he could not find him anymore.<br><br>Thinking that he might find some clues about who his parents were, he stayed in the house. But since then, he was never seen out of the house again. Nobody knew where he went, or if he was dead.<br><br>6. An old woman is living in the house<br><br>From: Cheng yi<br><br>Neighbours who lived near the house said that they heard strange sound coming from the house every night, they thought that there was ghost living inside there. One day, a young boy, called James, went up the hill and said that he want to explore the old house and to find whether there are any valuables inside the house. When he reached the house, he felt frightened, then he pushed opened the door.<br><br>He was surprised that the house was very clean and tidy, which he thought it should fill with spider webs and dust. Then he went inside the house, and start to explore the house. He saw a few old photographs of a young lady about his age and a box of jewelleries. He was so delighted that he jumped up and screamed. At this moment he heard someone is coming into the house, so he quickly went into the room to hide with the box of jewelleries.<br><br>He saw an old woman walking into the house, and thought that it must be the owner of this house. Then the women came crying after searching for something after a while. He suddenly remembered that he took the box of jewelleries with him. He felt so guilty that he came out of the room and returned the box of jewelleries to her and apologized to the old woman. The old women started asking him,<br><br>"Why are you, I thought all the people  are afraid to come up here?"<br><br>"I thought nobody lived here, and also try my luck to find whether there is any valuables inside the house," James replied.<br><br>The old woman told him that she was living here since she was young, but her mother died when she was young, so she had to support herself by working. But she had contracted a disease, what she left was only the box of jewelleries.<br><br>Later after the incident, James came and visited her everyday because she had no relatives. Nobody in the village knew that there was an old woman living there, as James did not leak the news.<br><br>7. Looking for a haunted house for TV series<br><br>From: Kenneth Ho Zi Hao<br><br>It was before Mr Andersen, a TV director, came. He had earlier toured Singapore a week ago. When he found out about the house history, he found out that it fits into the TV series, called the Scream Test, he is in charge of. The reason was because the house was a haunted one. He immediately set to work.<br><br>Firstly, Mr Andersen went to the neighbours to find more about the house from the neighbours head. He found out from the neighbours head that the house was at first owned by a man called Mr Johnny Kitte, a manager of a large textile company. Upon living in the house for two weeks, Mrs Kitte died of a very mysterious death, she died when she was removing the scales a swordfish and the swordfish jumped and pierced through her neck. Mr Kitte was very upset of his beloved wife death, he couldnÂ’t accept the death and hence every day stayed in the roof-top hoping his wife would return. After waiting for two months, Mr Kitte gave up and jumped straight from the roof-top. Then the next owner, Mr Little, a very rich and arrogant movie director, he built a carpark in the garden and hired a young boy to wash his 5 cars everyday.<br><br>One day, Mr Little went to the garden and found out that the boy was still sleeping, he woke the boy up but the boy complained that he was too ill to get up. Sensing the boy was cheating, Mr Little dosed kerosene over the boy and lit it up hoping that it would force the boy to get up, but sadly the boy was burned alive. The house was then changed into the a army hostel but again, something unfortunate happened, two soldiers were killed by a suspected strayed cannon missile. When the army commander checked the area to determine who fired the cannon missile, he found out that there were no military exercise taking place there on that day.<br><br>Mr Andersen decided to bring two psychics with him to visit the house. The psychics brought a reading machine that can sense ghosts. Upon entering the house, the reading meter flew to 75, the normal range is 2 and below, anything and above means there are ghosts in it. Then, they went to the roof-top and the kitchen, the reading was 65 and 74 respectively. The psychics advised Mr Andesen not to proceed with the TV series as the ghost in the house are very strong and were all looking for revenge but he insisted on doing the show. In the end, the contestants were all freaked upon leaving the house after the challenge, one even was admitted into the mental hospital after the game."<br><br>All these and more in SPI's <a href="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/hillview/main00.htm" rel="nofollow"> feature article about Hillview Mansion</a><br><br>Check it out man  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
