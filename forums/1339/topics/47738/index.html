            <div class='col-md body'>"This story came out in 2001, but has been circulating for quite a while with another resurgence in 2002. It probably continues because of the strong subject matter: Attached to the e-mail is a disturbing picture of a man eating what appears to be a fetus.<br><br>First, it is against the law in most countries of the world to eat human meat of any kind.  Cannibalism is a taboo in all but a few primitive tribes.  There are no resturants in Taiwan or anywhere else I know about that serve fetuses.  This is not part of Eastern culture, and never has been an accepted part of any mainstream eastern culture.<br><br>That being said, can I state with absolute certainty that the picture of the man eating a fetus is fake?  I'd have to respond: No.   I suspect it is fiction, but the man in the picture is a performance artist by the name of Zhu Yu from Shanghai.  It was part of a picture exhibition called Infatuation on Injury.  He told the Taiwanese press that it was a real fetus, stolen from a local medical school.  He claims to have cooked it himself and consumed it as part of his performance exploring attitudes towards life and death.  He claimed it made him sick, but he felt it was worth it for his art.<br><br>Since it has made him famous in artistic circles in Taiwan and China it is entirely possible that this was nothing more than a publicity stunt to garner public opinion.  You decide for yourself about Zhu Yu, but Taiwan is definitely not serving babies during the lunch rush!<br><br>Here are the hoax letters:<br><br>Don't get scared, but open your eyes to the facts going on in this world,<br>What you are going to witness here is a fact:<br><br>It's Taiwan's hottest food,<br><br>In Taiwan, dead babies or fetuses could be bought at $50 to $70 from hospitals to meet the high demand for grilled and barbecued babies...What a sad state of affairs!!<br><br>Please forward this message to as many people as you can so that it can be seen by the world and someone takes action on this.<br><br>It is against human race and unless we people of the world act to eradicate this custom, it will not end.<br>Even the word impossible says it is impossible but it's happening !!!<br><br>Here is a similar version:<br><br>Oh !! Oh !! How cruel can humans be???<br>Please finish your meal before open the files....(See attached file: Taiwan.jpg)<br>What u are going to witness here is a fact, don't get scared !<br>"It's Taiwan's hottest food..."<br><br>In Taiwan, dead babies or fetuses could be bought at $50 to $70 from hospitals to meet the high demand for grilled and barbecued babies ...<br><br>What a sad state of affairs!!<br>Please forward this message to as many people as u can so it can be seen by the world and someone takes action.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Due to the graphic nature of the photos, I have decided to link to them instead of posting them here.

            <div class='col-md body'>"The Chinese-language press quoted Zhu as saying during an interview on Wednesday that he intended to discuss life and death through his works.<br><br>By eating six-month-old human fetuses obtained from abortions, he posed a challenge to traditional ethics, he maintained to the press.<br><br>Born in 1970, Zhu said that he wanted to know if we could change our human culture in which we fear death and pursue eternal life.<br><br>To create Man-eater, he said he cooked the corpses of babies that had been stolen from a medical school.<br><br>Zhu admitted that the meat obtained from the bodies tasted bad, and said he had vomited several times while eating it. However, he said, he had to do so "for art's sake."<br><br>Though his works have sparked criticism, Zhu has achieved fame within China's avant-garde art circles.<br><br>In another work, Canned human brains, Zhu immersed human brains in glass jars, which also caused a stir.

            <div class='col-md body'>"<br>It's true (to the point of being a cliche, as a matter of fact) that avant-garde artists will do anything to shock the public, so we have to acknowledge the possibility that Zhu Yu is telling the truth Â— that he actually did cook and eat human fetuses. On the other hand, works of "performance art" are often strictly that Â— performances Â— and it has been argued that Zhu could have easily constructed his "fetuses" out of doll parts and animal carcasses, pretended to consume them in front of the cameras and made tongue-in-cheek statements to the press to convince everyone the exhibition was real.<br><br>That's a theory I'm inclined to agree with, because, frankly, if Zhu were telling the truth he'd probably be serving jail time. There's no reason to suppose China is any more tolerant of cannibalism than the rest of the world, and indeed the fact that Zhu's work was refused for an official exhibition bears that out. Plus, by his own admission, the fetuses Zhu allegedly cooked and ate were obtained illegally.<br><br>In early 2001, a Malaysian tabloid published some of the photos along with a story alleging that one Taiwanese restaurant's signature dish contains meat from human infants. Taiwan government officials demanded an immediate retraction, another indication that baby eating is not particularly well-accepted by the Chinese.<br><br>Shortly afterward, the same pictures showed up on a prominent Website (www.rotten.com), prompting an announcement in the British press of an investigation into their origins by Scotland Yard and the FBI. However, the owner of said Website maintains he has never been contacted by authorities from any country. When last we looked, the photos were still on display. "<br></div>
