            <div class='col-md body'>Before i go into the story , i'm goin to do a little introduction to avoid any confusion...<br>When i'm in primary sch , i was left into the care of my maternal grandma since both of my parents r working.... so i'll stay over at my grandma's house during the weekdays n my parents will bring me hm during weekends....<br>At a point of time , while i was in primary 6 , my paternal grandma hu was staying wif my parents was diagnosed hypertension n some other illnesses which i'm unsure of.... her days was numbered... whenever i went over to my parents' house , there was some sort of a strong medical smell which came frm my grandma herself.... not reli medical but i cant put tat smell into words.... And i remembered tat smell vividly , even till now....<br>After she passed away , the house where my parents n my grandma used to stay was sold away... And since then my parents moved to stay wif my maternal grandma....<br>During the last few months , out of a sudden i can smell my dead grandma in my parent's bedroom or mine , tat smell tat was edmitted frm her when she was alive.... And it lingers for a few mins before it went away.... i was puzzled so i went to my dad... he claimed tat he smelled it too.....<br>So does it mean tat my dead paternal grandma hu passed away abt 4 yrs ago , came for a visit... ?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Houdini and his wife agreed to an experiment in which the first of them to die was to communicate with the survivor.

The will come in the appearance as our loved ones who have died and say or do things etc..to deceive many. Once a person is dead, his spirit will end up in an eternal destiny and can never return. Fallen angels (demons) on the other hand have been banished onto earth from heaven and roamed the earth eversince and create troubles and evil....</div>
