            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I loved to explore old abandoned places , but so far i did not encountered anything for myself. I would love to join in such exploration if you guys are organising. Today i went to explored hillview area , those hdb flats going to be demolished and also hillview mansion.<br><br>Talking about Hillview Mansion , i went there with my 5 poly classmates before. We went there after games of basketball. It was me who suggest going there. We took 173 there , walking past a rows of shophouses and landed ourself on a road called Jalan Dermawan. The place is easy to find which the 45 degree steep row marks where the mansion is. We all walked up the steep road and saw the metal gates. The gates had spikes on the top.<br>At the side , there is a gap opening , no one dares to enter through there as it leads to the unknown. At last , we came to the idea of climbing up the gates , squeezing ourself through the gaps between the concrete walls n the spikes. Only the one guy backed up and offered to act as " guard " as there are people staying opposite the gate. We walked up the slipway which was lited by the full moon. When we were at the flat concrete floor which seems to be the entrance , my friend who is the leader , a bigger built guy , halted us. I am on his left side , wondering what is happening , thinking he might encountered something and was scared. He suddenly raised both his arms , pushing us back , seeing him nodding to something. And he stops. After he was like doing some prayer , he told us to go and get out quickly. We all so stuned n did what he say. After got out of there , we all rest at the park below. He was panting n seem breathless. We keep questioning him what was going on up there but he refuse to answer us. All he did was using his cigratted smoke and do so kind of blessing on us.<br><br>The weeks come by , i dreamt of that place. I went back to poly to ask those guys who enters who also say they having same dreams. One even has nightmares about it. This keep going on for about a week. Then till we cannot stand it and get our leader out for questioning. We wanted to know what he saw. Finally , he revealed that when he somehow stepped into the compound a mysterious force stopped him. Suddenly it all becomes smoky n hazy. A greyish figure appears infront of him and told him to get out as in we are unwanted. He seem got scared and obey that warning.<br><br>After that we dare not to talk about it and we stop dreaming about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My sis and hub went there in the afternoon.  Strange things is, they didn't know it is a haunted spot.  Went in to explore since the gate was open, but was stopped by a caretaker.  Is there really a caretaker in such a place?</div>
