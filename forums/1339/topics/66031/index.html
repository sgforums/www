            <div class='col-md body'>I was from Yuqun Primary in the past (currently the school is occupied by Fuhua primary, I think) just beside the current commonwealth sec.<br><br>The commonwealth sec history I dunno but I do can tell you the site that this school is currently on.<br><br>This current site used to be an old school abandon for years, in my time in primary (in the late 1980s), we used to venture to this old school.<br><br>Rumor is that this school has an old well and was rumuor to be haunted (supposely some students drown in it). Some say that, during my time in school camps, you can see white shadows at night lingering in the old school.<br><br>But my friends and I visited there but found nothing special but empty class, overgrown grass &amp; weeds, broken window planes and huge grasshoppers. Can't find the suppose haunted well though cause much of the school is overgrown with vegetation. But I can do confirm it is dammn creepy there.<br><br>Anyway, I think when I was in Primary 5 or 6, can't remember already, they tore down the old school. About 4 or 5 years later, the existing commonwealth sec was built there.<br><br>That is pretty much I remembered.</div>
