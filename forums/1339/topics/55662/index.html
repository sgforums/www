            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brief History:</span><br><br>Our first ghost outing was held way back in 27th June 03. At that time, response to our outing was lukewarm... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here were the people that turned up for the outing:</span><br><br>PaJeRoMiNi VeR 1.0<br>ratinacage<br>elementa<br>erijazz<br>En'<br>Sh|nyboy<br><br>6 people...not too small a group....but not too large either. Anyway, transport was just nice to accomodate all 6 of us so there were no complaints. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Our destinations for the night were Kranji War Memorial, Kranji Dam / Beach Battle Site and Lim Chu Kang Cemetary.<br><br>It was raining before the outing, but fortunately the rain stopped before we met up at 7pm. After a quick ice-breaking session at Kranji MRT, we were on our way to the first destination, Kranji War Memorial.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kranji War Memorial</span><br><br>The first thing we did upon our arrival was to try to open the main gate and the side gate. Hard luck as they were both locked. Luckily, we managed to find another way into the memorial (due to some quick thinking by Erijazz). Armed with our torches (mine screwed up at the last minute,as usual), we went into the memorial compound. Our eyes needed some time to get adjusted to the darkness inside the memorial although it was barely eight.<br>Anyway, erijazz's quick thinking led us into another way to get into the memorial. When we got into the memorial, it was dark all round. Quiet...serene...peaceful...we went into the main memorial building and started snapping photos of the area while exploring the surrounding graves....<br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid76/p3ec01d1ac4136f030b781404dd6b36ee/fb418dc5.jpg"><br>Top left corner: Vortex? or light reflection?<br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid76/p8a41032b4baf5c1ecddeb70c96c9b424/fb418dc7.jpg"><br>Orbs, one near the centre of the pic and the other in the background, against the night sky. There is also a small one near the top of the stairs.<br><br>Zoom in on the centre orb and you'll notice that there is a causasian face in the orb.<br><br>You'll have to focus slowly as the face is not that visible.<br><br>Notice a Robinson Crusoe - looking man with a beard and down-slanted eyes?<br><br>This could very well have been the orb of a soldier that died during the war.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010001_638x476.JPG"><br>Names of the POWs who died during the war inscripted into the main building of the memorial.<br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid76/pe29b596ecc969058b4064b375525f5d1/fb418dc3.jpg"><br>These benches are in every corridor of the main building. In the day, people sit on these benches to read the inscriptions on the walls.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010006.JPG"><br>More inscriptions on the stone walls at the rear of the main building.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strange Melody?</span><br><br>En', who was walking around the main building area with Elementa at first, suddenly stopped at a stone wall at the front of the main building. She stood there for a while before calling the rest of the team over. She then told us that she heard some kind of melody when she stood in front of the stone wall. I tried standing there and opened my ears to try to pick it up, but couldn't hear anything. Elementa, who was beside me, also did not manage to pick up any strange sounds. I took a snap shot of the area where En' heard the sound, which is this photo below.<br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid76/p893eeab015e69bdd41da0616bb9ae2f7/fb418dbf.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One last shot before we left...</span><br><br>Just as our group were getting onto our vehicles, I couldn't resist taking a shot of these banana trees which were planted right outside the gate of Kranji War Memorial.<br><br>When I came back and enlarged the photo, I was suprised by something I did not notice earlier!<br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid76/p2830eef90925646c453bd731e06e9320/fb418dbe.jpg"><br>Banana trees planted outside the memorial. Two orbs are spotted among the trees; one large on in the centre of the pic and a smaller one in the tree on the right side of the pic.<br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid76/p77f0f4020a93e0f1d1d47ab81085a404/fb4184c9.jpg"><br>Zooming in on the pic reveals spooky stuff.<br><br>The orb shows a lady with an opened mouth and fuzzy hair. Looks like she is smiling.<br></div>

It's also the place where the Japanese and allied resistance fighters clashed in a blitzkrieg which ended in a bloody massacre with heavy casualties for both sides.<br><br><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid76/p9b6de4d0842d3fefa045c7a2f07c7ecb/fb46ceff.jpg"><br><br>There was a small group of people fishing along the beach area.  Rat was exicted as he had discovered some new spots in this area to satisfy his hunger for fishing. We walked one round around the beach battle site. Here are the photos I snapped:<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010022_634x475.JPG"><br>An orb is visible on the extreme right side of the photo. A smaller one can be seen slightly to the left it.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/kdorb.jpg"><br>A 503% blow up of the larger orb on the right shows a solemn face looking downwards towards the right..see the sad eyes nose and mouth?<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010024_636x473.JPG"><br>Warning sign erected next to the dam area.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010029_632x474.JPG"><br>One of many shelters in the Kranji Beach Battle site area.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The playground</span><br><br>The playground, situated near the centre of the battle site, looked creepy at night. Hoping to capture some anomalies on film, i snapped away at the various playground structures.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010030_423x564.JPG"><br>If you notice closely enough, there is an faint orb floating above the slide..<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010032_476x637.JPG"><br>A faint orb floating in between the two swings.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010033_492x656.JPG"><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/pumpkin_kd.jpg"><br><br>After this orb was captured on film, we all agreed that it looked like a pumpkin head.<br><br>After blowing it up, i have to say it also resembles a zombie's head, the kind you see in cartoons.<br><br>There was an orb in every pic of the playground structures I took! No wonder these structures gave me the creeps when i looked at them!<br><br>Muttering a soft prayer for the lady and the kids who died at the dam, i hopped onto my vehicle. Lim Chu Kang Cemetary was next on our list. Erijazz, who was familiar with the Lim Chu Kang area, led the way with his trusty motorbike.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lim Chu Kang Cemetary<br><br>IWe were led deep into the cemetary paths by Erijazz. Looking to my left, where the tombs were, I noticed that there were several lighted lanterns hanging on the signs. These meant that there were many freshly buried in the vicinity. As we stopped along the road and got off the vehicle, the first immediate thing that we heard were dog barks. Loud fierce ones at that, coming from some graves quite near to us.<br><br>Walking among the graves, I couldn't resist taking some photos to see what I could capture on film. These photos below depict the spooky atmosphere the place was engulfed in.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010043.JPG"><br>Graves from Lim Chu Kang Cemetary. They were well maintained judging from their looks.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010036.JPG"><br>Walking among the graves. Most of them had the twin stone lions on them.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010034_637x478.JPG"><br>The best pic of the night. At first we thought it was just one orb for each grave...when I blew up the pic there were several more orbs behind!<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/lckorbs1.jpg"><br>As you can see, lots of paranormal activity among these few graves.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/lckorbs2_338x178.jpg"><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/lckorbs3.jpg"><br>These are the blow ups of the three orbs that are in the foreground of the photo. Can you see faces in them?<br><br>Listening to Ghost Stories among graves...a new experience..<br><br>After walking around the area, we settled down on a spot and erijazz and rat took turns to tell us some very spooky ghost stories. I tell you, listening to ghost stories among the graves was so much more scarier than listening to them somewhere else. You could feel goosebumps every now and then. Overall, it was a thrilling and fun experience!<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010038.JPG"><br>Cupboard near the graves with funny wordings on them.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010045.JPG"><br>This photo was taken at the end of the block. A floating orb(?) can be seen at the right side of the photo.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/lckorbs4.jpg"><br>Not sure if this is a floating orb with a trail behind it as it becomes too pixelated when blown up too much. This is the best I can get out of it....what do you think?<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010041.JPG"><br>Most of the graves looked well maintained and in mint condition.<br><br>Strange smell<br><br>Every now and then, we caught a whiff of a strange smell. It was not overpowering, but was quite pungent. En' said it smelt like sulphur. Anyway the smell was not constant, it came like in intervals. There was no wind when we were there...<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010044.JPG"><br>Taking a walk among the graves....<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010042.JPG"><br>There's a floating orb at the left side of the pic, above the reflections of the road sign.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/lckorbs5.jpg"><br>A blow up of the abovementioned area.<br>The two below are reflections of road signs. The one above them is the orb.<br><br><img src="http://www.urbanexplorers.ezhoster.com/P1010040.JPG"><br>A willow tree planted at the end of the block. Willow trees are believed to ward off evil spirits, and it is mandatory to wash one's face with willow leaves when returning from a funeral.<br><br>After staying there for almost an hour, we felt it was time to leave. It was overall a thrilling and fun experience, and I am proud of the intergrity and fearlessness of our team. The outing was a big success! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
