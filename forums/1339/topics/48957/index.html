            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted from another forum...<br><br>"Marbles from the floor above...<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>This topic is rather popular in hongkong. Since there is a radio station that have a ghost program every weekdays 12am to 2am, people will call in and share their stories.<br><br>A lot of topic will fall on the sound of marbles dropping on the floor coming from the above floor.<br><br>Not sure if people who live in landed property with 1 story will hear that or not, but certainly people who are living in flats hear it alot. I heard it before and now i still hear it, yet now, the neighbour above me have a little girl, so i cant make a big deal out of that. since it's possible that little kids might play with marbles at home.<br><br>Some people said that the sound could go on for whole night at certain time till certain time, or noise of hammer hitting the floor/wall. one of the callers said that the hitting wasn't just for that night, it lasted for a few weeks without stop, it would start at night.<br><br>the station host actually invites professionals to explain why there's those sound of marbles dropping on the floor. some pro constuction workers (what you call them?) will say that when they are building the high rise, they will mix some marbles into the cement or materials use for building. not sure why, but heard that it's for those young spirits to play with.. *shrugs*<br><br>even the host herself found some marbles in her wall when she accidentally knock a hole in her wall and some marbles came out.<br><br>I think if you guys think about it or took notice.. maybe you will remember that you always hear marbles dropping on the floor and continue by it rolling on the floor's sound.<br><br>there are also people saying that they are probably made by lizards. sounds like 'tsk tsk tsk"  but the sound made by lizard and the sound of dropping marble is totally different.<br><br>you guys think about it. and reply if there's anyone have any info to share.
