            <div class='col-md body'>Once again, FACT or FICTION ...<br><br>Authencity needs verification.<br><br>SIA have removed SQ006 permanently from their timetable.<br>The flight number is now replaced to SQ030. The return flight of SQ005 now SQ029.<br><br>From now on SQ006 is history. The flight number was change after SIA investigation team and management found something spooky happened on SQ006 final flight.<br><br>Believe it or not if you recall,<br>exactly 1 year ago on the date that SQ006 crashed, there is a Taiwanese SIA Stewardess who was murdered in a hotel in LA. The murder suspect was her fellow colleague, an Eurasian guy.<br><br>Remember???<br><br>Her naked body was dismembered and hidden in a cupboard.<br>Do you know that she was wearing red when she was flown back to Singapore on SQ005 via Taipei and wore red when she was buried?<br><br>Her mother wore red too to receive her body at Changi Airport.<br>Exactly 1 year (31 October) later on her death anniversary, the plane crashed in Chang Kai Shek Airport. Coincidentally, this was also the day the Eurasian steward was released from Prison.<br><br>The SQ006 TPE&gt;LAX sector ws schedule to leave TPE at 10.55pm. As there was an approaching typhoon. SQ006 captain &amp; Flight officers decided to board the plane and depart 15 minutes earlier. The L1 &amp; L2 door were not closed till 10.55pm (the origianl departure time).<br><br>Reason being the numbers of pax do not tally with the passenger lists in the economy section. One of the junior stewardess counted 5 times and advised her colleague that she cannot tally the pax in the economy secton. Both of them counted the pax again and confirmed an extra pax in the cabin. When they recounted the pax with the chief stewardness again the number of pax were correct.<br><br>Later the junior stewardess informed her chief stewardess that 1 of the lady pax sittig in 40A (front section of the economy class)was not there and cannot locate her in the lavatory either. The flight get push back as schedule. The 2 junior stweardess were among the casualties in SQ006 and none of the pax in the front economy section survived the crash. As for the chief stewardess, she suffered slight injuries as she was sitting in the business class section.<br><br>While preparing the flight for LAX in the business class section, one of the male inflight supervisor who can 'see thing' happened to see a lady flipping through the pax listing which was placed on one of the lst class cabin table. As there were cleaners in the cabin vacuuming, he did not shout at her but when he make it to the 1st class section, there were no sign of this lady. The male inflight supervisor was among the survivors unscratched as he was sitting at the back section of the economy cabin.<br><br>This story was brought up during investigation interview with the SQ006 crews. There was suspicion that the muder a year ago could have involved more than 1 person but they were let off.<br><br>It was belief that the accomplices could have been in the SQ006 flight.<br><br>It was understood that one of the male inflight steward who died in this crash is a buddy of the eurasian guy. The flight number was immediately changed after this interview.<br><br>... Beyond Believe ... Fiction or Fact???</div>
