            <div class='col-md body'>would like to share with you abt my encounter with the spooky kind during my ICT which hd justed ended.<br><br>During the last phase of our deployment exercise in sarimun avenue (spelling correct?) which is somewhere near LCK, our unit was depolyed at abt 9pm in this isolated deployment site.

The hq tentage next to us (abt 5 meters away) looks quite deserted. I realised I was all alone in my area. I was surpised that I did not expressed any sense of fear or loneliness, perhaps due to my exhaustion. Suddenly, I hv this urge to piss and I walked towards the bushes. As I pissed, I was chilled by this sudden strong cold breeze send cold shivers down my spine and I was absolutely terrified. My hair was stand on end. I quickly walked back towards the hq tonner. I climbed onto it and put down all my sbo and rifle and sat down trying to blank out. For no particular reason, I turned towards the bushes where i pissed and stared into it. To my horror, I saw a black human shape slowly being formed and in no time, more and more black human shapes appeared in the bushes and float/walk towards me. I almost wet my pants and told myself those black human shapes floating/walking towards me are probably the controllers and or 30 sce guys whose gonna attack us but I knew better that the nite attack was over an hour ago and it can't be them again!!!<br><br>The thought of these black human shapes coming for me and pull me into the bushes horrified me and it was then I regained my senses and quickly picked up my sbo and rifle and jumped out of tonner and ran towards the hq tentage.

A good fifteen mins or so passed and the other guys came back; I joined them and walked back towards the hq tonner and I stared into the bushes again and this time round, there were no black human shapes.<br><br>I kept thinking of this incident over and over again.

            <div class='col-md body'>On saw once at Pulau Ubin when I was in Sec 1. It was the second time on Ubin and I stuck liao bcoz I miss the last boat with my fds. When to make a call wif another fd on a public phone nearby....... and got farked by my mum, even lied that I was at my fds pl, bcoz my mun would freak out if she found out that I go Ubin at nigt with two fds w/o telling her.<br>Aft the call, walked back to the jetty, very dark... but found that the trip was longer than we recall. Then my fd freezed and grabbed my hand...I was wondering why.....Looked around wif the dim moon light.....<br>.......and I saw it.<br>A person wif long white hair and white long dress standing at a small hut surounded by lots of oil drums. Nv saw the hut on the way just now.....The dim moon light made the white figure glow...I could feel all the hair on my neck and hands stand. The figure was back facing my fd and me......I can feel that it was going to turn around anytime.<br>I managed to get my courage and dragged my fd along.......we just moved.....just wanna get out of there..about 5 minutes later..heard some sound and walked towards it..and suddenly we saw the jetty!<br>My fd and I rushed towards it and told our fd wat we saw. Together with our 3rd fd, we rushed back to where we saw the figure....But no sight of the small hut at all.....and I sleep at the cold jetty till day break...got the first boat followed by the first bus.....reached home and got fever immediately.</div>
