            <div class='col-md body'>about 4 to 5 years back, my friend had his 21st birthday party at east coast ( i'm not sure of the location as i was not there then ).<br><br>so my friend A, took pictures of birthday boy B and 2 other guys in the water near their chalet. seems everythin was fine but after they developed the photos, seems like there's a lady lookin at them from their back. from the pictures they could tell that the 'lady' was lookin at the guys but not the camera.</div>
