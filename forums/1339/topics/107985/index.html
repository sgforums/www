            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Does any one here, malaysian or otherwise give more details about this story?</strong><br><br>Nevertheless, there is an incident that happened on the highway that has<br>caught the attention of a lot of people. This incident does not happen along any of those crosswind sections but, instead, near the tunnel on the northern section of the highway. Before approaching the tunnel, drivers will go through highly areas with the hill on one side and a sharp cliff on the other. The sharp bends caused the authorities to put the speed limit down to 80kmph (110kmph for most of the highway).<br><br>This story went public the first time when someone called in to the radio during a ghost story programme. What make this story even more interesting are the several calls later from witnesses and relatives to verify that the story is true.<br><br>The incident happened on a Malay couple with a small baby. They were driving along the expressway on a late night. It must have been past 2am then and there aren't many private cars at those hours. As they got near the tunnel, their car broke down. Perhaps it is the hilly road, which put a lot of stress on the car, that caused the car to broke down more than anything else.<br><br>The man stopped his car along the emergency lane and got off the car to see if there was anything he could do. His wife was sitting at the back of the car with their baby then. He got off the car, opened up the engine and apparently was doing something there. The wife just waited in the car with their baby since she is the type of people who has the slightest idea about cars.<br><br>As the engine cover was turned up, the lady could not see what her husband was doing in front. Then, there was no noise at all. She started to get worried. Perhaps more worried about not being able to get out of there than if there would be anything wrong with her husband. Then the baby started crying. She carried her up and tried to calm her down. However, the baby kept crying and crying.<br><br>Afterwards, she noticed two police cars drove by. They slowed down as they past her. As she thought they would stop, the police cars suddenly sped off. Then she heard a shrieking break of the police cars ahead. Apparently, the police stopped their cars under the lights of the tunnel about 100 metres ahead.<br><br>Then, she started hearing the policemen shouting at her. They shouted at her and asked her to get out of the car and run towards them. She got panic upon hearing that. Then, worry about her baby's and her own safety, she grabbed her baby, got out of the car and started running as fast as she could towards the policemen. As she was running, they kept shouting at her to hurry and asked her not to look back. As she almost got to where the policemen were, she suddenly thought of her husband. She turn her head back to take a look while continued running.<br><br>To her horror, she saw three 'pontianak' (see notes) with lots of blood on their mouth. She saw one of them holding her husband's head and licking off the dripping blood while two others were busy sucking the blood from the man's body.<br><br>Two policemen, fearing that she may stop running upon seeing that, rushed to her and dragged her into one of the police car. They shot off as fast as they could after that. Seven policemen witnessed this incident. When the police got there, the man was lying there headless and 'bloodless'. The police, after interviewing the widow and the seven policemen who witnessed the incident, decided to close the case.<br><br>In the radio programme, someone called up later to say that he was one of the policemen there at that time while another called up claiming to be the victim's uncle. He said he refused to believe the story and had applied for the case to be reopened for investigation. He believes it was a murder case. Another caller said his sister, the widow, was distressed after the incident and he appealed to all listeners to believe that the story is true and be more careful on the highway.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Could be his version :<br><br>1) a couple was driving along karak highway(a place which ppl know its haunted) suddenly de car broke down so de husband went out to check wat happened...... (im not sure about de wife carrying a baby at this time) so he told de wif to stay in de car until he gets back not anyone so de wife did as he told (i think it was 2 in de morning so de husband went to de hills to get water for de radiator i think she waited and waited then some passerby went by n horned at her but she ignore them then a police came by n stop by dat time she panicked because she heard banging on the roof of the car so the policemen ask her to step out n run towards him......she was reluctant at first but she got out n didnt look back.......then when she reach the policemen she was shock to see dat a 'pontianak' banging her husbands head on de car......<br><br>2)the second is like de above but the pontianak wasnt there the husband was on top of de car lifeless........<br><br>3)I heard this true story from my fathers fren it happen last year i think on de way to genting hihglands but in de tunnel......there were road blocks at de entrance n at de end of the tunnel highway users weren't allowed to go tru the tunnel when they questioned the police he said there was a murder case but the true story is dat a couple was driving in de tunnel n then i dont know wat happen the wife wuz unconcious but when she recovered she ran out of the tunnel n told de police but instead of investigatin the police sealed the end n entrance they were scared to go in after a while the let passerby go in n they too went in to investigate so de police didnt find the husbands body but found his wallet n stuff so de police said it was burlary case BUT if it were which stupid robber would leave the wallet n stuff behind later when questioned the wife she didnt remember a thing a she remembered is dat she saw something n fainted</div>
