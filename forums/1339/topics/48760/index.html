            <div class='col-md body'>Explained...so that you'll know if you have captured something similiar on film.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="http://members.tripod.com/~cluricaun/photos01a.jpg"><br><br>Ectoplasm: This is an example of 'Ectoplasm'.  It will usually turn up as a 'milky/misty' substance in the photo, and cannot usually be seen when the photo was taken, although it can sometimes be seen when the flash of the camera goes off.  It is recommended that when one is attempting to take 'ghost photos', they refrain from smoking as the smoke may show up as 'Ectoplasm', as well as fog or exhaled breath if conditions are cold.<br><br><img src="http://members.tripod.com/~cluricaun/photos01c.jpg"><br><br>Orbs: This is an example of an orb.  These are fairly common and show up in photos as balls of light that may be either solid or partially see-through.  These balls of light, or 'ghost lights' as some call them, are formed from the evolution of vortices.  When one is taking photos, these balls of light may be visible to the photographer, or may only turn up in the photo.  This orb is in motion, hence the tail streaking behind it.<br><br><img src="http://members.tripod.com/~cluricaun/photos01d.jpg"><br><br>Vortex: This is an example of a vortex.  Many people put this down to a stray camera strap, however a vortex may twist erratically in the photo or the end may be visible, which cannot be explained as a strap.  Vortices are formed as a result of swirling columns of Ectoplasm and are common in the right hand side of photographs - hence the belief they are merely stray camera straps.  But when was the last time a camera strap showed up horizontally across a photo after twisting three times in the centre?  Not many!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some more pics, if you can't view the first few <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>accompaned by some theories on them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Ectoplasm</span><br><br><img src="http://www.castleofspirits.com/lisaghost2.jpg"><img src="http://www.castleofspirits.com/lisaghost3.jpg"><br><br>Here are some theories on ectoplasm-<br><br>1.)The theory I stick with is that ectoplasm is un-condensed spirit energy that has simply not yet formed into orbs or another anamolie.Many ghost hunters find this theory to be the most plausible!<br><br>2.)Another theory (well, not a theory but a fact) is that so-called "ectoplasm" is simply clouds or fog which can be outside that have an effect on the lens which can make these supposedly "paranormal" images appear.This has happened several times to me so make sure you go out when conditions are nice, no wind, fog, rain, dust, snow, cold weather, high humidity, etc. and DEFINETLY make sure that the lens of your camera is ABSOLUTELY CLEAN!In indoor investigations this problem is usually avoided.<br><br>3.)Another theory is that ectoplasm could be electro-magnetic energy from the Earth but I don't go by this theory since electromagnetic fields are usually are at their strongest during lunar cycles and cannot usually be strong enough energy-wise to be caught on film.If the electro-magnetic theory is true then why so many AUTHENTIC ectoplasm photos taken at times that do not coincide with strong lunar tides?I'll let the skeptics answer that one!<br><br>4.)Another plausible theory is that ectoplams is residual spirit energy that is left behind from a spirit that we recently in the area of where the photo was taken-this may coincide with Theory 1!<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Orbs</span><br><br><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/tx2/hauntedsugarland/images/playhouse.jpg"><br><br>1.One theory is that orbs may not actually be the spirits themselves but a residue they could leave in their wake (such as ectoplasm almost).Maybe this is why some of these orbs seem to be inside of a mist, it could be just a residue but who knows?<br><br>2.Another theory is that orbs are not paranormal but are explained through a rather more skeptical and scientific reason.Some scientists and skeptics theorize that orbs could just be so called "Earth Lights" which is electromagnetic energy eminating from the Earth.When the time is right the conditiions outside can make this energy apear on film and can even be seen by the naked eye.They especially appear when there are Lunar Cycles which affect the energy force of the Earth but then why do they appear so often and in such large numbers?Maybe this varies depending on the amount of energy the electromagnetic field possesses.I do believe that the elctromagnetic field of the Earth effects the way spirits can manifest their energy in some unknown way.<br><br>3.An actual fact involves weather conditions.When taking photos in the rain or especially in the snow it can get on the lens and may appear as orbs on film.This is a cheap theory because it cannot explain certain anamolies when conditions are nice.Yet again this is a common occurence but skeptics always jump to this conclusion.To avoid having this mishap, simply use common sense and only go ghost hunting outdoors when the conditions outside are permitting!If investigating indoors, make sure it is in a clean and dust-free area before you being photographing!A few simple precautions do go a long way!<br><br>4.Another is the lense flash theory.When you take a photo (especially at night) you can get a reflection of the flash off of another object and when it appears on film can turn out as orbs of light.Still, this doesn't explain the daylight occurences since flashes dont tend to reflect in the day since there is plenty of outdoor light and it is hard to tell a camera flash anyways in the light.Night photos can be a different story and you can usually tell if it is not authentic if there may be a flashy object in the background then you probably are having a len flash depending on you flash intensity and shutter speed.<br><br>5.)Dirty lenses are another explanation for explaining alledged "paranormal anamolies".A lens that has dust particles or streaks on it can cause them to appear as orbs or ectoplasm on your film or digital photos.Just make sure your lens is clean before every Investigation and you should avoid this common problem!<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Vortexes</span><br><br><img src="http://www.2xtreme.net/~embassy/aaaghostsite/f_chosey_01.jpg"><img src="http://www.2xtreme.net/~embassy/aaaghostsite/f_chosey_02.jpg"><br><br>Here are some theories on vortexes-<br><br>1.)Vortexes could very well be portals from dimension to dimension,which is the theorie I go with.This is probably the most well excepted theorie at the time of this writing.<br><br>2.)Another theory is that a vortex may be of an orb or orbs in motion.Maybe thats why it sometimes seems to look like that there are orbs forming a contrail in photographs but they could be just traveling through the vortex, either way both are plausible theories.The orb theorie could also explain why the vortex always seems to be bending in different directions.<br><br>3.)This is another cheap theorie that most skeptics go by is that the vortex could just be a camera strap.I viewed some pics in which the camera strap got in the way of the lens and it looks pretty convincing to the untrained eye.I rarely use cameras with a strap and if you do you should keep it out of the way of the lens.Usually when the vortex seems twisting or seems to look fake its probably a strap.This does not explain all the strange pictures of transparent vortexes and the orbs moving through them, though!Most ghost hunters can explain camera straps away the instant they see them!For example-if the "vortex" is too dark, has a uniform pattern like stitching, or is bent in such a way to suggest a camera strap.If you suspect you may have a camera strap and not a legitimate vortex then look for what I have mentioned and you can probably tell that which is legitimate from that which is merely a camera strap.The best way to avoid this is to simply remove the camera strap from your camera/s as I do or at least keep is away from the lens.You would be surprised how many reputable paranormal websites contain "concrete evidence" of vortexes that look remarkably similar to a Minolta camera strap.I don't recall real vortexes having a major brand name on them unless they're into marketing now:-)In any case, just use common sense!<br></div>
