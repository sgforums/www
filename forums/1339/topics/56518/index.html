            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Ghost of Sears Tower</strong></span><br><br>"In October of 1998, we came to Chicago to watch my son graduate... We visited many places and that evening we went to Sears Tower. We rode the elevator to the top, got out and walked around up there. It was dark by then so the view of the city from the Tower was breathtaking...I had my Nikon camera with me and we looked around to see if we could find anyone to take our picture up there together, but there was no one else on the floor where we were. I thought if we waited awhile someone would come but they didn't. So I took some photos out the window. Then I took two photos of my sons standing together in front of the window. After that I took a few more photos out of the window again. We had a great time and still didn't see anyone else up on that floor with us during our visit.<br><br>When I got back home, I got the photos developed. My sons and I were looking through them and were commenting on how they all turned out very well. Until we got to one photo of a man looking into the Sears Tower window! We all asked each other "Who's that?" My oldest son grabbed it and said "I want this copy!"<br><br><img src="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/timages/page/sears1.jpg"><br><br>No one knew who this was or how he could get into this photo! We tried all possible reasonings, reflection perhaps? That would mean that that man would have to have been standing somewhere to the side of in back of us. Again, we reminded each other that there was no one there at that time. We then looked closer at the photo, the man is leaning his arm on the rail. This rail is directly in front of the window and no space to stand between that rail and the window. Again he would have to be standing behind us leaning on a rail and there isn't any rail behind you when you are up there. It's just a hall with an elevator behind you and way far back from the window. I got out the negatives and looked and... #26 is this unknown, depressed looking, man looking toward us in the window. This man appears in none of the other photos as "reflections" and since I took the photos close together in time if he was there he would have showed up in the other photos. We cannot explain him and now call him the Ghost of Sears Tower.<br><br>I showed this picture to my friend, who said that this photo of the guy looked looked like he belonged in another era of time, like the seventies or eighties, because of the way he was dressed."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>So what do you think?
