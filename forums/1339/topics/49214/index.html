            <div class='col-md body'>Old photographs when developed showed photos that were never taken! Read on...<br><br>"In July 1997, I went to the guest bedroom to search for some 8mm film I had stored in an antique cedar chest. I was wanting to put our family pictures on a VHS tape when I noticed an old Kodak box with a roll of b/w undeveloped film on a self in the cedar chest. I had written "taken in our backyard Sept. 1969". Little did I know, the photos that should have been developed, were stored for 28 years! What a mystery these photos would become in my life. Considering what had developed in the circle of the lens that would normally be impossible for a $10.00 Kodak Brownie Hawkeye using 620 film. When I took the film to Main Photo in Yorba Linda, they told me not to expect success in developing because of age. But, what a surprise when 19 of the 20 developed successfully! That evening, my daughter Lisa started looking though the photos, saying they were typical photos of her at 5 years old, her dog, cat, swing set, just a normal backyard, with great clarity! "<br><br><img src="http://www.ghoststudy.com/monthly/oct00/indian16.jpg"><br>This was pic no 16 on the roll...<br><br>"But pictures 17 thru 19 turned out a bit different. As you can see, it appears that these last three pictures which were also taken in the backyard in 1969 display a different event of a time long ago when Indians owned the landÂ….truly amazing!"<br><br><img src="http://www.ghoststudy.com/monthly/oct00/indian17.jpg"><br>PHOTO 17,  was a total surprise! There are three Native Americans dancing in a row past my camera, only developed in the camera lens with the most unusual bright light on them. They appear to be Shamans preparing for a ritual. The third Native American is strangely in total shadow or silhouette, but there are bright feathers behind his head and in front of the second dancer. There is an extremely bright area, perhaps a pool of water, in the distant background. The circle of the lens is very profound, and natural light and shadow seem not of this world. The first Indian appears to be in a crouched position, wearing a dried half of a gourd on his head. I remember finding similar gourd plants growing in the sage brush on my grandparents ranch at the foot of Mount Baldy in San Bernardino County, here in California.<br><br><img src="http://www.ghoststudy.com/monthly/oct00/indian18.jpg"><br>PHOTO 18, becomes a greater mystery! There appears to be a ritual with an oxen at a lower level in the foreground. Possibly, there is a body tied to the back of the oxen. In the center there are two Shamans, on their knees, the one in the rear can be seen, but is transparent, both holding a long pole with a paddle on the end touching the back of the oxen. To the right there is an individual with a flute wearing a feathered skirt. There is a transparent figure right behind the flute player possibly holding a pole. This is where the mystery becomes stranger, there appears to be a Victorian woman, blonde hair, wearing a fur collared opera coat just to the right of the flute player, head tilted up, looking to the background. She seems to be sitting between more poles pointed in the direction of the oxen. The background seems distorted, with large areas of ectoplasm. To the left side of the Native Americans in the center, there is another feathered ghostly individual. To the right side of this individual, behind the oxen there is a female on her knees facing the oxen. She is transparent, but her long black hair is touching the ground. She is reaching for a pole structure behind and above her. Some have told me there appears to be an evil face in the foreground, over the oxen's back? The lens circle is still visible, but for some reason, fading. Shadow and light are unnatural, exhibiting an eerie scene.<br><br><img src="http://www.ghoststudy.com/monthly/oct00/indian19.jpg"><br>PHOTO 19,continues the ritual with a different view of the spirit village. Eyes go to the direct foreground where it appears to be a number of bodies being cremated, bathed in extremely bright light. The lens circle is fading, but still visible. To the left, one can see a captive in the complete darkness, nude with arms crossed and tied. There is a group of Shamans with poles to the right of the captive, walking toward the cremation scene. In the center, walking at an angle to the right blocked by a pole, is a Victorian man dressed in a tall Lincoln type hat wearing an opera coat. He is walking at a fast pace, oblivious to his surroundings. Some feel he is walking toward the Victorian woman in the previous photo. Instead of a Victorian setting, they are in an Indian village. Why are they there? Do they have some connection with my property too? Was there a rancho or Victorian home here after the Indians were banished? Why they are in the photos is a mystery to all that have studied the photographs at length. Behind him, appears to be individuals resting around an unusually bright pool of water, some brightly lit, others in shadow. There is a ghostly hut behind them with eerie orbs and ectoplasm floating above them. Going back to the right front, there is a ghostly pig sniffing a body that appears to be in the process of being cremated. To the right rear of the pig, there is a group huddled together with a small child to the far left of the group. Behind them are areas of ectoplasm with two bright balls of light above their heads. These balls are similar to the balls of light, coming out of the sliding glass door in the first photo, on the right side of Lisa. The negative of PHOTO 20, went totally black, possibly receiving a blast of bright light when the camera snapped the picture.<br><br></div>
