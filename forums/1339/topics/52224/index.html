            <div class='col-md body'>"Stigmata" is a Catholic phenomenon, used to describe the appearance of the wounds of Christ on a pious saint or Christian believer. It has been long debated by many who believe stigmata is instead a psychosomatic effect brought on by intense prayer. Stigmatics themselves are the main source of mystery for thousands of Christian believers. Are they really being punctured by the forces of God? Or are the wounds self-inflicted by those who harbor intense belief?<br><br>Stigmata can exists in two forms, visible and invisible. Invisible wounds are those covered by the forces of God for the inner comfort of the sufferer. Visible wounds appear on the side, palms, feet and head, and often appear and disappear in the space of a few hours. They can appear in one area alone, or all areas at once. Often, intense bleeding accompanies them, and the period before they appear is characterized by depression and weakness. Some stigmatics report feeling whips across their backs.<br><br>The first recorded case of these wounds was in the year 1222, by a man names Stephen Langton of England. St. Francis of Assissi, a famous follower of Jesus, experienced wounds in 1224.<br><br>The wounds can be experienced by both men and women. One of the more famous female stigmatics was St. Catherine of Siena, who experienced invisible wounds on her hands and feet. An interesting fact about stigmata is that it corresponds with the Passion and Death of Christ. Many wounds appear during the Last Supper, and the holy days of Easter. They disappear on Easter itself. Stigmatics reportedly speak to visions of Christ and angels during their trials, and smell strange scents. There are even reported cases of the blood types not matching between stigmata and wounds.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stigmata has been reported everywhere from America to Italy. There are cases in France, Spain, England, and Germany. The count of these victims has stopped at 345. It is believed that there are many more, however. Among this count are some of the most famous saints, such as St. Frances of Rome of Assisi, St. Gertrude, St. Collette, St. John of God, and St. Marie of the Incarnation. They span many religious orders, including Dominican priests, Augustinian monks and the Poor Clare nuns.<br><br>One of the more interesting theories to explain this phenomenon is the idea of "theological placebo effects." According to this line of thought, stigmatics are so emotionally and physically tied to their belief that they experience a state of mind similar to raptures. It is a fact that the immune system can be controlled by the waking mind, and in some cases, a heartbeat can be consciously slowed. It is this belief that leads some to think that the wounds of the stigmata are personally, albeit unconsciously, produced.<br><br>Stigmatics still exist today. There were a reported 20 in the nineteenth century, and their numbers are diminishing. One of the most famous current stigmata is Georgio Bongiavani, who has stigmata on his hands and forehead. His religious wounds cannot be explained by any sources, and according to several news reports they appear and disappear at will.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>INTERVIEW WITH A STIGMATIC<br><br><img src="http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/163/emilianochrist.jpg"><br><br>At 27, Emiliano Aden (Top) must be ArgentinaÂ’s youngest stigmatic. His life changed on the afternoon of 21 February 1996, a hot day by any standard; in Palermo, a suburb of the Federal capital Buenos Aires, it was an unbearable 42Â°C (108Â°F). Aden, then aged about 19, was returning home with his girlfriend from a 12-hour shift in a supermarket. As he parked his car, he felt a piercing sensation on his forehead. It was the beginning of his stigmata.<br><br>When I interviewed Aden in January 2001, his housekeeper showed me into his bedroom, where he was resting: Â“HeÂ’s in ecstasy,Â” she said. The wound on his left wrist began to ooze blood, which was disconcerting, but I asked him how he felt during the first episode.<br><br>Â“I did not feel dizzy Â– just pain, like heat. It felt as if something was moving on my skin. I asked my girlfriend if there was something there Â– she could see nothing, but I kept insisting.Â”<br><br>Aden felt increasingly anxious that something unusual was happening and drove straight to the Pirovano Hospital. Â“I was very nervous when we arrived. I asked my girlfriend to help me inside. I began shouting loudly. A nurse rushed over and made me lie on a gurney.Â”<br><br>I asked if the wound was visible at that moment. Â“Not then,Â” he said. Â“A physician examined me and asked for an X-ray, and analysis of blood and urine. When the results came back, he said I just had a severe migraine and prescribed an analgesic. My girlfriend called my brother to get the car as we wanted to walk back.<br><br>Â“I felt hot. I told my girlfriend that I did not want to be in the sun and we should cross to the shady footpath. I felt a burning sensation; it was not the sunÂ’s rays but like heat from a fire. I saw a tap in a garden and went in to wet my head. When the water touched me, I felt as if my head was opening.Â”<br><br>At first, the still-bleeding wound was not cross-shaped, but then the symbol appeared: Â“It was bleeding, but not ordinary blood. It was coldÂ… very cold.Â”<br><br>He ran off, and fainted when he got home. His mother, sister and girlfriend carried him to his room. They couldnÂ’t stop the bleeding, but didnÂ’t call a doctor. Â“My family are loyal Catholics,Â” Aden explained. Â“They called a priest who knew me but he didnÂ’t want to come.Â”<br><br>Initially, no member of the Church wanted to examine Aden Â– they assumed he had, blasphemously, made the wound himself. A week later, they wrote that they wanted to test whether real blood was flowing from his forehead. Aden was hurt and offended.<br><br>Aden shifted in his bed and asked me to leave for 10 minutes. From the door I could see him preparing to pray. When we resumed, I asked him whether the other stigmata were as painful.<br><br>Â“No. They are more like an inner pain, not born from the wrists but from my heart. The left wrist bleeds first. I often feel the heat. On the other hand, when I see something that I do not like, I feel deep cold.Â”<br><br>He stopped speaking and closed his eyes. As he pressed his eye sockets with his fingers, a drop of blood from his forehead fell across his cheek and stopped at the edge of his moustache. I asked if he wanted to stop, but he insisted on proceeding and we talked about the third stigmata, a deep wound which appears spontaneously when he prays.<br><br>Pointing to a photo of his girlfriend, he said: Â“That young girl always keeps me company. She is my only treasure and the only witness of my pains. I really feel pain.Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/163/bedman.jpg"><br><br>Adan believes the stigmata come from praying to St Luis del Palmar, a popular saint in rural Argentina and patron saint of Corrientes, the town where AdenÂ’s father settled in 1914 after fleeing the war in Europe and where Aden grew up. We talked about the symbol-filled dreams that disturb him each night. He is unconcerned by the ChurchÂ’s indifference; the Last Judgement does not depend on it, he said: Â“God saved us all a long time ago. Only the transformation of our individual souls matters now.Â”<br><br>He fell asleep and his housekeeper asked me, curtly, to go. As I left, I saw a queue of people waiting to be touched by the divine magic of Emiliano Aden.<br><br></div>
