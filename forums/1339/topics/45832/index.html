            <div class='col-md body'>Representing Fort Canning's military past are features such as the 19th century Fort Gate and the underground operations rooms (bunkers) of the Far East Command Centre. Here, in this "Battle Box" was where Lt-Gen Percival made the decision to surrender to the Japanese in 1942. All these attractions are linked together in the "19th Century Walk of History" trail.<br><img src="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/parks/loc/img-par-loc/par-loc-for_cann.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/parks/loc/img-par-loc/par-loc-for_cann2.jpg"><br>Another historical building is the former Singapore Command and Staff College.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fort Canning was formerly a British barrack before it was bombed by the Japanese during the Japanese Occupaion. The Underground Far East Command Centre, which is the well known Battle Box now, was built in 1936.  Not suprisingly,it contained an underground maze of 26 rooms and corridors 9 meters .<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/fort_canning/DSC03360.jpg"><br><br>Extracted off the net:<br>"Some public-accessible areas of the barrack have found to be used for ritual cult probably because of its unique spirit-filled sinister ambience."<br><br>Anyone knows whether this is true? Have the mazes of  the underground tunnels been used for satanic rituals before?<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/fort_canning/DSC03364.jpg"></div>

It is uncertain who was buried here, though some people believe this to be the resting-place of Raja Iskandar Syah, a ruler of Temasek.  Malay traditions state that the first Malay king and his chief minister were also buried there."<br><br>"Iskandar Syah was the last of the five kings who ruled Singapore during her golden age in the 14th century.  Singapore was attacked by an enemy but Iskandar Syah escaped and founded another kingdom, Melaka (Malacca).  Chinese records report that Iskandar Syah died around 1420, but do not tell us where he was buried."<br><br>"The Keramat came in a form of a terrace.  It has a 14th century-styled Malay roof called a 'pendopo', supported by twenty wooden pillars carved in a fighting cock motif of Javanese origin, shelters this structure.  On the day that we visited the Keramat, we saw two Malay ladies offering flowers and incense to the tomb.  By law, no offering is allowed and the public are prohibited from sitting on the tomb.  Would they be the descendants or relatives of Iskandar Syah?"<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/fort_canning/DSC03251.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/fort_canning/DSC03254.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/fort_canning/DSC03255.jpg"><br><br>"Answering mysteries:<br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently the star of David, the pentegram and the inverted pentagram are three different symbols...<br><br>This is the star of David.<br><img src="http://www.new-life.net/images/star.gif"><br>The Star of David (also called the Magen David, shield of David) is the symbol most commonly associated with Judaism today. The standard name for the geometric shape is a hexagram or six pointed star, usually composed of two interlocking equilateral triangles. Unlike the menora, the Lion of Judah, the shofar (ram's horn) or the lulav (palm frond), the Star of David is a relatively new Jewish symbol.<br><br>Concerning the pentagram. The pentagram below is the traditional pentagram with the five points of the star, one up, two down enclosed inside a circle. This style of pentagram has existed for countless thousands of years, first dating back to around 3500 B.C. At this time it was used by Mesopotamian rulers as a symbol indicating that their power encompassed the four corners of the known world.<br><br><img src="http://www.new-life.net/images/pentagm2.gif"><br><br>To the Hebrews the five points of the pentagram were tied to the Pentateuch (the first five books of the bible) and represented as a whole the concept of truth.<br><br>Perhaps most curious is the pentagram as it relates to early Christianity. Constantine the Roman Emperor who converted to Christianity chose to use the pentagram on his seal and amulet. Up until medieval times, the five points of the pentagram represented the five wounds of Christ on the Cross. During these times the pentagram carried no evil implications at all and in fact, in a lesser way than the cross, was symbolic of the Savior.<br><br>In the nineteenth century. Eliphas LÃ©vi, an Occultist, was the first to adapt the inverted pentagram as symbolic of evil. The illustration to the right shows LÃ©vi's two sketches of the pentagram. The first, his "good" orientation, featured the five points of a man within the points of the Pentagram. This is called the microcosmic man and represents the four elements, earth, wind, fire and water represented as the man's limbs with his head representing the spirit.<br><br>Next to the Microcosmic Man, he drew the inverted pentagram as the goat's head or Baphomet. In so doing, he formed for the first time, a differentiation between good and evil symbolized by the pentagram.<br><br><img src="http://www.new-life.net/images/pentagm3.gif"><br><br>The Baphomet sigil or simply Baphomet has become the official symbol of The Church Of Satan, which was started by Anton Szandor La Vey in 1966. Satanists and pseudo-Satanists have used this sigil all over the world.<br><br>If you look closely you'll notice that the pentagram drawn on the walls of For Canning is the inverted pentagram...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More stories and urban legends from the Keremat of Iskandar Syah...<br><br>"According to my grandmother, there used to be a beautiful, single and available, young lady living next door to her. She was the kampung's central attention. Men came to propose her hand in marriage but she was too young then and she had to reject them. One day, she fall terribly sick. Her tummy swelled and started to bloat badly, but strangely, the village doctor confirmed that she wasn't pregnant. Her mysterious sickness was soon associated to revenge.<br><br>Her family tried everything possible to cure her but to no avail. Finally, the decided to pay Keramat Iskandar Syah a visit. Miraculously, she was cured soon after. But being true Muslims, they knew that it was God who cured their daughter, not the dead Iskandar Syah."<br><br>Here another one:<br><br>"Sang Nila Utama, also known as Sri Tri Buana, was the Ruler of Palembang. He was sailing with his fellow loyalties when they were caught in a wicked storm. A royal advisor suggested for Sang Nila Utama to throw his crown into the violent seas, which he did. The waters calmed down immediately.<br><br>They landed safely on Temasek (now Singapore) where they met with the majestic animal, allegedly to have been a lion. Fascinated, Sang Nila Utama renamed Temasek as Singapura, or lion city. According to the Malay annals, Sang Nila Utama or Sri Tri Buana died and was buried in Singapore."<br><br>"The debate as to whether it is Iskandar Syah or Sri Tri Buana remains a controversy. May future excavation and research reveal the true identity of the keramat's occupant. Or, are they all actually the same person?"<br><br></div>
