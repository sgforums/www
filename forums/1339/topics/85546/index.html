            <div class='col-md body'>My school is located in Pasir ris. There are a few situations where i have come across the ghosts.Actually i can see them at times since i was 12.<br><br>1) During the first year, i was in the soft ball team and NPCC. everytime our class has home economic class, those who are in the NPCC are the only ones that hear a sobbing voice in the class. there once when the teacher was demo how to give the baby a bath, the false baby that she was holding is crying and tearing.<br><br>2) Then during a camping for the softball team, we were then allowed to use the home economic classroom which is at level 3 for our cooking. Then when everybody was crowding in the room, i was out alone at the corridoor....then i saw her. she was a girl around my age, but strange her uniform were very dirty and torn. then through her eyes, i saw nothing but sadness. the next moment she was at the level 1....calling out to me asking me to come.  Then the next thing i knew, my classmate slapped me. Then she told me she saw me crossing over the metal bar and about to jump.<br><br>soon after the school reopens which is in 2 weeks time, another gal from the express stream started screaming and crying in the home economic class. Then she fainted.<br><br>Soon, on a teacher day performance, a teacher performed a play based on the true story of the dead girl. it was as per wat the gal told me. she was raped by a construction worker when our school was partial in construction. i was the 3rd batch. she cut her wrist in the toilet at tat level. but she loved cooking so she in the home economic class.<br><br>3) there also another ghost in the technical block, he has his hand cut off in due to a mistake while doing his project.<br><br>4) Then during one of the NPCC camp that we have when in secondary 3, 3 of the gals including me were trying to sleep on the desks tat we placed together, and we slept with out lying on our torso meaning heads down. then i could hear a voice asking me to get up. i was scare and did not listen.<br><br>The next morning, one of us was having very high fever, then i thought abt that and ask my best friend, she said she heard the same thing. so the other gal must have listen to the voice.<br><br>5) during the 4th yr, it finally our turn to organise a camping for the juniors. as i have problems sleeping, i went to the 3 days camp after chalet of 4 days without sleep. I offered to do security duties for all my other NCOs. so i lead my juniors by batches per hours. different batches per hour,at 11pm everything was fine untill 12.15am, the lights on the level 4 computer room suddenly lights up even though the room is locked.<br><br>the juniors asked me how come the lights are on, i lied that that my OC just went up to type her report. The next day, i spoke to the teacher for computer club and confirm tat the room was locked.</div>
