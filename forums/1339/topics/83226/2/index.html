            <div class='col-md body'>I feel so sorry that I need to take such a long time to type the story. Because I really not free, since today I was mc, I take this time to type it out.<br><br>Here goes story no 1<br><br>This storey is from my mumÂ’s friend. She came to my house on day and she brings out this story. She have sixth sense. So she say this is happen to her one night when she was sleeping then she heard a lot of noise just rite beside her window. To what I know just right beside her window is a rubbish bin.<br><br>ThatÂ’s about midnight, she heard a lot of noise that sound like people are so happy and asking other to join in the fun or party. The information I have, that type of dirty stuff is can put under category of ghost. It actually is look like half human, in the night the head will fly off with the bodyÂ’s intestine and the body still left it at home, until morning is coming, itÂ’s will fly back to the body and join back. And it looks like a normal human in the day time. They can talk and walk can eat like us. So come to at night they only feed with blood. What I know people in my place call this as Â“si lo banÂ”. It is not the normal blood, they need dirty blood. Dirty blood means when girls having they monthly period, if the person never wrap it well or just throw is anyhow, the smell will attracted the Â“si lo banÂ” . Beside the period bloods the other is when lady giving delivery, the lady will bleed rite, and have the placenta. If the person never clean it up properly this will attract the Â“si lo banÂ”.<br><br>That time my mumÂ’s feel funny, she call her husband to wake up. And there want to go and check what happen, but she feel better not. And ask her husband to continue sleep, but turn up they can not sleep at all cause the noise getting loud. Then they know is the Â“si lo banÂ” having their party until before the sun is up. Then she goes out and checks what is attracting them to come. And she found out that, in the rubbish bin there is a bag of placenta and blood. Then she knew that there is a family near her house just delivery a bay past few days.<br><br>If you guy really want to know u can ask your malay friend I think the ladies is better, if I not wrong they don event throw the Â“patÂ” after they have use in outside. They will bring home and throw. If I not forget they need to wash the blood away in the Â“patÂ” then can throw away.<br><br>Sorry if there have any mistake in my typing.<br><br>i going to type the second storey that happen in one of the village in penang. the 1st storey is the intro only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now is the 2nd storey,<br><br>This storey is happen in a village in penang. The story goes like this there is a lady just delivery a baby. After a few days later her face was so pale.<br><br>One of her relative came to her house to give her a visit. When on of the uncle saw her face, he give out a scream and said Â“kali ini teruk, engakau mesti cepat cari jalan. Anda akan mati!Â” It means, Â“This is a big problem, you need to find a way to solve it or u will die!Â”<br><br>The family of that lady was shock, why the uncle say that. Then the uncle explains that there is something sucking blood. Then he ask them what time did they keep the cloths in? Then they told him sometimes they left it there until the next morning. Then they get a good scolding from him. He told them that no matter if there is a lady just give delivery or having their period, they need to keep the clothing in before 7.00pm. Cause the Â“si lo banÂ” will go to that personÂ’s clothÂ’s if there is a blood stand and never wash it clean. The Â“si lo banÂ” will suck then blood from the blood. Then after sometime, the person will lack of blood and die.<br><br>Then the family of the lady asked that uncle if there is any idea how to solve it. Then he gives an idea, since there are staying in a fishing village, there is a lot of fishing net and fishing hood. They need to set up the trap at evening. They need to do that because they need to prevent anyone knows they are doing this, or the Â“si lo banÂ” will not fall into the trap. They are guessing who the person is doing this to the lady.<br><br>They hang the ladyÂ’s cloths and put the fishing net around the place. Then they hide in the houseÂ…Â…Â…Â…. When midnight comes, they heard a noise outside the house. They heard something was trapping and they can hear voices of crying and screaming of pain. Then the entire villager heard that voice, no one dares to come out to see what was happen.<br><br>When the sun is out, they saw a fire was burning inside the trap which they have set up.<br>Then they know why the thing is screaming because its intestine gets hooded by the fishing hood. And they found out the Â“si lo banÂ” is a macik of this village. Then they rush to her house and found a body without intestine and head sitting on the chair.<br><br>If there is any spelling mistake please forgive me<br>Now is the 2nd storey,<br><br>This storey is happen in a village in penang.
