            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Drive That Never Happened<br>Sean H., U.S.</strong><br><br>"While not experiencing the following anecdote directly, I have reason to believe in its merit due to the fact that several different individuals, my mother included, all tell me the same exact details when questioned about it seperately... Either way, it's odd, so take it for what it's worth:<br><br>While in her early twenties, my mother was fond of travelling with friends up north to a particular cabin in the heavily forested woods of northern Michigan.<br><br>The entire group of friends were extremely familiar with the place, seeing as how they went there all the time.<br><br>The cabin itself was situated about ten miles from a small logging town.<br><br>Here are the odd events as everyone tells them to me:<br><br>After spending a night and the following day there, the group decides to take off the following night.<br><br>As they are driving down the lonely 10 mile forest road, which, by the way, is simply a straight shot to town, no turns or curves, they pass the road sign that indicates that they are 5 miles from the town.<br><br>As soon as they drive past this sign, the radio stops.<br><br>They end up driving on this straight road for about two hours, the town never in sight.<br><br>After the two hours of driving on this straight road, they pass the sign that says they are 5 miles from town, AGAIN. And to make matters even more confusing, as soon as they pass this sign, the radio starts up again at the same spot in the same song that it stopped on.<br><br>Naturally enough, they never travelled to that cabin durning nighttime ever again."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Silence Bubbles<br>J., New Jersey, USA</strong><br><br>Two inter-related experiences.<br><br>First was when I was about 10. On the bus on the way home from school. For about two seconds, all sound completely vanished. Cars outside the window, kids shouting, etc... All went 100% silent. It could have been me except... I heard a pupil about 2 seats behind me say, "Woah, what was that!?" Just after it happened.<br><br>I had nearly forgotten about this until about 15 years later, A buddy of mine said, "Did I ever mention the time that I experienced this weird silence bubble?" He related a VERY similar story, that he had, also on a school bus - in a different part of the country years later (he was a teenager when he encountered his "sound bubble"). He knew nothing of my experience when he related his.<br><br>Can we deduce - certain makes/years of busses have an acoustic peculiarity? Their engines emit a particular wave-form that periodically blocks sound when other factors (X) are in place?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Pasir Ris Tower<br>girlgirl11, Pasir Ris </strong><br><br>"This incident happened to me and a few others about a year ago.<br><br>My cousin, boboy, me, some of his friends and my other cousins were walking to the Costa Sands Resort as it was my grandma's birthday. Its was dark except for the moonlight. Some of boboy's friends lit cigarette so that we could see better. By the time we reached there,it was 11.15pm<br><br>After we ate, I asked permission from my mum to allow me to go and take a stroll with the rest of them. My mum allowed so we decided to take a walk. Suddenly,an idea struck to one of boboy's frenzz,Hakim. He suggested that we would go to the tower nearby. So,everyone agreed. We took our torchlight along. Before entering the the area, we recited some prayers. Mat,one of boboys frenz told us not to look behind if anybody called.<br><br>Before entering the tower, there will be a maze. We walk there three in a row. I was lucky enough to get in the middle of the row and at the same time, with my boyfriend,Zaini. So when we entered the maze, we saw this 'apek'(old man) digging a hole on the ground. We decided to ignore him as we taught he was a cleaner or something. So we continued walking.<br><br>After reaching the end of the maze,we were relieved. But when we looked up at the tower, we saw a boy, maybe in his teens wearing black t-shirt and pants. He was like standing at the tip of the cement his hands wide apart. Then suddenly, he jumped,but when we looked downwe saw nothing. We were shocked that we ran back to the maze and quickly back to the entrance.We saw the old man again, but this time staring at us.<br><br>We quickly head 4 the entrance. When we were running, we saw an eagle fly past us. We ran as fast as we could. When we reached the Costa Sands Resort, we went to the side of the swimming pool, we told each other what we saw. Some of us were shocked when Kamarul, my ex boyfriend said tat he saw a womens head despite others saw an eagle. He said that he had forgotten to recite the prayers. So, if anyone dares to got there, BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mount Ophir</strong><br><strong>Anonymous</strong><br><br>"I heard the first story from my English teacher in Secondary two. According to her, a group of 10 Singaporeans (all guys) went on an expedition to Mount Ophir as part of some formal training. (That trip took place in the early 80's, so it was a really long time back) While they were up there, they decided to take a shot of themselves together so the 10 guys arranged themselves into three neat rows to pose in front of the camera.<br><br>When the picture was developed, they realised that there were actually 11 people in the picture! The extra person turned out to be a very, very beautiful and sexy looking woman and she was standing directly behind one of the guys with her hands leaning on his shoulders. None of the team members could recall having seen this woman around at all. The guy whom the lady was leaning on, said he didn't even feel that there was anyone behind him at all!<br><br>Lots of people believed that this lady is a pontianak and that these beautiful women/spirits are interested in the souls of vulnerable guys. Although this hair raising affair did stir up some excitement and commotion amoung his friends, the mystery of this beautiful woman never came to light. People even started teasing this guy about being chased by a 'pretty young thing' whom he can't even see.<br><br>One year later, this guy decided to go to Nepal for a trekking adventure. This time he went alone. As he was on an economical budget, he decided to take the long way by boarding an inter-connecting flight from another part of Asia. (can't remember where) He boarded some Airbus (not sure if it is Air India or Scandinavian Air) but the trip was never sucessful. The plane didn't make it and crashed into the mountains. He was the only Singaporean on board. His friends believe that it must be this pontianak who claimed his soul but nothing can be proven at all. Details of this story cannot be confirmed because I heard this story so long ago..."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Here's a classic Urban Legend from the US...</span><br><br><strong>Gecko! Gecko!</strong><br><br>"In downtown New York, at a somewhat trashy apartment, there lived a man named Howard. He was a young man, in his mid-twenties, and had a terrible fear of cockroaches. Well if you've been to New York, and maybe live or stayed in a rundown hotel, you know how many cockroaches there are. Too many to count!<br><br>Howie had just come home from work and was looking for a bit of relaxation. All he wanted to do was get a bowl of ice cream, sit down and read the newspaper. He started raiding the messy cabinets and sink to look for a bowl and a spoon. He found the bowl, got out the ice cream and opened a drawer to get the spoon when, Surprise!! Out jumps a big juicy cockroach. After jumping twenty feet in the air and grabbing a spoon out of the drawer, he sat down to calm himself. "God forsaken roaches!" he yelled, while slowing his heartbeat, just as another cockroach crawled between his feet. " There's got to be something I can do to get rid of them." Just then, as he was getting his ice cream and reading ads in the paper, one specific ad caught his eye. "Got Roaches? We have a solution! Come down to Sam's Pet Club today and get yourself the natural predator of the roaches, a Gecko!"<br><br>"What in the world?" Howard thought. He read on: "That's right! A gecko! Follow the directions below to get your very own live cockroach eliminator! Then ask our friendly staff how to care for and what to do to get rid of your cockroaches." "Ya right. That gecko will probably eat me while I sleep." he said as yet another roach scuttled across the floor. He felt sick. He thought it was worth a try, so the very next day he followed the directions on the ad to the pet store.<br><br>He asked about the geckos and the staff told him what to do with a gecko and how much they were and, soon enough, he was driving home with his very own gecko. "Great," he thought "yet another little critter that is going to be loitering around in my house."<br><br>He got home and did just as the woman at the store told him to do, and let the gecko go. He saw the gecko run under the refrigerator after the nearest cockroach it saw. "Well, at least he is doing his job." he said after he heard the loud "GECKO, GECKO," sound that geckos make when they swallow.<br><br>Days went by, and Howard saw fewer and fewer roaches. He didn't like the gecko running around his house all the time, but what's one gecko to a thousand roaches? He shrugged it off, and tried to suck it up. One thing he did do, however, was close the door before he went to bed. But no matter what he did, somehow the lizard always got into his room.<br><br>One day after work, he was getting some dinner when he saw the gecko chase one of the last cockroaches on the house under the refrigerator. He saw the cockroach scurry under it with the gecko far behind struggling to go under. That's when Harold realized. It was getting bigger. That night he did everything he could to keep the Gecko out of his room. He fell into a deep sleep.<br><br>All the police found the next morning was a small stain on the bed that looked like blood. They searched everywhere in the house for Harold after a worried neighbor herd a slight scream and a haunting "GECKO, GECKO," that morning, but no one could find anything. No Harold, No Gecko, No cockroaches, nothing. They left that house confused and wondering, never to see Harold again. The only place they didn't check was under the bed, where the gecko was - big as ever, and full at last."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Here's another classic Urban Legend~!</span><br><br><strong>Humans can lick too</strong><br><br>A young teenage girl lived at home with her mother, father and her much loved pet dog.<br><br>Being 16 years old her parents decided that she was now old enough to be left alone without a minder while they went out for the evening. Although there was some concern about leaving a young girl in a house all by herself, they knew she was sensible and would behave. And besides, she did have the pet Alsatian dog to look after her and keep her company.<br><br>The parents left for the night, leaving Emergency phone numbers and supplies for the night. The girl was thrilled to be spending her first night alone in her parents house and mainly watched TV until 11.00 rolled round.<br><br>Deciding she was tired she moved upstairs to her comfy bedroom to retire for the night. Her trusty Alsatian dog following her all the time.<br><br>After being asleep for a short time she awoke to a dripping noise coming from the bathroom. Not afraid, but curious as to what the noise was she lowered her hand down beside her bed to gain a little comfort from the Alsatian. She felt the warmth of his soft tongue as he licked her hand, showing her that he was O.K and that everything would be alright. Feeling assured she drifted off to sleep once more.<br><br>Waking once again to the sounds of the dripping tap, or whatever it was, in the bathroom she instinctively dropped her hand down to pet her dog. Once again her dog offered up the loyal companionship that only a much trusted and loved pet can, and licked her hand and she once again fell asleep.<br><br>For the last time she woke up again, that annoying noise was still going, she reached for her dog but found he wasn't there. Wondering where her parents were at this time of night (it was about 3.30am by this time) and looking for her dog she walked out into the bathroom.<br><br>A horrifying sight met her, the dog had been mutilated and was creating the dripping noise, as blood slowly fell and pooled on the floor below. Screaming she ran back through the house and attempted to call the police. The phone was dead, and she turned to suddenly see her parents also mutilated behind her. Her screams could be heard as she looked down at a note written in blood, it read:<br>"Humans Can Lick Too My Beautiful".<br><br>She then runs madly for the stairs only to see a black figure waiting with open arms to catch her.<br><br>Variations on this story:<br><br>The girl is baby sitting some children for the night, she walks outside to throw out the garbage. The parents have left the home pleading with the young babysitter to beware if the air sirens sound as this is warning that a criminal has escaped from the local asylum.<br><br>While throwing out the trash the siren sounds, the girl runs inside locking the doors and windows. She takes comfort from the dog licking her hand on the couch. Same ending.<br><br>Written on bathroom mirror beside dog is "Maniacs like hands".<br><br>She views long haired, insane type man under her bed when lightning flashes as she is petting him. After police arrive they find he was living in his own room in the attic.<br><br>Girl ends up being pulled under the bed by maniac and killed.<br><br></div>
