            <div class='col-md body'>According to the old Chinese legend, over one hundred pyramids built in China are evidence of visits paid by aliens to our planet.<br><br>At the very beginning of the century, two Australian merchants traveled to the vast plains of Sichuan in the central part of China, where they discovered over one hundred pyramids. The Australians asked the superior of the local monastery about the pyramids, and the superior said that they were very old. The first record of the pyramids was written over 5,000 years ago; therefore, it is very likely that they are even older.<br><br>The merchants also discovered that the pyramids belonged to the epoch when China was ruled by ancient emperors who believed in the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. Moreover, the emperors themselves insisted that they were ancestors of the sons of the sky, who had landed the Earth on iron dragons. Aliens are alleged to have been the constructors of the pyramids.<br><br>In March 1994, Austrian Hartwig Hausdorf made a trip to the area close to the city of Xi-an, the capital of the Shaanxi province, which is situated in the central part of China. These territories were closed for foreigners. During the tour, the Austrian discovered six legendary pyramids. Hartwig Hausdorf organized another tour to China in October 1994, this time with a video camera. Hausdofr managed to shoot an 18-minute film. When Hausdorf returned home, he decided to watch the film that he had shot in China. However, the Austrian was extremely surprised to see more pyramids in the background. He counted over 100 pyramids standing in an area of 2,000 square kilometers.<br><br>Some of the pyramids are currently in very poor condition, as they were plundered by the local citizens. The pyramids are mostly built of loam and soil; some farmers destroyed the pyramids to take the loam and soil to their fields and used them in the farms.<br><br>When Hausdorf decided to continue his investigation of the pyramids, he faced lots of problems. Although he was allowed to continue his investigation, the Chinese government banned any excavations in the area.<br><br>What kind of constructions are these pyramids? The heights of the pyramids situated in the Sichuan plains are from 25 to 100 meters, with the exception of only one pyramid situated to the north of the rest constructions. It is the so-called Great White Pyramid, which is said to be about 300 meters high. This pyramid can be truly called the mother of all Chinese pyramids.<br><br>Recently, the Chinese authorities declared the area where the Great White Pyramid stands a closed region, as a launching pad for rockets is situated in that region.<br><br>The Chinese pyramids astonishingly resemble the pyramids in the Central America. Is it possible that the South American pyramids were also constructed by the sons of the sky?<br><br>Translated by Maria Gousseva<br></div>
