            <div class='col-md body'>My name is Brian and I live in Gravesend, Kent in Southeast England. I have today (6/9/03) returned from Wiltshire with my girlfriend (who is a big fan of Coast to Coast and listens every day when she is at home in Edmonton, Canada).<br><br>We went to Wiltshire to look at Stonehenge, Silbury hill and Avebury . While in the area, we visited the Crop Circle CafÃ© and was informed of the circle at Windmill Hill just two miles away. I was aware a new circle had been reported, but didnÂ’t want to lift my girl's hopes in case I couldnÂ’t find it.<br><br>This circle (pictures below) had appeared Saturday and upon arrival, was in very good condition. The circle is located on a slight hill. When approaching the circle, there was a cool wind. But once inside the circle, the wind was warmer. It also appeared non-directional. Always blowing from my right to left, regardless of where I was standing and in which direction I was facing. Everything seemed so at ease within the circle and for the 30 minutes or so I was there, I was at total ease with myself.<br><br>The roots of the crop were also interwoven amongst themselves in a very mechanical way. I also noticed that when I stood with one foot inside the circle and one foot outside, I was feeling very strong resonance through my feet. We also met a family from LA at the circle, and the wife also confirmed the vibrations (they are also coasttocoast fans).<br><br>Another very weird thing occurred. My girlfriend's camcorder battery was half full when we went into the circle (45 to 60 minutes worth of battery power) but once inside, it was emptied completely in 6 minutes. There was not even enough power to switch on the LED light on it. It was as if the whole battery was disconnected. Absolutely no power.<br><br>I am now totally convinced that this circle was not man made. It is too perfect and too precise. When at ground level, it is very hard to work out where you are and what part of the circle you are in.<br><br><img src="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/timages/page/windmillcircle1x.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/timages/page/windmillcircle2x.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2003/windmill/windmill2003d.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2003/windmill/WHillConnector060603.jpg"></div>
