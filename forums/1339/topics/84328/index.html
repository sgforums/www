            <div class='col-md body'>Written by some dude:<br><br>"I avoided all the sensationalist garbage centered around the World Trade Center attack but this stuff was kind of strange.<br><br>Several people who were on the ground at the site reported that when they saw the first plane hit Tower #1, they also saw a 'projectile' which passed the plane and seemingly landed on the ground. Speculation began about a missle, and asked if the military had somehow known what was about to happen and tried to shoot the plane down. This was denied by the overnment, and the people who had seen this 'missle' were told it was probably falling debris. This is the middle of jam packed New York City...no one's going to be firing missles that might land on yet another sky scraper and take 4 city blocks with it. Ok...made sense.<br><br>As the story got out, those who had been at the site started checking their various video camera and digital films frame by frame and turned up proof of this 'debris' and another "UFO" flying past the WTCs at the time of both attacks. No one reported seeing these with the naked eye and there<br>were no planes or helicopters in the area; having been banned from entering the airspace. These objects were only visible on a few frames of SOME people's videos. They were moving incredibly fast (as I'll show on Video #2) and vanished even though there would seem to have to be a point<br>of impact to some of them surely they'd hit another building, land on the ground or destroy something away from the immediate site when it landed? Something else was going on out there....are these UFOs? Did "they" know ?<br><br>This is the one I saw on TV once or twice before it (not surprizingly) wasn't shown any more. It wasn't until people remarked they saw a "missle" that the mainstream press admitted that they, too, had caught this on some tapes. They speculated it was 'debris' falling from the first tower - then why didn't it fall straight down? or part of the 2nd plane shearing off as it hit the building -then why didn't it land anywhere? And how did it get way the heck on the FAR side of the other Tower, already burning? It's as wide AS the building yet no one saw it with the naked eye. Or is it?<br><br>Which made me think it's elongated due to it's speed being 'smeared' by the camera. Yet the camera froze the blast of the jet impact ball of flame, and you know how fast that was going. Compare the frames and notice how far this object got in the time the explosion flame barely even had time to move<br><br><img src="http://www.anomalies-unlimited.com/WTC_UFO/IMAG0005.GIF"></div>
