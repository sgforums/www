I was too young to read and understand newspapers back then, that's probably why I missed it I guess.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, such cases are not uncommon in the US, several cases have been reported to the press, albeit being blasted at by skeptics for being fake. Many"victims", so to speak, of such cases have admitted to making up the stories after being questioned.<br><br>I'm not saying that this isolated PIE case is made up or something like that, but in the space of 15 years, nothing similiar had happened along the same stretch, so I'll take this story with a pinch of salt.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
