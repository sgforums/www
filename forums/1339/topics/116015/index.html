            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jigsaw Mystery</strong></span><br><br>There was an old lady who lived on her own in a very foggy part of Dartmoor. She had lived alone for fifteen years, ever since her husband had died in a mysterious car accident. However, the car accidenet is not my present purpose on which to dwell. You see, this old lady had a passion for jigsaw puzzles, it probably came with the stigma of being alone for she had no family or friends and lived in a very secluded spot. Every night she would sit at her dining room table and work on her current jigsaw puzzle until it was finished, then she would start a new one.<br><br>However, there came a night, a rugged, windy, stormy winter night when she ran out of jigsaw puzzles. She was extremely upset as she had nothing else to do (this was in the days before TV and her radio had no signal in so removed a place). She was just thinking of going up to bed earlier than usual when she heard a thud, as if something had fallen onto the mat from the mail flap.<br><br>Intruiged, the old lady hobbled downstairs to find a rectangular parcel had been put through the door and now lay, invitingly, on the mat. She picked it up, carried it upstairs to her dining table and opened it to reveal a new jigsaw puzzle! It had no picture of what it made up on the front but the old lady didn't care. Neither did she care who had sent it, she was just so happy to have another puzzle to do.<br><br>It took her about an hour to complete it but as she began the get the entire picture her consternation grew for she saw that the picture being made up was that of the very room in which she now sat. Then, she gasped, for she realised that the woman sitting at the table in the picture with her back to the window was a picture of her!!! Her fingers tremeled as she placed the last four pieces of the puzzle to reveal a picture of a crazed madman at the window staring into the room, holding an axe!<br><br>The last thing that old lady ever heard was the sound of breaking glass...<br></div>

He explained that it wasn't anything she'd want to watch and urged the woman to go home and leave the Doberman there overnight.<br><br>When the woman returned home, the phone was ringing off the hook.

In preparation for their upcoming midterms, the studious roommate (Jane) planned a Friday night of studying while the partier (Mary) decided to go to a frat party.<br><br>The two were friends, regardless of their differences, and while Mary got ready for the party, she tried to get Jane to go. Jane insisted on studying and Mary set out for the party. Jane agreed to leave the door unlocked, so that Mary wouldn't have to bring her keys.<br><br>While Mary was at the party, she met up with another group of friends and they convinced Mary to stay at their place for the night. Mary agreed but had to stop back at her room to get her keys. It was about 2 a.m. when Mary got back. She snuck in and grabbed her keys, leaving the lights off, not wanting to wake her roommate.<br><br>The next morning Mary walked home, intent to ask Jane for some study help. When she reached her room and opened the door she saw Jane murdered at her desk! Written on the wall in Jane's blood was "Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light?"<br><br>Variations:<br>This story has also been set at a summer camp where the two girls were bunk mates and one went back to get her purse.<br>Sometimes the police are already at the dorm room when the surviving roommate returns and they reluctantly let her in to see the message on the wall.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broiled Diver</span></strong><br><br>Fire Authorities in California found a corpse in a burnt out section of forest whilst assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The body was dressed in a full wetsuit, complete with a dive tank, flippers and face mask.<br><br>A post-mortem examination revealed that the diver did not die from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Investigators then set about determining how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire. They found that, on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast - some 20 MILES away from the forest.<br><br>The firefighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large buckets. The buckets were dropped into the ocean for rapid filling, then flown to the forest fire and emptied. The diver was scooped out of the ocean, into the bucket and dropped over the fire.<br><br>Apparently, he extinguished exactly 1.78m (5'10") of the fire.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Alligators in the Sewer</strong></span><br><br>It used to be a trend for parents returning home from Florida vacations to bring back small, baby alligators for their children to raise as pets, particularly in New York. Once the babies grew up, they were no longer cute or convenient. So, to get rid of them New Yorkers resorted to flushing the little guys down the toilet.<br><br>Some of these washed up gators survived in the city's sewer system and began to breed. Now there are full-grown alligators living under the streets of Manhattan. It's been said that the animals are blind and albino, having lost their eyesight and the pigment in their hides because they live in constant darkness.<br><br>Variations:<br>The alligators grew to monsterous sizes and are "mutants."<br></div>
