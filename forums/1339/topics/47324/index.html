            <div class='col-md body'>"Perhaps not many Singaporeans know this.  There are strange "signs" at Punggol Beach similar to that of the mysterious Crop Circles in Britain.  Where exactly is it?  It is "embossed" on the western part of the inland beach as shown in the 2nd photo with an arrow.  What Sign is it?  This is something we tryed to analyze in this article.<br><br>The Sign is made of two concentric circles with their perimeters approximately 3 feet apart.  There are other straight lines cutting through these circles, as shown in the 3rd and 4th photos.  The straight lines were tire marks of vehicles, as you can see the tire marks imprinted on them.  However, the two big circles still remain a mystery.  The circles, at  first glance look a little like tire marks, however, upon closer examination, you would be able to see the differences.  The following is the analysis of characteristics of the mysterious circles:<br><br>(1) The groves of the circles are smooth without any tire patterns. The groves are narrower and deeper than tire marks.   When you look at the intersection of the tire mark lines and the circles, you will see that the tire marks are overlapping on the circles.  That meant that the circles had been there before the vehicle ran through them.<br><br>(2) The gap between the two circles is merely 3 feet apart.  We all know that normal vehicles would have a wheel chassis of at least 5 feet, unless we are talking about a Mazda 121 or smaller, or a golf bugger.  So it is unlikely that the circles were made by a vehicle turning around.<br><br>(3) The circles are almost perfectly round.  They look as if some machinery was used to draw the circles in the sand.  If they were created by hand, the circles would not be as symmetrical and we didn't see any traces of foot-prints near the circles.  It looked just like a mark was left there by a huge chop stamping onto the sand from thin air!"<br><br><img src="http://100megs14.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/signs/DSC00795.jpg"><br>The first half of the beach near the jetty.<br><br><img src="http://100megs14.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/signs/DSC00811.JPG"><br>The location of the Signs is in the 2nd half of the inland beach.<br><br><img src="http://100megs14.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/signs/DSC00852.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://100megs14.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/signs/DSC00853.jpg"><br><br>What do you think? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>went down to this place yesterday evening..the setting sun was a beauty.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>anyway the two circles have been a bit faded...but i could still make out the circles..<br><br>the ground was sandy...the same type of sand you'll find on any beach..<br><br>now for the circles...their diameter was huge! from the photos i though they was like small circles....but they were at least 15 metres in diameter.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>i noticed some tyre tracks around the area...all seemed to have grooves...however, the two circles did not have any grooves...just smooth...like as if a grooveless tyre made it...(not possible for grooveless tyre to travel in that type of terrain..)..<br><br>another possibility could be a person standing in the middle and using a stick to draw out the circles by turning one round holding on to the stick...but that would require him to have two long sticks...and why would anyone wanna do that?!<br><br>I went there seeking answers....and in the end i dug up more questions.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
