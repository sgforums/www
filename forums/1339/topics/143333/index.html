(See report below.).<br><br>It might not even be easy to find the place.<br><br>Right smack in the middle of nowhere, it is located along Lim Chu Kang Road (near the Neo Tiew Road junction) - a five-minute drive from the largest cemetery in Singapore.<br><br>An army camp is nearby.<br><br>You don't have to take our word for it, but The Singapore Paranormal Investigators Club certainly thinks the estate is an attraction. The club conducts paid tours, called the Ghoulish Trail, for the public to visit this atmospheric site.<br><br>SPOOKEY TOUR<br><br>The $25 tour, which includes visits to other areas such as the Bukit Brown Cemetery, is organised with the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) Film Society.<br><br>Film Society member Ho Weng Hin, 22, a Bachelor of Science undergraduate at SIM, said: 'We thought it is a good idea because there are some places in Singapore that people do not know about. This is a chance for them to see and experience it.'<br><br>He noted that there will be two more tours before the year ends.<br><br>According to the HDB, Blocks 3 to 5 Lim Chu Kang Road were built in 1979.<br><br>It was announced in October 1998 that they were slated for the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme.<br><br>The last occupants moved out early this year.<br><br>Plans for the site are being looked into, HDB said.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Where time stands still<br>AS you walk down the deserted corridors of this HDB neighbourhood, only the sound of dried leaves crackling under your feet breaks the grave silence.<br><br>The neighbourhood's really that quiet, with the occasional truck whizzing by along Lim Chu Kang Road.<br><br>We can only imagine what the place was once like - The New Paper was unable to track down any former residents.<br><br>The peeling wall paint, the yellowed lamp-posts, the dirty slide in the playground have all seen better days. And there's overgrown greenery everywhere.<br><br>STRAY DOGS<br><br>The estate is home to a couple of stray dogs which insisted on following me around.<br><br>It is a rest-stop for foreign workers from a nearby construction site, too.<br><br>Evidence of their visits: Beer bottles and peanut shells on the void deck floor.<br><br>A construction worker resting nearby was surprised to see me.<br><br>'What are you doing here? Nobody ever comes here,' asked Chinese national Chen Qian You in Mandarin.<br><br>The 38-year-old welder, who has been working here for the past two years, added: 'The only ones who come here are foreign workers like us. We just chill out and chit-chat. It's deserted and dark at night. And quite scary, too.'<br><br>Along the five-foot way, a fading signboard of a clinic creaked in the wind. Inside one of the three-room flats, there were shattered windows, a dusty stool and the remains of a broken cupboard.<br><br>Time has truly stood still for this forgotten estate.<br><br></div>
