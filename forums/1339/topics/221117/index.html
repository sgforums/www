            <div class='col-md body'>ok, first i have to say that i'm a very nice guy and this incident happened on last friday.. it was the world environmental day and i had to stay back for the talk after school, and i'd say it's damn boring, waste of time... etc etc.. and i try to rush back home immediately after the talk.. i look at the bunch of people at the bus stop and most of them are my course mates and who cares about them when i'm tired? (i just dun wannt squeeze and be the last one or even can't get into the bus as it's not double-decker) i was waiting at the bus stop listening to my mp3.. and when the bus came.. my thoughts, "oh yes how lucky".. the bus came to a stop directly in front of me and i'm the 3 person to get board the bus.. now ok. there are 2 girls (my course mates) one of the girl her ez-link card beeps, maybe not enough money, then her second fren stop aside and take out some coins to help her fren.. 3 of us are on the left, upon seeing that, and thinking that there's a crowd waiting behind i tapped my card quickly and procede to the right of the bus doors and search for my seat.. then i heard a voice "hey that guy " something like that, i'm not too sure whther hes referring to me but i'm the only guy that first boarded the bus so i ignore him.. and sad to say i can;t find any seat but just stand at the back of the bus... then i saw my malay frens and told them what happen jus now.. well they alight few stops before the interchange and i alight at the interchange, when i was trying alight which everyone does the same usual thing (line up-and get-down the bus fast).. just then the bus door is shut and the bus-driver came from his seat and walk towards me and his eyes look at me...when he's coming to me, he tapped HARD on my shoulder and says " EH boy, scann ur card" then he press the emergency door exit button on the exits top to let the rest of the students and passengers to alight then he confronted me. I was shocked, and think of that just now, yeah he's calling for me when i board the bus... Ok, then i tap my card, i have thenormal beep and not the long beeping sounds.. ok i guess he knew he saw something wrong just now.. and he walk away in a manner, with no remorse.. i was not happy about his attitude and when he used his hands to tapped HARD and i mean hard on my shoulders...i was tired and stay back after a long boring talk and ina ddition to this incident i get suddenly.. heat up and that man just friggin walk away like that... as if he does not done something wrong?<br>i yell at him a 5 word hokkien vulgar (which i really does not want to do, but i can't control my temper for that little moment) i know i was low.. but u think i've done the wrong thing... the bus driver is being unreasonbale.. and when i yell at him, he just look back for a moment and then walk away back to his seat after he saw so many passengers look at him, instead of me cos i'm the one shouting.. so yer my first time saying my experience.....need feedback  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
