            <div class='col-md body'>"A Saskatchewan farmer, stuck for almost three days when his hand got caught in a rock picker, said he was hallucinating about being at a barbecue when he came to and realized he was slicing off his own fingers.Bruce Osiowy, a 53-year-old farm activist, recalled the harrowing details from his hospital bed Wednesday after doctors amputated the left hand from which he cut off two fingers with a pocketknife to free himself from the farm implement.<br><br>"You cry, and I'm not ashamed to say that," he said. "You pray. Man, I've never done more praying in my life."<br><br>Osiowy, who farms near Abernathy about 90 kilometers east of Regina, said his hand got caught last Thursday around 7 p.m.<br><br>Wearing only a short-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans, he passed the days with no food or water in the company of his dog Gopher, a seven-year-old border collie, who also kept him warm during the cold nights.<br><br>On Saturday he began to hallucinate he was attending a barbecue at a Mexican resort.<br><br>"I was cutting this beef apart and it was a horrendous job to just hack it apart. Finally another fella said, 'I've got a hand and an arm for you' and he gave me that,' " he recalled.<br><br>"I decided I was going to cut the two fingers off that borrowed hand. I was cutting the fingers on my own hand there was no doubt about it. There's no doubt that the hallucination was a big assistance to getting this job done."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are under extreme stress for prolonged periods of time, your brain will find it hard to seperate reality from your subconcious dreamworld. Hallucinations are quite normal when I am extremely tired (like never sleep for 3 days doing assignment) or kenna very high fever from flu. It's like dreaming while you are awake.</div>
