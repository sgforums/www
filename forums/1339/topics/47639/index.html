            <div class='col-md body'>People sell the strangest stuff on Ebay.com..<br><br>In correspondence with the earlier thread about <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=47593" rel="nofollow"> a ghost trapped in a jar for sale </a> on Ebay, here are more bizarre stuff for sale!<br><br><img src="http://auctionknowhow.com/museum/img/17.jpg"><br>"Old bottle with Schenley embossed on neck and on the bottom it says federal law forbids sale or reuse of this bottle. It is clear with a flared neck, maybe meant for a stopper, which I do not have. Inside is a dead mouse for character which I will leave in upon sale. A real conversation starter. This is from my Grandmothers collection, so it is before 1960."<br><br><img src="http://auctionknowhow.com/museum/img/29.jpg"><br>"If you are a Sci-Fi then the ALIEN BABY FETUS in a bottle keychain is a must have. These are really hot and going fast.Out a thousand there are only a few hundred left. Take one for yourself or more for your friends. The picture shows the Aliens actual size. Only $2.00 each these go for $4.99 in any novelty shop or store if you can find them."<br><br><img src="http://auctionknowhow.com/museum/img/8.jpg"><br>"Well I'll try to describe this lot the best I can. What we have here are several things I just discovered in my couch while trying to find the remote. We have one pack of Big Red Chewing Gum(3 pieces left)I don't see a date so I'm not sure if it's still good. Next we have a 2.5 inch machine threaded screw(phillips head)Also, $.80 in change(details upon request).Following that we have two red rubber bands, one needs a little restoration. One piece of peppermint candy that I'm sure my father gave me. One paper clip in mint condition. A single red cap from what I believe to be a Bic Pen,(How may times have you wanted one of those)A single wrapper from a Starburst candy. A quarter of a match stick as well as a partial box(might still light, I won't guarantee) The edge of a single piece of paper from a mead spiral bound notebook. A few shards from a pecan shell from the tree which is in my front yard. And finally, about a third of a pretzel(age and origin unknown) "<br><br><img src="http://auctionknowhow.com/museum/img/decal2.jpg"><br>That's right, folks. Step right up and get your bullet hole decals!<br><br>The first ones were single bullets, like the ones on top. However, they have steadily grown more elaborate, with multiple bullet holes and cracks radiating from them, until you get a work of beauty like this car ...<br><img src="http://auctionknowhow.com/museum/img/decal3.jpg"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

If you put a disc in the player, it will try to spin the disc up a few times, and eventually NO DISC will come across the screen. Once in a while, if you eject and insert the disc a few times, it will eventually read the disc, and play normally. I've found that putting a lampshade on my head and dancing in my boxers helps this out, but your mileage may vary.<br><br>The player is in good physical condition. I took it apart to see if there was anything obvious in there to fix, and lost the screws. I didn't touch any of the innards, just wanted to let any prospective buyers know that the screws are missing.<br><br>The original Sony remote control is included with this player. If nobody buys this, it's going in the trash. Happy bidding.<br><br></div>
