            <div class='col-md body'>There's a mystery on Mitchell Flats, just outside of Marfa in far West Texas, which is open land left behind by an ancient sea.<br><br>The best place to witness this unexplained phenomenon is at the viewing site, just east of Marfa on U.S. Highway 90.<br><br>From there, on almost any given night, you can watch the mysterious lights. What do they look like? Well, it depends on who you talk to.<br><br>"I remember the night when I saw the Marfa Lights for the first time. I was sitting on a pickup while my group wandered off. And suddenly they appeared moving at a very fast rate of speed. They split into two bright lights and suddenly split again into four lights. I've seen them several times and have never seen them appear the same way twice. Each time I have seen the lights they have been very different," said Marfa resident Sheri Eppenauer.<br><br>"It was about six years go when the strangest thing happened to me. I was living on Chinati Mountain on a ranch out in Texas and getting ready to go to bed that evening, got into bed, turned out the light, and a bright light just showed up just through my window. It changed colors and lasted for a few minutes and then went away," said Marfa resident Felicia Wood.<br><br>In the middle of the Mitchell Flat is what remains of an old World War II Air Force training base. During its prime in the mid-1940s, many of the pilots saw the mysterious lights. Marfa resident Fritz Kahl was one of them.<br><br>"We discovered the lights by chance off in the distance, very small, very soft. And it's a phenomenon that they tell me that it exists over other parts of the world. This happens to be our local chapter of that book, of phenomenon in the mystery world," said Kahl said.<br><br>Who can explain their source? Where are they actually located? How long have they been in existence? The mystery is no closer to being solved now than when they were first seen.<br><br>"The thing is that if they ever solve the mystery, then it's gone, put down everything. As long as it's unsolved then there is gonna' be people out here looking for it, trying to figure it out," said game warden Jim Kitchens.<br><br><a href="http://www.news8austin.com/content/headlines/?ArID=87555&amp;SecID=2" rel="nofollow">You can watch the video at this website  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> V </a></div>
