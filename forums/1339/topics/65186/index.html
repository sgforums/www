Our activities and exploits are purely done out of informational, aesthetic, artistic and amusement reasons. We conduct thorough research and we do not organize groups of annoying people for 'tours' or whatever nonsense in the hopes of encountering something unexplained.<br><br>So far we have infiltrated 3 sites (though I am still quite unsatisfied with the missions) and we have run up an extensive list of abandoned buildings/hospitals/hotels to explore.<br><br>We are not interested in ghosts although sometimes unexplainable s**t happens that isn't expected and require us to abandon our mission and get the f**k out of wherever we happen to be at.<br>We do not break in.<br>We do not trespass.
