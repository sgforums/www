            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like you guys are quite interested in OCH..<br><br>Anyway here's more:<br>"The 'Old' Changi General Hospital that was situated around Halton Road was isolated since Feb 1997 and has been left vacant for 6 years. However, stories about the building being haunted started in the early 40's. The Hospital itself had 70 years of rich history when it survived from the gruesome World War II that took place from 1941 to 1945. Therefore, seeing spirits of all races and of different nationals wandering around in the compound would be a common sight."<br><br>I have also heard from my friend that a skinny malay guy used to hang around in the compounds of OCH after dark before it was sealed up....he's definately human...but the sight of him reminds you of a human skeleton....It's believed that he is a drug addict ....my friends encountered him several times while exploring OCH... and everytime they see him, he keeps saying that there are no ghosts in OCH, why are they coming here to bother him....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The ghostly footsteps from OCH...solved!!<br><br>"Out of many ghost encounters reported on OCH, quite a number of them are due to psychological effects or natural environments.  For instances, an exceptionally loud water dripping sound in a hollow roof that makes anybody to believe that is ghost foot steps, especially in the dark.  From the corridor of the 3rd level, one cannot distinguish the source nor the direction of the of the foot-step like noise.  Sometimes the noise was going evenly paced.  And sometimes it paused.  This noise has the most scary impact at night especially in a deafening silent environment.  It makes anybody who hears it panic.  The panicking effect will make him difficult to judge the real cause of the noise.<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/och/2DSC00112_bright.jpg"><br>The source of the footstep sounds. It was actually the water dripping sound on the roof. Somehow this sound when hit the hollow plaster boards, it amplified to a higher degree and loudly filled the whole floor of the building right underneath the roof<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/och/2DSC00111.jpg"><br>Looking at the North-East direction, there was an air-envelope for planes landing down at Changi airport. We saw planes from different airlines flew thru the sky regularly at that certain route.<br><br>Only by going up to the roof top during day time, we would then be able to check that the noise came from the dripping of a broken gutter.  Because the whole roof has become very shabby due to aging, the water flows a bit irregular through different water paddles collected by the roof.  The dripping eventually landed on a thin plaster board that echoes up the whole literately hollow roof structure.  In turn, this loud tapping noise fills the whole ambience in the level 3 corridor and there comes the rumored ghost foot-steps.<br><br><a href="http://100megs14.com/~spiworld/spi/study/fm/och/footsteps_in_corridor.zip" rel="nofollow">Clip 1</a><br><br><a href="http://100megs14.com/~spiworld/spi/study/fm/och/waterdrips_on_rooftop.zip" rel="nofollow">Clip 2</a><br><br>From these two clips, you can hear that such a small water dripping does sound loud enough like metal beating from your neighbor's home renovation during day time.  And it sounds like eerie foot-steps from an invisible man at night.<br><br>The other reported haunting instances are ghost lights flashing by, and ghost howling from far to near.  Upon thorough checking from many visits, it can be proved that<br>"some" ghost howling or ghost lights may just be airplanes passing-by as Changi airport is not far away.  Furthermore, as the photos have shown, the wards are well air-ventilated with the open top-end wells and smashed window panes.  Doors may slam and things may roll, when it gets a bit windy or when you have walked pass them sending slight vibration.<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/och/DSC00086.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/och/DSC00089.jpg"><br>Both photos above show that the interior structure of OCH is such that both sides are long corridors with (smashed) open windows panes, and in between the wards are well air-ventilated.  Wind current can easily flow from one side to the other.<br><br>Although some haunting phenomena can be debunked with evidences, yet nobody can completely eliminate the possibilities of real ghost encounters in OCH.  It is just like when you can find one dog in a street is white, we cannot conclude that all the dogs are white in this whole town.  Anyway, SPI never encouraging any trespassing on state lands or private property.  Nobody can recce into it unless carrying government permit.  Some haunting stories will remain as a mystery, and it may be better to leave the spirits there undisturbed."<br></div>
