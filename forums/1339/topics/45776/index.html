            <div class='col-md body'>Went for dinner with my fren juz now...and started discussing abt OCH over prata...<br><br>Something I heard from him that I wanna share with you guys...<br><br>He overheard this from his cousin:<br>His cousin and a bunch of frens were at the SAF cahlets near Changi Village. As they felt bored, they decided to explore OCH. That was a long time ago when OCH was not closed up like now. Being a bunch of daredevils from the infantry who have been to "jungles in brunei where it's so dark you cannot see your outstretched hand", they felt exicted as they have not explored the premises of OCH before but have heard so much about it...<br><br>Some of the doors were locked, but one of his cousin's friend managed to find a window that was not closed. Armed with torches,They climbed in, one by one, and were overwhelmed by the strong smell of medicine.<br>Being a formal hospital, this was not abnormal. They began walking around the place, making funny noises and fooling around, like running around the place and opening unlocked doors, just for the thrill of it. SOmehow they managed to find the staircase and climbed up floor by floor, exploring every floor...<br><br>When they reached the seventh floor, which was the top floor, they explored it like the other floors. After they finished exploring, they were dissapointed as they didn't find any artefacts or ghosts.<br><br>One of the guys, an Ah Beng type, then shouted :"Chey, Hao Siao.<br>Mana Oo Kui?!" (This is rubbish! Where got ghost?!). They made their way back to the staircase where they climbed up from....and guess what...THERE WAS NO STAIRCASE!<br><br>They just kept going round and round...looking for the staircase! They were pretty sure they had came up from a staircase, but everwhere they looked, it was the same. Long corridors with rows of doors...and the strong medical smell made it worse..<br><br>They were really scared now. Even the guy who shouted earlier was showing signs of fear...<br><br>Anyway, the group just huddled together,prayed and waited until daybreak...One of the braver guys decided to start looking for the staircase again and guess what? It ws just around the corner, which they had circled at least ten to eleven times previously!<br><br>They ran like hell outta there!<br><br>Seriously my fren's not very good at making up stories, and neither is his cousin either (I know them both)...<br><br>Anyway the story above may not be the best adaptation as I had to translate it from Chinese to English...<br><br>Maybe that's why guards were hired to patrol the place... to prevent us from being hurt by exploring inside...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another:<br><br>"I was admitted into OCH, SAF ward, during August '95 for 2 weeks.<br><br>The SAF ward of OCH was located at 7th level. At that time, the whole 7th level was sort of a 'special' level, with wards not meant for ordinary civilian use. There's a ward for inmates from nearby Changi Prison, occupying one big end of the floor, where its doors were closed at all time, but through the door windows you could see a of couple wardens/police officers stationed inside when there's inmates admitted, if not, it's empty; then there's the SAF ward, took up the floor in the middle, which I'm the only occupant at that time; and finally, the SAF Psycho-medicine Branch/Ward, occupied the other end, for the mentally unsound SAF personnels.<br><br>So how was OCH ward like in those days? White walls, pink doors, clean, peaceful &amp; serene, except for every Tuesdays, when it was sort of parents-visiting days at the psycho-medicine branch. Same ambience and atmosphere during the nights too. Another hospital which, in my opinion, shared the same 'feelings' with OCH is Alexandra hospital.<br><br>During my 2 weeks stay, I saw occasional shadows moving about on the ceilings of the corridor when it's empty, and heard some coughing near me, even though I'm the only patient in the ward, during days and nights. Beside these trivial stuff (I've seen worse at Slim Barrack), there was once I woke up to a strong flower perfume (never smelled a frangipani before) in a particularly cold night. Tried everything - increase the speed of ceiling fan, rub tiger balm near the nose (was that desperate to get rid of overly sweet smell). The perfume disappeared when a nurse came in during a routine check.<br><br>Kind of sad to read that what was once an ideal hospital (to me) is now one of the most haunted sites in Singapore."<br></div>
