            <div class='col-md body'>As mentioned by AE86tofu, there is a grave across the street from the old ford factory. I'm not sure how many people are aware of it? It is situated in a clearing in the forest by the road. I know about this place because when I was much younger I have gone past the grave many times in my parent's car. The clearing itself used to be open but a few years back they suddenly fenced it up and put up state land signs. Whatsmore, they purposely planted dense dhrubs along the fence to block the view of the grave from the road. If it wasn't for my prior knowledge of the place we wouldn't have know it was there. The site is quite easy to find as there is a green cyclone fence to block it from the road, but it doesn't go around so u can go around the side. The shrubs have some pinkish leaves while the rest of the surrounding foilage is just green. The description of the grave can be found in AE86tofu's post about the old ford factory.<br>Anyone has any info about this?</div>
