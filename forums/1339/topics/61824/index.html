The owner of the house was C.K.Tang. But soon, it was deserted. No one knows what C.K.Tang planning to do with the house except himself. On the 7th January 2002, somebody found a police report that indicated there was a murder case involving a husband and wife who used live in that house. The wife was killed and the spirits has not been resting since. Rumor said that the big old tree behind the house is where this spirit shelters itself.<br><br>Nonetheless, a more accurate report showed that the red house was once a child care center rather than a residential dwelling. It has a few blocks and each one has a name. It was later converted into a dancing school before it was deserted. The house is still intact as it was originally built from the first day. Throughout the years, many people have had visited the red house although it is a private property. Police patrols routinely, endlessly and purposely come and catch trespasser as it has become a hot ghost hunting place.<br><br>The neighbours who live near the red house are particularly sensitive and noisy. They must have been frequently annoyed by groups of people who always come visit this place. The house is surrounding by three blocks of houses. The neighbours will not hesitate to report to police should they see anyone entered the red house. Catching and warning the trespassers have become a common job for the local policemen too.<br><br>However we heard that some youngsters vowed to burn down the neighbours' houses after they were caught by police, sabotaged by the noisy neighbours of course. We just hope that won't happen. We don't need another haunted house beside the red house with the owners murdered.<br><br>Smoking Lions<br>(Source: Hearsay from a SPI fan)<br><br>There is a famous urban legend appearing in forums: "The lions statues are alive. When you walk pass them at midnight, they will turn their heads looking at you." The lion statues in front of the Red House have become mythical. Some people have reported that they hear them roar at night, and some said they saw their eyes glowed. However, we have got a chilling account sent by a SPI fan. Here is the story:<br><br>This is a true story. I live in Tampines. My friend and I used to venture into red house to explore. It has a stone wall which is not too tall. An easy way is to jump up to the lion, then step on its head and climb over the front gate. It was kind of like Jackie Chan's stunt act. However, I had a weird feeling that I should be very guilty in stepping on the lion's head. This idea kept knocking on my head. Anyway, we sneaked in successfully and were happily inside the red house checking every corner. We care less any other thing. But the fxxking busy body neighbours called the police. Before the police came, we were rushing out mad to the gate. My friend, without any hesitation climbed over the gate and stepped on the lion's head again just like a reverse of how we got in.<br><br>I was very panic when I heard a car dashing here from a distance that I believed was the police. But my guilt consciousness just didn't allow me to go ahead - to step on the lion. A minute later, I was caught by the police and my friend managed to escape. I got interrogated by the police, jotted down my IC number, and warned for trespassing into a private property. Luckily they let me go without any charges.<br><br>But a month later, a horrible accident happened to my friend. That was the weirdest thing I have ever heard about and it happened to my friend. A lamp post suddenly fell down and hit my friend's head. He was hospitalized, and died at approximately the same time that he stepped on the lion's head. I was too scared to tell this to anyone. But still I want to warn all you folks. DON'T MESS WITH THE LIONS. I don't even want to go near Pasir Ris anymore, and this is my last time mentioning about the red house.<br><br>....<br><br>Despite this horrible account from a SPI fan, we know that there are <strong>people who offer cigarettes to the lions, touch their heads and pray for 4D</strong>.
