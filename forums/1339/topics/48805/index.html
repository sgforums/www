            <div class='col-md body'>Willard Library has been serving the river city of Evansville, Indiana since it opened its doors back in 1885. At over 110 years old, Willard is the oldest public library building in the state. Built with a grant by local philanthropist Willard Carpenter, it was formed to be "a public library for the use of the people of all classes, races, and sexes, free of charge forever."<br><br>It's also reputed to be very haunted! To the point where ghost cams were set up around the library in the hope that visitors to the webby can capture and report any ghost sightings to the webmaster!<br><br>And capture they did! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Laurie writes, "I do not know if the <a href="http://web.myinky.com/ghost/ghost2/cam.html" rel="nofollow">Willard library children's room ghost cam</a> at Willard Library refreshes every 10 minutes but I finally got the evidence of her being there then not being there 10 minutes later. If you look at the picture it looks like she is sitting on the steps in the hall reading. I am so excited.

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone captured a queer bright vortex thingy in <a href="http://web.myinky.com/ghost/cam.html" rel="nofollow">the research room cam</a><br><br>"This set of cam shots are my most recent shots taken on the Research's room cam. I was watching for about over 2 hours. I started to notice an light orb/with dark shadow. There were people in the room at the time as well, reading at the table.<br><br>Over the next couple of hours, I noticed the vortex take more form, first in one chair, then on the other side of the table. Then as the people left, it got bigger either above or directly in front of the table. It moved along the right side of the tables, ending in a bookshelf(rumored to be one of her favorites) in the back of the room.<br><br>I do not usually see much in this room, but I am flabburgasted by these photos. At first as I was watching, I thought they were sun reflections, but the windows are IN THE BACK of the room. The cam is mounted on a wall with no windows. (You can see a picture of what the wall looks like through photos on the library's main site.) So I can't explain the pictures. I've sent several off to the library. Maybe they will deem one worthy to put on their proofs page."<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/tiffmeister68/research1.jpg"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/tiffmeister68/research2.jpg"><br>Around 4:15pm, Indiana or ghost time, I start watching the cam in the research room. I notice strange light orb at bottom of page. Watch it for about 1/2 hour taking 2 pics.<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/tiffmeister68/research3.jpg"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/tiffmeister68/research4.jpg"><br>Strange orb gets huge, gives off reflection or there is weird stuff happening on the book shelves on the left. Strange form on the far left lower chair. Both pictures are actually taken about 10 minutes apart, between 4:15 and 4:45pm.<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/tiffmeister68/research5.jpg"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/tiffmeister68/research6.jpg"><br>Things are even weirder. The orb starts to move away from the camera along the tops or side of the table. It's for about another 15 minutes.<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/tiffmeister68/research7.jpg"><br>Vortex ends up in back of room by back bookshelf, rumored to be the ghost's favorite browsing area. It's nearing 5:30 pm.<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/tiffmeister68/research8.jpg"><br>The vortex seems to disappear around 5:40pm, replaced by lights along all of the bookshelves at 5:50pm. The last picture is taken around 6:00pm. The library has closed, with things looking like they are back to normal.<br><br>I have noticed the best ghost watching time is between 1pm - 6pm when the library closes. I don't know why, but that seems to be the best time to get pictures of the ghost. Either the climate is right, or the traffic of humans is higher at that time. Maybe the ghost likes the company. It does seem to appear a lot with other people sitting at tables.<br><br></div>

I don't know, but this is what I captured and saved to my folder.<br><br>Jose sent four captured photos, which I put together in this animation sequence. The photos were taken 30 seconds apart.
