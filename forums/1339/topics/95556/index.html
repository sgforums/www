            <div class='col-md body'>Old Changi Hospital<br><br>History<br><br>Built in 1930's, together with an A/E opposite the road and several blocks of commando barracks cum Changi prison nearby, the Old Changi Hospital (OCH) is situated at Netheravon Road in Changi villages.  It has quite a long and rich history for being the former hospital of today's modern Changi General Hospital in Simei and Toa Payoh Hospital equipped with world-class facilities.<br><br>With its classical design, one can see that OCH is a typical replica of buildings built by British Colonial architects in the early 20's.  Surprisingly OCH was not meant to be a hospital when it was first built (same for the A/E).  The British was planning to have a heavily guarded military location in the east of Singapore.  The site was strategically selected for it is high on top of a hill overlooking the sea surrounding most of the east side and the south side of the island.  For about 10 years before the war, this classical 7-storey high building compound was used as military command quarters and barracks.<br><br>During the assault of the Japanese aggression from Malaya in February 1942, Changi was targeted as one of the first attack points.  In a day or two, it was occupied by the Japanese army moving from Puala Ubin.  Soon after that OCH was converted to a military hospital where all the wounded soldiers and civilians were attended to.   After the Japanese Occupation ended, it was converted back to its original self, as a public hospital and later with a Military ward on the third level.<br><br>From February 1997 onwards, OCH was closed for its hospital operations were replaced by the new Changi General Hospital.  It got isolated and left vacant there since then.  According to some insider sources, the abandoned OCH will remain as it is but it will be re-open for the 'public' soon during 2005 for the Army Camp or for the Officer Cadet School (OCS) Trainees.<br><br>However, stories about the building being haunted started in the early 40's.  The Hospital itself had 70+ years of rich history when it survived from the dreadful World War II that took place from 1942 to 1945, witnessing the fall of Singapore and the brutal tortures towards the prisoners of war (POW) that happened there.  Therefore, seeing spirits of all races and of different nationals wandering around in the compound would be a common sight.<br><br>If you are thinking of visiting the hospital in the hope of bumping into a spirit of any nature, go with 2 or 3 friends.  If you go beyond that, you will never see it as they are all hiding behind the window pane or the back of the door WATCHING at you.   But of course, you can go there alone, however you will never find yourself ALONE.<br><br></div>

Good luck for those construction workers. For your second part, Spirits do not need to hide to watch, they can see you but you may not necessarily see them.</div>

I &amp; my cousins decided to have a bicycle trip around Changi Beach. While cycling...my cousin Ady Burn the one who also wrote about the story called'The Very old hospital', decided that we go to the Old Changi Hospital in search of unusual phoenomena......All of us go there with our bikes.<br><br>As we reach there....we locked our bikes outside. At 1st..we felt a little scared...but when we want to enter the hospital..we heard a man voice only to know it was the security guard. But then we decided we have a chat with him of his experiences at the Old Changi Hospital....We had a very long talk with him...By then, it was already becoming dark. We decided to go home...we 1st shake hand with him and went to unlock our bikes...While we are locking our bike....we realised that the security guard is not there...we were scared.<br><br>Then....another voice called us. We realised it was a malay security guard...but it was the one whom we had a chat with.....When asked whether he had seen another security guard that we had just describe to him.....he look confused.......and told us that he was the only security guard left guarding the Old Changi Hospital..we look confused and ask him again...only to get an answer from the guard..that we just had a talk with the ex security guard that guard the Old Changi Hospital 30 years ago.....We were scared to death and flee with our bikes home....<br><br>After the incident...the five of us dare not go back to the Old Changi Hospital again...that was only at the outside of the hospital but not inside..so beware to all those whom had read this.<br><br>THE OLD CHANGI HOSPITAL IS HAUNTED!"</div>
