            <div class='col-md body'>This is one of the songs with a more distinguishable backward message.If there was a top 40 of backmasked songs, then "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin would be at the top. This song contains many backward messages. Here is one of them that occurs right at the very end of the song.. It says: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Play backwards. Hear words sung."</span></strong> The curious thing, however, is that there are no superimposed soundtracks on this song and the backward phrase is formed purely by the way the words were sung at the time the recording was made. Coincidential? Or did the producers know about the messages but kept mum abt it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><a href="http://reversespeech.com/rev/examp7.ram" rel="nofollow">http://reversespeech.com/rev/examp7.ram</a><br><br>Enjoy!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fresh off the www....<br><br>"Rock music has been around long before Elvis Presley time. You might be wondering now, why on earth did Satan choose music as his "investment"? 1) Everybody listens to music. 2) He was an angel of songs before he was cast down to earth with 1/3 of the angels in heaven. 3) People tends to remember the lyrics which makes it more dangerous (I will talk more on it later on in the section "Subliminal").<br><br>Effects<br><br>This effect might not take place instantly it will have to depend how often you listen to rock music.<br><br>If you are a hardcore rock fan this are some of the effects you might be experiencing.<br><br>You canÂ’t live without it.<br>You tend to make an effort to remember the lyrics.<br><br>You might want to take up lessons to learn how to play an musical instrument.<br><br>You talk and act like them.<br><br>Do all sorts of posers (horned hand).<br><br>Buy their Â‘collection itemsÂ’ "<br><br>"Touch of magic of rather magick- a witch term of magic)<br><br>"This priest/priestess attends a ceremonies at a recording studios to satanically bless the rock music. What they will do perform incantation Â– that places demons into EVERY CD of the rock music that was sold. Certain demons are summon sometimes to speak on the recording, this can be heard when the song is played backwards- rewinding it at a certain speed- this is known as backmasking message. Sometimes the priest/priestess are recorded in the music (of course you canÂ’t hear it will all the over-all noise of the music), they do chants and incantations to summon up more demons every time the song is played."<br><br>Something like subliminal songs but deadlier as this backmasking is done by summoning a devil to speak on the song. Here is one famous song by [<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Eagles Â– Hotel California</span></strong><br>Forwards: 'There were voices down the corridor, thought I heard them say, welcome to the hotel California.'<br><br>Backwards: 'Yeah Satan, he organized, oh, he organized his own religion. Yeah, when he knows he should, how nice it was delicious, he puts it in a vet he fixes it for his son which he gives away.'<br><br>FACTS: Indeed, the hotel in Hotel California is not in fact a hotel. The 'California' is a street in Los Angeles where the first Satanic Church was built, headed by Anton Szander Lavey, author of the Satanic Bible. Many major musicians were said to have attended this church, including Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones<br><br>Aliester Crowley (very popular in the rock music world) gives instructions to the Satanist:<br>". . .train himself to think BACKWARDS by external means, as set forth here following.<br>(a) Let him learn to write BACKWARDS. . .<br>(b) Let him learn to walk BACKWARDS. . .<br>(c) Let him. . . listen to phonograph records REVERSED<br>(d) Let him practice speaking BACKWARDS. . .<br>(e) Let him learn to read BACKWARDS. . ."<br>(Aleister Crowley, Magick In Theory And Practice)"<br><br>Linkin Park, anyone?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More on Led Zepellin's Stairway to Heaven...<br><br>"The song "Stairway to Heaven" by the group Led Zeppelin is the most popular song in rock history. One line of the song, says, "you know sometimes words have TWO MEANINGS." They should know ~ the song is drenched in satanic backmasking! One part when wind blow and did you know." But when played backwards, you clearly hear: " Oh I will sing because I live with Satan." This is the number one song in rock history! Just a coincidence ~ not hardly! Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin is a devout follower of satanist, Aliester Crowley. One of Crowley's satanic teachings, learn to cast unsuspecting spells on people by talking and singing backwards! Zeppelin's song "Houses of the Holy", they sing, "Let the music be YOUR MASTER/ Will you heed the master's call/ Satan. . ."<br></div>

Inside the album, looking down on the festivities, is none other than Anton Lavey, the founder of the Church of Satan and author of the Satanic Bible!  The Eagles manager, Larry Salter, admitted in the Waco Tribune-Herald, (Feb. 28, 1982) that the Eagles were involved with the Church of Satan! Not surprisingly, one of the Eagles's songs is titled "Have A Good Day in Hell."{ and of course... the  album title is aptly named Hell freezes Over}"</div>

I heard a message during a whole verse that obviously gave its message when played forward but also a complete different message backward. Not just little blurbs of what could be perceived as sporadic words here and there, but complete sentences with a message that we had nothing to do with. I was an instant believer and after hearing this you may be a believer too. There is something much deeper in music that we can not even comprehend. It is something very spiritual and I believe that the spiritual father you serve will be represented in your music obviously forward as well as backward. What you are about to hear was not planned. We had nothing to do with the message. It was placed there by Holy intervention."<br><br>Foward - you will hear the words: " With the right to sing - song  after song - this songs for you to sing along"<br><a href="http://www.4electricbass.com/sounds/singfwd.mp3" rel="nofollow">http://www.4electricbass.com/sounds/singfwd.mp3</a><br><br>Backwards - you will hear: " God is soon to rule don't trust Satan - No, Satan lost - he's so scared of  you "<a href="http://www.4electricbass.com/sounds/singbwd.mp3" rel="nofollow">http://www.4electricbass.com/sounds/singbwd.mp3</a>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"You may say that these songs are harmless because nobody listens to them backwards, but some psychiatrists agree that the subconscious mind can pick up these backward messages and if you listen to them enough, they become embedded in your subconscious mind. These tracks may or may not have been deliberately altered, but the fact is that the backward lyrics are undeniably fitting to what they sound like. If they are, why would the artists put these messages in to their songs, and why do they have to be satanic, why can't they be something moral such as 'be good to your friends'?. Backmasking in tracks is not the only evidence of evil in everyday life. Subliminal messaging also exists... "<br></div>

These tracks may or may not have been deliberately altered, but the fact is that the backward lyrics are undeniably fitting to what they sound like. If they are, why would the artists put these messages in to their songs, and why do they have to be satanic, why can't they be something moral such as 'be good to your friends'?. Backmasking in tracks is not the only evidence of evil in everyday life. Subliminal messaging also exists...

            <div class='col-md body'>Something unrelated to backward masked messages, but may be of interest to rock fans...<br><br>Did KISS, the famous rock group, stand for Knights In Satan's Service? Read on, as Gene Simmons, the group's bassist opens up in his biography...<br><br>". . . misinformation about the band began to spread in the southern Bible Belt states, including a rumor that the name KISS stood for Knights in Satan's Service, and that the four of us were devil worshipers. Ironically, this rumor started as a result of an interview I gave in Circus magazine after our first album; in response to a question, I said that I sometimes wondered what human flesh tastes like. I never wanted to really find out, but I was curious intellectually. Later on, this comment seemed to ignite the whole idea that in some way KISS was aligned with devil worship. When I was asked whether I worshipped the devil, I simply refused to answer for a number of reasons: the first reason, of course, was that it was good press. Let people wonder. The other reason was my complete disregard for the people who were asking. Through the years, whenever religious fanatics accosted me, especially in the southern states, and quoted the Old Testament at me, I would quote them back chapter and verse. They didn't know that I had been a theology major in school. An idiot is an idiot . . . whether he quotes the Bible or not.<br>So, why did they choose 'KISS'? According to Simmons, the adoption of that name was surprisingly quick and mundane:<br><br>One day Paul [Stanley] and Peter [Criss] and I were driving around, brainstorming for new names. I had thought of a few, like Albatross, but I wasn't happy with any of them. At one point -- we were stopped at a red light -- Paul said, "How about KISS?" Peter and I nodded, and that was it. It made sense. Hindsight is 20/20, of course, and since then people have talked about all the benefits of the name: how it seemed to sum up certain things about glam rock at the time; how it was perfect for international marketing because it was a simple word that people understood all over the world. But we just liked the name, and that was that. "<br></div>
