There had been some rumors floating around that people who came into this house, practiced black-magic, performed occults, rituals and prayed for 4D.  Some even took drugs, ecstasy and then vandalized the building.  Rumours even said people who entered the house died of unnatural death afterwards.  Well, It is only a rumor, or really is a curse?  We will expose more of this with some photo evidence on the second part of this article.<br><br>Nevertheless, one of the prominent mysteries one can see is a big four-digit number written on the wall.  7447.  Does it coincide with the rumours that said people came in to pray for 4D?  The digits are actually painted using a spray-can and of several feet in size.  It is written on the servants' quarter that is connected by a roofed corridor to the main house.  Who did paint this number?  What does the number mean?  and Why was it painted on that particular bunker?"<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0069.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0070.JPG"><br><br>"There are several speculations on who are the painters of this number.  One is by the bikers around this area.  Outside the Maltida house, there is a rural empty land - a perfect sanctuary for the bikie fans.  They might like to write down the number from their bike number plate so to tell everyone that he used to be a winner.  However, for this action, he must have come prepared with a can of spray paint.  To our observation, there is no other paint-sprayed graffiti than only this number.  Do bikers always carry a can of spray paint around?  So the person came in with a sole purpose of just spraying this number on the wall and no others?"<br><br>What do you think? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

There was no other trace of similar red-painted graffiti nearby.  So obviously, somebody brought in the red paint, just for writing this mysterious Chinese character.  We showed this character to many Chinese friends of different dialects.  But none of them can figure out what that is.  According to one Taoist friend who is familiar with Chinese rituals, he said the first few strokes on the left resemble some talismans which are commonly used to summon spirits."<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0074.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0076.JPG"><br><br>HOFS experts..could input us on the word written? thanx  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>"Being not surprised that there may exist plenty of spirits over this vacant land that once stood a wild jungle in Punggol, we concentrated on checking out all sides of the house.  The three photos below are quite significant.  The first one showed an ordinary orb on the right.  The second one, showed there is a patch of illumination at the servants' quarter.  What coincided so well is that the hazy light was coming out from the wall where it got the mysterious number 7447 written on!  By enlarging the picture as shown in the third photo, you can see there is one or two milky figurines somewhat like a ghost called 'Pocong' in Malay legend.  They look as if they were emerging out from the wall into existence...!"<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0122.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0123.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/ghost03.jpg"><br><br>"Apart from the ghostly photos, we found another strange sight - the soil mounds that look like graves.  There are four of them, may be more, just outside the Punggol house.  They may be left over by the construction job of demolishing the land.  Or may be they are burials by somebody?  They have a wooden stick with a plastic bag tied on as markers.  Coincidentally, each soil mound measures at about 7 feet long and 2 feet wide.  The size is very well suited to have a human body covered underneath.  Well, we have found only clues but not evidences.  But these clues suggest spooky things that have probably happened here.  So what had happened?  Evil ritual, intruders died of curse, horrible murders, or unnatural deaths?  Only God knows..."<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0047.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0133.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-world.com/~spiworld/spi/spi_files/punggol_kampong_house/pic03/DSCF0136.JPG"></div>
