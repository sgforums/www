            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Well if you've been to Seremban in Malaysia recently you'll probably notice there's a big pond in the middle of the town. That pond area is used to be a Convent Girl School and rumors says it used to be a bunker or some sort and there's underground tunnels leading to somewhere under the school. Well, they'd moved the school to another location few years back. There were plan planned for the old school building and so they demolished the old building and from what i remember they were suppose to build another shopping center with it and never got successful due to the land *not stable or they are sinking or something* so they tried to fix the problem and still they cant build anything with the land. Besides shopping mall i think there's a few more developer failed trying to build something there. Since i'm no longer staying in Seremban 6 years ago not sure what else happened there with the land but for all i know it is still a pond. Kinda weird that nobody can build anything with the land. If anyone heard anything about it let me know. Thanks..<br><br>Note: Rumors says that the land is cursed, haunted or something so that is why no one can do anything with it. These are just rumors but all i know is that nobody can build anything on it and it's a pond now for years already. Once again, if anyone have anything regarding this let me know please.. thank you!</div>
