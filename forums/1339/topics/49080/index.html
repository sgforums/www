            <div class='col-md body'>Along the stretch of Queensway Road, near the Queensway Shopping Centre and Alexandra Fire Station, there are a group of old Quarters<br><br>These Quarters are mostly occupied by KTM (Keretapi Tanah Melayu/Malaysian Railway) rail workers. They rent the Quarters at an affordable price and will usually go back to their hometown in Malaysia during the weekends or public holidays.<br><br><img src="http://sfogs.purehostings.net/ktm/ktm8.jpg"><br><br>The area is dark and surrounded with huge trees and thick home-growns like, sugarcane, banana and papaya trees.<br><br>"I personally experienced this years ago when I was in primary school. My uncle asked me to accompany him to his friend's house, which was in one of the Quarters. My uncle said something like, his friend was in trouble of some sort.<br><br>I remember vividly the evening when we reached the house. It already looked pretty worn out then. I was greeted by this friendly man at the door (my uncle's friend) and I remember shaking hands with him.<br><br>The next thing I saw gave me the fright of my life. As I stepped into the house, right in the middle of the living room, I saw a full-length grave, without the tombstone of course, growing out of nowhere like nobody's business!!! Immediately I felt goose bumps all over me.<br><br>The grave literally took up nearly three-quarter of the living room, making it impossible to look elsewhere. So like it or not, I had to 'admire' it.<br><br>According to my uncle's friend, the grave wasn't there when they moved into the Quarters five years ago. The grave began to grow slowly, started of as a small ant-hill and soon developed into a full, Muslim-like grave. It couldn't be the roots of a huge tree, as the cement flooring was not broken or even cracked. It was smooth edged all along.<br><br>They couldn't do anything about it. And since, the grave never gave them any problems of any kind, they decided to live with it. The only thing they had to bear in mind was not to step over the grave, simply to pay some respect to whoever is underneath it."<br><br><img src="http://sfogs.purehostings.net/ktm/ktm6.jpg"><br>The unit which allegedly houses the grave....it is empty and locked...<br><br></div>
