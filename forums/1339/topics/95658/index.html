The photo was taken in August 2002 at the Night Safari. My friends, Pauline, Melvin, Kelvin and I went there on a Saturday night at around 11pm to have fun as we had nothing to do.<br><br>When I was driving towards the Night Safari, we came to this road which was very small and dimmed and all of the sudden I felt creepy. However, I just cast it aside thinking it was because of the darkness. Once we reached there, we had a lot of fun and took many photos. Everyone of us would take turns to be photographed at the same place.<br><br>One week later, Melvin had developed the film and we looked at the photos. But there was this particular photo that looked eerie and it was the one that I took it alone. There was this white shadow in front of me and it looked like a fish. The rest of my friends who also pictured at the same spot didnt have the shadow at all. I was really freaked out when I saw it. It was so unbelievable till now I am still thinking whether it is the supernatural or is because of my friend's smoke as he was smoking at that time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear fellow forumites, pls allow me to clear the air about this:<br><br>First of all, I would like to thank jolin80 for posting this up on SUE.<br><br>This story and photograph are from SPI's archives ---&gt; <a href="http://www.spi.com.sg/stories/pau_fishy_photo/main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spi.com.sg/stories/pau_fishy_photo/main.htm</a><br><br>This story, as stated on the SPI website, is "Contributed by SPI Agent - Pau", and not told by jolin80 herself. Thus, I believe she was trying to post this up for everyone to read and this accidently led everone to believe that the subject in the photo above is her. Hope that clears the confusion.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway, back to the story and photo, the contributor did state that the photographer was smoking at that time while he was taking the photos, so there might be a high chance that the smoke that appeared might be cigarette smoke.<br><br>Another point to ponder is what Fireice mentioned earlier, the subject is not in the centre of the photo. Unless the smoke was deliberately staged to appear, there is no reason that the photo was taken so far away.<br><br>Lastly, although I may not be 100% right, I believe that the "smoke" is actually cigarette smoke blown from the right side of the photo when it was being snapped. At least that's what my gut feeling told me when I first looked at the photo.<br><br>What do you think??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And while we're on this topic, here's something else that appeared below the same article:<br><br>"Several years ago, we drove to Night Safari and there was an unexplained thing in the car park. My friend's car has got a pair of auto ultrasonic sensors installed on the rear bumper. The sensors are used to warn the driver should there be an obstacle behind the car, particularly useful in reserve parking. That night, in the Safari car park, my friend went into a wrong lane and was about to reserve the car out. Suddenly the buzzer went off as the sensors picked up something. My driver friend and the rest of us were very puzzled; there was NOTHING behind the car as we were in a clear lane. How could the sensors sense something?! At least none of us did see anything or anybody behind our car."<br><br>A parking sensor has the uncanny ability to sense the paranormal??<br><br></div>
