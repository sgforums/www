Firstly l must introduce myself, my name is MR  FRANK SMITH from ANGOLA, in the southern region of AFRICA. I am 30 years old, I am the eldest son of the UNITA REBEL LEADER MR JONAS MALHEIRO SMITH who was ambushed and killed on 22nd February 2002 by GOVERNMENT TROOPS OF MPLA.  I am presently residing in SOUTH AFRICA with my widowed mother MRS ELIZABETH SMITH, my WIFE and my 4year old son.<br><br>I got your address from the CAPE TOWN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY here in SOUTH AFRICA. On behalf of my widowed mother MRS ELIZABETH SMITH, I decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$25.000.000.00 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION  UNITED STATES DOLLARS) which l inherited from my late father into your PERSONAL/COMPANY ACCOUNT.<br><br>In his Â“WILLÂ” he specifically drew my attention to the US$25.000.000.00, which he deposited with a SECURITY/FINANCE COMPANY here in SOUTH AFRICA fully documented on my name. In fact my FATHER said and l quote  (my beloved son, l wish to draw your attention to the US$25.000.000.00 which is deposited with the PRIVATE SECURITY /FINANCE COMPANY IN SOUTH AFRICA. I am very much dedicated and committed to win this war against the ruling Government troops of MPLA, incase of my absence on earth, as a result of death, only you should solicit for assistance for investment purpose).<br><br>From the above you will understand that the lives and future of my family depends entirely on this money, as such l will be grateful if you can assist us. We are now living in SOUTH AFRICA as ASYLUM SEEKERS and the FINANCIAL LAW of SOUTH AFRICA does not permit ASYLUM SEEKERS certain FINANCIAL RIGHTS. In view of this, you can see that I cannot be able to invest this money in SOUTH AFRICA.<br><br>For your effort I am prepared to offer 25% of this total sum, while 5% will be set aside for local and international expenses. Then 70% will be for my family and me for our investment purposes.<br><br>Finally, modalities on how the transfer will be made will be conveyed to you once we have established trust and confidence between ourselves. Please treat this matter as very urgent, contact me on line or email as above.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>MR FRANK SMITH<br><br>Oops this guy Angolan, not Kenyan as mentioned earlier.</div>
