            <div class='col-md body'>"Right at the centre of the pond, about 10+ meters above the water, one may be able to spot one or two wind chimes hanging below the top branches of the trees.  Look harder.  So far there are at least six wind chimes of the same type being found by us.  All the wind chimes share some common characteristics: made of six long steel rods attached to a wooden disc holder, same size and color, hang on the part of the tree extruding out to the water, and they are properly tied to the tree.<br><br>This has triggered a few questions on the wind chimes.  Who has hang them up there?  Six wind chimes of six steel rod.  Technically, how that person hang them up there?  From the pictures, you can see they were quite high above the water.  So using a tall ladder is almost impossible unless it were done on a solid ground.  Using a long bamboo stick seems to be difficult too because the wind chimes were not just hung there, but properly tied to the tree.  By climbing up to the tree and tie them there by hands is not possible too, as the small tree branches seem too fragile to support a human body weight."<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/kampong_java/DSC03269.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/kampong_java/DSC03264.jpg"><br><br>In November 1999, Kampong Java Park was adopted by KK Women and Children Hospital under the Adopt-A-Park scheme by National Parks Board.  As part of this park adoption, hospital staff have designed and planted a landscaped garden.  This garden is part of a larger landscape plan to develop the park into a therapeutic garden.  The intention is to enable patients to use the park as a "window of healing".  During day time, Hospital patients roam around the park for the therapeutic effects of "greening for health".  However, at night, Kampong Java Park becomes a popular lovers going place for its quiet environment around the lily pond.<br><br>Many stories indicate that Kampong Java Park was badly haunted.  Patients died in the hospital would have their souls wandering around because of the sentimental bonds built within there in their final days.  Lovers who went to the park at night for their private moments often heard ghost voice whispering at their ears.  Some even encountered slapping on face by invisible entities.  Furthermore, school kids were known to have drown in the pond when they were volunteering the maintenance of the park.<br><br>Rumor says that the park was used to be a Jewish Cemetery before it was adopted by KK Hospital.   Another rumor says the site was a mass burial ground during the WWII.  Upon the park development project by KK Hospital, most of the remains were dug up, and thereafter left the ground with a big deep hole.  Water was then filled in to make it a lily pond.  But today, as what we can see, the pond still resembles a round big hole of the size enough to hold hundreds of skeletons.  The underwater soil at the bottom of the pond is calcium rich that lilies are growing so vividly!<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/haunted/ghoulish_trial/kampong_java/DSC03258.jpg"></div>
