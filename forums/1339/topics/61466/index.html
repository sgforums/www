            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2962127748" rel="nofollow">Here's the link to the auction page~</a><br><br><img src="http://i20.ebayimg.com/03/i/00/da/9a/1d_1.JPG"><br><br>"This is just a regular Ouija board, except for the strange things that happen when its around. I'll start the story from before I owned this ouija board....and this whole story is true.<br><br>When I was about 16, my sister and I were at my aunts, and it was a little after 10:00 pm. My aunt lives on 80+ acres out in the middle of nowhere, on a farm built in the early 1800's. There is a huge barn, and at least one wall had collapsed, and the doors on the front were missing. We were walking around outside, because everyone else there was older than us, and talking about when they were young. We found it boring, so decided to go for a walk outside. After a few minutes, we came to the old barn. The moon was almost full, and shining very brightly. We could see right through the barn. I saw a shadow moving within the barn, and though my eyes were playing ticks on me, but then my sister screamed. The shadow looked like a girl with a long dress and a bonnet, hanging from one of the beams in the barn by a rope around her neck. It was slowly swinging back and forth. We were both scared, so we started running back to the house. When I looked back, I could no longer see the figure in the barn. After getting back in the house, we talked about it, and had both seen the same thing.<br><br>A few years later, we were back at my aunts, and exploring the basement. Since the house is so old, the basement is set up strange, with several rooms. The floor is concrete throughout the whole basement, except for in the furthest corner from the door to the basement. In that particular corner, there is a patch of dirt that is about 3x5 1/2 feet. It seemed weird to us, and we asked my aunt about it. She freaked out that we had even gone in the basement, and told us to never go in there again. A few weeks later, when they weren't home, we went back there, and brought with us the ouija board (listed in this auction). We went to the spot in the basement that had the dirt floor, and tried to see if the ouija board would work. We were sitting there for a few minutes, and nothing. We were about ready to give up when the planchette started moving. I thought my sister was moving it, but then I noticed that the way both of our hands were on it, it would be to difficult to move without the planchette flipping over. It was a long time ago, so I don't really rmemeber exactly what it spelled out, but I do remember one thing. When we asked who they were, it spelled out "Elizabeth". Up to that point in time, I had never gotten the ouija board to even work. It certainly never did anything strange. It just sat in a box in my room. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>After the "Elizabeth" incident, when I got back home, I stuck the box with the ouija board on my desk. It was touching my lava lamp, and within 30 seconds, the light bulb in the lava lamp burned out. I just assumed it was a coincidence, but then other things started happening. When the ouija board was in my room, and I was listening to the radio, or even a cd, it would have a static sound. Not enough to bother me, but enough to notice it. If I stuck the board in another room, the radio would sound normal again. The same with the tv. It was just weird. I put the ouija board in storage until a few years later, after I was married, and we bought a new house.<br><br>I had forgotten I even had the ouija board, and was sort of happy to see it again. I brought it up to my bedroom, and then as luck would have it, the light bulb in my lamp on the dresser burned out. That scared me, so I stuck it in the basement. We went to sleep, and when I woke up in the morning, the ouija board and planchette were on my dresser, even though I had stuck them in the basement, and the box was missing. I searched the whole house for the box, and I still can find it to this day. After that night, the board stayed in the basement, and seemed to remain dormant for a while. A year or so after we moved in to the house, I was in the basement doing laundry when I heard a noise like fingernails on a chalk board, only less shrill. I figured it was our cat, getting into something, so I started moving things around to try to find him. Thats when I noticed on a shelf in the corner, the ouija board was sitting there, and the planchette was moving by itself. I was so freaked out I immediatly left the basement. Later, I wondered what it was spelling out, so I went back down there, WITH my husband (less scary that way!!!) and went to see it. It WAS still moving, and it was spelling "why" over and over. I took the planchette, left the board where it was. I put the planchette in a drawer in my dresser upstairs.<br><br>After this, other strange things started happening. My 2 year old started pointing out the windows, and crying, and hiding. When I asked her what was wrong, she told me "Ghosts look at me!!!!" That scared the hell out of me. This happens on a regular basis now. Other things that happen include the tv turns on by itself, and the refrigerator turns itself up to as cold as it can get, even if we put tape in the dial. Sometimes the water in the bathtub will run by itself. Nothing dangerous, but it still scares me. I figured it had something to do with the ouija board....but then I found something out from one of my neighbors. Back in the 1800's when my town was first founded, the lot that my house is on, plus 3 others, used to be a cemetery!!!!!! After researching it, it said that there were originally 200 people buried there, and there are only records of some of the graves being moved. No one knows what happened to the rest.<br><br>I'm starting the bidding low, because I just want to get rid of the ouija board. Its never done anything that felt evil, but it still scares me. I can't guarantee that the same things that happened to me will happen to you, and I will not be held responsible if anything does happen.<br><br>Also, if anyone is interested in buying my house, I'd love to sell it. I do not like knowing, for a fact, that it was built on a cemetery. Too many weird things happen here. So if you have any interest in my house, or have any questions about the ouija board, feel free to contact me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>On Nov-04-03 at 14:01:04 PST, seller added the following information:<br><br>The ouija board has been put away, and this morning, when I came downstairs, the ouija board was on the coffee table.  I have a collection of amish dolls on shelves in the living room, and they were scattered all over the floor.  It couldn't have been my husband because he works 3rd shift, and when he left, the dolls were one the shelves, and the board put away.  He still wasn't back from work yet when I came downstairs.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>On Nov-06-03 at 21:44:14 PST, seller added the following information:<br><br>I'm not sure it has anything to do with the ouija board, maybe its just my house....but tonight, I discovered something. I was looking up other "haunted" items on ebay......and saw pictures of orbs. I thought they were fake pictures, or dirt on the lens. Well, I decided to look through my pictures I took of my house, since someone is interested in buying it. I took all the pictures at the same time, and didn't touch the lens at all. On pictures of my living room, there are orbs. All over the place, in different places in each picture. But in every other room.......there aren't any orbs on the pictures. So I took more pictures. And again, orbs in the living room, but no where else. Now I'm freaked out!!!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>On Nov-07-03 at 22:20:33 PST, seller added the following information:<br><br>I have put the ouija board in a box, ready to be shipped. But now, instead of it somehow leaving the box, or whatever I figured it would do, I keep seeing a black cat in my house. Its not a real cat. When I see it, it fades away. It mostly stays on the box though. It seems real enough when I see it though, and it apparantly can knock things over. I heard a noise, and saw that a coffee cup had somehow fallen over on the table. The "cat" was sitting by it. Also, my two year old has been playing hide-and-seek with "Lizbeth" for the past few days. Also, she just sits there talking seemingly to herself, and when I ask her who she is talking to, she insists "Lizbeth" is there. When I asked her who Lisbeth was, she said "You silly Mommy, she ghost!!!" and laughed at me. That REALLY does scare me so much. I don't like that a spirit who talks through the ouija board talks to and plays with my two year old. So I hope if you bid on this that you are ready to have a spirit interact with you or a family member if she chooses."</div>
