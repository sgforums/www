            <div class='col-md body'>Heard this from a fren...he told it to me when we were on duty and had practically nothing to do...apparently this story was shown on a Taiwanese program...forgot which one..<br><br>A gal, her bf and a group of friends decided to go camping on a mountain , which was a favoured campsite by many hitch-hikers and adventurers for it's beautiful panoramic view.<br><br>That night they were preparing for a BBQ. After unpacking the food and charcoal and stuff, one of the guys realised that there was not enough charcoal to last for the large amount of food they have planned to cook. So, he decided to drive down the mountain to the convenience shop which was at the foot of the mountain. The rest of the group decided to tag along as they did not want to be "lightbulbs"...this of course pleased the couple as they could spend some time alone together. The grp went of in the guy's car...<br><br>After waiting for what seemed like ages, the group did not return. The bf, concerned, decided to look for them. The gal was scared to stay at the BBQ area alone but had no choice as all the food, tents and BBQ pit have been laid out and it would be quite a chore to keep everything noe. Reluctantly, she agreed to stay and look after the area. Besides, their BBQ area was quite close to the road. THe bf rode off on his motorbike.<br><br>After a while of waiting alone, she became quite accustomed to the chirping of the crickets. It was quite silent. Suddenly, the sound of a roaring engine broke the chirps. She looked to the road and saw the group of friends coming back in the car. She looked at her watch...10:30 pm."Hmm...gone for 45 minutes..." It pulled over and she walked towards them. She noticed that all the friends looked very scared..<br><br>"Quick! quick! Get on the car!" shouted one of her friends.<br><br>"Why?" What happened? Why do you guys so scared?" She asked.<br><br>"Your bf crashed his motorbike at the bend near the bottom of the hill!!..."Said the friend.<br><br>The gal was shocked to hear the news. Amidst her confusion and panic, she opened the rear door of the car and proceeded to board the car when she heard the sound of a motorbike nearing..<br><br>To her suprise, her bf came back on his motorbike! She was bth scared and happy to see him. The friends started shouting at her "Quick quick! Come in! He is dead! It's his ghost!" At this point, she really didn't know what to do...should she follow the group of friends?<br><br>TO her suprise, her bf stopped a distance away from the car. He took off his helmet and shouted to her."Come here quick! Follow me!"<br><br>Maybe it was her love for him, but she decided to take the risk and follow her bf instead. She walkd over to her bf. IN her hert , she was thinking to herself "If he is dead, I might as well follow him to wherever he brings me...what's the point of living without him...?"<br><br>The driver of the car, upon seeing her actions, slammed on his accelarator. The group of friends shouted at her:"Crazy! Fancy her following a ghost! Let's get outta here!" With that, they quickly drove off..<br><br>She put on the helmet and climbed onto his motorbike. He began riding off. Ater riding for a while, he stopped on the roadside and took off his helmet. She followed suit.<br><br>"Dear, it's lucky that you did not listen to them and followed me instead..."Said her bf.<br><br>"Why" she asked in a suprised manner, thinking she was gonna die.<br><br>"You'll know when we get around this bend" WIth that, he put on his helmet and continued riding on..<br><br>After the bend, she saw some police cars and an ambulance and a large group of people crowding at a slope.They got of the motorbike. Her bf took her hand and she followed him to the commotion. On the bottom of the slope, was the car of that the group was in!! She heard a man was telling a police officer:"I was here on the roadside enjoying the view with my gf....It was really bad...I guess the driver lost control while negotiatiing the bend and lost control..after that the car went off the road, hit the barrier and went flipping down the slope..."<br><br>"And around what time did the accident happen?" asked the policeman.<br><br>"10:30 pm.."replied the man.<br><br>The gal was shocked! 10:30pm!! That was the time where she saw the group coming back!!<br><br>She hugged her bf and thanked god that her love for him was stronger than her fear at that time....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Anyway this version may be a bit different from the version on TV...cos my fren can't really remember the story also...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is another spooky one...<br><br>/adds more wood into the fire<br><br>Ah Q (ok...it's a stupid name...just bear with it, for the story's sake) was obsessed with a girl living in the opposite block. She was really pretty, and he always enjoyed watched her walk down the stairs and wait for the bus at the bus stop opposite his home.<br><br>Suddenly,one day, she did not appear at the norma time slot where she normally would come down to wait for the bus to go to work. Ah Q was suprised. He continued waiting but to no avail. This went on for 3 days..<br><br>Ah Q couldn't take it anymore. He decided to go her block to try to get a glance at her. He slowly went up the stairs of her block until he reached her flat. He was afraid that she might open the door suddenly. He was about to walk away...when suddenly a strong feeling overcame him. He felt that he needed to look into the peephole of her door...he didn't know why...just that he had this strong feeling...<br><br>He succumbed to the feeling and looked into the pephole..<br><br>All he saw was....a mirror the colour of red....<br><br>He felt funny.....why is it like a red mirror and not the interior of the house? Anyway he walked away from the house, not suspecting anything as he was more afraid of getting caught for peeping..<br><br>The next day he flipped open the newspaper...and he was shocked!!<br><br>"23 yr old girl hangs herself 3 days ago and was discovered yesterday night" He saw the photo and it was the girl he was obsessed with!!<br><br>Then it struck him...the ghosts of people who commit suicide have red eyes (a Taiwanese belief)....<br><br>Do you understand the last part and how it is related to the story? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is another creepy and well known one...<br><br>On the anniversaries of his parents' death, John (or watever name you like)  decided to visit their graves and pay his respect, at the old cemetary located off Lornie and Kheam Hock roads.<br><br>To show his respect, he burnt joss sticks and made offerings. It was around 3 pm and as he was about to leave, he saw a woman in black, praying beside a nearby grave which have no tombstone.<br>As he and his brother passed by, he was shocked to see that the grave was open! The woman turned around and to their surprise, her face was covered with blood, and she had no eyes! only eye sockets!<br><br>The woman spat at them and begun to scold them in dialect. She said to them, "You are so inquisitive!You want to go inside this grave?! COME!"<br><br>She began to move towards them with her arms extended. They ran as fast as they could.<br><br>The following nights, the two brothers were having bad dreams about the lady trying to pull them into the grave.<br><br>After consulting the medium, everything were back to normal again and nothing unusual happened after that.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok...another story... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>A guy was driving home from work, alone. It was a late night for him and it was around 1130pm. Suddenly, a car in the opposite lane flashed it's high beam at him. He though that there was a road block in front so he slowed down his vehicle..<br><br>He drove on but there was no road block. Several vehicles passed him and they all did the same thing, falshed their high beams at him. He felt real strange. Suddenly, a huge lorry which was in the opposite lane , which went past him after flashing it's headlights, was visible in his rear mirror. He recognised it as it was one of those big M'sian lorries carrying chickens. The lorry managed to catch up on him (he was moving slowly to avoid getting caught at the road block for speeding...) and kept it's high beam on him. He felt really scared...why was this lorry tailing him and high beaming him?<br><br>After driving for abt 10 minutes, he came to a petrol station and turned inside. The lorry followed suit. He stopped and got out of his car. The lorry driver jumped down from his vehicle and shouted at him to go over, which he did....<br><br>"Ah Di, you were really lucky! I think you better go to a temple and pray after this!" said the lorry driver in dialect.<br><br>"What happened? Why did you follow me and flashed your high beam at me, uncle?" he replied.<br><br>"There was a lady in the rear passenger seat of your car! She was holding a bloodied knife! BUt when I flashed my high beam at her, she immediately hid below. That's why I followed you all the way and flashed my high beam at you!"<br><br>The man thanked the lorry driver profusely. However, in his mind, he was thinking, is this true? Was there a ghost in my rear seat? He returned to his car, and to his horror, was a bloodied knife stabbed into the cushion of the front of the driver's seat!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> This story happened along one of the most haunted roads of Singapore...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"This is a real story spread among Singapore taxi drivers.<br><br>It was about 7.30 pm in Chinese New Year's eve. Taxi driver Ah Tan, a 60-year-old man, lived in Bedok Reservoir Rd, was rushing back home to celebrate the family dinner.<br><br>He happened to pass by a remote path somewhere near Punggol. That used to be a farm village but has been deserted for a few years. There were altogether four bus-stops along the roadside.<br><br>While he was driving along the path, he saw a young lady at the bus-stop flagging for his taxi. At first, he wanted to take the lady but he was going to be late for his dinner. Being a person particular for punctuality, he decided not to take this customer. Then he carried on driving. To his surprise, there was another lady flagging him down. This time he felt familiar because she was wearing a red T-shirt and black skirt but  due to fading light, he could not see her face.<br><br>When he passed by the third bus-stop, he felt a bit of horror as another lady was flagging him again, in the same red and black clothes! How would a lady moves faster than the wheels? The distance between two stops is about 0.8 KM away! This time, he really felt horrible and stepped the accelerator harder. When passing the fourth one, a lady charged at his car!<br><br>He was driving at least at the speed of 100 KM/H! The lady flew over his vehicle and dropped inside a drain next to the bus-stop. Ah Tan cried out due to extremely horror! The victim once again in red and black clothes.<br><br>Ah Tan felt so bad and had no mood celebrating New Year.<br><br>Finally, he decided to report to the police. The body in red and black skirt was found, it was a young Chinese lady aged between 20 to 25 year old. Ah Tan's horror got attested. The lady's cause of death is not by car accident but stabbed by sharp object! She had been dead for about three days, the body already started to decay.<br><br>After the police statement, Ah Tan thought of the whole things had been over.<br><br>Of course the police snickered at his initial statement and made him do another 'credible' one.<br><br>One week later, Ah Tan's horrible feeling had lessen. What a coincidence, he striked first prize 4-D for his taxi number plate. He won a big sum of money, he was so delighted in this, but unfortunately he fell down in the bath room and fractured his right arm. He was admitted to Changi hospital.<br><br>In the hospital, he started to have nightmare night after night. A young lady, in red and black skirt, kept calling him "Ah Peh, li di si lo lai?" (Uncle, when are you coming down?). He really cannot tolerate to it anymore.<br><br>Moreover, the inflammation started on his wound. Luckily, one of his friend who is a Taoist priest suggested to give up his stake's money instead of plead for 'safety'. He told Ah Tan that the lady ghost is gnawed by serious grievances and has become a ferocious spirit.<br><br>Since she could not avenge the murderer due to some reasons, Ah Tan chosen to be the 'scapegoat' for her rebirth'. The 4D winning stake is to exchange for his life!<br><br>After a battle of mind, the lady still disturbed him in the meanwhile, with a shattered nerves he decided to give up his $100,000 to The Charity Community Chest. Strange enough, he recovered from the illness rapidly.<br><br>Everything seemed to be over, but a short period after his discharged, his wife striked 4-D again, the stake amount is also $100,000! This is because, one day, his wife went market and bought some vegetable, she saw the wrapper was the used newspaper which reported the young lady's murder case. Strangely, there was four numbers on it, and his wife bet on and striked. After a fierce argument between them, Ah Tan failed to convince his wife to donate the money. A deep worry began to burden Ah Tan when his wife started puzzle head and like to put on red T-shirt  and black skirt. She seemed to go mad and the temper got hotter and hotter.<br><br>One morning, she suddenly told Ah Tan that the life is meaningless'.<br><br>This time Ah Tan was decisive, he gave up all the money immediately. He brought his wife to the temple and asked the monks to release the young lady's  souls from purgatory.<br><br>After this incident, he stop buying 4-D or involves in all kinds of gambling.<br><br>Not long ago, he'd also gave up his taxi-license."</div>
