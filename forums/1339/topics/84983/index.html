            <div class='col-md body'>I made a search in the net and found these:<br><br>"Orang minyaks are known rapists. They rape only virgin girls and most of the times the girl is raped in their own homes. It is said that after raping 49 girls the orang minyak is imbued with black magical powers.<br><br>Before raiding a home an orang minyak will mutter an incantation and throw sands and stones on the roof and, if the residense do not awaken, the orang minyak will break in.<br><br>However the orang minyaks are quite easily scared off. Just show them a lighter or a torch and they will run away very fast. Suspects of orang minyak rape cases are mostly living naked men who pour black oil over their bodies. Motives are mostly about satiating the sex drive and not the summoning of magical powers. However there are unsolved rape cases where the orang minyaks become thin air when chased after only to be heard from the next day.During the old times in villages where there is an orang minyak on the loose, people kept their daughters on house arrests to prevent them from being raped by the oilman."<br><br>Photo of villagers holding on to an oilyman in a bottle(?):<br><img src="http://img7.exs.cx/img7/5180/untitled285.jpg"><br><span style="color: green;">Which beats me..If the Oily Man was a human after all, would he fit into a bottle, even with all that oil on??</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oily man or wat we Malay called it, Orang Minyak, is actually human. But its also a ghost too in a sense. It's hard to explain but it status of either human or ghost is simillar to Penanggal or Kum Kum.<br><br>Penanggal is the flying head with intestines stucking out. It acually a guy turning to this ghost with work of black art. For imortallity maybe as what I hear.<br><br>Kum Kum is a a female vampire. She cursed cause of her ugly face. He have to wonder time to time untl she collected 22( or maybe i got the quantity wrong ) fresh young virgin blood. Then only she can break the spell which makes her ugly in the first place.<br><br>Anyway back to the topic about the oily man... how it's fitted into a small bottle is erm... I also dn't know. bt whoever want to find this thng, you can't. It doesn't exist in our modern life anymore. Yet if you believe that then you're easily to be fooled. ehem... there is a place I know which have the sightings of this oily man, but it was back in 2001. Not sure if there is nowaday.<br><br>The place is the Cemetery somewhere near Bugis Junction. Road name... Jalan Kubur. If you wish to see it also, you can't. The reports given was all females.<br><br>So my guessing is you have to be female and 100% alone at that time.<br><br>Again back to our chapter of Oily Man...<br>What Pajero have stated was the actual facts of this Orang Minyak...<br>I'm not sure if he have stated this cause I'm typing this offline now. The oily man does not go around killing people. They are actually 100% wth Gurantee stamp rapist. They go around rape girls, not sure is it virgin or not, or only have to be beautiful girl... but rest assure, they are rapist. And for what I know which is what most people also know, after the raping event. The draw an X on their victim face. Kinda like the marking saying, "YES!! I'VE SCORED!!!" or sumthing like that.<br><br>There are two thing which the oily man against. The 'Batik' cloth which can only capture it. Another is fire. DUH!!! But that won't kill it.<br><br>How it moves? Like a ninja... cannot even sense it.<br>How it dissapears is really unique. What I heard is It blends itself in the darkness and POOF! INSTANT DAVID COPPERFIELF MAGICS!!!<br><br>Ok.. now I'm reading back what I've said and got me thinking. How the hell did I know all this in the first place.... Hahaha...<br><br>PJ... don't unexist this topic.... I still want to find out more about this horny ghost.... Anyone out there... If you have anything to say... or maybe photos associated with the oily man... please post em here.<br><br>Also, try not to discuss anything off topic iside here....

            <div class='col-md body'>DS, you might be interested in this, I was surfing for the "Oily Man" on the net when i found this..<br><br>"Dr Nurul Rampak<br>Director - SE Asian Cultural Studies<br>University of Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>I am writing to you in your capacity as an expert in Malay folklore. I have an unusual request, so I hope you will indulge me in a brief explanation.<br><br>Last month, my wife Cathy and I were sightseeing somewhere southwest of the Cameron Highlands on the Malay Peninsula. I donÂ’t know where exactly, as we became lost in the jungle while looking for a Buddhist temple.<br><br>Cathy persuaded me to stop at a particularly steep point on the trail to take some photos of a river visible through the canopy below. The creature was waiting for us next to the scooter when we returned.<br><br>Picture an otter without a tail standing on its hind legs, with a tiny human face and hands to match, and youÂ’d have an idea of what it looked like. It was waist-high and held a staff in one hand, oiled fur glistening in the hot Malay sun.<br><br>We stared at the Â‘Oily ManÂ’ in astonishment before it pointed at Cathy and clutched its genitals with a leer. I moved in front of her and shook my head. I think he got the message, because he shrugged and pointed his staff at me. I only realised it was hollow just before the dart hit me in the thigh. I pulled it out straight away, but the poison spread quickly; a tingling sensation followed by numbness that rapidly deadened my leg.<br><br>Then the Oily Man turned its attention to Cathy, prodding her with his blowgun and making high-pitched yipping sounds. Cathy tried to frighten him away with the flash of her camera, but it didnÂ’t work. He tripped her with the blowgun and immediately jumped on top of her, clearly sexually aroused. I limped towards them, but the Oily Man suddenly howled in pain and scampered into the jungle towards the river. Strangely, Cathy said she thought her wedding ring burned it.<br><br>I required a respirator to breathe by the time we reached the hospital, as the Doctors were unable to combat the neurotoxin from the dart. Fortunately, the poison wore off after three days in intensive care.<br><br>Returning to Australia, we tried to put the experience behind us, and the film stayed in the camera until last week. For some reason, the Oily Man is quite hazy in the photo attached, but it piqued my interest. After some investigation, I stumbled across the Malay folktale of the Â‘Orang MinyakÂ’ or Oily Man, a supernatural being that preys on the virtue of maidens.<br><br>Dr Rampak, can I request all information you have on the existence of the Orang Minyak for inclusion in a submission to the Malaysian government that IÂ’m preparing? Tracking down this creature may be of profound anthropological significance, as there is no doubt we have travelled similar evolutionary paths.<br><br>I have also enclosed my toxicology results so you know this isnÂ’t a hoax."<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>Benjamin Noble.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  I am amazed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br></div>

I woul like to set the record clear about this myth of the fabled "Orang Minyak".<br><br>First of all this "Orang Minyak" is not of any unearthly or supernatural origin. It is a form of "ilmu" knowledge, whose origin is of a sinister nature. More associated with the dark arts usually.<br><br>Just like the fabled "Hantu Penanggal", the "Orang Minyak" is a man, whose quest to seek unearthly skills and powers by invoking the earth demon ("jembalang tanah") however in return for such abilities the demon usually requests in return to consummate with a virgin girl once every full moon ("Bulan Penuh"). Thus it is the demon which usually inhibit's the man's body, when he goes about raping virgin girls.<br><br>One more thing the oil that he coats himself with is the key to his seemingly unnatural abilities. The oil is made as per instructions by the earth demon, whose recipe and procedures is only known to a select few, has the ability to give one to perform unnatural feats, such as, invulnerability, invisibility, ability to camoulfage and blend with the night, agility and etc.<br><br>Well I hope this information could set the matter straight. I am just perturbed that many mythical creatures are being mis described and explained. It is time someone, who is well versed in the Occult to set the matter straight.<br><br>Regards,<br>Clavicula Salomanis</blockquote></div>
