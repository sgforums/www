            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: orange;"><strong>Making light of a mystery</strong></span><br>By Ashleigh Wilson<br>December 26, 2003<br><br>It bobs around on the horizon - a strange, fuzzy circle of light they call the Min Min. And in Boulia, a small town in western Queensland, there's no shortage of theories about what it is.<br><br>"I reckon it's an emu running around with a torch up its arse," says council worker Robert "Bruiser" Cooms. "That's what it's like, exactly that."<br><br>For years, the legend of the Min Min light has been one of Boulia's major tourist attractions, and the eerie phenomenon has even managed to spook the most hardened bushmen. But now the locals are fighting a new threat.<br><br>Faced with a rational explanation of the Min Min light by a Brisbane academic, the people of Boulia are playing down the facts and talking up the mystery. And no one's going to convince them otherwise.<br><br>"You don't know where it is - it could be a hundred yards or a hundred miles away," says Mr Cooms, 62, who last saw the light while he was shooting kangaroos outside town.<br><br>"It can be really scary, but you just can't explain it."<br><br>Others politely disagree. Earlier this year, a neuroscientist from the University of Queensland, Jack Pettigrew, achieved what none of the locals wanted to know: he solved the mystery of the Min Min light.<br><br>Professor Pettigrew showed the light was a product of a fata morgana, or inverted mirage, and created one himself to prove it.<br><br>He says the light is caused when a pocket of cold air is trapped below warm air close to the ground.<br><br>But in a town that boasts an elaborate $2 million Min Min tourist centre and thrives on the tourism dollars the phenomenon attracts, they don't want to know too much.<br><br>There's even a prominent sign enticing visitors on the way into Boulia to experience "this unsolved modern mystery". When telling their own tales of Min Min encounters, the locals speak in hushed and reverential tones.<br><br>Council worker Ned Rivas relates his own story, then grins when asked how many he's seen. "It depends on how many of these you've had," he says, pointing to his beer.<br><br>However, Professor Pettigrew insists he is not out to spoil the fun. He even describes the light as "freaky'.<br><br>"It's not that I'm trying to take the piss out of them, or take the wonder out of it, I'm just providing a basis for this phenomenon," he says.<br><br>For his part, Mr Cooms is quick to dismiss Professor Pettigrew's findings and scientific approach.<br><br>"They should leave it alone," he says. "It's one of the great mysteries of the world."<br><br></div>
