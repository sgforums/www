Sure we've all heard about chickens who run around the barnyard after getting their heads chopped off. But for over a year? So in an effort to know, for sure, that the news is The Truth, I went looking for evidence that Mike was real. Here's what I found -- and the story from the 26 March 2000 issue of This is True.<br><br>The town of Fruita, Colo., wanted something a little less boring than the usual "pioneers" to focus on for Colorado Heritage Week, so the city revived the story of Mike the Headless Chicken. In the 1940s, farmer Lloyd Olsen went to get a chicken for dinner. Wanting to leave as much of the neck as possible, he lopped off the chicken's head as tightly as he could. The chicken did not die, and continued to "peck" for food as it walked around the yard. Amazed, Olsen started feeding the chicken with an eyedropper. The headless bird, dubbed Mike, appeared in Life magazine and traveled to exhibitions around the country. Fruita's Mike the Headless Chicken Festival is a smashing success, and a new Mike sculpture ("I made him proud-looking and cocky," the artist says) was recently unveiled downtown. Mike lived for 18 months after his head was chopped off."<br><br>Mike in Real Life<br><img src="http://www.thisistrue.com/images/mike.jpg"><br>A face only a mother could love -- Mike the Headless Chicken.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually most of Mike's head survived the chop off... his brain stem and a ear was left, allowing him to survive. The part of the brain not really needed for chicken life, mainly that of higher brain functions (the part you use to fill out tax forms) was lost, but the chook din really flex that muscle and as you could see, lived pretty fine without it.</div>
