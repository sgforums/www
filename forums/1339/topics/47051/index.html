            <div class='col-md body'>Reference Scripture passages:   Luke 21:10-28 and Revelation 6:1-8<br><br>Being aware of the recent news, I can't help but to agree and testify that biblical prophecy from the mouth of Jesus is very true. Glance through the passage of Luke 21, how many prophetic descriptions can you identify with? [Luke 21 verse10 :  Wars*, severe earthquakes, famines and pestilences(diseases) in various places and fearful events and great signs from heaven.] For me, ALL of them are what we see on daily news and the Bible tells us there are more to come... A look at Revelation 6 provides us with yet another astonishing insight. In verse 5-6 of the chapter, " A quart of wheat for a day's wages...." a day's labour and yet unable to buy enough wheat tells us the amount of hardship one has to go through inorder to earn a living. With economic downturn and increase in unemployment as the backdrop, how relevant is this prophecy to us ? Going on to Revelation 6 verse 8, ["...given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the WILD BEASTS of the earth."] Sword, lack of food supply and pandemic disease can kill even with our modern technologies and scientific advancements but what about wild beasts? Animals killing a fourth of world's population how can it be? They are either extinct, endangered or locked up in zoos and with our housing facilities and weapons, these creatures trying to harm us is a laughing stock! But once again, we are brought to attention that the current killer diseases that has emerged lately came from animals.  How can it be so?<br><br>Examples like the Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV) responsible for AIDS being from monkeys, Bubonic plague(Black Death) from rats and the recent SARS-causing pathogen, the Corona virus that cause so much fear and several other diseases is suspected by scientists that it came from some wild animals infecting human beings and claimed millions of lives.  The Bible warned its readers that these are the signs and indications of the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ which marks the final episode of world history ending with the Judgement day............Coincidental or fufilment of biblical prophecies.....You decide?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is part of an article "A Satanic Plot for a One World Government The World Conspirators: the Illuminati" by Myron Fagan.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Before u start reading, Illuminati is actually a satanic group...</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">World wars</span><br>The First World War was to be fought so as to enable the Illuminati to destroy Czarism in Russia, as vowed by the International Bankers after the Czar had torpedoed his scheme at the congress held in Vienna, and to transform Russia into a stronghold of atheistic Communism. The differences stirred up by agents of the Illuminati between the German and British Empires would be used to foment this war. After the war would be ended, Communism was to be built up and used to destroy other governments and weaken religions.<br><br>The Second World War, when and if necessary, was to be fomented by using the controversies between fascist and political Zionists. During this war, International Communism was to be built up until it equaled in strenght that of the United Christendom. When it reached that point, it was to be contained and kept in check until required for the final social cataclysm.<br><br>The Third World War is to be fomented by using the so-called controversy agents of the Illuminati would stir up between political Zionists and the leaders of the Moslem world. That war is to be directed in such a manner that all of Islam and political Zionism, Israel, will destroy each other while, at the same time, the remaining nations, once more divided on this issue, will be forced to fight themselves into a state of complete exhaustion - physically, mentally, spiritually, and economically. The stage will then be set to put the one world government into operation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A one world government</span><br>In the final phases of the conspiracy, the one world government is to consist of a key dictator - the head of the United Nations, the Council on Foreign Relations (the Illuminati group in the U.S.), a few billionaires, the Communists, and scientists who have proven their devotion to the great conspiracy. All others are to be integrated into a vast conglomeration of monopolized humanity, becoming total slaves of the conspiracy.<br><br>In the United States, immediately after World War I, the Illuminati set up what they called the Council on Foreign Relations, commonly referred to as the CFR. This CFR is actually the Illuminati now operating in the U.S. Its hierarchy, the mastermind control of the CFR, to a very great extent, are descendants of the original Illuminati conspirators, even though many of them have changed their names to conceal this fact.<br><br>There is a similar establishment of the Illuminati in England, operating under the name of the British Institute of International Affairs. There are similar secret Illuminati organizations in France, Germany, and other nations operating under different names. All of these organizations, including the CFR, continuously set up numerous subsidiary or front organizations that are infiltrated into every phase of the various nations affairs. But at all times, the operation of these organizations were and are masterminded and controlled by the Illuminati.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Have anyone notice about a speech in G8 Summit recently about playing a role in shaping the New World Order? New World Order is about creating a One World Government! This has been plan many years ago....this is 1 of the sign too!</span>[/i]</div>
