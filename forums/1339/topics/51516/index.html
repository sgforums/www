            <div class='col-md body'>"This mystery is of particular interest to me, because when I was much younger, my parents actually had a copy of one of these paintings in our house, hanging half way up the stairs on the wall. Here's the story about the painting and it's numerous prints:<br><br>From around 1985 onwards, a series of mysterious house fires were brought to the attention of the general public, following the discovery that in each case, the buildings and all their contents were completely destroyed apart from a painting - the "Crying Boy", which remained unscathed. In the years that followed, some 40-50 cases were recorded in which a house fire had destroyed everything except for the picture. It became known as the "Curse of the Crying Boy", and even made headline news at one point. The picture itself was a portrait painted by a Spanish artist of an orphan. It is said that his studio burnt to the ground, and the boy was later killed in a car crash. The picture is one of the first to be mass produced in the UK, there are several thousand of them in circulation, but the curse still appears to apply to all the copies. It is said that the curse will only effect someone if the owner of the painting becomes aware of it. Some psychics have claimed that the painting is Haunted by the spirit of the boy it depicts.<br><br>We must have had that painting in our house for 15+ years, and although it never set fire to anything, I never used to like it. It's not a particularly pleasant picture in any case, and it always used to give me the creeps. Fortunately it's long gone, but I can't help wondering who's got it now. One thing's for certain, there's no way I'd ever put that picture up in my house again."<br><br><img src="http://www.ghoststudy.com/monthly/jun03/tears1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.ghoststudy.com/monthly/jun03/tears3.jpg"><br><br>"The SUN newspaper did a huge story about the painting and asked all its readers to send in their copies of the painting to them and they would destroy them. And guess what... a fire mysteriously started at the warehouse where the paintings were being stored."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Submitted by a viewer:<br>I am a regular visitor to your site and until now I have never seen anything that has made my blood stand still. My Great Grandfather lived in Davenport, LA in the early 80's. His house was old but always clean and safe because he frequently had children visiting. The only thing that scared me about my Great Grandfather's house was this creepy close up painting of a boy crying. I was a young boy at the time and didn't like the fact that it felt like the boy was watching me. Any way in the summer of '83 he left town for a business trip and returned to find that his house had burnt to the ground. Searching through the remains of his home he found that only two things had survived the fire: A photo album of me and the painting of the crying boy. He told me this story several times before he died but I never believed him, thinking he was trying to spook me. I am 23 now and when I read the story and saw the pic on your site, more than just a chill ran down my spine, if you catch my drift.. I once asked him what happened to the painting and he said that he sold it for a dollar at a garage sale. I remember the painting but not the fire. I saw that you asked for letters about this painting and decided to share my Great Grandfather's experience with you. ~ Steve</div>
