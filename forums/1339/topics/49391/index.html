            <div class='col-md body'>"The Hiccup Man :<br><br>His name is Russell Harrison, and he has a very bad case of the hiccups. In fact, Russell (or "Hick" as his friends call him) has been hiccuping for sixty-four years. The hiccuping began when he was four years old, and not a day or night has gone by for Russell since that time without the bothersome affliction. He has tried every home and folk remedy known to man. He has been to countless so-called medical experts. He has been the subject of at least two five-year long studies at John Hopkins University and the Mayo Clinic. He has gone under the knife, twice. He has even tried professional hypnotists, all to no avail.<br><br>You've probably seen the story of Russell's plight on TV's Sixty Minutes, Nightline, and 20/20 with Barbara Walters. Over the years he has appeared on just about every talk show around, from Johnny Carson (see left) to Letterman to Leno to Imus to Politically Incorrect.<br><br>"This has ruined my life," said Russell in a recent interview which was punctuated by the uncontrollable spasms of the diaphragm. "I've been through four and a half divorces and countless botched relationships, not to mention all the jobs I've drifted in and out of. My dream was to be a country music singer or disc jockey, but these hiccups ruined that dream. Mel Tillis got lucky. He has a real bad stutter but it goes away when he sings. When I try to sing, my hiccups won't quit. Oh well, I guess the good Lord had a reason to give me these hiccups, and if he sees fit, he'll send a cure my way someday."<br><br>Even after all these years, Russell has not given up the hope of one day being hiccup-free. For the last twelve years he has had a standing offer of a $500 reward to the first person to deliver to him a cure that works. If you are up to the challenge, you can usually find Russell sitting out on his front porch at 186 Hickory Hill Drive in Campbell County, just watching the cars go by...and hiccuping. "<br></div>
