            <div class='col-md body'>When the day of Pentecost came, they(the apostles) were all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.  They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.  All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. (Acts 2:1-4)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tongues  are in modern day, divided  into 2 categories.<br><br>One, it is an angelic  language meaning that  it makes no common sense to  another person but it is  language inspired by the Holy Spirit inside a christians to communicate with God. Yes it sounds gibberish to  others,  ev en to the person who speaks it becos it is the Spirit in him/her speaking  not him or her.<br><br>Two, it is  a known language but  maybe p r e v iously unknown to the speaker. For example, i may not  know French or  some African language, then  the Spirit came upo n  me and then  suddenly I get the  gift to speak French,  that  is tongues too. IT can  be an oneoff  situation i n  this case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I am not wrong, the church lost most, if not all of it's spirtual gifts when it stated to seep into worldy politics and a heavy, legalistic way of life that seemed to replace grace for a moment.<br><br>I doubt the gifts actually left the chuch, who on earth wouldn't God want us his church to operate in the supernatural anyway? Or are we supposed to reach out via the foolish ways of man that so many of us sometimes run the risk of over to?<br><br>It is my opinion that the modern church today shall all the more operate in the supernatural. And I believe that this is all the more shown by the persceuted churches in third world countries with nothing to hold onto but their faith, and they fo come across a lot of supernatural interventions.<br><br>For us, I suppose we have our spirtual senses dulled sometimes by the vale of plenty we have. In our wealth we have prehaps started to put God into a box which we can understand, a box of country-club mentality and trying to buy God over with thides and good deeds? Manly methods? Not that these are wrong, but prehaps like the animal in the zoo losing their instinct for survival in the wild, I go concerned we might have lost our sensitivity to the spirit of God in all our head knowledge and material possesions, the four large walls of the church we see.<br><br>In this past two years I have been on the frontline, I have little doubt that the enemy is not only very real, but it is a supernatural enemy. And if we refuse to operate in the supernatural as we are called to do, thinking we can fend off their firey darts with nothing but our head knowledge and years of historic thelogy, I'm afraid we are woefully underarmed.<br><br>In the light of this, has it been a surprise that we are more ready to quote scripture, but less able to follow up on our words? To show grace to a friend or something? Hmm...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Imagine. Last time people, despite their personal misgivings, respected the chuch in the old days. During the time of God's Generals (Smith Wigglesworth, Maria Esther, Joe Cook and so on) because despite their unbelief, could see the power operating in the church. When the church realizes it's supernatural annointing and moves in it. There was deliverance, healing and all sorts of mircales goin' around as the normal affair it really was.<br><br>And this was during a time 1850s-1950s when atheism and rationalism was even more militant then today, where atheists and the like dared to go to meetings, stand up, and speak up against the speaker. But many of who were promptly silenced by the power of God. Just look at the cases of William Brahman and is it Maria Esther? Where pple who dared to challange them publicly collasped writhing and crying in deliverance or suddenly lost their voices and could not speak (undoubtly these pple were changed by their brush with the hem of God's cloak). Despite all their curses, misgivings and such, the unbeliever respected the church in those days.<br><br>Nowadays. Even we who claim to be charismatic hardly operate in all the supernatural described in the book of acts which we had been called to do so. When people look at the church today, they scoff at it, basically, they see the entire thing to be a scam. And maybe they are not far from the truth, for prehaps we have sold out a lot to the ways of man in trying to move in the flesh rather then in the spirit. We've prehaps became so seeker sensitive that we've dulled our area of being God sensitive.<br><br>Of course, I'm not saying that we should and must follow the path of the gu ren in the old days, or look back whistfully on them and live in yesterdays hour. But we have to go on to the next level in our lives and such. I certainly dun believe what we as a church, esp. in singapore, are being and doing everything God has called up to be and to do. There's still quite a lot of work to be done.<br><br>Basically, prehaps the problem could lie in our pride over our acomplishments, where we build big buildings, live in them like a country club and pat ourselves on our backs. Assuming that we've indeed done what we've been called to do. Not that these things are bad, but I think we should open up our eyes to our surroundings. When was the last time we helped change things for a friend? Do we actually spend more time preaching to our friends, not that is bad, then actually helping them? Moving in the flesh? Hmm?</div>
