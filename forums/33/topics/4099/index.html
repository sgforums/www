            <div class='col-md body'>Bureaucratic system is inevitable. Not that I am embracing the philosophy. How liberal is good for you then? I'm sure that Unis ain't judge on whether or not they inform their students of when the term starts. Just for interest, they do have printed schedules of the major activies.<br><br>Can't say much about the rest of the system. Hasn't use much of their service so far except for the mundane registrations of modules and examinations...<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://synpl.tinted.net" rel="nofollow">Sobriety is not required.</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by n-ever (edited 17 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, NUS is NOT world class for the following reasons:<br><br>a) Bad teachers who confuse you by telling you about the controversies of a new topic, even before explaining the subject matter of that topic.<br><br>b) If you have been to LT 19 at Bizad, just look at the ridiculous angle that you must bend over in order to write on the lecture table top.<br><br>c) Many teachers are just out to get published in international journals, get promotions, and no one cares about imparting the knowledge to students.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, from my personal experience, NUS Lecturers are very (relatively) dedicated to undergraduates alredi (i used to think they are not too). Really. Overseas, the lecturers REALLY SUX, they dun give a gamn about undergrads, when you got questions to ask them outside lecture, they can tell you in your face "sorry I am not free".<br><br>Overseas Uni like those in the States and UK are more focused on postgraduates.<br><br>And NUS exam papers do have standard, at least for my faculty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi LittleMan,<br>which fac are u from? Being in NUS, I get the feelings that the lecturers are obliged to answer the queries we have after lecture/tutorial because they are paid to do so. I find the tutors more dedicated as compared to lecturers. This is especially so for tutors who are still pursuing a course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>True, they are paid. But they are being paid a lot more in their industrial projects and researches which they earn by commissions. And each lecturer has to produce 5 journals each year, otherwise kenna kick out. So they are actually not very free to tok to undergrads. Hence I really appreciate their effort cos I am that kind of person who bo liao bo liao go see lecturer one. I even go to their office to chit chat !<br><br>And frankly, they are already very helpful. In UK, *sigh*, wait long long. Undergrads are NOTHING to them, not interested ah! Only a few good ones will help you. But most of the time, they leave you to die. Their notes also ! Alamak ! I thot NUS worse enuff liao !<br><br>The tutors are better cos they are younger, understand our problems and they need our appraisals to promote *hehe* Also, they dun have "outside" assignments. Hence tutoring is their "full-time" job.<br><br>Me from Mechanical and Production Engineering. U ?<br><br>Just one thing to add ... 30 years ago, when we wanted to make Changi Airport World Class, people were laughing ...<br><br>Why can't we make NUS world class ?</div>
