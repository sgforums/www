            <div class='col-md body'>for my case...most of my tutors are pretty dedicated to their wk &amp; are willing to teach the students...but like us, they HATE the system as well.<br><br>Most of them are not consulted of many changes made in the system of their own faculties, &amp; only come to know of it abt only a few days b4 us. they themselves often complain to us abt the sch, but in subtle sarcasm, of coz.even the tutors are displeased wif the sch, wat more abt us?</div>

Most of the time, lecturers are just lecturing for the sake of lecturing. And it is worse for lecturers coming from China. Their English is almost incomprehensible and they are boring and just read out from the notes most of the time.<br><br>One more thing to add. I think some of NUS students really don't behave like how they should behave. There was once that my friends and I were in the canteen and when we found a seat, we left our bags on the seats and went on to buy our food. However, when we came back, there was this group of students sitting there playing cards! During lunchtime when everyone else is looking for a seat! They threw our bags to one side and when we came back and stared at them, they didn't even bother to say sorry! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> And there was this particular girl that looked really bitchy I must say.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi pple<br>at least NUS has better, cheaper food and is more accessible than NTU.<br>It is located at such a ulu place.. the queue for the bus can reach all the way from the end of the bus terminal to the MRT station...<br>Many tutors are actually masters students who are forced to teach... and they like so reluctant like that. Some dune even bother to teach properly....<br>Frankly, what's the point of going to school when u dune have teachers who can teach?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the point is that you all are seeing it from the point of students. Think about it, you all are there for 3/4 years, some more, some less. The top admin of NUS has been there for so long, they are the ones with long term vision. Like the Changi Airport example, while the currents changes may not seem to be benefical to all of us, maybe in ten years time they will make sense? It is not easy to run a university, and there are unpopular decisions that have to be made. Why not try to turn things to our advantage instead of complaining?<br><br>This said, I have to agree that some of the things mentioned, like the attitude of the staff could be much better. Once, I went to the registar's office, and the clerks at the front desks were so rude. However, when I went up to the 4th floor one, the clerk there was very nice, showing that we shouldn't generalise. Maybe there is a feedback channel that we are not aware of?<br><br>Regarding tutors, I have to say that my tutors are all relatively nice. Whenever I have problems, they will be willing to help me out, though I do not look for them all that much. Bear in mind that we are in the U now, no more spoonfeeding, and they do not have to behave like JC teachers who will hang over us all the time.....Students ARE expected to do their own readings.....at least, that is what is expected in Arts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quite a number of top students in the tertiary institutions are foreigners, cos many of the smart S'poreans have left to study overseas already, mainly on scholarships. So only the not so smart ones are left...<br><br>As for NUS courses, tutors being lousy, etc. they are really not as bad as everyone thinks. Wait till you try an overseas uni. You're basically on your own!!<br><br>But I do agree about the comments about admin. The system is too bureaucratic! So except for a few exceptions, the general admin sucks!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>What the lecturers do in class is to touch on the principles/concepts taught in the textbooks given, and how and why they apply it in the real world situations and give examples. They will sometimes also give u a scenario and ask how u would react using the concepts taught, why it is right, why it is wrong ... and a debate in class would probably arise fr it.<br><br>Students are EXPECTED to read the textbook beforehand. If you have any doubts/questions regarding the text they asked you to read, ask then they will answer you. Otherwise, they wont really touch on whats already on the text.
