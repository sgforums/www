            <div class='col-md body'>I am entering NUS this August. I have friends who are in NTU and SMU, and after having discussions with them, I realise that NUS students are getting the worse deals....<br>For example, NTU freshmen are virtually guaranteed a hostel room if they apply(or so I heard); they even get to choose their roommates if they want to stay in the double room.<br>For NUS students, we do not get to choose our roommates. My friends also warned me that your CCA records have to be stellar then you will have a hostel room. This turned out to be true, because my hostel applications was unsuccessful. I am now facing a 4 hour journey to and fro NUS every single day!!!I was thinking of joining CCAs before that but now I have changed my mind...where am I going to find the time?For students who apply for hte cheaper rooms, there is also the compulsory meal fees that we have to pay...so we end up pay for 6 days worth of food when we will probably not be staying 6 days in the hostel...<br>SMU students do not have such problems as their school is in a centralised location.<br>Furthermore, I found out that international students only have to pay the hostel application fee of 5.20 if and only if they get a hostel room. With my unsuccessful application, I have wasted money....<br>Which uni do you think is the best funded?Most people seem to think its SMU...anyway,it seems the uni that is most willing to advertise and promote its graduates at a time when the economy is bleak.<br>I guess I'm just frustrated and have to air my views.Maybe I should just get used to the fact that life's not fair...I have been suffering from "monopolitis" all my life...what can I do when NUS is the only one that offers the course that I want?</div>
