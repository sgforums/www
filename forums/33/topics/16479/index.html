The sore throat caused  my earache and throbbing headache. I couldn't even finish the slice of bread for breakfast... I just ate 2 bites, took me 10++min to finish chewing them... In the end, fed up, threw it away (without my mother knowing)...<br><br>Well, I went sometime last week to YIH also to see the same doctor about my bad cough... initially, the cough was better after taking the medicine prescribed... oh well, it cost me only $2 for cough mixture and flu tablets,  and since the medicine is quite effective (and I dun need to take antiobiotics), so I went to YIH about my sore throat too...<br><br>Yeah...to cut the long story short, the doctor said that my throat is alright (heh...I told her the soreness is along the neck and led up to skull and ear...of cos she can't see lah...) and gave me lozenges and panadol...<br><br>Now, I'm still coughing, throat still hurting everytime i swallow saliva... pain in the head throbbing every few times a minute...<br><br>sighz... i think i will go back to health service next time... they dun give antibiotics  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (I hate antibiotics...)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>antibiotics quite useless in sore throat, usually. might as well go for the serious cough mixtures, the one with codeine phosphate.<br><br>anyhow, i`m sure you`ll be fine within a few days .. sleep early, drink lots of water .. diet a little, lose a few kilos .. you`ll be looking like kate moss coming out of your sore throat.</div>

I was taking the red one, but now finish it already...<br><br>future doctor, I already quite skinny already leh... my lower arm is like quite bonny already... diet also won't remove the unwanted weight in the wrong area... But then, I think I will lose weight... got appetite but take so long to eat, cough so badly until I must steady myself (else will fall down)... okay... i will drink more water...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there`s quite a lot of cough syrup mixtures out there with codeine phosphate, like phensedyl etc .. problem is that they have potential to be abused by drug addicts, who can drink them by the gallon. usually is brownish color.<br><br>and you should eat more, also can exercise more .. lose weight in other areas .. start by walking in campus end to end instead of taking bus. save twenty cents and get exercise. just dun die halfway and kena sent to a&amp;e hor.<br><br>get worse, just icq me, see if i can help, but i think you shd be fine in a couple of days. meanwhile, i`ll stay away from sci, hear someone coughing will run in the other direction. heh heh just kidding. hope you get better.</div>
