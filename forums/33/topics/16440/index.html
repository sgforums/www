            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm not ready to reveal which module my lecturer is teaching, just that he's from the Maths Department, Science.<br><br>He made this claims on his website:<br>Claims: (1) It is not my obligation to put my lecture notes in my web site;<br>(2) I can not guarantee the contents of the notes are error-free.<br><br>He doesn't send his notes to co-op so we can't get the printed copies and he made the above claims. Also, he DOESN'T PUT UP his notes until THE MORNING OF THE LECTURE !!!<br><br>As a student, I feel that he, as a lecturer, has the responsibility to provide easy access to his notes to facilitate our learning process. Although, no man is perfect, he should ensure that his notes are as error-free as possible.<br><br>Like what I say, he doesn't provide his lecture notes until the morning of the lecture ( our lecture starts at 12noon) and usually, my friends and I have to rush to the co-op to zap from one printed copy. Otherwise we have to do without notes.<br><br>His notes are badly typed out. He doesn't have the sense to use proper italic or bold to emphasize his points. And printing his notes is a nightmare. As his notes are revealed on a lecture to lecture basis, we have to print from wherever he stops, which is sometimes quite troublesome.<br><br>As for the textbook he uses, there is only 1 copy in Science library and some idiot has borrowed it and has yet to return. Although the lecturer said he had asked the library to purchase more copies and put the textbook on RGB, I dun think I will have the chance to touch the textbook at all...<br><br>I have yet to see a lazier lecturer in my days in NUS. He is a waste of NUS's monetary resources. I'm thinking whether to send a complain letter to the department head 'cos at the rate he is going, I dun think i will get a good result.<br><br>And next time I'm grading the lecturers, I will fail him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm don be so angry lah<br>let me tell u something which may ease your anger......<br><br>Firstly, it is indeed not an obligation for lecturers to provide notes to students. Although generally speaking, most lecturers still practise giving out notes, which is discouraged by university's policy!<br><br>Secondly, fret not! coz i also have another lecturer who refuse to put up his lecture powerpoint notes on his website before the lecture. He will only put the powerpoint file on his website 1 or 2 days after the lecture!<br><br>When many students find that it is easier for us to make and take down additional notes with the lecture notes, they begin to mail the lecturer but he still stand firmly on his grounds. What can we do? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> The only consolation we got was that he is a good natured lecturer, hence we also give in to him.<br><br>Well, i do indeed agree with you that it is their responsibility to ensure error-free notes. This would prevent any misunderstanding by students, and also does not creates a bad image on the lecturer on whether he knows his stuff well enough.<br><br><strong>Shervon99:</strong><br>Be sure to give your lecturer a FAIL evaulation and write a long essay on how he can improve on his teaching methods!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shervon99, have u gals ever tok to your lecturer b4? or perhaps even email him regarding this issue?<br><br>Seems like he is indeed a lazy fellow! Let me guess.... is he an Assoc. Prof? coz most of the time an Assoc. Prof will not have any incentives to value add their lecture contents and presentation since they are already at the peak of their career and there are basically nothing much more for them to excel or achive beyond their current status.<br><br>In contrast, a newly grad of Phd. might be able to better understand and put himself into the shoe of those students. They still have the energy and strength to strive for achivements and recognition.<br><br>Hey, after your final draft, send me a copy leh! hehehehe let me see okie?</div>
