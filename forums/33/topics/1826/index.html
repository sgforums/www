            <div class='col-md body'>The following article is a real problem experienced by a personal friend.<br><br>1 and a half years ago in 2000, PJC accepted an overage student from another JC to its first batch of J1 students. The school accepted him.<br><br>One day, during the year (around August), this student was on the way to a medical clinic during school hours. He took the MRT there, on the way out of the control station; he was halted and was requested to surrender his Student Pass by a MRT officer. He did have the validity year sticker but his Student Pass stated only his secondary school as his "PJC" sticker was washed off by the washing machine earlier. The officer did not believe his reason and called up the school and asked if he was a student of PJC, however when the clerk went thru the records, he/she said that he does not exist.<br>The officer then confiscated the Student Pass and told him a letter would be sent to his home.<br><br>This student had been consistent in his work and claimed to have studied very hard for his promotional exams for that year. However, he was not promoted. He was nonplussed and refused to accept it and requested to see his exam papers. Uncommonly, the school declined his request even on an exception basis. He left the school feeling puzzled and demoralized.<br><br>Almost 1 and a half years later, he received a letter of warrant for an arrest regarding the Student Pass matter. He was surprised, as he has already forgotten about it. He was angry because he was not at fault. He was even more upset that he and his father had to take a precious day leave from work to settle something, which he did not do.<br><br>He is planning to report this matter to the LTA as well as to the MP of his estate.<br><br>This whole situation seems to be a conspiracy amongst the PJC admin. And has caused gratuitous mental stress and a waste of time and money to the student and his father.<br><br>Was this student ever registered in the school? Did the school overlooked his age but continued to "play" along? Or was it just a "hoo ha" the clerk made and that he really flunked his exams? But why did the school refused to let him have even a glance at his exams papers?<br><br>The story continues once the MP replies.<br></div>
