            <div class='col-md body'>Blurfreak,<br>The CFM can be chosen as graded or pass/fail. Should you take pass/fail option, no matter how good you did or how badly you fair as long as you pass, you will just get a pass grade. The modular credits will be awarded to you but no marks will be taken into calculation of your CAP.<br>If you choose to take graded(the default option), the result will affect your CAP and you will be given A,B,C,D accordingly. Usually the advancement to the next level is affected purely by passing the modules, however nobody wishes to have a low CAP that is dragged down by their CFM. Of course, if you do well in the CFM, it can help to pull the CAP up also.<br>Basically most undergrads decide on whether to take graded or not based on their confidence of doing well in that module. Of course, taking ungraded also means less stress.<br>Hope this helps you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Its called something like TRADITIONS OF CHINESE (from chinese dept). This module toks abt traditions of chinese eg: how ppl celebrate chinese new yr and the origin of it etc.<br><br>One interesting thing is, it is written in english.

            <div class='col-md body'>I took Chinese Tradition as my CFM before. In my view it is quite interesting but not that easy to study due to the relatively large number of readings and memorising to do. Hwwever I managed to spot the questions and taking the module as ungraded, it is quite ok. The only problem could be that it is not easy to copy the notes during lecture especially when ou happen to meet a China lecturer teaching in English whose pronounction is not what we are used to. The topics includes different religions such as Confucionism, Taoism, Christainity, Buddhism, the scholor system in China, divinity and how to view art pieces. Mainly it revolves around China.If anyone is expecting to study about all the different festivals that we celebrate, they are in for a shock, as the coverage is quite minimal. That's all I have to comment about the module and as a last note the exam is 3 hours long and closed book.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm today another idea strike me. It is an extension of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Binominal Distribution</span> X~Bin(n,p)<br><br>We can invoke the <span style="font-style: italic;">Central Limit Theorem</span> if the sample size (n) is greater than thirty (n&gt;30).<br><br>Hence by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Central Limit Theorem</span>, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Binominal Distribution</span> will approach a <span style="font-style: italic;">Normal Distribution</span> and we will be able to find the probability of <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">event X</span></strong> occuring from the usual Bell shaped curve with the aid of a statistical table.<br><br>Can this work?<br>Hope this will be a better one than the above 2 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*claps claps*<br><br>*awards yoohoo an A* for his ideas*<br><br>though i think that for the first theory is too simplified, and the assumption that all students have similar characteristics is difficult to meet in the real world. But as all thoeries in economics and all other areas, such assumptions are necessary to in order to come up with a model framework in the first place. so this is where your 2nd and 3rd ideas can come in, by using sampling to test the accuracy of your first theory.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi yoohoo,<br>You're taking HRM now ah? How you find it? Who's teaching you? I heard HRM is quite relaxing for students of other facs coz it's only worth 2 modular credits, and only lasts 6 weeks rite? Last time I had Dr Lee Soo Hoon for my tutor, she was really nice, and made this supposedly very dry and boring module very interesting and fun, but we got to do two 20pages reports, one group and one individual. I think you all no need to do that rite?<br><br>Which LT did you go to? LT16 and LT17 are the ones with the individual chairs and tables, and LT18 &amp; LT19(if I didnt remember wrongly, long time since I've been inside a LT already) still have the old wooden bench-like tables if i'm not wrong. But they have been renovating LT19 during the holidays, dunno what has become of it now. Maybe they'll start to renovate the LTs in Arts soon lah, be patient!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
