Like me, I always travel between science and biz... 2 ends of the U-shaped... (but that is 'cos of my ECA). Anyway, if uni life is boring, that leaves you with lotsa time to develop an active social life, which is the next ultimate besides getting a degree.<br><br>After all the bad things I've said about Science, Science isn't exactly that bad... There's lotsa pple around, lotsa lecture halls, lotsa buildings, but pple just dun care who or how you are, 'cos we dun care about 'being seen' and 'seeing'. Science is not like Orchard Rd (aka. Arts &amp; Biz), most people just wear sandles, bermudas and T-shirt to school... you dun need to put on tonnes of makeup, and nobody cares if you're with the latest trends... food isn't the most important thing to us... canteen is for studying, not eating... Yeah...not to mention that science grads get a starting salary that is higher than arts grad... We have the latest Lecture halls, thanks to SOC (School of Computing)...<br><br>What did I miss out?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
