            <div class='col-md body'>so to conclude, the maxmium pts for entering jc should be extend abit maybe to 23pts. everyone should have a change to go jc who score less than tt &amp; for those who fail to get 23 or other reasons must either repeat their 'o' or go ITE. No1 should go poly with 'o' instead 'A'. This should be the proper way becoz an 16 yr old will not know wat abilities they have to find jobs. they r not mature &amp; too ypung to think of this. &amp; rememeber guys have to go NS, u think they can remember wat they have to do in their poly &amp; wat can they learn in NS! U can forget wat u learn in jc as u going to pick up back in the uni as most of jc grad no need to get a job after NS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>isn't this solution a little out of point? i tot you were tryin to argue that poly grads should be given equal opportunity to enter uni with A lev grads regardless of which poly he's from?<br>your solution only emphasizes that entry to university should indeed be given priority to A lev grads. and jc criteria score really depends on how many students the jc's are capable of takin and whether students with such aggregate scores are capable of tackling A lev education (and yes i agree perhaps s'pore edu system relies too much on paper qualification).<br>soon uni entry criteria will take into account ns performance etc and i guess its these things that will help alleviate our education system's heavy emphasis on paper qualification.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had only started following this thread, so kindly pardon my age-old comments.<br><br>Anyway, talking about equal chances to JC and Poly students. After students have got their O's and are making decisions to move on, the obvious choices for most will be either poly or JC. JC is undeniably more difficult to get in as compared to poly, hence give the JC students some credit for being able to get a place in JC. As for poly, I know of some students whose grades can allow them admission to JC, but they opt for poly instead, as they  actually want to get into the working society asap.<br><br>At this point, perhaps you can think about the JC students being disadvantaged. If you look at the job ads, job qualifications equate an 'A' cert and an 'O' cert, which essentially mean that a JC student, upon graduation, is still looked upon as having the same qualifications as he had 2 years ago when he graduated from secondary school. You may even consider going into JC as a risk, coz uni would seem as "the only route" after grad. If they can't get into uni, there is not many other places they can go to! As for poly grads, at least they can choose to work after grad, except for the few who will pursue further studies in the uni, local or overseas.<br><br>Like mentioned by someone in this thread, the syllabus planned for both groups are different to cater to the needs anyway. Students enter JC - with the main aim of making into uni - are taught the fundamentals which will be discussed more in-depth when they go into uni, whereas poly students will be taught skills development which will prepare them in the working society. So most students should actually be pretty sure about their future routes by the time they get their 'O' results -- JC -&gt; Uni -&gt; work ; Poly -&gt; work.<br><br>Also, let me assure you that poly students ARE ABLE to get into local universities. I did have a few uni classmates who were poly students. As for those which were said not being able to get into uni despite fantastic results, perhaps they were vying for vacancies in too-popular faculties, which of course would post more difficulties of entering uni. Anyway, these difficulties are not unique to poly students, they were also shared by the JC students as well.<br><br>By the way, I had also seen comments in this forum about local unis not being as good as those overseas. Not that I disagree about this, but why in the first place the laments about "how it difficult it is to get into local unis"?<br><br>*******************************************<br><br>I love myself most, so why should I please you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hajime..before i can comment on anything..i hope that you can uderstand a fact that the engineers from the local unis are not recongnised in the Professional Engineers Board of SINGAPORE!!! issnt that contradicting...and what an irony...anyway.. as you have said also..that why is it that ppl are complaining that the uni here are low standard and still why are there ppl that are complaining that it is very difficult to get in..wel..it is purly becuase there is a common understanding between the whole of singapore that poly grads are second class as compared to A'level grads..and then again...most of you are correct in saying that poly is  tertiatry education..but then again..what is the salary scale out there like for a a'level grad as compared to a poly grad??quite a small dissference..and the difference between a poly grad and a Uni grad?? A BIG SUM!!! so why is that that all you ppl kept saying that poly grads recieved tertiatry education but then they are not given the same recognition as a grad??purley because he is a poly and that is a Uni grad that i am comparing with...so is it fair to just outcast and reudce the number of entry for Poly students just based on that argument??No offence to JC students..i do agree with you that going to JC is a direct and simply route to Uni..but i seriously think that the Unis here should not deprive poly grads with a chance at Uni...<br>Another point that i would like to make...its the way that the GOVERNMENT treats the overseas graduates before and after!! before the students went to study overseas with their parents hard-earned money..nothing..nothing is said to them from the government..however..once the students have graduated from the overseas with 1st class and 2nd hornours.,.the governemt began to emphaisze on them coming back to singaproe and contribute to the country's economy and things like that...and that the students are forgetting their roots by working overseas...i really feel that it is really very unjust for those poly grads...who spent the whole of their parents's life savings to go and study overseas and when they have graduated...the society that discrimated them so much before they left are urging for them to go back and contribute to it...WHY SHOULD THEY??<br><br>Above are just some of my personal comments..and please correct me if my facts are wrong..thks...and i must say again..this is not meant to offend anyone..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This topic is kinda old but let me say a few words to those who are willing to listen.<br><br>Yes, indeed the Singapore government is biased, but why do you think that JC students with Cs and Bs are able to enter into NUS? The truth is, not many of them will be able to enter into "Good" courses. What do I mean by "good" courses? Its those popular ones like Engineering, SoC, etc.<br><br>When I entered into NUS 2 years ago, the cut-off grade for NUS Engineering was AAB, can you believe it? It means that students who score BBB or BBC are not able to get into NUS Engineering! Besides that,  the entire cohort has almost 40-50% students who scored either AAA or AAAA (+ S-papers ) in the A levels.<br><br>Let me ask you back the question. Who then, should be allowed to enter into the course? Those with AAAA or those with a COM from poly?<br><br>Besides, when I entered into year2, Electrical Engineering took in some numbers of Poly grads. Those poly grads who are supposedly to be the creme de la creme of the polys. But sadly,  when I looked at the way those poly grads who topped their cohort, the truth does not reflect well on them.<br><br>Let me raise a real-life comparison. A JC student who scores only, say AAB (the minimum grade allowed) and a poly grad who scores ADs and is the top 1% of his cohort. They are both in the second-year. When you do a comparison between their level of understanding, and their ability to apply concepts, the answer is really obvious as who comes out as the winner.<br><br>I must agree that poly grads are good at hands-on stuffs. When it comes down to more theoretical concepts, they are not able to grasp it. I am generalizing.<br><br>Also, the writer of this thread says that the government is restricting the number of people allowed to pursue university education. But lets put it this way, university education is not for everyone. The annual fee is $5650 (subsidised). Without subsidy, the annual fee comes up to $20000. That is to say that, the government is subsiding a student up to $80K per student. If the government allows any Tom, Dick and Harry to enter into the university, it is simply wasting the taxpayer's money.<br><br>Look we are talking about input and output. The government inputs $60K and then gets a grad without substantial standard, is it worth it? The question here is really whether it is worth it to push everyone through university education.<br><br>In the case of the foreign student, I do not agree with the writer's views. Foreign students are very very very intelligent. They have exceptional IQ and the ability to grasp concepts. I know tonnes of them. They are hands-down winner when it comes to understanding. Therefore, it can be understood why the government is willing to sponsor them.<br><br>We're talking about Gaussian distribution here (Normal Distribution). Among their cohort, perhaps the poly grads seemed to be able to fare better. But once they are pit against the creme de la creme of the nation (+foreigners), they are at the bottom end of the ladder. Need I say more? It does not matter if you are the best of the worst. What matters most is being the best of the best.<br><br>It is a competitive society. Life sucks. C'est La Vie. Get used to it.<br></div>
