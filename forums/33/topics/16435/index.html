It seems that this has nothing to do with the performance of an individual's PC, but rather more on luck!<br><br>I had frenz who went to cybercafe and still, don seems to register faster than me ( i am at home). Those in school may be better off slightly as they are the direct client of NUS Server (am i right?). But the queue is so long! I heard frm frenz that some had to Q for 2hrs b4 it is their turn!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But come to tnk of it, we are slightly better off than last time.... They used to queue outside the department. Time slots are pasted on notice board and they had to Q outside and write their names on the blanks of each time slot! So if u are taking 5 modules, u have to run to 5 different departments to sign up for tutorial~!!!<br><br>Nevertheless, i still have to say that this kind of online registration is to tense and competitive although it is in some sense "fair". There should be some room for improvement. Any suggestions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm saw in the papers a few days back tat SMU is using another system for students to sign up for tutorial/ modules.<br><br>They are given 100 e-money at the beggining of every semester. With this, they can "buy" the modules that they want to study. So depending on how important the module is to them, they will put how much credits to it.<br><br>However, I feel that this prob of over-congestion is still not addressed aseveryone will still have to come to the university's site at the same time.<br><br>It is quite impossible to allocate time / day slots for say 1st, 2nd or 3rd yr students to come reg at different days. This is bcoz, some students might have accelerated and hence, a 2nd yr student might be taking 3yr modules.<br><br>how abt allocating different days for 1000, 2000 and 3000 modules?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno about you guys... I'm from Comp Finance in Science and I encounter 2 systems of registration.<br>For SOC, theirs is balloting...equally frustrating 'cos you might not get the slots you choose, even if you registered damn early. The worst part is what my fren did: Find enough people to form a class, then ask the lecturer to reserve/block out/ book the slot they prefer before registration starts. Isn't that as good as not having the balloting system?<br>By the way, Comp Finance pple like to reserve slots...<br>As for my Maths module, it's first come first served...well I prefer that actually... I just wait for the registration to start, then 5 min b4 time, keep reloading the page until the module is available... usually I get what I want. This time round, I didn't exactly get what I want 'cos my frens and I wanted to choose a slot other than that offered...went to pester sub-dean and now dunno what's the situation...whatever...leave it to my frens to settle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I heard Arts registration is quite bad...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya loh, arts registration one of the worst!!!Hey i am not talking big, juz imagine how jam the server/cyber-traffic is with over few thousands ppl accessing it at the same time??<br><br>Ya, btw arts has one of the highest population. So it is not surprising tat we cannot even access the arts homepage at 5pm when the tutorial reg starts.<br><br>I had spent 3 hrs in front of my PC (doing for myself takes abt 2hrs, and then help my frenz who cannot get in, takes me abt another hr) and by the time i log off at 8pm, i had a headach and could not face the PC anymore!!!!!<br><br>Why can't they make the tutorial after the lecture? den we no need to choose any slot for tut liao right? And this will also ensure students come for lecture. (Similar to HRM way of functioning)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that bizad's modules registration works in a different way from arts. Before a semester ends, we are asked to register for the modules that we want the next 2 semesters and we are given the modules we have chosen through balloting. The computer allocates the tutorial classes for each module that we are given before the new semester starts. First week of the new semester, we have this add/drop exercise whereby we can swap the modules and tutorial classes if you dont like what you're given, whether or not you get it is again done by balloting. I think this system is not too bad, compared to the arts system where you have to go queue up physically to sign up for each class. But the downside is we can't access the add/drop from home thru the net. Got to go down to school to do it since everything has to be done in the computer lab, which sometimes can have very long queues. But the good thing is we don't have to worry about not being able to log on to the relevant webpage and spend hours in front of the computer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yoohoo: Not that i dun give you face... as a half-SOC students, need to side...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yoohoo:</div><div class="quote_body"> wah, never give face huh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">? don even agree on one of my reasons?<br><br>Well, it may be true tat SOC is using comp intensively, but it is mainly the hardware that counts, not the server. They do not need a very good and powerful server to do programming and other related stuffs. Do SOC students surf net very frequently as part of their academic requirement?<br><br>Personally, i don even tnk Sci students will use computers intensively in their course of study. Subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology, to name some, are those tat do not require much use of the computers and not to mention, internet!<br><br></div></blockquote>SOC students do require to use powerful servers to handle the programming requirement. If there is only 1 student using the server, naturally they dun need a powerful server. However, there are many users at a time, therefore justifying the need for a powerful server that can handle the processing and networking requirements. Even the monitors used in SOC's newer labs are 17 inchese... Arts and Biz lab probably dun have that, rite?<br><br>Some science students dun need to use computer that intensively... they are just like arts and biz students...just use computer to type report and surf net to check email only...<br><br>Some courses in SOC does not have lectures at all...the students download and view the lectures clips... and SOC students surf net very often...as far as I know...they touch their computer at least once a day  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Given that they have equalised the fees for all courses excluding special ones such as medicine and dentistry, think it will be more fair that they provide everyone on campus with the same facilities especially in terms of equipment such as servers. No reason why those who utilise more get better ones while those who supposedly use less get lousier servers when all pay the same course fees and computer fees.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know i am contridicting myself, but frankly speaking, the new type of lecture hall seatings are not comfortable.<br><br>I cannot lean my head like i used to be, against the "table" of the back row that stretches from one end of the row to the other end.<br><br>Also, there is restriction the way i cross my legs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. The new seatings make it uncomfortable for me to cross my legs (actually occassionally switching b/w crossing of legs and straightening of legs should make one feel more comfortable right?)<br><br>But one good thing is that, the small little "desk" will not slide down if the screw is loose, or we did not hold it "upwards" properly. This is bcoz of the way they "fold" the desk such that it will never go down.<br><br>Overall, in terms of comfortability (which is very important since we spent abt 2hrs for each lecture), the standard had declined. But in terms of other aspects, it has improved.<br><br>Is modern design compromising comfortability for the pleasure of our visual sense?</div>
