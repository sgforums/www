            <div class='col-md body'>And talking about facilities, i think bizad should consider expanding the computer lab. There are never enough computers to meet the demand. This problem gets worse during the peak period towards the end of the semester when everyone is in the computer lab rushing their assignments. For those students with laptops, there are not many plug and play points around the faculty. Also, there should be more benches around so that it'll be easier for students who are doing group discussions to have a proper place to do their discussions. It's so tough to find empty benches around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi yoohoo,<br><br>yah, long time no see. Missed me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>All the bizad LTs have been renovated? hmm..i so suaku, I didnt even know that. One of these days I must go and see.<br><br>well, actually for bizaders, there's also not much need to bring our laptops. But sometimes, it's more convenient coz it's tough to find an unused computer in the lab. We only have one computer lab that is open for students to use. I think there's roughly 80 computers there? not very sure. But it's never enough. There is a tiny computer cluster in the library, but there are only about 5 computers in there, and most of the time, 1-2 computers will not be working. So it doesnt help to solve the problem as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm, I didn't know that all the LTs are renovated in BizAd and I was still using LT16 till late June. Haven't really got a chance to pop in to the new LT19 yet as well.<br><br>Sparkle,<br>The best way to get a comp in the comp lab is to book them and end up chasing whoever is using the terminal away. I think they should open up the labs in the lower storey as well during hours that they are not used for instrutional purposes. Another bad thing is the long printing queues. It sure is frustrating to need to print that 1 or 2 pages and you end up at the end of the long queue with some people printing more than 50 pages at one shot. Since they started lessons at 8 in the morning (and I got 4 days with that slot), maybe they should consider opening the labs at 8 as well for those who may need some kind of urgent printing of handouts or reports.</div>
