              <p>Hi heather,</p>
              <p>well , a big thank you for your concern towards the title of 'attraction'. - that's first. I'm currently studying in a local polytechnic , namely, NYP or (Nanyang Polytechnic). This Year , 2010 , I'm going to sit for my DIP (Aerospace Engineering) and aiming for a Good GPA. If i managed to get the grade that's overwhelming , is there any chances for me to progress to University education under Faculty of Law? I'm from ITE and the only higher qualification i possesed is GCE N Level. My greatest worry is , can i sit for law course by completing first year non-discipline law courses and get good results in university?</p>
              <p>Please note that this question is only applicable to those who have mutual experience for Law courses in the local university.Hence, if you're answering without reading my Thread , i don't think i should consider them as an answer to my question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for answering , heather.</p>

              <p>btw, law need o level grade 2 for english then can

              <p>i think u havt reach university dun think so much because im
              also like u havt reach poly/a level or ite then think so much. i am
              currently a private candidate again for o level.those professional
              course need interview one, not everyone can go in de. only small
              amount of people can get in. but from i heard u get 4 GPA from ite
              can straight go polytechnic. and i also heard if u study those
              professional course, in ur GPA result u get upper 2 then bar will
              recruit u as a lawyer. BUT FROM WHAT I HEARD, u dun need o level
              oso can enter university if u got ite ceritificate. And from what i
              heard, only small amount of the place are given to polytechnic
              students. and from what i heard even if u manage to go in NUS, they
              wont give u a good course. But still i think is quite possible if u
              win those student in polytechnic which is very difficult.</p>

              <p>here is some link i see although im not from law course or
              anything. but from what i see some people who enter law course did
              not end up being a lawyer.</p>
              <p>i can tell u something,professional jobs need people with good
              memory, thats what most professional has. for example
              psychology,dentistry,medicine.this few course give 1 wrong medicine
              can end up in jail. Lawyer need good english and mouth, bilingual
              also. cause need to know how to speak chinese and chinese is
              not very simple if u check dictionary.</p>

              <p>O chance.</p>
              <p>Even if you score all As in your A level from top 5 JC, u still have to have good CCA plus good parents plus good interview skills. Unless they set aside allocated % especially for poly students. The chance to go in even if you have perfect A level results is very low, there are only about 200 places. </p>
              <p>Even if you manage to get in, you must be really smart (not hardworking) in order to succeed in your career.</p>

              <p>By good GPA I am guessing northwards of 3.80. But that alone only gives you the slimmest of chances. I not as sure of the situation now, but I think you still need to have SAT scores to apply for law school? Try to get in the 2300's for that. Its quite a drastic change, going from engineering to law, but I guess all students will start at about equal footing.</p>
              <p>At this stage, if you can prove your competency in language, no one is gonna care if you failed your 'o' levels, thats ancient history for christ's sake.</p>

              <p>Hi heather,</p>
              <p>well , a big thank you for your concern towards the title of
              'attraction'. - that's first. I'm currently studying in a local
              polytechnic , namely, NYP or (Nanyang Polytechnic). This Year ,
              2010 , I'm going to sit for my DIP (Aerospace Engineering) and
              aiming for a Good GPA. If i managed to get the grade that's
              overwhelming , is there any chances for me to progress to
              University education under Faculty of Law? I'm from ITE and the
              only higher qualification i possesed is GCE N Level. My greatest
              worry is , can i sit for law course by completing first year
              non-discipline law courses and get good results in university?</p>
              <p>Please note that this question is only applicable to those who
              have mutual experience for Law courses in the local
              university.Hence, if you're answering without reading my
              Thread , i don't think i should consider them as an answer to my
              question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for answering , heather.</p>

Will they accept me if my GPA in Poly is 3.9 or &gt;. Do you think they can accept me into the law course? I'm very prepared to memorise and talk as if i'm "already" a lawyer. it's the matter of Practice which is attest and what's more intricated is , how you plan from ITE and &gt;. if you're in ITE and you decide to get a work and marry after that , that's called  'reckless' action.</p>

              <p>nus close to zero chance, since they look at qualifications for admission, and O level english is a basic must-have.</p>
              <p>as for SMU law, you will have slightly more chance to enter the law faculty as a poly grad, provided that you have outstanding GPA and you excell in your interview, which every potential applicant have to go through. however, you need to demonstrate your proficiency in english with a SAT score of at least 2100, which is not that easy to get.</p>
              <p>the other alternative route to become a lawyer is to go overseas for law degree. Australia is a good choice, cost-wise and distance. be sure to check which australian law degrees are recognised in singapore before enrolling into the course.</p>
              <p>and don't bother going for those law degrees from private school like SIM, stansfield.</p>
              <p>external degree from the university of london, offered by these private schools are not recognised by the ministry of law, and holders of these degrees are not allowed to practise law in singapore.</p>

              <p><br>Oh please cease from talking your usual RUBBISH here. I see you're tired of being exposed for being a butt pirate crapeating farmer in the other forum and found your way here.</p>
              <p>The local law courses take in all the scholarship rejects from top 5 JCs and there are plenty of people from neighbourhood sec school and JCs there too.</p>
              <p>The criteria for the course itself is only A for only three measly A level subjects, not even 4 subjects needed, let alone S papers (what's known as H3 now). 9 out of 10 people in the local law courses are people who took S papers hoping to get an overseas scholarship, which even 4A and 2 S distinctions people may not get, are rejects of the scholarship process.</p>
              <p> what a retard. Good parents or interview?? fuck off as if it's the interview the prestigious PSC.</p>
              <p>There are over 350 places now in the two farmer law courses. I was from the top JC and all my friends had at least 1 to 2 S papers. So I know full well who goes to where and what quality of people are siphoned to where in the food chain.</p>
              <p>The local law and med courses are the traditional dumping grounds of the over 1000 people rejected by PSC.</p>

              <p><br>fuck off lah! NUS + SMU farmer law schools have close to 400 places. GO READ THE FACTS. You are definitely NOT an insider. Your numbers are all wrong!</p>
              <p>NUS med has always taken in even more people than NUS law, even though its selection criteria is slightly more stringent. NUS med takes in 250 a year, 25% more than NUS law which takes in 200. SMU has added at least another 150 to 180 places for more farmers. To get an interview someone only need friggin 3 As for farmer law and 4A for farmer med. IT IS NOT SOME ELITE SHIT.</p>
              <p>You are a frigging farmer crapping here and you got exposed...YET AGAIN. Aren't you tired of making a fool of yourself everywhere you go? You loser farmers are so amusing.</p>
