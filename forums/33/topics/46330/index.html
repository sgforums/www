            <div class='col-md body'>Sally n Roy were lovers....like any other couple, they get to know each other tru friends.<br>Sally juz ended a short-term relationship and was rather depress but knowing Roy helped<br>her coped with the misery of a broken relationship.<br>Roy was in army then, after being single for a long time, he felt he was ready to find someone.<br>Or perhaps he needed companionship...<br>The timing was perfect, both needed companionship, hence after knowing for less than a month,<br>they became lovers.<br><br>Like all relationship, the beginning was honeymoon period for the both of them.<br>Sally was glad to have Roy, but after a failed relationship, she too felt unsure.<br>She was not sure whether it was a right thing to do, hence she told Roy all about her past,<br>how she felt,and most importantly, that she was really someone who take relationship seriously<br>and was extremely possessive. Roy, on the other hand, didnt take it too seriously, being a typical guy,<br>he felt that it wasnt much of a problem. He  was sure things would work things out, he was very optimistic.<br>He assured Sally millions of time with words and actions,<br>Sally was touched and in return she begin to put in feelings.<br>She felt that since Roy had put in efforts, she should too put in her part.<br>So in return she love Roy back.<br><br>Sally and Roy have  alot in common, they both love to have fun, enjoy food and most importantly,<br>they can communicate with each others.<br>They can tell each other their stupidest n silliest thoughts, without fear that the other person wld laugh or<br>look down on the other person<br>Sally thought she found her soulmate, she enjoyed every moment with Roy, being with Roy was like in cloud 9.<br>They did many things together, going to each other house to stay when parents wasnt around, Sally would cook for Roy<br>or Roy wld drive Sally around to different places around singapore and try out different delicacy that Roy would noe.<br>Roy would showered Sally with gifts, once in a while gave Sally the sweetest surprise...<br><br>A year soon pass, Roy had ORD and ready to go in to uni.....his relationship with Sally had become very stable, perhaps too<br>stable that Roy was getting tired of it. His feeling had changed whereas Sally's feeling for him had deepened.He dunno how to<br>tell Sally. They do quarrel, it was not really a fairy tales...like any ordinary couples, they quarrel over the tiniest matters.<br>Roy hate to quarrel but Sally perferred to tok things out...she hated cold war.<br>They began to have difference....but Sally felt that such differences is normal in any relationship, as long as they love each other, such problems would be resolved.<br>But Sally was wrong, Roy did not really love her as much as she tot he would.<br><br>They soon went on a trip together, to a small sunny island, they wld go snokelling together and party in the night.<br>When they go snokelling, swimming in the deep blue sea, everything was silent, Roy hold on to Sally's hand as they swim.<br>Suddenly, they seem to be alone in the whole world except for the both of them. Sally tot Roy wld hold on forever,<br>never did she know that this hand would soon let go....<br><br>As Roy enter nus, their relationship deteriorated....Roy would get to know girls and concealed his attached status.<br>Sally was very unhappy about it, being a possessive girl, she cannot stand the idea of her bf knowing other girls behind her back<br>and worse concealing his status...<br>Because of this, they keep on quarrelling....Sally stared to interfer with every aspect of Roy's life, Roy was sufforcated.<br>In one major quarrel, he would not take it anymore and slapped her and Sally slapped back. She was devastated.<br>She would not understand why the person who she tot loved her so deeply wld do such a things to hurt her.<br>Why would he hate to tok to her or go out with her anymore and lie to her n go out with other people behind her back.<br>Roy on the other hand was shocked, he never tot he wld hit a girl or scold a girl so badly...<br>He dun understand why Sally would love him so much, n why she would not let go...<br><br>They continued the relationship, trying hard to savage the relationship, or at least that was wat Sally tot to be until<br>a girl came into their relationship.<br>She was his classmate, it started on the icq chat, it was rather innocent or to some extent of flirtation.<br>Sally was shocked to find out, she did something she never would tot she wld do, that is to call the girl.<br>Stuck between two girls, Roy was stressed, he was shocked by Sally's behaviour. he never tot she wld call the other girl up like that.<br>Eventhough, he did go out with the other girl, Sally still look him up. He ended up being with two girls.<br>Despite Roy's betrayal, Sally still loved him very much....the tot of breaking up hurt her even more than the feeling of betrayal.<br>She begged Roy to stay, eventually Roy being soft-hearted came back again.<br>All Sally's friends would not understand why she would do such a things. They dun understand how would<br>she choose to forgive someonewho had hurt her so much once n once again.<br>Eventually, they felt that she would not listen to their advices and stop giving it anymore, they would only look on..<br>Sally felt more and more isolated, her soulmate Roy have stop loving her, and her friends have left her...<br>She knew it was her own fault, she was so blinded by her love, that she refuse to take her friends advices,<br>she still tot that if she perserve things eventually wld work out between Roy and her.<br>She forgotten the fact the relationship was very much a two-sided affairs, it doesnt matter how much she do for Roy,he juz wld not<br>appreciate it anymore.<br><br>The more Roy take her for granted, the worse he treated her. To the extent, he was so disgusted by himself and with Sally too.<br>He knew Sally love him deeply. he knew too she understand him fully and perhaps in this life,<br>he would never find another girl who would love him as much as Sally does.<br>But he is so young, he dun want to be bounded by a girl, he felt that he would continued to stray n continued to hurt Sally.<br>N he was frightened by Sally's behaviour, she have changed from a fun-loving girl to someone who was easily paranoid n insercure.<br>She became extremely hysterical when she cant find him and would cry and laugh at the same time. She would call him million time a day, to the extend of getting into his nerve.<br><br>In a way, Sally had went 'crazy' and was in extreme depression....but she did not let anyone noe....only Roy noe.<br>But Roy would not handle it, he dun understand how would someone become like this, he felt disgusted and helpless.<br>Sally too was helpless....she couldnt control her emotion and was extreme vulnerable,it didnt help much when her only emotion support<br>Roy had chosen to desert her. To a point she tried to end her life.....<br><br>Everything came to a end, when another girl came into the picture.<br>This time no matter how Sally beg, Roy refused to give in anymore, he said he really love this girl.<br>Sally dun understand, how would a girl that he noes not too long would change everything....<br>This 2 yrs 8 mths 26 days of relationship meant nothing at all......all the memories, picture they taken,<br>gifts that was given was nothing more than a waste of his time.<br>He say they would still be friends....but in Sally's heart, she knew things would never be the same before.<br>Knowing that they were together, she would feel hurt.....Sally really would not bring herself to give him the blessing...<br>Perhaps she didnt love him that much, she was juz afraid of losing him....<br>But Sally knew she really loved Roy very much, he would be very special to her...<br>But she also knew she meant nothing to him anymore</div>
