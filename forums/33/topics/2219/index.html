            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about reputation, yeah, it is true that certain people be it guys or gals couldn't care less about it. But think it in another way, do YOU really care what kind of people are they?<br>Seriously, would you bother with these people in the first place, not unless they are relatives, friends, or someone related to you. Hmm.. maybe a survey could be made on this topic, who noes what the result would be. It is often hard to differentiate between fact and fiction, just like most of what is written in the forums. A lot of it 'could' be exaggerated for all we know. So take everything with a pinch of salt..</div>
