              University of Singapore (NUS), who were supposed to sit for a paper on 
              managerial economics last Saturday, were told on the spot that the exam 
              was cancelled - because not enough question papers were printed. <br> In response to MediaCorp's queries, an NUS spokesperson attributed the gaffe to "human error". <br> The university is looking into the matter "to strengthen the processes 
              to prevent this from happening again", the spokesperson added. <br> According to the spokesperson, the mid-year test for the module "BSP 
              1005 Managerial Economics" was scheduled to be held at 2pm last 
              Saturday. <br> The spokesperson said 750 copies were supposed to be printed for a class of 725. <br> <span style="color: red;">The lecturer-in-charge of the exam, who works in the 
              banking industry, had another class in the morning and he discovered at 
              "about 2pm" that there was a shortage of 200 scripts, the spokesperson 
              said. </span><br> The spokesperson said: "The lecturer-in-charge discussed with fellow 
              colleagues on duty that day on the various available options. There was 
              insufficient time to make additional copies as another test had been 
              scheduled in the same hall immediately after the stated test.<br> <span style="color: red;">"After considering all options, the lecturer-in-charge
               made the difficult decision of cancelling the test. The 
              lecturer-in-charge then made the announcement to the students, took 
              responsibility and apologised for the human error made, and followed up 
              with an explanation email to all affected students."</span><br> The mid-year test would have made up 30 per cent of the students' 
              overall grades. The weightage will now be shifted to other assignments. <br> In an email sent to the affected undergraduates last Saturday - a copy 
              of which was obtained by MediaCorp - the course coordinator said: "On 
              behalf of the entire team, I am really sorry for today's fiasco. We fell
               short in the number of printed papers we had and we could not find a 
              way to make this work." <br> Pointing out the difficulty of rearranging another sitting for the exam, he added that there will not be a mid-year exam. <br> Adding that the situation was "completely unintended", the coordinator 
              said the question paper will also be made available to the students for 
              them to try the questions for practice and for tutorial discussions. <br> An affected undergraduate, who wished to be known only as Mr Tan, said he felt "very frustrated and annoyed".<br> He added: "I studied so hard for it and it got cancelled at the last minute."<br> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Hotnews/EDC111004-0000162/Shortage-of-question-papers-forces-NUS-to-cancel-economics-exam">http://www.todayonline.com/Hotnews/E...economics-exam</a><br> <br> Related:<br> - <strong>'NUS students upset over exam cancellation'</strong>: [<a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20111004-303064.html">A1news; 04Oct2011</a>]<br> - <strong>'NUS cancels exam due to lost scripts: Why make us pay for your mistake, say students'</strong>: [<a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/777652/nus_cancels_exam_after_200_papers_go_missing_why_make_us_pay.html#commentSection">STOMP; 04Oct2011</a>]</div>

              <p>Seven hundred and twenty-five scripts would take some time to distribute out. So the papers would have been laid out before the exam starts. The shortage should have been discovered earlier.</p>
              <p>Surely NUS would have the paper and copier machines to zap 200 copies in a jiffy.</p>

              big to fail bank [<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail">wiki</a>] phenomenon and perhaps lying in wait for yet
              another government big bank bailout [<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout">wiki</a>].<br> Some bankers should really learn to be more focused to the progress
              of society rather then being obsessed with making money by hook or
              by crook through multiple twisted and dishonest methods (esp the
              Wall St ones!).</p>

              <p>Screw-ups in exam are so darn common.</p>
              <p>I just had a cock-up yesterday already. Wont reveal details here.</p>
              <p>And 1 sem ago....the MCQ had options A-F.....the answer booklet to be shaded only had A-E.</p>
              <p>Epic!!</p>
              <p>Worse, the prof was in hospital from high fever and the prof who took his stead for that day kena this sh!t for no good reason.</p>
              <p>What happened in the end?</p>
              <p>The delirious prof was phoned while in A&amp;E and he said: If you think its E, shade E. If you think its F, shade E.</p>
              <p>Cancel exam would have been more appropriate here.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>I should add that the paper was riddled with errors....serious ones that caused us to crack heads for no reason over simple stuff like having dollar sign or not....which makes a huge difference in calculations.</p>
