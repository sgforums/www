            <div class='col-md body'>i was wondering how come the thread starter did not reply after the first post..<br><br>anyway, i may want to extend his thought further... while i understand and actually adore singlish as part of our culture there is certainly much more to be desired when it comes to the proficiency of singaporeans in the english language.<br><br>it's just too easy to "blame" it on singlish... the basics like grammer, spelling and vocabulary of many singaporeans are sub-standard.<br><br>whether the standard of english is good or poor in singapore (or any other country) is not up to me to criticise. but i want to make a point clear. do not be proud of speaking/writing poorly and rely on "singlish" culture as an excuse for not improving your language skills.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with joho...<br>singlish is a culture.. but not an excuse to the low standards of english.. it just seems so funny when a lot of improper english can be directly translated in to chinese...<br>think it is acceptable when we add a "lor" or "lah" in our sentence..<br>thats more to singlish..<br>rather than saying things like :"i go home then i call you" instead of "i"ll call you when i reach home".....<br>and though my level of english is not sky high...<br>singaporeans should be aware that standard english is better than sub standard singlish....<br>correct me if i am wrong</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi xiaoliang!<br><br>no i've graduated from an overseas uni. i guess it is stressful and stuff.. but i have a feeling that it's much more stressful here than overseas.. but i dunno about the quality of students that the university puts out.<br><br>i really think that the quality of a student does not depend on the institution but rather the student him/herself. i'm of course talking about respectable unis lar..<br><br>sometimes the angmohs in the overseas unis can be more interesting when they talk.. it's GENERALLY accepted that angmoh's can speak with more flair and humour than chinese. however u get ULTRA boring and stupid lecturers there to.. machiam like you should be teaching the lecturer rather than the other way round!<br><br>i'm working now.. miss uni life back in australia. enjoy it while it lasts!! and make more frens and widen your network, this is the time to really start networking as you will need them when u start working. not that u are using them next time that's why u wanna get to know them now, but becos nowadays, it's sometimes not wat u know but WHO u know..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
