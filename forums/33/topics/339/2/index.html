            <div class='col-md body'>Since people here tokin about gers in NUS.. just like to add in a few comments after spending four yrs in NUS. Basically, on the overall... guys are horny and girls are dao.and since most guys are in eng, people just stereotype eng guys are desparate and since most girls are in arts, people stereotype arts girls are dao. come on, guys. girls coming to this age of course have to wear nice nice and make up nice nice, imagine spending their 12 yrs in pri, sec, and jc all in school uniforms, is quite frustrating... let them do what they want... And come on guys, it is very hard here in Singapore, that you can just walk up to a girl and can start chit chating with her happily.... it is normal that she walk away. guys, go join some activities and know girls from there... it is better that way.<br>Advices to eng guys too, join some activities to know girls, if can click then go for it, dun go around tables in arts canteen or any other canteens and go jio girls like that... really pervert..<br>But quite sad for eng guy too, that it is very hard to know girls..... I also notice a lot of my frens during their final year, they decide to just go for eng girls, as time is running out for them!!!<br>So girls from other fac, pls do understand our plight......<br>Actually, I notice girls from science fac are nice and decent, eng guys can actually go for a try there....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.....after lookin at those comments about pretty girls....chio....and all that stuff....I was wondering...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> Is it really that important to get a chio, or wat ppl say pretty ones?? To me, I might say maybe I am an average guy, but somehow I feel, you want to date someone, I believe she no need to be chio or pretty right? As long as you find her pleasant to the eyes, it is more than enough, and please I hope you people know that there is a difference between pleasant looking and pretty. Having a pleasant to the eye look of the for the guy who wanted to court the girl or rather woman, for some older ones... and that goes with a good character, that's more than enough. If, we were to look for just chio or pretty ones, one day when we look back, we might regret our choice.....so guys....don't just see, try to feel, plan and think wat you really want. It is because, after 30 or 40 years down the road, the partner with you, will eventually aged, n it is the feelings and bond rather than looks that keep things going in the happy way....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Most of KingÂ¡Â¦s students just prefer to hang around rather than being nurture in a "SShXXtyÂ¡Â¨ establishment. They like to witch-hunt together The leisure activity (beside the famous DATE RAPIST Prom Game that is well known to the British Media) are playing Â¡Â§private dick" in the school and carry on the street. They love to find vulnerable and weak schoolmates target and call them Â¡Â§wimpÂ¡Â¨ or Â¡Â§idiotÂ¡Â¨ (step on someone back all the time). The most pathetic thing is that: KingÂ¡Â¦s college is full of these underachievers who try to pull any non-religious students DOWN.Have anyone ever examine that KingÂ¡Â¦s priests and archbishops from KingÂ¡Â¦s church never tell the students how to become a nice person; but the standard catholic tricks instead: name-calling, blame KingÂ¡Â¦s own sinful imaginative thought on other scape goat that can be found, being hypocrite, always use the excuse of raising money (just look at KingÂ¡Â¦s pathetic campaign in the hospital or 1 million project to save KingÂ¡Â¦s books shortage archive library.<br><br>I do feel that KingÂ¡Â¦s are pathetic noise-makers because KingÂ¡Â¦s guys always come to the other nearby college library to chat rather than being a good reader. KingÂ¡Â¦s College do seem to have more Â¡Â§SE ASIAN gold-mineÂ¡Â§ students than us, but KingÂ¡Â¦s college and its church associate does seem to concentrate on old catholic crime: extreme greedy CORRUPTION rather than use those government fundings and studentsÂ¡Â¦ tuition fees on the proper education and buy some modern equipments. Does KingÂ¡Â¦s college really suck? Luckily, those freshmen at KingÂ¡Â¦s college can tell the true horrible experience when they have committed to a university that is much worse than their own High Schools. Another disgusting well-known fact: KingÂ¡Â¦s accommodation staff does steal safe-keeping students belongings during Long Holiday. Well, where is justice and consideration in KingÂ¡Â¦s. To be honest, other college accommodation is not great, but they live with other well-educated students in the University of London Area. KingÂ¡Â¦s accommodation is made of fire-risk wooden bouncing floor and expensive tiny student study rooms that are smaller than most people laundry rooms at home. GREED is an old sin?? It must be something new this year !!<br><br>However, there is no evidence of a relationship between the amount of money thrown into university education and genuine educational accomplishment. For university course, British University cost more than double than a same degree course that held in one of the universities in Singapore. Beside the difference in the price tag, there are employment restrictions as well. Nowadays, British University charges the whole year tuition in advance even the students might have scholarship and loans coming in. In Britain, Singapore Students are simply the MILK COW for the British Economy. The situation is even more ridiculous for Secondary School Education. The average cost is more than 26,000-00 US dollars per year. It is enough to cover the construction cost of a front yard swimming pool in many countries. Why it worth so much money? It is never justifiable.<br><br>I have studied in UK before, what I have got is: continuous bullying [pushing around] and mis-treatment from the UK university. I have got very good A-Level and my parents were very generous to spend all their money in my further education. Most Singapore and Singapore students get the worst rooms in the British School accommodation. Always in a weird corner, size is tiny and an inhumane place to live in. I was put in a storage room that was under the staircase; the ceiling is so low that I could touch the bottom of the staircase if I raise my hands. It is tinier than the maid bedroom or the closet of a master bedroom. I could not move at all if I would like to put my bicycle inside. The furniture is old and extremely tiny. This is in contrast to other single students bedroom on the same floor, the room is big enough for them to park their car inside. We were all paying the same single room fees. Once and once again, these things happen to every Singapore and Singapore student. It is just because British are arrogant and the Singapore and Singapore students are too polite to make a complaint. It is not about the fairness, but Singapore and Singapore student always get an inhumane room to live in, British look at us as tiny slave in one of their many colonies. They created unfair hardship for all Chinese students. Other British parents use their car to help their children to move in, does the Chinese parent take an extra suitcase, fly there and see the room that their devoted child will be living ? They could get a shock.<br>Every summer exam, my classmate in the university would tried out all their dirty trick, if you donÂ¡Â¦t mind to waste all your money and all your time, go to Britain for a university degree, you will know. For example, I know plenty of SINGAPORE students who go to Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh for their degree, but SINGAPORE students seldom finish the degree in those TOP OF THE WORLD universities. They are certainly bright enough to be there. But British are famous of their dirty trick during examination. It is why we seldom know any graduates in Singapore that graduate from Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh.<br><br>One dirty trick is Marijuana, it is an inhaling soft drug. Unlike Singapore, one third of students do smoke in Britain. If any student who is known to be bright. They will use this dirty trick. On the other hand, most SINGAPORE students donÂ¡Â¦t smoke at all. You might have heard of few famous school students who are exceptionally bright in internal exam but their mind go BLANK during public examination. This is the most possible cause.<br><br>Let me explain, if one study hard and able to comprehend and recite material. Unless the student rush too much or aim to answer too detail. Otherwise it could be Marijuana-induced. The students donÂ¡Â¦t even have to take it on his/her will. Just some nasty students who sit next-to and smoke some home-made cigarette ( with Marijuana ). There are many nasty effect, one is the mind will go blank for a while.<br>What kingÂ¡Â¦s college achieving during creating such turmoil for me. They behave pretty much like the Bible public Â¡Vbut in an evil, stealing, nasty way --- Keep all my electronic dictionary and expensive textbooks (they took most of those textbooks and notes while I left in the KingÂ¡Â¦s accommodation storage facility during Holiday) that I purchased in bookstore in Britain. Get all my parent earned income for my tuition while giving as little support to me as their student. They steals my books (they are not only doing it in the final year, but year after year i.e. every year), my electronic digital clock, Nintendo with 20 games that I brought to UK from Singapore, TV, basically everything. You might never hear of such story. And countless belongings of mine. What a British Degree mean to you, you better find out after you spend all the money youÂ¡Â¦ve got and waste all your time in Britain. Most British graduates in Singapore seem to be very inferior or very insecure who try to step on people in every occasion. They did learn those characteristics from British education system --- totally unfair, totally unjust, totally ripe-off<strong></strong></div>

My parents have to pay the expensive high fees in the UK university for all foreign students. What I get in British University were man-made hardship and negligence + denial by University Officials. Pretty much like in that Korean TV Drama, there is a nasty step-brother who tried to exploit the new-comer sister[SINGAPORE studentS in British Universities or High School] everyway that he could.<br><br>However, it could get even worse and more extreme and total rip-off, the British universities are even worse than the gangsters, in the way that they exploit and extort SINGAPORE students in terms of Basic Rights and Family Fortune. Even more recklessnessly.<br><br>Since I was young, my parents provided all I need, like a bicycle and a computer etc. I have been a nice, well-behaving, hard working and brilliant student for all my academic subjects. I went for one of the most intensive medicine course in an UK university (in order to become a Family Doctor or a Bright Surgeon in the Operation Theater). But the bigot, arrogant British put me into a nousy, tiny storage area underneath the staircase and call my room the spare room. Â¡V Usually, occupied by no-one and no students will be allocate to that tiny under-the-staircase space anyway. The space is so tiny; I could not even extend my arms there. The furniture was old, humiliating, and wobbly. It is just more ironic when comparing to all other British students on the same floor who also got their own single room --- all their room is big enough space to park 2 normal size cars inside (except2 long long limousines). We are all paying the same standard single room fee Â¡V highest among the university.<br><br>There is really no evidence of a relationship between the amount of money thrown into university education and genuine educational accomplishment.

Beside the difference in the price tag, there are employment restrictions as well. Nowadays, British University charges the whole year tuition in advance even the students might have scholarship and loans coming in. In Britain, Singapore Students are simply the MILK COW for the British Economy. The local student only paid one-third of what the Singapore student paid. Furthermore, their Local Education Authority (LEA) will lend them all the tuition fees and let them have some living expenses too. On the other hand, it cost the Singapore parents an arm and a leg to send their kids away. The situation is even more ridiculous for Secondary School Education. The average cost is more than 200,000-00 SINGAPORE dollars per year. It is enough to cover the construction cost of a front yard swimming pool in many countries. Why it worth so much money? It is never justifiable. It is simply because of their parents studied in English in the past, it is incomprehensible for their children to take an exam in Chinese.<br><br>When we look at the top-notch education around the world, Germany and Japanese use their own mother-tongue language to teach. Their English is not the best but the quality of their products is the highest quality with very clever engineering that many countries admire. As a conclusion, the next generation should able to use Chinese to demonstrate their knowledge in examination. No doubt about it.<br><br>For any uninformed parents or prospective university students who are studying for their Advanced Level. Do not bet all your salaries on your children UK education ( It could crash as much as the peak of the Housing Market here and there)<br><br>The Sunny picture in British Universities Prospectus never do any justice to the real foggy weather in Britain. I sincerely donÂ¡Â¦t want any decent human being to try out university and deprive over there Â¡V in Britain.<br><br>Finally for those devoted and dedicated parents considering British School for the Beverly-Hill budget type of education. AUSTRALIAN AND AMERICAN STUDENTS pay the same fees as the overseas students for their University Education, they are much friendlier (with a real heart, just like any good human should have) than the arrogant British. In those countries, Chinese students are considered to be smart in science subjects; however, they are all right about that. Unlike UK, jealousy is not an issue when fair competition IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVE OF THEIR ECONOMIES for centuries.<br><br>Why the Singapore parents would pay a fortune to some mysterious old school in Britain for an uncertain academic attainment that they knew little about while certain that British would be NASTY and DEPRIVE against Â¡Â§Chinese KIDSÂ¡Â¨ (they look down on us as worse than house maid Â¡V in British Mind)<br><br>Will it be better to save up those money and buy a Real House with a real big garden.<br>British secondary school place is just over-priced, the education service has not even seen before such commitment of purchases. Does it make any sense, at all????<br><br>Since I was young, I do the best that I can, being hardworking in all my exam and project.  Recently, I also volunteer to provide free on-line tutor in an official web site: etvonline.tv  come and have a look<br><br><strong></strong></div>
