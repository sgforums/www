              <p>there are some parts quite relevant as to the redundancy of males in the business/ sales force (but the ones will make it must have excellent PR and presentable skills) as opposed to gals who could even be on par with the best sales man without formal education if she has excellent looks and "PR" skills..thats the brutal reality....</p>
              <p>if a guy does not have the looks, then he needs to work very very hard on presentation and PR skills and/or highly sought technical and academic qualifications....at the very bottom he needs to be really a YES MAN in order to succeed...</p>
              <p>a business degree is a general discipline which only proven track records could qualify him up the corporate ladder....so a smart guy would work towards having both a specialized and a business degree....gals would tend to spend more on their outlooks and seduction as it is sufficient with a general degree....</p>
              <p>his options now should be continuously networking and upgrading - keep focusing on building his career...if he is single...all the better.....but if he is married...and faced with such career dilemma....high chances are that his wife would leave him at his most distraught state....and that would add on to his living woes....</p>

              <p>"I  am a 35-year-old male home-grown Singapore Chinese citizen. I graduated in 2000 from NUS Business School and harboured high hope of a good life afterwards.</p>
              <p>However, when I started work in an operations position, my pay was only SGD 2100 – way  below the general market rate of SGD 2500  for fresh grads."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking at your statement, I feel like slapping you. Do you know how many jobs out there are only given to NUS, NTU and SMU grads. How many times singaporean overseas students like us never even had a chance to be even selected for an interview just because we have an overseas degree.</p>
              <p>I was not so lucky like u to get into NUS, I had to slog and study to get my overseas degree, even then when we returned we were looked down by our employers.</p>
              <p>my so call degree pay was only SGD 1200 when I first started out but I never gave up  I worked hard and taking up jobs no people wants and learning the ropes, Finally I could get a better life for my family.</p>
              <p> Is best for you to wake up from your dream of a good life and start facing reality.</p>

              <p>I think the main problem with this guy is that he complains that he's got the grades, but his job opportunities do not commensurate with his grades.</p>
              <p>What rubbish. Job opportunities are always there if you know how to look, if you're willing to work hard, and you're willing to have an open mind to allow for new experiences and exposure.</p>
              <p>I can agree that good paper qualifications are a prerequisite to getting ahead in life. However, that is only half the story. The other half is all about what you do with those qualifications - do you use them as a stepping stone to get ahead, or do you just sit down and whine just because you can't get what you want?</p>
              <p>These words are especially striking:</p>
              <p><strong>However, when I started work in an operations position, my pay
                                      was only SGD 2100 – way  below the general market rate of SGD
                                      2500  for fresh grads.</strong></p>
              <p>Eh hello, a lot of people start off below the general market rate. What differentiates the winners from the losers is that the winners suck it up, work their asses off and do their best to get ahead.</p>
              <p>I can agree that our education system is not perfect in that it drills the importance of getting grades over getting knowledge.</p>
              <p>But that said, the more intelligent thing for him to do would be to just work around the fallacies of our education system. If the skills taught are not good enough, then he should learn to upgrade. If he can't think critically because of it, then he should <em>learn</em> how to think critically!</p>
              <p>Instead, he just wants to sit down and whine over how it has failed him. Duh.... since he knows what's wrong, then why not just get up and work on improving himself? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>"I  am a 35-year-old male home-grown Singapore Chinese citizen. I graduated in 2000 from NUS Business School and harboured high hope of a good life afterwards.</p>
              <p>However, when I started work in an operations position, my pay was only SGD 2100 – way  below the general market rate of SGD 2500  for fresh grads."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking at your statement, I feel like slapping you. Do you know how many jobs out there are only given to NUS, NTU and SMU grads. How many times singaporean overseas students like us never even had a chance to be even selected for an interview just because we have an overseas degree.</p>
              <p>I was not so lucky like u to get into NUS, I had to slog and study to get my overseas degree, even then when we returned we were looked down by our employers.</p>
              <p>my so call degree pay was only SGD 1200 when I first started out but I never gave up  I worked hard and taking up jobs no people wants and learning the ropes, Finally I could get a better life for my family.</p>
              <p> Is best for you to wake up from your dream of a good life and start facing reality.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : The number of job vacancies rose 36% over the year to 50,200 in September 2010.<br><br>According
               to the latest annual job vacancies report released by the Ministry of 
              Manpower (MOM) on Friday, the rise in vacancies was driven by 
              Singapore's rapid and robust economic recovery.<br><br>In fact, MOM said it was the highest number of job vacancies recorded since the comparable series started in March 2006.<br><br>The
               highest number of vacancies was for service &amp; sales workers (10,330
               or 22% of total vacancies), followed by professionals (8,270 or 18%) 
              and associate professionals &amp; technicians (8,230 or 18%).<br><br>Nevertheless,
               in terms of the three broad occupational groupings, employers were most
               looking to hire professionals, managers, executives &amp; technicians 
              (PMETs) (44%), followed by clerical, service &amp; sales workers (29%) 
              and production &amp; transport operators, cleaners &amp; labourers 
              (27%).<br><br>Corroborating with the high demand for PMETs, positions 
              requiring at least a university degree qualification made up the highest
               number of vacancies at 10,570 or 23% of total vacancies. <br><br>This 
              was followed closely by openings requiring at least secondary (9,840 or 
              21%) qualifications, reflecting the strong demand for service &amp; 
              sales workers.<br><br>The services share of vacancies increased steadily
               from 68% in 2006 to 75% in 2010, reflecting the growing importance of 
              the service economy. <br><br>Manufacturing contributed 17% of all vacancies in 2010, down from 26% in 2006. <br><br>MOM
               said the decline in manufacturing's share of vacancies partly reflects 
              the continual restructuring of the sector towards high tech and 
              value-added activities.<br><br>With the completion of major building 
              projects, construction's share of vacancies declined to 6.6% in 2010, 
              from 8.1% in 2009, after rising from 4.2% in 2006.<br><br>Five in eight vacancies (63%) in 2010 required working experience, comparable with a year ago (62%).<br><br>Overall,
               job-specific experience (26%) was a more common requirement than 
              industry-specific (19%) and general working experience (19%).<br><br>Amid the tighter labour market, one in three (33%) vacancies was unfilled for at least six months. <br><br>The
               MOM said due to the record level of job openings, the number of 
              openings vacant for at least six months rose from 10,140 in 2009 to a 
              five-year high of 15,360 in 2010. <br><br>Eight in 10 (81%) of these vacancies were for non-PMETs and the remaining (19%) were for PMETs.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span> </span></p>
