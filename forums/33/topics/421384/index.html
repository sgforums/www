              <p>Dear Mr Goh</p>
              <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-31075" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2011/01/ex-nus-graduate-i%e2%80%99m-a-failed-product-of-our-meritocratic-educational-system%e2%80%9d/graduate-boy/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-31075" title="graduate-boy" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/graduate-boy-248x300.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="300"></a>Please publish my story under the name “Chua S” if you find it appropriate  for your site.</p>
              <p>I am a 35-year-old male home-grown Singapore Chinese citizen. I 
              graduated in 2000 from NUS Business School and harboured high hope of a 
              good life afterwards.</p>
              <p>However, when I started work in an operations position, my pay was 
              only SGD 2100 – way  below the general market rate of SGD 2500  for 
              fresh grads.</p>
              <p>At that time,  job competition and wage depression were  prevalent 
              and I didn’t want to miss out on the opportunity as it was better that I
               have a job than nothing at all.</p>
              <p>My situation may sound unbelievable to you but it is true – since 
              then, I have been stucked in a prolonged underemployment and 
              unemployment cycle of which I can see no light for the past ten years!</p>
              <p>As of Jan 2011, I have been out of proper employment for 8 months 
              after completing a contract operations job. Contractual work arrangement
               means that I will be working for a while and stay unemployed for 
              another  long period  before I managed to secure another contractual  
              work arrangement again.</p>
              <p>Its not ideal for work security  and there is no way  that I can even
               think of starting a family with such unstable job arrangement prevalent
               in our current work environment.</p>
              <p>Relentless marketing of so-called foreign talent by the PAP has 
              reinforced the view that foreigners are   better  even though they may 
               not be and their services are not actually   cheap either.</p>
              <p>I have heard of foreigners earning $5000 when I could barely earn 
              above $2000 and I hailed from the prestigious world-classed  National 
              University of Singapore! Something must be wrong somewhere…</p>
              <p>Local home-grown HR managers have told me that foreigners were being 
              hired simply because these people were foreigners. Everyone liked the 
              idea of a diverse workplace until they were badly affected by their 
              adverse work ethics and knowledge.</p>
              <p>When I was hired for contract positions, the supervisors were always 
              anxious I would disappear suddenly and they had to find replacement. 
              People of  my profile are  expected to cut and run after 3 months.</p>
              <p>This was despite the fact that I have always completed my contract 
              term. They just couldn’t commit to a more permanent work arrangement 
              with me.</p>
              <p>From my observation,  organizations generally preferred females 
              (including foreign females) for the positions I applied for. These 
              positions include administration, accounting, banking, finance, 
              operations (office-based), human resources, retail services and sales 
              support.</p>
              <p>Organizations only employed males for engineering, sales and 
               technical positions. I did not have the relevant engineering and 
              technical background.</p>
              <p>I have also noticed  that more  sales positions are now occupied by 
              females leaving me wondering what kind of jobs are available for guys!</p>
              <p>The only sales area where males still maintain  the majority count was those of a self-employed nature.</p>
              <p>I have also stopped applying to insurance companies because they were only interested in me becoming an insurance agent.</p>
              <p>Some people have suggested that I go into teaching or tuition. The 
              idea of exhorting young students to study hard for a brighter future is 
              totally repulsive as I am the  clear example of a big failure from our 
              renowned meritocratic educational system. We are encouraged to study 
              hard, get good grades and graduate but in the end, we all struggled to 
              get stable decent  jobs and this unpleasant   situation is not only 
              unique to me… many of my peers are caught in the same tragic cycle too.</p>
              <p>What good is it if you have all the A’s in your report card but you 
               could not find ready employment long after you have graduated?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Ministry of Education is likely to reject me just 
              like any other civil service or related positions  that I have 
              previously applied for.</p>
              <p>As I felt that  my NUS educational background has been either 
              irrelevant or a liability, I have been careful in taking up any 
               upgrading courses. In 2003, I was even rejected for a position as I was
               still taking a part-time course!</p>
              <p>Other people in my situation would have long  emigrated or become 
              self-employed. I need not describe my frustrations further as this has 
              been repeated by many people here.</p>
              <p>I hope you are able to assist me. Please keep up the good work on your website. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Regds,</p>

              <p>Different people have different talents. I'll say he's either skilled or talented (Linguistically) in the academic sense, which is the reason for his academic success.</p>
              <p>I believe everyone agrees that being a top academic student does not translate into success in the professional field. In fact, all fresh graduates have the potential to be successful in his/her worklife, but the main question here is this -</p>
              <p>'What differentiates a student who has the potential to succeed as opposed to a student who actually reaches his potential?'</p>
              <p>Obviously our supposed victim of the Singapore brand of education could not step over from school and into real work. Theories that we learn from books are essential as it sets you thinking, but using such rigid formulas/theories in the real business world never work. As far as I'm concerned, esp. since I'm not even of the age to enter Universities yet, what differentiates a worker would be his/her ability to adapt to changes and face challenges with a fresh perspective.</p>
              <p>Not saying that old formulas never work. It's just rigid thinking that never works, and it's sad that the Singapore Education System focuses on grades more than the personal growth of students, and thus the emphasis on "RIGHT" and "WRONG" answers.</p>
