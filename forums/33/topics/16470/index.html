Student bodies are still sucky (NUSSU's improved a bit, but some fack clubs have taken over the rotting show). And things still don't work: some fellas I know took a whole damned blardy semester to get a locker - they applied in August and had to carry their 10-kg textbooks to and from school for three bleedin' months.<br><br>And the sick part is that there have been people who really hate putting up with this kinda rubbish. They've been makin' all the right noises. They wanted to run for club Exco to clean out the mess. Then they realized the bleedin' situation's beyond all hope of recovery and they weren't goin' to put their reputations and their basic degree (not even hons, mind) on the line - not when they know they can't hold out long enough to make sure the boat ain't gonna sink after they leave.<br><br>My point is, matey, fuggeddit. NUS people nowadays don't have much ambition. Their biggest goal in life is to get a degree and scram fast into workin' life. And then they'll realize how inadequate their degrees are because of the rush.<br><br>There's not gonna be any hope for recovery man, not unless some law enforces that fack clubs can only be run by govt scholars or somethin'.<br><br>Otherwise, just pack yer bags and study in Hawaii. At least even the babes are watchable.</div>
