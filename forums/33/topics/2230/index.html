            <div class='col-md body'>I think life in NUS is %@*#&amp;@^#$* boring!!! There's nothing else to life except for tutorials, projects, uncomprehensible teachers, hordes of think-they-very-chio-and-so-become-very-dao girls, and legions of think-they-very-cool-and-so-become-a-poser guys. Sometimes I wonder if I'm going to waste all my years in NUS to boring stuff?<br>C'mon, it's not as if I didn't try to make my own life better, but I think people are getting more and more indifferent.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys..do you know you all are so lucky?<br>My faculty is the most boring of all cos' we are always facing the computer screen everyday for at least 8hrs.It's becoming so bad that many guys got addicted and became slave to those stupid terminals.No LIFe !<br><br>Guess which fac I am from?Probably u have guess...it is computer science.It is true that nowadays ppl are very dependent on computers for a livelihood but it had gotten to a stage that we became so isolated from out surroundings.Ppl don't care even if the world is going to end soon as long as they<br>have a computer or a laptop around, they think they are safe.I know this is a bit far-fetch but it is true in out fac!The chio bos are no different from other facs.Some would fall for guys who can help them in their homework/projects.A proper term would be MATERIALISTIC.However, I do agree that some are quite hardworking.<br><br>You should pay a visit to our labs one day and you will know the truth.It is becoming a second home to those geeks.A pity , a lot of them are guys who are still unattached , their time are being spent on computers.<br><br>I am lucky to say that I still have life outside school cos'I am quite active in sports.<br><br>Sorry for writing such a long message but I feel much better after saying this out.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reminds me of an article I read in Times..<br><br>One woman went to the Silicon Valley to get to know rich millionaires who got their fortunes from the dot.com craze. Anyway, she married this 43-year-old millionaire. Guess what he requested on the wedding night? (if I didn't remember wrongly) He wanted that woman to read him bedtime stories! Ohmigosh.<br><br>Guess that woman's disappointment..anyway, she had since divorced that 'kid', &amp; married an even richer millionaire. That article did not say if the 2nd one was better, but it did say alot about the computer geeks who became millionaires, but as they spend so much of their life with their computers,they have apparently forgotten how to lead a normal life &amp; socialise with people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just want to add on to my point.Not all of us are comp geeks.There are others who would like have balance between school and personal life but the cirriculum(hope I spelt correctly) in our fac doesn't allow us to have time for other activities e.g dating.Very often , we had to spent our weekends to churn out programming assignments while my friends over at the other facs are enjoying their weekends.I am really fed up with the system.Maybe I shouldn't studied comp science in the 1st place cos' I felt that I really missed out a lot of fun at my age!Too bad, I just have to bear with it for one more year.<br><br>Thanx for listening.<br><br></div>

Since u all hate NUS so much, take more modules each semester, or take special term, and u can graduate earlier and get out of NUS faster.<br><br>life's like tat lah...just try to make the best out of it...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Right now they are the most enthusiastic bunch of ppl I know who look forward to going to school every day. The reason? Their class. Cos their class will stay together for almost 3 years and that sort of bind them together. So envious...
