            <div class='col-md body'>hi yohoo,<br><br>CAPM is one model of asset pricing, and what some research tries to do is to find if there's a better model that will model stock returns.<br><br>Spreads, straddles etc are hedging strategies using combinations of stocks and options. Options are another area for finance research. But what I was referring to was more like using momentum strategies (buying past winner stocks i.e. stocks which had made good returns and selling past losers), contrarian strategies (buying past losers and selling past winners), etc.<br><br>January effect is simply the phenomenon whereby you can make greater profits in January compared to other months of the year. One explanation for this (in the case for countries with capital gains tax) is because people sell off their stocks which have made losses in December to minimise their tax liabilities, and then buy them back later in Jan.<br><br>hmm..this post sounds like a finance lesson, hope it makes a little sense to you.

I understand what you mean. You noe, after a while of having different classmates in different classes all the time, sometimes you stop trying to be friendly to new faces and just stay around with the group of pple that you already noe. Some people would not bother to put in the effort needed to make new friends. For me as well, unless we're supposed to work together on a group project, I wouldn't really bother to go talk to those people whom I dun noe even though they're from my class, unless maybe if they're sitting beside me, then just try to be a little more friendly. It's no wonder that people taking cross-fac may find us unfriendly, especially since they prob hardly noes anyone of us there. But I think if I were to go over to arts, I may find the arts people more dao. Guess it's just where you're more comfortable with.</div>

If you don't like such fun, go and read your lecture notes lar... Might be more fun that way. Heee...<br>Are you like the kind of boring, block-headed geek who throws away the pictures in the Playboy Magazine, but only read its articles, eg.
