            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder since when does the 1st lesbian ever found.But i know that Gays aren't far from now.I think everyone  should know a little  bit of China History that during the Emperor Dynasty time servants are to be castrate in order to become servant in palace.From then onwards,i think there is where the source of gays from.<br>But flash back to this century or millellium i shall say Lesbians and Gays are so common in our life.While in the past their acts are regards as shamless and disgraceful thing for their ancestor. Are we improving in our sense of minds or just turning back (side tracking our thoughts)<br>I had seen lot of Lesbians.Some well dress up.I wonder why 1 have to dress up to become male and other as female.Why donn they find a real man in actual fact?They think that by tighting up their breast,smoke ,wear like a man ,act like a man they can imagine themself as truly man!I donn think the needs of doing so many things to convice people that they can do the same as real man!<br>I had seen Lesbian doing some thing extra---<br>enter a Gent.That quite a comical scene!I remember my frenz and i went to this toliet and see 2 lesbian inside.At 1st we tok we enter the wrong loo.But then we double check and went in.But the lesbian ignored our presence.Relive they are not using the loo they are just washing their face.But the cleaner inside the Gent keep on staring at them.The xpression of this cleaner was very entertaining like the show Under one Roof act by Richard Ng,really look like him man!<br>Thinking and looking at them my frenz wonder how they are going to use the loo in the presence of the cleaner who keep on staring at time.The whole scence look weird...<br>Some of them their girl friend are dammn chio man! i must really hand in to these HUA MULAN.<br>---------------------------------------------<br>And as for gays.I saw even more when going out.The gays are sometime alone or in groups.<br>Some of them are very exagerated they make up their face 2 red spots,putting lot of power dresssing like FAnn WONG.There is even one i will not forget 1.Can u imagine a BIg fellow guy dresss like singapore is a winter time.ALL those furly clothes got spots one,go coffeshop and eat their lunch!I really must hand in to their courage of enduring the heats of singapore. Some of the gays are really huge big fellow like those we saw on Tv WWF,wreslter.But too bad they act like sissy.There goes their image of Aronld or vammm dammn.<br>These are some of the views.I hope that u all can join in and speak up your stand.Stand leh buay steady la 4 your rights,<br>and sit down to relax 4 your minds.That all i have to say....hope to hear from u ...soon<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi mate, i juz happen to see your topic, and to tell you frankly, i'm quite disappointed in your view...<br>i'm a les myself, and who cares where does the 1st les come from...its either inborn in you, or girls are too badly hurt by guys, that they no longer have faith in them...so they turn to girls....<br>and sometimes i reckon that guys are so irritiating that i'm glad i'm a les....and i'm still one till now...<br>ciao...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does it really matter who started Gays and Lesbians? I mean... they are juz as human as any other person. There is no need to be homophobic!!<br>I dun think there is actually a need to seperate gays from the rest of any humans. I guess they were juz born with it in them...many of them are actually trying very hard to change, only because society does not accept them, causing them not to accept themself also. That should not be the way!!<br>Like a priest here in s'pore once said,"When we talk about Love, Homosexuals know how to love others just like heterosexuals, maybe even more. It is simply love gone wrong"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So bad meh? Butches like a bit weird leh. My first encounter with them was in a pool hall. There was a noisy group of five or six butches at the table next to mine. I was preparing for a shot when I accidently bumped into one of them. Butt to butt so to speak. I stood up, apologised and offered to let her shoot first. She didn't glare at me or anything. Instead, she covered her face and giggled, and then the whole group started giggling! So much for butches being known as rough and tough. Deep down inside, I think they're still very girlish.</div>
