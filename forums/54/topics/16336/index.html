            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>I am from the UK and wish to study/find employment in Spore. I hav recently been turned down by the National University of Singapore which has left me dissapointed. I am looking into Polys/other tertiary institutes in Spore which offer similiar courses. What are your opinions on Polys in SG? How easy would it be for me to find work after i graduate? The course i would go for would be IT related. By the way i would be considered a mature student as i am 25.<br>I am also looking into the possibility of teaching english. I understand Singapore requires individuals to have a CELTA qualification. Would there be any schools which would offer employment for a fresh graduate without experience? Do all schools in Spore require you to have a degree to be a TEFL teacher? What kind of income would this generate for me?<br><br>Thank you for any info<br>Amit<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there! Allow me to add in a couple of personal opinions. Firstly, a brief intro, I was a former graduate from Temasek poly, in Visual Communication. Currently doing part time studies in Communication and media  in University of South Australia (long distant learning) in Singapore. Working in a branding department here.<br><br>I would not be able to throw you enough details on TP. Like other polys in Singapore, it offers a wide variety of courses, ranging from engineering, business, IT, and of course, design where i graduate from. To get a better picture, you should visit the TP site at <a href="http://www.tp.edu.sg" rel="nofollow">www.tp.edu.sg</a><br><br>That should bring you through a quick overview of what TP offers. I suggest you make a trip down to the school, collect some brochures and speak to people in charge there.<br><br>If you are doing a full time course in any local schools here, i don't think you have time to do any work, maybe some part-time or weekend jobs.<br><br>Have you considered any other schools, beside NUS. How about NTU? What are the reasons for them to reject your application? Alternatively, you can always take a degree course in Singapore (long dist. learning) from any other countries. You can try SIM. <a href="http://www.sim.edu.sg" rel="nofollow">www.sim.edu.sg</a><br><br>I am not a career counsellor, so I won't be able to tell whether or not you can find a job upon graduation. There are many factors leading to the answer of that question. Your results, your attitude, your experiences, etc etc. If you are not fussy, it's not difficult finding a job here. If you are willing to learn and pick up things fast, there are always doors open for fresh graduates.<br><br>So, hope my few opinions helped!<br><br>good luck to you!<br><br>priscilla~</div>
