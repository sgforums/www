I oso feel that the Moving Images is not really focus on animation stuff as compared to NYP, tt has specialisation in Animation, Game Design &amp; Interactive Media.. in the end NYP's DMD and TP's Moving Images landed in my 3rd and 4th choice.. lol..<br><br></div></blockquote>Itachi I cut and paste your post here, i think we got senior here who can advice us.<br>my JAE visit was no good too, the moving images old uncle oso blue blur <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> dont know what he said is correct, my firend 28 pt oso can apply BEST show us the wrong counter for JPSAE, Q for FREE waste time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>i read myself better. my choices TP because is near to where i lived.
