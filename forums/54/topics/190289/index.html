            <div class='col-md body'>nah, we shouldn't keep quiet because of the spies. we should let them know what we think!<br><br>I have super super little social life now though. quite terrible. I was just coming out of my shell also leh. I haven't had time to spend with my family and friends from other schools. so sad lor!<br><br>I mean, what the director is doing has it's good points yar, but it's like cutting off design school from the rest of the world. have our own ccas? but what if we want ccas to socialize with the people from other schools? looking at the same people all the time can be very tiresome, and we lose out on networking.<br><br>I hope that he actually sees this forum and does something about it. maybe look at the individual subjects and see what needs a longer time... things like drawing, or require a darkroom, or animating and video...<br><br>but I know for sure that block teaching is here to stay. I guess what we could do is to make some noise so that the upper levels know that we are suffering and perhaps change the timetables a bit for us. (NOTE: timetable ONLY, not curriculum, I spoke to a lecturer and (s)he says that (s)he wants to cut down some of the things learnt because there isn't enough time)</div>
