But with some good effort, unit trust can give you a return of ~5-15% taken both the good years and bad years into account. And if you know compound interest, you know how powerful that can be. The downside is that you do need some financial intelligence and emotional stability to ride through the up and down cycles. If not, it can easily hurt more than gain.<br><br>By the way, I have all of the above.</div></blockquote>i was tinkin of term n hospitalization... maybe hospitalization first.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
