            <div class='col-md body'>Taken From The Official Maplesea Website<br><br>It has come to our attention that the buying and selling of AsiaSoft Passport accounts and MapleStory accounts are taking place in MapleSEA. Please kindly note that such activities are not desirable in MapleSEA as the sellers and buyers will be solely responsible for their actions.<br><br>We will like to draw all players' attention that the trading of accounts may lead into the following possible scenarios:<br><br>1. Seller recovers sold account<br>Seller sells AsiaSoft Passport / MapleStory account to buyer.<br>Seller regrets and wants the account back. Buyer refuses.<br>Seller reports that his/her account been hacked, to AsiaSoft.<br>With correct particulars provided (such as Name, National ID, Address etc.), AsiaSoft will return the account to the Seller, who is deemed to be the owner.<br><br>2. Selling Banned Accounts<br>Seller sells AsiaSoft Passport / MapleStory account to buyer.<br>During trading, the account is banned when the seller uses a hack.<br>Buyer had already paid the money for the account but seller refuses to refund.<br>Buyer reports to AsiaSoft on the situation.<br>AsiaSoft will not lift the ban and account will be terminated as it does not belong to buyer after verification.<br><br>3. Seller Passport suspended due to Buyer's Actions<br>Seller sells AsiaSoft Passport / MapleStory account to buyer.<br>Buyer repeatedly commits hacking / bot-ing / harassment / scam etc and account is banned.<br>Seller's AsiaSoft Passport account which the bought MapleStory account belongs to, will be banned too.<br><br>In any of the above scenarios, it is unfair to both buyer and seller. AsiaSoft cannot be responsible for the actions of the parties involved as it is of their accord. Both parties will risk taking losses especially when Cash Shop is out. In the 1st scenario, if the buyer is to charge any cash into the account, the seller can just claim back the account by reporting the account has been hacked.<br><br>Hence, for any possible ownership claims, members are advised to submit valid particulars such as Name, National ID, Address, Date of Birth etc. in order to prevent disputes over ownership. In accordance with MapleSEA Terms of Use, any account with information deemed invalid will be suspended. Members may submit a request to correct their information to support@maplesea.com before we start taking actions to suspend accounts.<br><br>During investigations, any account that is registered with a National ID that belongs to another person will be returned to that actual person after verification.<br><br>Penalty for selling, buying and trading of accounts include:<br><br>There is an administrative charge of SGD$50 for resolving ownership claims.<br>Any Passport sold for commercial gains will have all accounts wiped before returning to the owner.<br>Any Passport traded in exchange for another passport will have all accounts wiped before returning to the owner.<br>In the event the Passport contains information that is unable to be verified during the resolution process (e.g. fake National ID), the passport will be terminated.<br><br>All banned accounts (for hacking, botting, cursing, selling cash items etc.) will result in their respective Passport being suspended for security purposes. The user will not be able to login into their Passport. Banned users are required to e-mail abuse@maplesea.com to make an appointment with the CSO to verify their identity. If this is not done within 90 days, the Passport together with all game accounts will be deleted. No refunds will be made for any A-Cash or items left within.</div>
