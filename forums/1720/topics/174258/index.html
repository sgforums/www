            <div class='col-md body'>I was supposed to buy a wa3 *4slots left Work Glove for 12.1m from him. When he traded me, i put 12m and so i thought i missed out another 100k. Before i could add, he closed the trade and re-traded me. After i placed the correct amount of money and he placed a work glove. I pressed OK to trade, because i thought he was a nice guy, i didn't check if it was the right one. In fact, I was in a rush therefore my carelessness <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>After a minutre, i searched my Equip inventory to find out that it was a [B]CLEAN[/B] one!!!!! :'(<br><br>Then, I whispered to him and told him he gave me the wrong one. He said i was a scammer!!!! He scolded me and told me to go eat Sh*T. He said: So high level wanna scam me.. Wtf... Go eat SH*T LAH.<br><br>In fact, he really did not give me the original work glove i was paying for. He kept denying and asked me if i was a girl. I told him YES, I am. I'm really sad now.. Please give me back my mesos or the glove!! He said: "Isit because you failed the work glove so you want the money back!!!!!!" and he told me I was lame to call him a scammer. The point is why would i wanna scam him and how can i scam him???<br><br>An hour ago before he logged out, he invited me to a chat and told me this: Hey, don't scam me again ok? I tell you what, i am selling another work glove wa3 4slots, u want????"<br><br>What the HELL.<br><br>I was feeling very devastated earlier. I even cried buckets, all my buddies know how I felt. Imagine 12.1m gone just like that :~(<br><br>I tried to fish out some informations of his personal details from his guild members. They said he is 14 this year and studying at Andersons Secondary School.<br><br>Oh yeah and i was using the laptop, so i couldn't screenshot the conversation with him. I felt like the biggest FOOL.<br><br>Tell me tell me what should i do now??? Worse come to worse, I was thinking of going down to his school to look for him.<br><br>Any suggestions????<br><br>[I]If there's one feeling in the world I'd always relish - it's knowing that someone believes in me.

            <div class='col-md body'>There's really nothing much you can do. After all you did buy his clean work glove for 12.1million. Treat it as a lesson learnt. go buy 10% gloves attk and try your luck ba. maybe first few scrolls will work and wont feel so bad. He should not have scolded a poor lit girl like you though.<br><br>Lots of scammer around. Sometimes you buy 60% gloves attk scroll, end up is 60% helm def or something.</div>
