            <div class='col-md body'>I believe gLc and me had been a really good example to you guys that buying &amp; selling of accounts is highly risky.<br><br>gLc had been really kind enough to warn you guys not to buy account by sharing with you guys his misfortune.<br><br>--<br><br>Here's a little summary:<br><br>In late september last year, gLc bought a level 74 hermit from me at $75 + Gameboy Advance + Cartridge + Lan Cable and had promised to continue sharing the Asiasoft passport with me(he agreed even before we met to do the trade) as I have a Beginner that I really spent a lot of time in. He was being very understanding and generous to actually share the Asiasoft passport with me. I was really thankful at that point of time.<br><br>Although there were things that both of us were not happy with, like 1) disbanding of my guild with 30 members and emblem even he promised not to, 2) his A-cash went missing, we did not really went into nasty quarrels or declare 'wars' with each other.<br><br>However, recently, the level 10x hermit had been hacked, along with gLc's 400m mesos and godly weapons.(according to gLc.) Both of us could not access to the Asiasoft passport since then. I admit I shared the passport information with some friends as I wanted them to train my Beginner and I thought it's good if I let them know the passport login information as they might need to change the Beginner's password or top-up A-cash.<br><br>So, my friends who had access to the Asiasoft passport were sure to be pushed the blame to. However, there were no evidence that it was hacked by any of them.<br><br>On the other hand, myself assumed that ImAclone2 was gLc's clone as the email of ImAclone2 was registered as gLc.91@*******.*** and ImAclone2 posted a thread to sell a hermit which was the exact same level of the hermit I sold to gLc. However, there were no evidence that ImAclone2 was really gLc.<br><br>Flamings went on over the forums, phone and MSN. We both had our own point of view. Both of us said we had our own lost. Both of us had our own pain. The story was a never-ending one.<br><br>Nothing could be done, as the NRIC used to register the Asiasoft passport was invalid and the conclusion is,<br><br><span class="large"><strong>NOT TO BUY AND SELL ACCOUNT!<br><br>Buyers:<br>You wouldn't want to lose an account like gLc! Your hard-trained maple account with items that could be used to fetch some cash!<br><br>Sellers:<br>You wouldn't want to be tekan and make others lose the trust in you just because the buyer's account had been hacked! Your reputation will be gone overnight even you've done next to nothing!</strong></span><br>---<br><br>Here's a plead to all of you, gLc and I had mark this as a full-stop, and we are sharing our personal experience to warn everyone of you guys out there, so please stop adding fuel to the oil and post excessive flamings or post things that are irrelavant.<br><br>This thread serve as a warning to all buyers and sellers! (not for declaring a war or something!)<br><br>For peace and joy,<br>Shi Yun</div>
