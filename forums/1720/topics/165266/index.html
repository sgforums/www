            <div class='col-md body'>A man came home from work late, tired and irritated, to find his 5-year old son waiting for him at the door.<br><br>"Daddy, may I ask you a question?"<br><br>"Yeah sure, what is it?" replied the man.<br><br>"Daddy, how much do you make an hour?"<br><br>"That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?" the man said angrily.<br><br>"I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour?" pleaded the little boy.<br><br>"If you must know, I make $20 an hour."<br><br>"Oh," the little boy replied, with his head down.<br><br>Looking up, he said, "Daddy, may I please borrow $10?"<br><br>The father was furious, "If the only reason you asked that is so you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about why you are being so selfish. I work hard everyday for such this childish behavior."<br><br>The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door.<br><br>The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little boy's questions.<br><br>How dare he ask such questions only to get some money? After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to think: Maybe there was something he really needed to buy with that $10 and he really didn't ask for money very often. The man went to the door of the little boy's room and opened the door.<br><br>"Are you asleep, son?" He asked.<br><br>"No daddy, I'm awake," replied the boy.<br><br>"I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier," said the man, "It's been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you. Here's the $10 you asked for."<br><br>The little boy sat straight up, smiling. "Oh, thank you daddy!" He yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills. The man, seeing that the boy already had money, started to get angry again. The little boy slowly counted out his money, then looked up at his father.<br><br>"Why do you want more money if you already have some?" the father grumbled.<br><br>"Because I didn't have enough, but now I do," the little boy replied.<br><br>"Daddy, I have $20 now. Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with you."<br><br>Share this story with someone you like.... But even better, share $20 worth of time with someone you love.<br><br>It's just a short reminder to all of you working so hard in life. We should not let time slip through our fingers without having spent sometime with those who really matter to us, those close to our hearts.<br><br>If we die tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily replace us in a matter of days. But the family &amp; friends we left behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more into work than to our family an un wise investment indeed.<br></div>
