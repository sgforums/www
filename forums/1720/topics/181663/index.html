Today's your lucky day ~!<br>Organising Your Inventory 101 has opened for registration,<br>Guaranteed to shape your Item Inventory like never before ~!<br>Sign Up Today ~!<br><br><strong>Organising Your Inventory 101 ~ Equip</strong><br><br><img src="http://img113.imageshack.us/img113/4520/equip9il.png"><br><br>This part of your inventory are not only for your item drops, but for your toys.<br>You might want to try and keep your toys close to one side of your Equip box, so that there will be a clear margin between the items you want to keep, and items to be sold.<br><br>Organising your toys will make your Equip much neater. Seperating between weapons and armors is a good thing, especially when you need to change to your full gear quikly, in order to fight the evil Crimson Balrog lurking outside your ship.<br><br><strong>Organising Your Inventory 102 ~ Use</strong><br><br><img src="http://img117.imageshack.us/img117/9308/use9qj5ah.png"><br><br>Possibly the most active section of your Item Inventory, the Use section holds mainly your potions, scrolls and for Assassins/Hermits, your throwing stars/knives.<br><br>For Assassins and Hermits, you might want to keep your stars on top, for quick recharge. Else, you would have to scroll down, in order to recharge your stars at towns.<br>My opinion, 12~16 stars would be sufficient for your adventures ~<br><br><span style="color: #CC0000;">As you might have noticed, I have left 4 slots for white potions, blue potions, power elixers and elixir. Leaving slots for these pots are recommended, because these are potions dropped by monsters. When a monster-dropped potion is picked up, it will be collected in the slots you've allocated for these potions. Thus, will leave your inventory clean, and not as messy as when you've got potion scattered all over your inventory.<br><br>You can leave the power elixer's slot empty because not alot of monsters drops power elixirs. However, for me, I do visit rog once in a while, thats why I've left slots for it.</span><br><br>Personally, I've bought 2 extra rows or space from the cash shop, in order to store my stars.<br>It would really be useful, expecially when jr.yeti pops a 60% Glove Atk for you ^^<br><br><strong>Organising Your Inventory 103 ~ Etc </strong><br><br><img src="http://img113.imageshack.us/img113/5338/etc3th.jpg"><br><br>The Etc Section. Constanly being populated with leftovers picked up either willingly, or unwillingly(by your pet).<br>This section stores your ores, quest items, and Magic/Summoning rocks.<br><br>In game, there are 16 different ores. Arranging the ores like this is strongly recommended, so that when you see some guy shouting buying ores, you can quickly check how much of it you have. Eliminating the hassle of logging in to your other account, you can also beat other sellers, especially when your overflowing ~!<br><br>What happens when you overflow, and no one's buying em ?<br>Take 1 of each ore, put them in one of your other char.<br>When your ores in your main reaches 100, take 99, and place them in your other char.<br>This way, your other char will have 100 or the ore, and you, will have 1 ore, resting safely in the slot.<br>Personally, I've colour coded them ^^<br><br>As you might have realised I've also bought 2 extra row of slots from the cash shop, to store my summoning rocks.<br>Placing stuff like teleporting scrolls, charms and summoning rocks right on top of the ores will diffrentiate between the leftovers and your precious rocks. You don;t want to be npc-ing your precious rocks do you ?<br><br><strong> Organising Your Inventory 104.1 ~ Set up </strong><br><br><img src="http://img113.imageshack.us/img113/6316/setup2zv.jpg"><br><br>This section basically just store your christmas collectibles, the spaces are there, why not ?  :gee:<br><br><strong>Organising Your Inventory 104.2 ~ Cash </strong><br><br><img src="http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/2284/cash8tj.jpg"><br><br>Pets Rocks ~<br><br><strong>Organising Your Inventory 104.3 ~ Quick Slots</strong><br><br><img src="http://img110.imageshack.us/img110/1240/quickslot1ka.jpg"><br><br>Most people like to place their skills here.<br>What I recommend is to place your Potions and Pet Food here.<br>This will not only help you keep track of the number of potions you have left,<br>It can also measure your "Pots-Per-Minute" consumption, for future repoting reference ^^<br><br>That's It ~!<br>Hope It Helps ~!<br>Free Bumps Appreciated ~!<br></blockquote></div>
