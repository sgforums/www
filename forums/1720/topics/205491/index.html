            <div class='col-md body'>oh. the first video happened in UPM, Universiti Putra Malaysia. I watched this video from my rmmate's computer last month, i think.<br><br>according to my roommate, UPM's hostel is divided into several erm, say, groups. Apparently the chinese were from students from another group and tried to hold an activity in the Malay's group. we can see that they have set up a table or counter, with several reading materials and sign boards. one even had a camera. i believed he was supposed to snap photos of the activity.Then the malays told them it's against the rules, bla bla bla... and this happened. then the boy used his camera to snap this video.<br><br>even the security guard is against the chinese, like they want it to happen at all, while the malays were yelling so aggressively at the chinese boy.<br><br>there are several universities that are very erm, leant towards the malays. I heard UPM has 1st class facilities, but most of the students are malays. chinese who study there will have very very low passing rate. heard (not sure it's true) that only 1% of chinese will pass the exams. den the malays will pass easily.<br><br>sigh... what can we do? we live in their lands... it's a disgrace to them, and they have never think of how much we've done to help them grow their country... the only ones seem to appreciate us are only the prime ministers. that's why i have plans to find a job out of malaysia after graduating.<br><br>as for the second video, "This video may contain content that is inappropriate for some users, as flagged by YouTube's user community. To view this video, please verify you are 18 or older by logging in or signing up." I'm not 18 yet, pai seh.</div>

This has caused anger in the college's students who knew about the background and history of the GMM.<br><br>The GMM is a society joined by chinese students of the UPM. In the university, no society based on race or language should be allowed. The GMM took the students' benefits as it's first, but they used it as an excuse to attract new students to join them. Actually, the GMM is a society that has connection to DAP and Keadilan (two opposition parties of Malaysia), and was under the control of their mentor, Tian Chua (dunno who).<br><br>the next part said they planned for this by holding secret meetings in Cameron Highlands. I mean, if they were secret, how can the website get hold of the photos?<br><br>we skip to the log file for 17th July.<br><br>6.30 pm - the chinese were eating. No flyers or leaflets were seen<br>6.40 pm - GMM group opened a counter, but this action didn't get the approval of HEP (Hal Ehwal Pelajar - student affairs department) of college 12 &amp; 14.<br>7.00 pm - Chairperson of the HEP asked the chinese to leave quietly within 10 minutes<br>7.10 pm - another warning. but GMM stayed. pushing and quarreling issued. HEP called the security guards to help dismiss the chinese<br>7.30 pm - security guards fail to put an end to this incident. police was summoned and they arrived in less than 10 minutes' time.<br>8.00 pm - Chief Inspector of the police arrived. The GMM agreed to leave as long as no actions would be taken against them<br><br>we go down to the photos. look at photo number 6. The caption:<br>Incident in UPM - red circled LIM HUAT SENG, USM (Universiti Sains Malaysia - Malaysia Science University), as a provocation source. Started yelling "Jangan Gaduh... (don't quarrel)" before they started quarreling. What is the motive of this... Nobody quarrelled but he yelled at the top of his voice, splitting his throat apart.<br><br>from the video, it is clear that the malays were already teasing the chinese before he started yelling</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from what i personally think, the UPM is a racist university. According to the website in the previous post, there were two chinese-based illegal society. but i believed that there are also illegally formed malay-based society in UPM. besides, the racism in the university may also make it tough for GMM to get an approval to set up the society.<br><br>just be careful when you communicate with malays in malaysia... they are totally different from singaporean malays. some are very kind, some are not.</div>
