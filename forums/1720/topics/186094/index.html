            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, so there was this girl in my guild, let's call her MAY. She has two accounts and she share it with her friend and her brother. Her friend logged in to her main account, let's call it MAIN. Her second account was logged in by MAY, let's call it 2ND. So I was confused when they switched account with each other. I thought MAIN was MAY so I ask her if the ksing and defaming was still going on and I offered to help her.<br><br>MAIN was really rude and 'she' even say something like as if I dun want to help her. I thought 'she' was being frustrated so I shrugged it off. Never mind, so I still went to help 'her'. But inside, I was thinking that I was doing her a favour and yet she still doubt me..which was really an unpleasant feeling.<br><br>Along the way, I was rushing and use my teleport scroll to teleport to orbis 1st floor and quickly enter into aqua world. I was swimming and 'she' pmed me saying 'oi hurry up i'm yawning liao' along the lines while I was rushing. I said I am reaching already it not as if I am from vic going to aqua. By the time I reach there, 'she' was just saying 'party..' I was like huh? So I guess 'she' just wants to leech me...<br><br>Amongst over this incident, MAY in her 2ND account was screaming at MAIN to get off the account. I later found out that the person in MAIN was an ex guild mate of ours. Not only am I angry over this but also, there was this guy in our guild that keeps begging to share account with MAY. This guy has always been begging me since day one and whenever i'm not in use, he just don't care and so is the others!<br><br>What do you think about leechers and such? I dunno what to do now..I was soo angry just now! In my mind I was thinking..omg, our guild is full of beggars, account sharers, leechers and so and so..and the situation is so messy somemore! MAY and the person in MAIN didn't even agree to share account somemore! And the person in MAIN still dare to intrude MAY's account...<br><br>haix..tell me what to do??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
