Why are you so sure, with your "4G intelligence" that it wasnt her. Talking one load of bull, without even stating the reasons for your unimaginable total defence for her isnt helping much either, I see more of personal attacks than stuff made to even defend ur side you've taken.Or are you SAC urself..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2) Next, you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly</span> said I tried to achieve "personal, illegal desires", does that also = to you accusing me of hacking the account back?<br><br>As far as i know, YOU <strong>dont</strong> have any idea on the account holder/me/the other "3rd" user. So who are you to come down here to <strong>directly</strong> accuse me of having the "personal, illegal desires" all kept to myself, in other words, what you just said, is NOT a hypothesis/assumption made on your reading, to what i ASSUME you have done, to take sides with whoever.<br><br>In such, I do agree that the innocent should not be faulted, yet again, some asswipes just run away free.<br><br>Oh ok, i just noticed as well, that you said you dont mind providing<br>all relevant account details including the IP addresses that accessed the account, email change logs from the database.

            <div class='col-md body'>gLc, I think I really have had enough of you and your nonsense, as well as your one-sided story. No matter how many gazillion times I tell you I'm not responsible of hacking the account, you just refuse to believe. You seems nice at first, and you seems nice after you edited the thread on the (Part I), I thought you were understanding.<br><br>But now, I don't know what's your point of arguing with whoever who's above, and then accuse him as my clone, bf or my friend. As all of you can see here, I'm not as senior as gLc here, nobody can vouch for my integrity. I do not mind. I believe the truth and justice is &gt; the amount of people who side his one-sided story.<br><br>Unfortunately, I'm wrong. Say, 100 evil monsters were to attack a superhero, the superhero would die eventually.<br><br>I thought things had come to an end, and the account belongs to whoever who get holds to it now, obviously, it's not me who's holding onto the account, it's quite obvious that who I am talking about.<br><br>In your (Part I), you agreed that you shouldn't post anything without solid evidence but in your Part II, you seems like one ignorant guy who's stubborn and pin point to whoever you like to.<br><br>You requested for a meet up, I agreed with it and even volunteered to pay the taxi fare for you as I know it's inconvenient for you to come all the way down to Woodlands. But since you're the one who requested for a meet up, I think I've the right to decide the location. Also, you mentioned about one Malay guy blah blah blah, then when I ask you to ask that Malay guy down to meet me as well, why don't you want to do that?<br><br>Once you do that, the "new buyer"(according to you, the malay guy) can tell you whether I am the seller or not. There's no benefit for him to side me anyway. You might say I'd ask my friend to sell him the account, but you said the Malay guy described the seller as what I am. So there's no way my friend can look exactly like me.<br><br>I don't know waht can I do to get back the account. If what you're saying is the truth, and you really didnt hack the account. I wish I have a way to get the account and give it all to you, but I can't. I can do next to nothing.<br><br>It's really unfair for you to post all your one-sided story then tekan me like that. I'd not do such stupid thing to spoil my own reputation and make enemies like that.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
