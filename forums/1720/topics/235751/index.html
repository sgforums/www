In which now is a 10X hermit which i trained till.<br><br>Around last week, I tracked the char and found him to be at sotong, i went there and wanted to ks, but i later found out that he spoke almost perfect english which was a shock to me, from what the hacker normal speaks.<br><br>The hacker always used words like, "eUu", "shO", "lykks", basically, all those sort of language. This new guy said he bought the char only a few days ago, he even gave me his handphone number as i wanted to clarify things. He described the girl as, "FLAT, 1.5m-16m,no specs, not exactly small built, but not big either, could be 40-50 ++ kg."<br><br>After hearing all these, I had my doubts because the girl describe does look like the girl i met originally to buy the char from. I told him that it was a hacked char and that after training it, he might get scammed and the char taken away, for safety precautions, i told him to stop using it asap and hes been calling me daily to find out the current situation of it.<br><br>Also, this "skeletonsAREcute" wanted to do a meet up to clarify all doubts, then again, i had my suspicions bout it, i thought to myself, why meet up? Its not like im ever gonna get it back again. So to all potential account buyers, regardless of who is selling the account, just do take care. The unexpected could happen.<br><br>* FYI, the 400 mill in which my friend put in my char was lost overnight, since then i paid him $800 SGD, as I believed it was my responsibility cuz it got lost in my char.<br><br>Yet the person who sold me the char says its my parsar that i bought it and I should take all the blame.<br><br>Well, thats for nothing. Thanks for reading.</div>
