            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by skeletonsAREcute:<br><strong><br><br>1. gLc buys account from me. *lvl 73/4 hermit, forgot*<br><br>2. gLc's A-cash went missing sometimes, he ignored. (this one I really admit is my fault and I believe that his cash really went missing, cause once my friend ask me why do I keep toping up cash even when I'm not playing and he even said he used some.)<br><br>3. gLc disbanded my guild even with a verbal promise made.<br><br>4. gLc and I kena hack as we're still sharing the same passport, he promised to let me have my beginner even when he buys the hermit away, so yea.<br><br>5. gLc claims that he lost 400m and paid $800 to his friend. buddies were also scammed by the so-called hacker.<br>My beginner lost all the gacha items(too many to remb), such as sake bottle[b]s</strong>, brown bandana, attack wg, speed shoe, etcs, but I admit, when added up, it's not more than 150m, so if he's telling the truth, he's really losing much more than I am.<br><br>6. gLc PMed me and claimed that I gave him an invalid number then posted all the PMs' screenshot until I call him and wants him to comprehend clearly that he shouldn't be making assumptions this early.<br><br>7. I really thought it was my online-friend who hacked it - he havent been online for weeks, he doesn't reply to my SMSes, hp switched off whenever I tries to call. But after thinking for awhile, he might have no time for MSN, he changed his number(quite frequently and normal for prepaid users to change number now and then).<br><br>8. gLc requested for a meet-up. I agreed without any hesitation because I think it's good to talk face-to-face. Then since I'm sacrificing my time for him to meet him on his demand, he still wants me to give in to him to where he wants to meet. He says he wants an explanation, which is why he wanted to meet me. I was so gong to actually think that I owe him one, but now, do I really owe him one? I wasn't even the one who hacked it.<br><br>9. gLc backed up, he says no point meeting up, since "some ppl" won't return his account. I can't agree any further, "some ppl" won't return my account and my stuff either.<br><br>10. I was browsing through MarketPlace after he created his (Part II) thread, so I came across this, "WTB: aquila mesos" so I was thinking of looking at who wants to sell and PM them if their rates are good for gifting them as a gift for some of my items lost are also my friends'.<br><br>Then, I saw this reply, "are you gLc :lol" and then followed by gLc's reply, "shhh..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">". So I thought it's better if I do a search on this ImAclone2 in which he used to post his buying mesos thread, just to play safe cause I won't know if he creates such thread somewhere else too without my knowing.<br><br>Tadah, I saw this S&gt; lvl 101 hermit, with wa 45 scarab, I was very shocked.<br><br>I look at his profile(ImAclone2), and realised the email used says, gLc.91@hotmail.com .<br><br>Now I'm dam sure, it must be him.<br><br>First, he pretends that the passport was hacked by somebody. Then, he posts threads and convince others that he's a victim, also to hide his guilty conscience, I would say.<br>Followed by, claiming that the so-called new buyer, a malay guy, says a girl sold that account to him(w/o any proof) and claim that the malay guy describe the girl just exactly the same as me.<br>Then when I say ask the malay guy to actually come out to meet me and see whether he says it's me or not, he said I might have asked my friend to sell it for me.<br>Pretty contradicting?<br><br>11. As for the rest, I'm really too lazy to post.<br><br>Time to go to school. =)<br>Good day people![/b]</blockquote>1) Your statement 1 is true.<br><br>2) Statement 2 is true also.<br><br>3) I didnt disband the guild, but you may say its me, since I already promised not to.<br><br>4) Yep, we did kena hack together.<br><br>5) Ok, you have ur losses, i have mine too.<br><br>6) Over msn, which you said you did share an msn account with someone else, so if it wasnt you who gave me an invalid number, probably the other guy, aka the hacker pretended to be you and gave me and invalid number. Yes, up till now, I still didnt say you did it, and yes I have no proof either.<br><br>7) On this, you know him for 2 years, you dont even know his workplace? Studyplace? So basically you know his name and age only? I dont believe a 2 year online friendship can result in you knowing so little things only, sincerely I dont. But, isnt it obvious enough? Fine, if YOU didnt hack it, why shouldnt he answer his phone? OR since 2 years of friendship made you trust him so much, why didnt he tell you of his new number? Which includes countless sms-es you sent to him without replies, and calls as well. In otherwords, could he be the "real hacker"? I dont know.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Shouldnt you come to where i want? Even i suggested we give and take, you sacrifice abit and i give as well. But no, you insisted woodlands. Thats dam far for me. Logically thinking, if anyone had lost that much an amount of money, who would he target first? The ORIGINAL asiasoft account holder, or her friend? So you are saying that you have to "sacrifice" your precious time to meet out, as well as a nearby area near you? I havent heard bigger bullsh!t in my life. You are suppose to take responsibility for the loss, but now I didnt even blame you nor wanted you to pay for the losses.<br><br>9) Yes, at first I did wanted to meet, but after hearing some words and advices from a few friends, they adviced that even meeting up wouldnt get back the account, whats more, some people might flare up halfway over it, since its over, its over, meeting up would never let me get the char back again, so whats the point?<br><br>10) If you even believe that its me, then I have nothing else to say.<br><br>Also in this thread <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=230499" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=230499</a> , if you didnt notice, for the kanday0x guy who aimed to thread hijack, I personally went down to look for him, why?

Not exactly two years but close to two years, but the days we really spoke and played in game together is far less than two years, might even be less than 1/2 year.<br><br>I mean, this is really how online friend goes what, one day you talk to him, the other day you don't see the need of talking to him anymore, because you guys have no topic to talk abt with.<br><br>Last time, we used to discuss everything about maple, but after I said I wanted to quit, he told me he can help me train my Beginner while I'm away, I've no reason not to trust him, so I just give it to him anyway.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Who should be responsible for my lost then?<br><br>If you don't know the "rules", if you're the one who's asking the other party out, + setting the time and date, the other party HAS THE RIGHT to choose where.

Somebody had been making assumptions and creating lots of threads to gain "special" attention to his and my lost, which I don't think it's very necessary. But if you like it, go and do it. Others shall see what kind of person you are.<br><br>Again, posting PMs/MSN dialogs, I seriously it's RUDE, although there's nth to hide about. Never mind, somebody here ain't civilise anyway.<br><br>10) You've nothing to say? I thought you had tonnes to explain.<br><br>And, if one day I stop replying to this thread, that would be the day which I find it really pointless to argue over a lost that I'm experiencing, and somebody who wants to attract more of others' and my attention....why should I be so stupid and give in and give him all my attention?<br><br>I've really been dwelling over this matter becase I find it hard to believe that when I lost something too, the other party is indirectly accusing me of hacking it, and thinking that I should be responsible for the lost.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Qing zhe zi qing.</span></div>

(this one I really admit is my fault and I believe that his cash really went missing, cause once my friend ask me why do I keep toping up cash even when I'm not playing and he even said he used some.)<br><br>3. gLc disbanded my guild even with a verbal promise made.<br><br>4. gLc and I kena hack as we're still sharing the same passport, he promised to let me have my beginner even when he buys the hermit away, so yea.<br><br>5. gLc claims that he lost 400m and paid $800 to his friend. buddies were also scammed by the so-called hacker.<br>My beginner lost all the gacha items(too many to remb), such as sake bottle[b]s</strong>, brown bandana, attack wg, speed shoe, etcs, but I admit, when added up, it's not more than 150m, so if he's telling the truth, he's really losing much more than I am.<br><br>6. gLc PMed me and claimed that I gave him an invalid number then posted all the PMs' screenshot until I call him and wants him to comprehend clearly that he shouldn't be making assumptions this early.<br><br>7. I really thought it was my online-friend who hacked it - he havent been online for weeks, he doesn't reply to my SMSes, hp switched off whenever I tries to call. But after thinking for awhile, he might have no time for MSN, he changed his number(quite frequently and normal for prepaid users to change number now and then).<br><br>8. gLc requested for a meet-up. I agreed without any hesitation because I think it's good to talk face-to-face. Then since I'm sacrificing my time for him to meet him on his demand, he still wants me to give in to him to where he wants to meet. He says he wants an explanation, which is why he wanted to meet me. I was so gong to actually think that I owe him one, but now, do I really owe him one? I wasn't even the one who hacked it.<br><br>9. gLc backed up, he says no point meeting up, since "some ppl" won't return his account. I can't agree any further, "some ppl" won't return my account and my stuff either.<br><br>10. I was browsing through MarketPlace after he created his (Part II) thread, so I came across this, "WTB: aquila mesos" so I was thinking of looking at who wants to sell and PM them if their rates are good for gifting them as a gift for some of my items lost are also my friends'.<br><br>Then, I saw this reply, "are you gLc :lol" and then followed by gLc's reply, "shhh..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">". So I thought it's better if I do a search on this ImAclone2 in which he used to post his buying mesos thread, just to play safe cause I won't know if he creates such thread somewhere else too without my knowing.<br><br>Tadah, I saw this S&gt; lvl 101 hermit, with wa 45 scarab, I was very shocked.<br><span style="color: red;"><br>I look at his profile(ImAclone2), and realised the email used says, gLc.91@hotmail.com .</span><br><br>Now I'm dam sure, it must be him.<br><br>First, he pretends that the passport was hacked by somebody.
