(this one I really admit is my fault and I believe that his cash really went missing, cause once my friend ask me why do I keep toping up cash even when I'm not playing and he even said he used some.)<br><br>3. gLc disbanded my guild even with a verbal promise made.<br><br>4. gLc and I kena hack as we're still sharing the same passport, he promised to let me have my beginner even when he buys the hermit away, so yea.<br><br>5. gLc claims that he lost 400m and paid $800 to his friend. buddies were also scammed by the so-called hacker.<br>My beginner lost all the gacha items(too many to remb), such as sake bottle<strong>s</strong>, brown bandana, attack wg, speed shoe, etcs, but I admit, when added up, it's not more than 150m, so if he's telling the truth, he's really losing much more than I am.<br><br>6. gLc PMed me and claimed that I gave him an invalid number then posted all the PMs' screenshot until I call him and wants him to comprehend clearly that he shouldn't be making assumptions this early.<br><br>7. I really thought it was my online-friend who hacked it - he havent been online for weeks, he doesn't reply to my SMSes, hp switched off whenever I tries to call. But after thinking for awhile, he might have no time for MSN, he changed his number(quite frequently and normal for prepaid users to change number now and then).<br><br>8. gLc requested for a meet-up. I agreed without any hesitation because I think it's good to talk face-to-face. Then since I'm sacrificing my time for him to meet him on his demand, he still wants me to give in to him to where he wants to meet. He says he wants an explanation, which is why he wanted to meet me. I was so gong to actually think that I owe him one, but now, do I really owe him one? I wasn't even the one who hacked it.<br><br>9. gLc backed up, he says no point meeting up, since "some ppl" won't return his account. I can't agree any further, "some ppl" won't return my account and my stuff either.<br><br>10. I was browsing through MarketPlace after he created his (Part II) thread, so I came across this, "WTB: aquila mesos" so I was thinking of looking at who wants to sell and PM them if their rates are good for gifting them as a gift for some of my items lost are also my friends'.<br><br>Then, I saw this reply, "are you gLc :lol" and then followed by gLc's reply, "shhh..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">". So I thought it's better if I do a search on this ImAclone2 in which he used to post his buying mesos thread, just to play safe cause I won't know if he creates such thread somewhere else too without my knowing.<br><br>Tadah, I saw this S&gt; lvl 101 hermit, with wa 45 scarab, I was very shocked.<br><br>I look at his profile(ImAclone2), and realised the email used says, gLc.91@hotmail.com .<br><br>Now I'm dam sure, it must be him.<br><br>First, he pretends that the passport was hacked by somebody. Then, he posts threads and convince others that he's a victim, also to hide his guilty conscience, I would say.<br>Followed by, claiming that the so-called new buyer, a malay guy, says a girl sold that account to him(w/o any proof) and claim that the malay guy describe the girl just exactly the same as me.<br>Then when I say ask the malay guy to actually come out to meet me and see whether he says it's me or not, he said I might have asked my friend to sell it for me.<br>Pretty contradicting?<br><br>11. As for the rest, I'm really too lazy to post.<br><br>Time to go to school. =)<br>Good day people!</div>
