              <p>Hmm..... I agree that sound issue for the official released was better than original one, but still can be improved. (And why SBS7322B said what cheat??) I will see how it goes first, as once I release, I would release all (201-202 KFC, 203-204 Ribena, 219-220 Magnum Gold, 219-220 Sma Ad, 219-220 Original (No ad), <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>237-238</strong></span></em> H2o Ad) so that takes time.</p>

              <p>To do list for C651:</p>
              <p>1: Fix overhead thingy --- Done</p>
              <p>2: Integrate Bngauw's sound patches --- Done</p>
              <p>3: Install panels including STARIS on the blue and green carriage (So far official releases only do the orange carriage, which is the one with TO cabin) --- Done</p>
              <p>4: Fix the interior TO cabin side --- Done</p>
              <p>5: Convert the train to full png --- <strong>Done</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>New To-Do List:</p>
              <p>1: Extends the short seats in C651's end as C651 does not have the "standing area" like C751B -- U/C (Thanks to Flip for pointing out)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2: Get images for gangway part -- U/C</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3: Get images for <strong>inside</strong> TO cabin <span style="color: #ffffff;">---- WTF, unless I take DNB, sneak into depots, how am I supposed to accomplished this!?</span></p>
              <p>4: Motor sounds by Flip + Bngauw (WTH, I would like to discuss this issue as well.)</p>

No, not on the back of trains as seen above but somewhere on the doors. This is why I have gone offline for the next few days and fixed it while adding more work such as removing unnecessary codes [I realized there are quite a number of unwanted codes in 1219, 2219 and I am focusing on 219 out of the 219/220 now as of writing.

              <p>Hmm... WIP. What happened was the released train, open up your Objectviewer on &lt;carriage number&gt;.csv such as 3219.csv, you can see that outside you see the SMRT livery and inside the train with the priority seat sticker etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, there cant have 2 layers of sticker in real life (Open up files such as intwall1.csv) and you can see another wall with such stickers etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Technically, you will see 2 layers and I feel it is kind of weird, so I removed the inside layer of the sticker on &lt;carriage number&gt;.csv. But since this issue, I have decided to restore them, only using another set of image without the microphone and stickers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmm, FYI, there are certain details that is difficult to explain here. But be assured that this suggestion is WIP. For other enquiries, you may PM / MSN me.</p>
