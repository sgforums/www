              <p>Thanks for the description, I was able to produce that as well (But do try opening those carriage number.animated in Object Viewer I have taught you how to do le hor.)</p>
              <p><img src="http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5878/flashingadandcolourissu.png" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the exactly same train as the one released (That has the SMA ad), hence, you not only see the colour issue as the user above stated, but also the ad flashing issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Problem description:</p>
              <p>Advertisement case, was like "overlapping" with the glass window. Bo bian must accept.</p>
              <p>The colour case as reported, was not shown in the Objectviewer as well (Same goes to the advert case). In both problems, they were NOT reflected in Objectviewer, a primary tool used to visual our development works on various objects, but on the actual openBVE game itself, and hence I conclude that most likely, is that the PC he and me using is plain sucks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Disclamier: I uses a laptop with Intel (Not Sinktel) graphics on Windows 7 64bit with 4GB RAM subject to be eaten by bo liao GPU, and as far as I know, he (TecomaStan) is using a lappy Windows 7 32bit as well. Hence, all I can conclude from now is certain poor performance GPU, may show a lot of visual issues on the game itself but not the objectviewer itself. Ironically, it seemed that the fps has slightly improved based on my previous posts.</p>

              Since the issue is not shown on ObjectViewer, I dont see an immediate need to fix it as I need to confirm whether is this the difference nature. Anyway, due to the nature of the design, parts of the train (You see those problems there) are places with holes and as such, the workaround for me is to patch it as one in ext8.png.

              <p>Ok, the issue was again confirmed on flip's desktop with a 7600GS, so not so on Intel Graphics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, he said that his 3D PSD (AEL) got hole. Which is damn similar to this train's issue (Notice the seats?). Well, apparently it has to do with newer stable release and I feel like going back to 1.2.6 version, as I believed that the latest version is the root of all these problems, and not lousy GPU causes it. (OpenBVE recently changed it's renderer)</p>

              <ul>
              <li>Suggested on how to solve the gaps issue by resizing the image to width &amp; height to a number that is power of 2 (such as 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024 etc)</li>
              <li>Suggested on how to resize without get pixelated (By NOT using interpolation) in GIMP so that I wont get those blue stains back again and spend time like siao to correct them with possibly the need to sarifice some quality.</li>

              <p>Please refer to the downloads thread for the latest official C651 train released!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is pretty similar to the previous preview release which has since been deleted, only to have a following add-ons:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Bugs fixed</li>
              <li>First BVE train to be released that conforms to International standard, which is the only solution to fix the bugs listed a few posts ago.</li>
              <li>Added a constant speed mechanism that is the same with BVE C151. (Not sure the real life C651 or C151 got or not)</li>
              <li>Unofficial (Actually official) release of ad changer. You can just use the ad changer to change any of the advert in C651 V2.0 or above. The advert I have compiled is essentially all of the adverts available for these trains. Read the readme for more instructions.</li>
              <li>I think if I am not wrong, now the train is virtually impossible to speed over 90km/h. Earlier release is possible, in theoritically with obviously, skip stops in EWL / NSL route.<br></li>

              <p>Well bump it again, with a minor patch of white stripe is released. Actually, if you go see int_back&lt;3XYY&gt;.png where &lt;3XYY&gt; is your 4 digit train car that is the odd / smaller number (3201, 3203, 3219 or 3237), there is a white stripe which I forgot to notice.</p>

              <p>Pai seh. Bump with new announcements:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a short term next release, I will be releasing a C651 Version 2.0 SP1 (Service Pack 1) that is a cumulative patch of the above one as well as below:</p>
              <p>To-do list:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Fix the gaps in the train cabin and a more realistic (Still not so realistic) internal TO cabin<br></li>
              <li>Better STARIS (Does not apply to Magnum Gold exterior advert, or applicable as well if you prefer STARIS than that message of terminating at TE1.)<br></li>
              <li>Other miscelleaneous fix (Reintroduce codes that were commented out)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If time allows:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Re-implement the shoe / bogie thing (I just heard that this thing is not so accurate, need time to verify)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Not to be included (Possibly part of Future Version 3.0 / Service Pack 2 plan):</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Real STARIS (That STARIS simply shows doors open on right side instead of "other side" on <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>both</strong></span></em> sides, which looks stupid on City Hall, Raffles Place, Bishan, Braddell, Dover)<br></li>
              <li>ATO plugin</li>
              <li>3D cabin</li>
              <li>&lt;Anymore suggestion that is not feasible to implement now but existed in C651?&gt;</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Do note that when I made such announcements, I mean it by a new patched full train is to be uploaded soon, without a target date set as of posting, this is considered that the above patch is a cumulative of several patches which might be troublesome to some users. If you are comfortable with reading my readme file, you may just download that particular patch file and read the instructions accordingly to install (Save time by having to download a smaller file).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, this Service Pack 1 is one of the requirment for me to complete before I would release a next iteration of openBVE for Dummies package.</p>

              <p>For the train, no. The updates should be less than 1MB and the full train coupled with the patches should be as usual, less than 20MB. The next release of openBVE for Dummies should be around 220MB.</p>

              <p>I think you should get some pictures of the gangway. And so many
                  updates might as well release a V3.0 liao.</p>

              <p>Gangway picture is also planned, but not shown here, as part of surprise plan, but wikileak-ed le.</p>

              <p>No, Version 3.0 will then focus things like 3D cabin, Real STARIS, Real ATO and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>some other further visual / audio improvements</strong></em></span>. I plan to make a development plan as follows:</p>
              <p>Version 1.0 -- Basic train done by Jcqh</p>
              <p>Version 2.0 -- Intermediate train enhanced by me (and people in the committee, contributor, co-s etc.) with various updates</p>
              <p>Version 3.0 -- Advanced high quality train further enhanced by me (and people in the committee, contributor, co-s etc.) which is like no more further updates required.</p>
