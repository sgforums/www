              <p>Okay, I've tried the NSX, and I have very some comments that would hopefully help you improve on the route.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I must say that proofreading is a very important role in the determination of your work. Your notice on the board states, "Some tracks are removed and we will replace the better tracks with the older tracks." This sentence, when interpreted correctly, will mean that you will replace the good-condition tracks with old tracks. This doesn't make sense. Do correct this error. Other than a few other spelling and grammar mistakes here and there, things should be fine. :)</p>
              <p>Your electronic displays which are from Michelle's Demoroute1 require some editing. They look as though they're floating in mid-air, and yeah, I did laugh out a little on it, because they look very cute. :P Try building some supports, maybe from the roof, so that the displays can be hung on them.</p>
              <p>Once again, the displays, you have to texture your message properly. The message is very stretched, which means that things scroll by very fast and then people can't read it properly. Use SetTextureCoordinates to edit your message.</p>
              <p>Lastly, your faregates are simply from my Airport Express Line and replaced with some wood texture, I guess. Somehow I can look through the 'boxes', something doesn't seem right.</p>
              <p>Other than that, I believe your route is on it's way to success, just try harder. Try creating more of your own objects and add them properly into the route. If you need any other help, you can always approach us, the developers, and we'll try to help you. :D</p>

              <p>You should release the route with a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COMPATIBLE</span></strong> Train. If not, you'll get this bad remarks. The faregates are too high for the train. They can be fat, but the height is the problem.</p>
