              <p>Lol! Actually CGL was the first line to introduce this (Abit different, refer to CGL V0.8) and then EWL introduced it on PSR - SIM.</p>
              <p>But AFAIK, NSL wants to use part of these objects from CGL and EWL, as the EWL's one got a short coming of no curve rails. (All rails are straight in shape, and hence the curves are not very smooth) --- How about asking the NSL to do the curve tunnels based on EWL one?</p>

              <p>So, you have to change railtypes everytime you go into a curve? You mean curved rails with different radiuses? If you are talking about that, you can refer to Dennis Lance's tutorial. He has curved rails of different radiuses. All you need to do is just change the rock.bmp and the rail's dimension.

              <p>If I did not recall wrongly, the NSL are in the midest of implementing new rails / viaducts right? Maybe u guys want to use The Soon version as seen in EWL or with some enhancements that the EWL currently dont have. Well --- after that, probably I will be freed from the project and hence i got time for my BVE, and I can do final checking of sectors beyond Bugis and merge them together.</p>
              <p>Oh yes, after that I still have to do NEL (Which now still have not contributed a single thing, I am sorry about it) and following that, I suppose u guys should be ready for the next NSL release, and I hope that by then CGL V0.9 or even V1.0 is also ready, so that I can see which version is the best for a particular object and use it.</p>
              <p>Ok, BVESG_common make sense, but, AFAIK, some objects in EWL / NSL cannot be used in NEL and I believe that CCL do connect to NEL (Go Vivocity yourself to see it, or wait for me ..... if it is possible).</p>
