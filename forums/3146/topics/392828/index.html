              <p>Latest updates:</p>
              <p>Gotten permission from Veyron to release the routes. Most of the edits are basically here. Actually, I even released a few patches along his route which hopefully he will integrate it in his Queenstown release before he actually does that (He said the latest development got Queenstown, that since it is not released, why not integrate my edits and he may PM / MSN me on the parts that I have edited. I will delete the patch once he got all my 3 updates (Or rather my Version 3 of the update that contains previous updates as well) integrated. No point repeating and keeping old archives -- wasting my space only BECAUSE my way of doing things is to get into perfect in reasonable way before I release it.)</p>
              <p>Now, I left jerry's permission because I did not take not which of it is from NSL AND what I know is that I use their lines for comparison / debugging which allowed me to put roofs even on his CLE - COM route and my to be released route (Bedok - Eunos).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Update: I recalled. I use NSL to refer from the tunnel as well. Now also change to use his way for converge / diverge tracks approaching / leaving stations.</p>

              <p>I release the first ever Bedok - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Eunos</em></span> route (Sorry, up to Kembangan again first)</p>
              <p> Link Removed. See the lateral post.</p>
              <p>However, there is a catch or 2. (This is Alpha 3)</p>
              <p> 1st: It is not completed in the sense that it is meant for a preview.</p>
              <p>2nd: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Somewhere in Kembangan - Eunos seemed to have the tendency of passengers discomfort.</em></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><br></em></span></p>
              <p>3rd: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Eunos station platform seemed to be too close with the track, causing passengers discomfort??</em></span></p>
              <p>-- The sector from Kembangan - Eunos has been removed so as to redo the thing
                           using Google Earth. Thus, points 2 &amp; 3 are invalid at the moment.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>4th: No sound announcement as of yet.</em></span></p>
              <p>--- Deleted. From now on, there has sound / announcements implemented since I got hold one of it. Read below notice.</p>
              <p>5th: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>You need to install Veyron's route and better to apply my Version 3 (Or Beta 4 , but either of them affect <strong>ONLY</strong> his Clementi - Commonwealth route.) patch. I will be releasing a full version AT LEAST I get these things perfect first (Then separate into 2 branchs first.)</em></span></p>
              <p>--- This is NOT required anymore as I have integrated the Patch 4 RC2 and Bedok route into 1 single pack</p>
              <p>6th: When approaching Kembangan, the Eastbound track curve is still not very polished. I am waiting for developers to help me which is why I release another preview (Wait, isnt I a developer as well --- No, I mean those experienced developers haha, dont be offended :D )</p>
              <p>New addition:</p>
              <p>1st: The route between Bedok and Kembangan has fixed to match Google Earth instead of Street Directory despite either uses Guesstimation (Guessing and Estimation)</p>
              <p>2nd: Sound has added <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em></em></span>as <a href="/users/241383">Zeywery</a> has provided me the announcement! Thank you. However, as the announcements was recorded as a bunch, I need to use Windows Live Movie Maker to separate them, (I use Windows 7) so do watch for the next release.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notes: It is POSSIBLE to get 100/100 or more for this 1 station route so long as you stop at the station and either being accurate in positioning or timing. I have tested such that it will not have random passenger discomforts (So dont complain to me when you applied emergency brake all of sudden to a complete stop -- That one sure uncomfort). Do note that at the end of the track heading towards Eunos, it will derail as there are no more tracks (So there wont be any imaginary tracks mentioned in previous developer's work on other lines).</p>

              <p>Request received. Making one such. By the way, is the Version 3 or Version 4 (Beta) patch of mine is better. Do make real comparison and not say the answer just because of version. The only changelog for Version 3 to 4 is to smoothen the curves in the Westbound track (This is a Eastbound route).</p>

              <p>Thank you, however, it would be better if you can record station by station. (That is your provide a compressed file like zip, contains things like next_Alj.mp3 and Alj.mp3, where next_Alj.mp3 is the "Next station, Aljunied" and the Alj.mp3 is the "Aljunied ..... &lt;Paused&gt; ...... Aljunied". This will save the hassle of separating them and insert into the route.

              <p>Notes: I am not sure if the Terrorist message is fixed or not. And even if it is fixed (That is certain sector got such announcement while others not), does it have the 'randomization' (Sometimes in English, other times in Chinese, Malay or Tamil)</p>

              <p>I got a question:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to ask a question on curves &amp; converging / diverging 
              tracks.<br><br>Basically, I know that when a track is turning to the 
              left, I can use .Curve -XXX where XXX is an integer and .Curve XXX for 
              right curves. I also know the use of .Curve 0 = resume to straight line.<br><br>I
               also do know that by specifying .rail 1;YY where YY is the distance 
              away from .rail 0 (Main rail) in meters.<br><br>But, I have a question 
              on how to use them appropirately, i.e: What is the formula to specify 
              these values so as NOT to create a extreme sharp cuve and causes 
              discomfort of the passengers??<br><br>Based on the Google Earth, the 
              station <a class="postlink" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kembangan_MRT_Station">KEM</a> can be found on 1°19′15.54″N 103°54′46.23″E and station <a class="postlink" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunos_MRT_Station">EUN</a> can be found on

              discomfort during normal accleration when leaving station KEM and the 
              curves between stations. By the way, Station KEM and EUN are the

              <p>Thanks joey, I see. By the way, is there any connection with the .rail 1;X specification and the other thing is that is passengers discomfort a normal for a "prolonged B1", that is like reducing from 50 or more km/h to a complete stop by B1-ing only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last but not least, the weirdest of all is that when before leaving the station, doors are not even closed, and the reverser is set as F (Forward) with N, it also give me passenger discomfort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What does all these above implies on the code?</p>

              <p>In order to preview my latest progress, this release contains CLE - COM updated (Only change the speed limit to 80, because in real world I never seen a train service got &gt; 80km/h -- Apart of it, it is the same as previous release ) &amp; the Bedok - Eunos route restored (Hence the purpose)</p>

              <p>BTW, could there be a chance is my train fault?? (I "released" a 4 power notch C151 when developer's version has one)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is probably not the perfect release and the accurate curve details may not be present which is based on estimation + guessing from Google Map (Because I don't know about curved ruler). There is a high chance in Kembangan - Eunos to get passenger discomfort frequently and even on P2. Bedok - Kembangan is rather more or less completed in terms of track layout.</p>

              <p>I need something more, hope you guys would not mind:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1: I wish to know how to do crossovers? (Used between Aljunied - Paya Lebar and Paya Lebar - Eunos)</p>
              <p>2: I wish to know how to do a real underground tunnel. Although I have MSN Jerry and he suggested .pitch command which has the effect of up / down tracks, but the RouteViewer seemed to see that the tunnel wall does not touch the ground. (And by the way the scenry should have the slope go upwards while the track goes downwards) Using .Height command will cause the entrance / exit of the tunnel filled with grass (From Negative height to positive). This is to be used in Bedok - Kembangan.</p>
              <p>3: I have seen that Pasir Ris - Tanah Merah route by The Soon was on hold. Can I have a reference / test it such that I want to extend the route Eastwards? (Before I do Kallang - Bugis route)</p>
              <p>4: I would need a Tanah Merah East/West bound announcement as well. (Prefably Westbound first)</p>
              <p>Last but not least, I have a "prototype" of the route in Bedok - Aljunied, but it is a developer version (All of it that released by me are actually Developer version, just that I do not open public now) until my question 2 is solved (Minimially).</p>
              <p>Thanks for the developers' tip, especially from Veyron, Joey and Jerry, that the passenger discomfort and other issues are solved. (Even though it will not advisible to start with P3, but P2 with ATS enabled.)</p>

              <p>1: The tunnel portion can be further improved as the tunnel contains green grass as background (Which should not be)</p>
              <p>2: The crossovers is my inital attempt from JUR - BBT route and I am not sure if the crossovers are too short. Thanks to Joey.</p>
              <p>3: I know in the opposite direction also have signal lights which is not included. Not sure if OpenBVE supports it or not.</p>
              <p>4: Station Objects, Scenry are not included.</p>
              <p>5: Terrorist announcement not included at the moment (Even though there are placeholders for it -- Need more research)</p>
