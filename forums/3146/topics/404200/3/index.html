We, the BVE SG moderators can do nothing about it, so bumping is required if there is no replies for about 1 month or more, but less than 3 months, right before an auto locked was granted.</p></div>

              <p>Unfortunately I think that the huge size of the current routes are problematic as well. I am trying my best to keep the file size of the Blackton Line as small as possible, the other routes I'll try fixing another time.</p>

              <p>Here are some pre-release notes for you to consider when the route is released tomorrow:</p>
              <p>In order for the signs on the PSDs to be displayed correctly, you need to set openBVE's transparency mode to <strong>"Smooth"</strong>. Here's how you do it. First, open up the openBVE application, and then click the "Options" tab on the left panel. Then under "Interpolation", there should be something called "Transparency". There will be a bar beside it. If your bar indicator points to "Sharp", drag the bar indicator to "Smooth". That should do the trick.</p>
              <p>The route goes from NW1 South Coast to NW7 Blackton South. All stations from NW1 South Coast to NW4 Lakeview have PSDs, the stations beyond that do not have PSDs. Although NW6 World Plaza and NW7 Blackton South are underground, PSDs are not installed in them.</p>
              <p>There are currently no reported errors as it is, if there is just one error or more, try redownloading the route package.</p>
              <p>I think that's about it, happy waiting! :D</p>

              <p>Do note that you need to set openBVE's transparency mode to "Smooth", for you to be able to view the PSD signs correctly.</p>
              <p><strong>AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to delete all Harbourvale City routes related folders (except for the Airport Express Line) before downloading and extracting this. This is because I have changed the organisation of the Harbourvale City Routes.</strong></p>

              <p>I have a suggestion and an error. Error: At NW6, Unlike what Boylush said, I didn't see and PSDs at the station. I pretty much overran the station (Lol).</p>
              <p>Suggestion: Make the gradient on the section of tracks from NW1 South Coast to NW2 Westway smoother. I tried to maintain a speed of 40km/h but rose to 60km/h. And It felt like a rollercoaster in the TO Cabin.</p>
              <p>Hope this is good feedback. Thanks.</p>
