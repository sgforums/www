              Alright, so we're back here again.
              
              I've noticed that recently there is quite a number of people intending to develop a new line for Harbourvale City. I have considered about it and I have decided I will not disapprove of a new route project in Harbourvale City so long as it fulfills the following criteria.
              
              1) The line is at least four stations long.
              2) It passes through a 3km radius from either Central or Kegstone.
              3) The route has to acknowledge an interchange with other operators' lines when using the same station name with a station on the system map. 
              4) We must see that there is some form of improvement in the travel time from a station to another. At least a decrease of 5 minutes estimated.
              
              I think that's about it. Is there a need for an extra line in Harbourvale or not? I will leave it to our SGF users to decide. :)

              <p><strong>History of OpenBVE Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) And Light
              Rapid Transit (LRT) system</strong></p>
              <p>Refer to the thread <em><a href="/forums/3146/topics/399578" rel="nofollow">[OT For fun] History of OpenBVE Singapore MRT And
              LRT system</a></em> for this chapter...</p>
              <p><strong>The beginning of a whole new rapid system in
              2008</strong></p>
              <p>In 2007, the government of Harbourvale City was convinced that
              they needed a new metro rapid system. The roads were becoming
              increasingly congested and citizens complained of the terrible air
              quality. Thus, the government saw the need of a straight line
              linking the northern part of the city to the CBD. As a result, the
              Harbourvale Line began construction and was completed in 2008. The
              line was a one-track system, due to space constraints and several
              other problems.</p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale Line 2008</strong></p>
              <p>HCRT [Harbourvale City Rapid Transit] (then HRT) was allowed to
              operate the Harbourvale Line using DMUs at that time. However, due
              to increasing congestion, the Harbourvale Line was rebuilt in late
              2008 in order to allow for construction for more houses.</p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale Line late 2008</strong></p>
              <p>In late 2008, sections of now unused tracks were abandoned and
              new tracks were laid to change the direction of the line.
              Generally, the line did not change much. Several old platforms were
              still utilised.</p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale Airport Express Line (now Airport Express
              Line)</strong></p>
              <p>After the opening of the new small airport, a short line was
              needed to connect the airport to the rest of the rapid transit
              system. As a result, the HAEL was constructed. Train services ran
              from the Airport and terminated at Chinatown. It was a branch
              line.</p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale Line 2009</strong></p>
              <p>Increasing population in the southern area of Harbourvale City
              forced the government to extend the line from Square Quays to
              Blackton Junction. Many services terminated at Square Quays and
              turned back to serve the southern part of the line. Ridership
              increased too.</p>
              <p><strong>2010 MAP</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i868.photobucket.com/albums/ab247/nickgoh45/openBVE/hlmap-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale Line 2010</strong></p>
              <p>In early 2010, the government decided to tear down the whole
              line one last time and rebuild it again. This was to allow for
              construction of elevated sections to allow for more "open"
              stations. The government also allowed more special stations to be
              built. The designs of the stations were now more diverse and
              unique. The line began to operate fully again in May 2010. Though
              this line was the only line operating in HBV City, interchange
              details were made into the announcements to allow for other
              lines.</p>
              <p><strong>Airport Express Line 2010</strong></p>
              <p>The airport in the northern district was demolished and a new
              larger airport was built in East Harbour. The new line Airport
              Express Line was thus built to connect the airport to the rest of
              the system. Construction is completed and the line is open to the
              public. HCRT was awarded the line's tender.</p>
              <p><strong>Blackton Line</strong></p>
              <p>As the eastern and western parts of the city grew, the
              government announced the Blackton Line to be built and operated by
              HCRT. Completion dates are unknown.</p>
              <p><strong>Evergreen Fields Line</strong></p>
              <p>Although HCRT was supposed to begin operations on this line
              by 2008, the line was abandoned due to flaws in signalling and the
              land that the line was built on sank tremendously. HLRT
              (Harbourvale Light Rail Transport) bidded for the new line and won
              the bid originally, but due to financial problems (in reality, it's
              lack of time.), the line was given up to
              HCRT.  Construction has temporarily stopped.</p>
              <p><strong>Coastal Sands Line</strong></p>
              <p>As there was a "blank spot" between City Line and Airport
              Express Line, the Coastal Sands Line was supposed to help
              passengers get from Coney Island (Yes, you heard it. It's
              called Coney Island) to East Harbour quicker. HMRT was awarded
              the line's tender. Construction is still ongoing.</p>
              <p><strong>Kegstone Line</strong></p>
              <p>There was not much a need to build this line, until Caroye began
              tremendous developement. HCRT was awarded this line's tender.
              Construction has started. WTC is the official contractor of the
              line.</p>
              <p><strong>North West Line</strong></p>
              <p>This line was supposed to serve the western district of the
              city, allowing an alternative for passengers to transfer to the KS,
              BL and LR lines. HLRT was awarded the line's tender originally, but
              due to financial problems (refer to above for the phrase meaning),
              the line was given up to HCRT. Construction is ongoing.</p>
              <p><strong>City Line</strong></p>
              <p>Much like the Circle Line in Singapore, this line is
              basically... a circle. However, due to underdevelopement in several
              areas of the coastal areas, this line was delayed. HLRT eventually
              won the bid.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>LRT
              Lines</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><strong>District LRT Line</strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not to be confused
              with Harbourvale City Light Rail</span></em></p>
              <p>Due to the high population in Evergreen Fields and Lakeview, a
              light rail line was planned to serve the estates around the MRT
              stations. Thus, this line serves as a link between the HBV Line and
              NWL. HRTA originally received the line's tender, but due to
              financial problems, the line was given up to HCRT.</p>
              <p>This line was originally called the Light Rail Line as it was
              intended to be the only light rail line in Harbourvale City, but
              eventually due to change of plans, the line was renamed to the
              District LRT Line.</p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale City Light Rail</strong></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not to be confused
              with Light Rail Line</span></em></p>
              <p>As the lines serving the CBD of Harbourvale are not enough to
              cope with the high demands of passengers, a light rail line in the
              CBD was planned. Starting at Kegstone and ending at Monument, this
              line brings commuters closer to the places they want to go. NRTC
              received this line's tender. Construction for this line is
              ongoing.</p>
              <p><strong>Resort Island Line</strong></p>
              <p>An island off the shores of Harbourvale City has become a
              tourist attraction. Currently people need to travel here by boat,
              but by 2011(reality), a new line would connect(in reality, it's
              released) both places to allow passengers another alternative to
              travelling. Tendering for this line has not taken place.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trains</span></strong></p>
              <p>Trains running on the above mentioned lines used SMRT spare
              trains to run the services. However, this often proved unreliable
              due to the fact that some trains are not in revenue service for
              repairs in depots. Finally, after numerous complaints on the lack
              of trains, a tender was listed out, and the C100A was born. Its
              specifications and design was provided by the Harbourvale
              government.</p>
              <p><strong>C100A</strong></p>
              <p> The first of its kind, the C100A is the very first train
              to be built specially for Harbourvale City. With an orange stripe
              running through the whole length of the train, the train will run
              on the Harbourvale Line. The seats are all the HCRT's livery, with
              orange being the front and back carriages seats' colour, red being
              the second and fifth carriages seats' colour and black being the
              two middle carriages seats' colour. 23 trainsets were purchased and
              is currently using ATS. ATO is still being implemented on the
              train. More details will be revealed soon.</p>

              <p><br>I doubt so.. If there is a railway station, people will start to expect a Regional Line. Which will usually be long journey, maybe boring and will take a long period of time to develope.</p>

              Rapid Transit (LRT) system</strong></p>
              <p>Refer to the thread <em><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/3146/topics/399578">[OT For fun] History of OpenBVE Singapore MRT And
              LRT system</a></em> for this chapter...</p>
              <p><strong>The beginning of a whole new rapid system in
              2008</strong></p>
              <p>In 2007, the government of Harbourvale City was convinced that
              they needed a new metro rapid system. The roads were becoming
              increasingly congested and citizens complained of the terrible air
              quality. Thus, the government saw the need of a straight line
              linking the northern part of the city to the CBD. As a result, the
              Harbourvale Line began construction and was completed in 2008. The
              line was a one-track system, due to space constraints and several
              other problems.</p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale Line 2008</strong></p>
              <p>HCRT [Harbourvale City Rapid Transit] (then HRT) was allowed to
              operate the Harbourvale Line using DMUs at that time. However, due
              to increasing congestion, the Harbourvale Line was rebuilt in late
              2008 in order to allow for construction for more houses.</p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale Line late 2008</strong></p>
              <p>In late 2008, sections of now unused tracks were abandoned and
              new tracks were laid to change the direction of the line.
              Generally, the line did not change much. Several old platforms were
              still utilised. [...]</p>
              <p><strong>[...] Harbourvale Line 2009</strong></p>
              <p>Increasing population in the southern area of Harbourvale City
              forced the government to extend the line from Square Quays to
              Blackton Junction. Many services terminated at Square Quays and
              turned back to serve the southern part of the line. Ridership
              increased too.</p>

              <p><strong>Harbourvale Line 2010</strong></p>
              <p>In early 2010, the government decided to tear down the whole
              line one last time and rebuild it again. This was to allow for
              construction of elevated sections to allow for more "open"
              stations. The government also allowed more special stations to be
              built. The designs of the stations were now more diverse and
              unique. The line began to operate fully again in May 2010. Though
              this line was the only line operating in HBV City, interchange
              details were made into the announcements to allow for other
              lines.</p>
