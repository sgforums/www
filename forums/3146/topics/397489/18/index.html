              <p><br>There are reasons why I'm not letting you develop the C591. The first reason is that, you are working on a C851A yourself, and I think you need time to get that train up to the high expectations and standards of BVESG. Your train is still relatively undeveloped, and there are many areas of improvement. The C591 is a rather huge project and you may not be able to cope with that many projects on hand.</p>
              <p>The second reason I'm not letting you develop this, is because I have not personally tried train building. We shouldn't be doing one aspect of routebuilding all the time, we should be all-rounders.</p>
              <p>The third reason is that if I let you develop, we have to communicate a lot between each other. This way, I can get a train developed according to my desired specifications. For example, I have to ensure that you know the exact length of the train doors, otherwise if the doors do not match the PSDs, I will complain and then you will say, "Aww I did my best!" and then an argument ensues. You are seldom online on Facebook, so it is extremely hard to communicate. I don't read my emails very often, so if you have any queries that you sent through email to my inbox, I may only reply in a week's time. Besides, a lot of the specifications of the train have not been officially confirmed, so there is no use disturbing me for this project.</p>
              <p>It's not that I'm selfish or arrogant, but I sincerely hope you'll understand why I won't allow you to undertake this project.</p>
              <p>P.S. I deleted your comment as I believe that it is rather offensive and you really shouldn't use caps or exclaimation marks in your comments against somebody.</p>
