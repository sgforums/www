              What do you mean? Some things have changed. The changelog is as follows:
              1. "Boulevard" has changed to "Stadium". "North Coast" has changed to "South Coast".
              2. The announcements have been recorded again to support future lines. "Doors closing" has also been added!
              3. Stadium and Square Quays have been restructured and structured respectively. 
              4. Maps of the system have been added.
              5. Signals have been added from University to Harbourvale.
              6. Exit signs were added at Central and Stadium.
              
              Yup, I think that's about it...

              From what I know, most errors come from the addon for routebuilder (sign creator). Tell the user who PMed you not to worry. If he/she is extremely upset or worried about it, I can personally redo the signs, but that means I have to reupload it again. I understand that the command for the signs were "Builder" instead of "CreateMeshBuilder".

              No, it does not affect the route in anyway. I can fix the "builder" command but I don't think I can fix the dummy signal.

              <p>I am not sure of the details... I can't seem to find it. I think that dummy signals are obviously signals that are placed in the Routebuilder library but they do not have the .bmp files. Why they are there, I'm not sure?</p>

              <p>Look, in pure Singapore lines, the North East Line, got all 4 languages announcements for the "Please mind the platform gap" and English + Chinese for the station announcements (Excluding the Interchange details), so your point is invalid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And whatsmore is that Nickgoh45 is creating a Harbourvale line, a fusion of Singapore MRT, London Underground / Tube (University station) , New York Subway (Blackton Junction etc), Hong Kong MTR (University station again --- it is used in both subway systems ---- noted by joeyfjj and Central station) etc.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, we must take that into consideration. In short YOUR POINT IS INVALID.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Final verdict: Keep as much language announcements as possible.</p>
