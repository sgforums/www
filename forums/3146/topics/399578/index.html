Ever since the USSR and the JR Group expanded the route to Pasir Ris, The Soon Transit had officially came into the picture by combing the strength in 2010 May 3 with the main construction focus on the station's interiors, tracks and viaduct. It had further strength itself with the involvement of the Habbohotel Group in 2010 May 5. On 24 May 2010, WTC and Chris Vehicle Consortium (CVC) had further pooled in efforts to the EWL team. With a sudden increase of number of co-developers, the EWL team is confident to be the fastest developing team, and the next step is to complete the entire line within 6 months from now.</p>

              <p><strong>16/5/2010</strong>: Currently, the line is going through re-tender as the planner, JTC, has shelved the plan. If the re-tender is unsuccessful, there is a high chance the plan would be fully shelved, until someone is able to revive the plan. This is because JTC has already planned a new line and construction is already underway, despite the name of the line has yet to be finalized.</p>
              <p><strong>Circle Line<br></strong>Soon after the completion of various EWL / NSL sectors, the CCL was announced by the openBVE government on 19 Apr 2010 to be the next to be constructed in order to bring convenience to the residents in Mountbatten, MacPherson, Serangoon and Bishan which provides a direct link to the CBD areas such as Stadium, Nicoll Highway, Marina Centre (Esplanade) and Dhoby Ghaut. It can also bring convience to other commuters who can have a much nearer MRT station than existing EWL / NSL stations, such as Bras Basah, Esplanade and Promenade. The first sector will only cover the CBD areas starting from Dhoby Ghaut and ends at Stadium is expected to be completed by End of June 2010 with the extension towards Tai Seng, Marymount in subsequent phases, which can then really benefit the above mentioned areas. By 2011, it will be extended further from Marymount towards Harbourfront to look like a partially circle (Not a completed full closed circle) and another further extension by 2012 will start from Marina Bay to Promenade in order to start the inital phase for closing the remaining "holes" in order to make Circle line a real circle. The Circle Line's tender was won in a joint bid form by SBS Engineering Coporation and Wee Transit Corporation.</p>
              <p>Due to some technical problems. The work for Circle Line was postponed till December 2010. However, Wee Transport Coporation announced that it will open the line till Paya Lebar instead of Stadium. Together with SBS Engineering, the work with the C830 rolling stock and Circle Line will be released together.</p>

With the addition of this train type, all of the EWL / NSL rolling stocks are completed and the next on the order list is C151A, which is cater for future Tuas Extension / JEMP.<strong></strong></p>
              <p>However, openBVE government does not stop at EWL (CGL) / NSL. It has also expanding on NEL and CCL, which means new rolling stocks are needed as well.</p>
              <p>For the NEL, the C751A was chosen as the rolling stock and the tender contract was won by Kenneth Foundation of Consortium (KFC) by VTC, Kenneth Transit of Millennium (KTM) and  USSR, with no expected timeframe for such delivery at the moment.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the rolling stock for CCL is C830, which is a joint venture by SBS Engineering Coporation and  Wee Transit Coporation (WTC). The construction of the C830s will only be officially started at June 2010.</p>
