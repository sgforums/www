              <p>To add on, its all about the coding whether to
                  determine where the trains go and to stop at stations. For example,
                  it is possible for trains to go at eastbound track for westbound.
                  But I have tried to change the coding at the point where reaching
                  AMK to go to southbound track instead of middle track at JUR-BSH
                  route and failed! But it will be nice to have to have switches in
                  OpenBVE like in real life!</p>

              <p>BL4 is probably still under construction like NE2 or NS6, NS12. As in maybe just a station box like CC18 (soon to be) , not open for passenger service.</p>

              <p><br>Well. Usually when there's a station missing, it means that the station is not even built yet. It is just a spacing for future stations. You don't see any stations Between NS5 and NS7 nor NS11 and NS13.</p>

              <p><br>The reason why Woodleigh was closed is because it is not a very commercial area. SBST Concluded operating trains to Woodleigh will just waste money. When the school near Woodleigh opens, Woodleigh Station Will Finally Be Opened. Be aware it was built in a cemetry area, which LTA dug up.</p>

              <p><br>BL4 is a future station on the Blackton Line. Its working name is FountainMall, but it's likely to be changed anyway. LOL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The station is not open along the rest of the line due to the reason that it's located in a relatively undeveloped district. As the name suggests, it's located right next to a future shopping mall, there will be quick connection to the mall from the station concourse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The interesting thing about this station is that it's both at-grade and underground, located two levels below the grass, trees, flowers, creepy crawlies and whatever. Upon leaving BL3 Benoi, the tracks will descend and eventually reach the point in which the tracks are two levels below the surrounding ground. Then you'll enter a tunnel and immediately reach the station. After leaving the station, it'll be total underground sections all the way through the City Centre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The station's basic structure has already been completed. The platforms will, however, be kept from passengers' view when trains pass the station using temporary thin concrete walls. The station will be opened in 2012 latest.</p>

              <p>Nickgoh45, since you are the developer of HBV line, AEL and NWL, why not make a HTARIS for trains plying these lines? (Note: if this is too confusing, I meant that each train ply one line, and it is with the STARIS for that line.)</p>

              <p>The station is not open along the rest of the line due to the

              <p> </p>
              <p>The interesting thing about this station is that it's both
              at-grade and underground, located two levels below the grass,
              trees, flowers, creepy crawlies and whatever. Upon leaving BL3
              Benoi, the tracks will descend and eventually reach the point in
              which the tracks are two levels below the surrounding ground. Then
              you'll enter a tunnel and immediately reach the station.
              After leaving the station, it'll be total underground sections all
              the way through the City Centre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The station's basic structure has already been completed.
              The platforms will, however, be kept from passengers'
              view when trains pass the station using temporary thin
              concrete walls. The station will be opened in 2012 latest.</p>
