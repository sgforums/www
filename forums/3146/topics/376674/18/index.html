              <p>Alamak, I meant I planned and doing C651 first. What password you need? Well, all you need to develop a route / train is to equip with</p>
              <p>1: OpenBVE (The one that players plays on!)</p>
              <p><strong>2</strong>: ObjectViewer (Useful on developing train by fitting the interiors, the seats etc. Useful for developing routes such as EWL, NSL, CCL or fictional ones etc by viewing each object such as the station inclusive of but not limited to (HH)PSD, RATIS, faregates, benches / roof - ceiling etc design of the station architecture)</p>
              <p><strong>3a</strong>: Routeviewer (Obviously, it is used only when developing a route so as to see the route itself, how curve should a curve? Where a crossover at / and the crossover type [By declaring a new rail intersecting with your main line rail. Nope. Crossover are for show only unless ur main line is using the crossover such as the one released by "The Soon" for PSR - SIM route (But not on PSR - BGS as the development earlier by me did not expect The Soon's route will be using the left platform on PSR. It MIGHT be done at a later time / last stage of development)].</p>
              <p>3b: Train Editor (Obviously, it is used only when developing a train such as controlling the weight of train, the motor sounds, the number of power / brake notchs etc. I didnt use it personally before.)</p>
              <p>Note for the ones in bold (As known as 2 and 3a sector.):</p>
              <p>You will need to own a <strong>Text Editor</strong> such as Notepad in Windows (Other OS should have a similar application to <strong>handcode</strong> it but without the above 2 development tools) while using the utilities (Route / Object viewer) to view the changes you have made because you cannot make changes in a viewer utility and hence the name.</p>

              <p>Quite lo soh huh, well, to keep it short, it means you need to handcode using <strong>Notepad </strong>(Windows) and view your changes in <em>ObjectViewer</em> / <em>Routeviewer</em> (Anything that is not creating a route, then goes to Objectviewer. Again windows only tool).</p>
              <p>You need <em>OpenBVE</em> to play the game and see the "real effect" (OT: See my latest post on C651. I am sick of it and decided to stick measurements with Objectviewer instead of OpenBVE until further notice. Hence, you may see weird gaps / holes etc.)</p>
              <p><em>Train Editor</em> is only used during developing of trains' characteristics. (Train motor sound, weight of train etc)</p>
              <p><em>Object Bender</em> is a new tool that I have included in the Dummies package if i am not wrong (I have just updated it and a new dummy release will be on new C651s and new EWLs (Possibly NSL) as well as some Harbourvale related routes.) but I have no idea on how to use it. (It is a <strong>NEW</strong> tool)</p>
