              <p>Well, but a computer usually comes with a better graphics which the laptop cant do due to heat / battery consumption consideration on the go. With a lousier graphics on laptop, it usually wont do well for (open)BVE even if you have a 64bit OS (4GB RAM + Intel Core 2 Duo or similar class 64bit CPU. PS: Under 4GB RAM still can have 64bit OS so long as with a 64bit CPU but does not take advantage of 64bit computing that handles more RAM.), which is happening to me where I self-pwned the EWL is lagging especially Bugis - Raffles Place due to advanced tunneling and TBM style in between CTH - RFP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eh, I advertise my own work progress le. :D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, a bigger HDD can indeed store more routes and trains, but if your computer / laptop is lagging like hell, what the hell you get a better HDD to store these high quality routes when you cannot enjoy them well? (I know HDD free space can be used for swap memory, as known as a "replacement" or a proper term, virtual memory, but that is slower than real RAM which is not very good for HDD anyway.)</p>

              <p><br>No wonder you take so long to reply to posts. In conclusion, a computer is possibly better than the laptop, you promote your routes in your posts and you should get a bigger memory space or RAM instead of buying a HDD. Either that or upgrade your graphics card. Idk. I'm confused...</p>

              <p>Well, I find one thing interesting:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While there is little progress on real life projects such as C151 or C751B or EWL or NSL (Except recently) all the while, I am lost on fictional lines, partially there are more than 1 fictional city and I am not sure if their rolling stock / lines have released.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can any kind soul summarize the happenings on these fictional cities as part of my plan to release a new version of OpenBVE for Dummies (Note: That dummy pack so far is almost 200MB, unlike a train such as C651, it is impossible for me to keep that as archive, consider that more lines and rolling stocks are coming up, with even better quality objects to existing lines, it is matter of time that this dummy pack has to split into multiple archive or so.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>New plan: I may release a new version of dummy pack every half a year or so starting from the next release (Prefably December and June, where it is my vacations), where I read it as a summary of the progress over the 6 months in the BVESG world.</p>

              <p><br>Those who are complete dummies who always ask questions and completely no knowledge of OpenBVE at all.. The other is for people who already know how to use OpenBVE and What OpenBVE Is. Only Want to download the SG Routes and Trains but donno how..

              <p><br>But this is transferring to another line.It is something similar to Paya Lebar station.Example:Pretend South Coast is Paya Lebar.You want to transfer to CCL.Paya Lebar EWL is aboveground same goes to South Coast HBV line.You just need to take the escalator/lift to the CCL since CCL is underground same goes to South Coast NWL it is underground sn station.So,in conclusion,South Coast station resembles the same transferring of lines like Paya Lebar station.Isn't it the same???Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
