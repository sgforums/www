              <p>U Do NOT need an pre-existing C151 train to work and Willis did mentioned that his testing version of a new release (Presumely 0.7), which I have no access of (Since I am not yet a developer, currently tested by the developers) has inclusive of such mods.</p>

              <p>Thanks joey, but</p>
              <p><strong>.sta EW6 Kembangan;12.3317;T;;1;;;;23;;;0</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>seemed that the above code will solve the problem, given 12.3317 is the arrival time, T seemed to be Terminus and the 1 ,23, 0 means what then??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Because I am developing Bedok - Aljunied route, now Stage 1 focused on Bedok - Eunos which created a lot of problems on passenger discomfort (Especially Kembangan - Eunos which has more curves than Bedok - Kembangan sector).</p>
              <p>1 of such problem is the above mentioned of complete stop also result into this mess.</p>
              <p>This is why I "downgrade" it to Bedok - Kembangan to ensure that the terminus is designed correctly first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in summary such passenger discomfort can be caused by (Without any particular order):</p>
              <p>1: Inappropirate driving skill by users / players (Should not happen on Developers)</p>
              <p>2: Sharp curves with high speed (P2 also leh, hard to explain high speed)</p>
              <p>3: Passengers ratio is quite high, meaning too crowded train, probably some people almost / already kiapped or similar</p>
              <p>And the solution is:</p>
              <p>1: Get a guide how to drive a train</p>
              <p>2: Increase the radius and cant, by using .curve 1000;7 as example</p>
              <p>3: Decrease the passenger ratio, using the above code in bold, is the 23 is the passenger ratio?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do add more if I missed a thing, and edit if things got wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ironically, it seemed that passengers will discomfort, when developer does not put a T as above in terminus, probably there are passengers in the train on terminus (Do Not Board) which.........??</p>

              <p>I remeber I read about a default 25m of redraw somewhere, which can be changed in some code. I wonder what is that command and just to confirm can that be changed in sectors (Example, when some station are position at 4815, which is clearly not divisible by 25m given default, by defining 4840, 4865 etc as station objects will cause the screen shown in openBVE weird ("Empty station", cannot see the roof and floor etc) and my work around is define .sta and station objects in 4815 and define station objects again in 4825, 4850 instead of 4840,4865 and the problem is the length of the station seemed a bit too long than other stations) ?</p>

              <p>Thanks, but the exisitng codes have +/- 25m (Using round off way). I may try it on future extensions / when things have completed to iron out things (But does not work for BVE4.....)</p>

              <p>Thanks joey, but</p>
              <p><strong>.sta EW6 Kembangan;12.3317;T;;1;;;;23;;;0</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>seemed that the above code will solve the problem, given 12.3317
              is the arrival time, T seemed to be Terminus and the 1 ,23, 0 means
              what then??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Because I am developing Bedok - Aljunied route, now Stage 1
              focused on Bedok - Eunos which created a lot of problems on
              passenger discomfort (Especially Kembangan - Eunos which has more
              curves than Bedok - Kembangan sector).</p>
              <p>1 of such problem is the above mentioned of complete stop also
              result into this mess.</p>
              <p>This is why I "downgrade" it to Bedok - Kembangan to ensure that
              the terminus is designed correctly first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in summary such passenger discomfort can be caused by
              (Without any particular order):</p>
              <p>1: Inappropirate driving skill by users / players (Should not
              happen on Developers)</p>
              <p>2: Sharp curves with high speed (P2 also leh, hard to explain
              high speed)</p>
              <p>3: Passengers ratio is quite high, meaning too crowded train,
              probably some people almost / already kiapped or similar</p>
              <p>And the solution is:</p>
              <p>1: Get a guide how to drive a train</p>
              <p>2: Increase the radius and cant, by using .curve 1000;7 as
              example</p>
              <p>3: Decrease the passenger ratio, using the above code in bold,
              is the 23 is the passenger ratio?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do add more if I missed a thing, and edit if things got
              wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ironically, it seemed that passengers will discomfort, when
              developer does not put a T as above in terminus, probably there are
              passengers in the train on terminus (Do Not Board)
              which.........??</p>
