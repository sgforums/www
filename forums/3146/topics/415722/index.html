              <p>With the recent increase in the number of fictional routes and trains, the developing standard of SGBVE has greatly decreased. Therefore, it is important to set some basic guidelines to ensure that new routes and trains meet our 'high' developing standards.</p>

              <p>I would suggest a type of grading system with increased difficulty of accomplishment on a scale of one to ten. To better understand my meaning, here's an example.</p>
              <p>Level One: Basic track and platform objects are in, with no scenery in the route. The basic skeleton is completed.<br>Level Two: Basic track, platform, tunnel and/or viaduct objects are in, with very little scenery in the route. The skeleton of the route is completed and finalised and there are curves.<br>Level Three: Basic track, platform, tunnel and/or viaduct objects are in, with some scenery in the route. There are some platform objects, with (a) proper background(s) for the whole route. <br>Level Four: Basic track, platform, tunnel and/or viaducts objects are in, with quite a lot of scenery in the route. Every platform has objects on it, there may be some simple roofing object for stations done up.<br>Level Five: Basic track, platform, tunnel and/or viaducts objects are in, with quite a lot of scenery in the route. Every platform has objects on it, there may be more complex roofing objects for stations done up. The .station command is edited fully and meets the developer's wishes.<br>Level Six: Basic track, platform, tunnel and/or viaducts objects are in, with quite impressive scenery in the route. Every platform has objects on it, the roofs are complex, and the station layout is realistic and believable. There are some miscellaneous commands used by the route like .buffer and .doppler, which signify the developer is putting all these to good use.<br>Level Seven: Track, platform, tunnel and/or viaducts objects are in, with impressive scenery in the route. Every platform has objects on it, the roofs are complex, and the station layout is realistic and believable. Every command that is used in the route is necessary and not redundant. There are very few errors in rendering and most object commands are properly used.<br>Level Eight: Track, platform, tunnel and/or viaducts objects are in, with impressive scenery in the route. Every station is modelled accurately according to the developer's plans. Every command that is used in the route is necessary and not redundant. There are almost no errors in rendering (1-2 errors at most) and all object commands are properly used.<br>Level Nine: Track, platform, tunnel and/or viaducts objects are in, with impressive scenery in the route. Every station is modelled accurately according to the developer's plans. Every command that is used in the route is necessary and not redundant. There are no errors in rendering (1-2 errors at most) and all object commands are properly used. In-train announcements are in the route (unless your route is a <strong>long-distance</strong> type of fictional route.)<br>Level Ten: The route has been fully completed and is as of standards of non-fictional routes. The degree of realism is extremely high. Your route has almost no more room for improvement.<br><br>Any route that makes it to level three can be released to developers and moderators to try out, and any route that makes it to level six can be released to public. This is one of my suggestion. :)</p>

              <p>Lol, the current EWL PSR - BGS, is about at level 9 since Track, platform, tunnel and/or viaducts objects are in (I know the objects to approaching tunnel is not there yet), except impressive scenery and station is not realistic enough (Due to the cylinder shape may cause lagginess and cant be bothered to try them) and my codes are <strong>absolute free of errors</strong> except when the announcements file are not ready, which usually will be commented out.</p>
