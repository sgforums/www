              <p>Unless you got my development files for EWL, you have to hack or rather change it for your own purpose as I did to Willis (The FHPSD is initally his one, where later modified certain images that only exists in CGA and not in EWL's underground).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is not a route file, or an update to EWL route. Right now, just get the official March 15 EWL from BDK - ALJ. While I wont say it is perfect, but it shows a preview of it. The next release could be as early as end of April or can be as late as end of June, something which I have not decided at the moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, unless you intend to develop something (Not necessary a route), the objects here does not make a value to you.</p>

              <p>Theoritically, adding them is not a problem to me. BUT, the texture and how to code a cuboid is a really a challenge to me. If you could code that object, then I will be more happy to integrate them into it.</p>

              <p>BTW, the above object is EXPECTED to have another update or two, which will have the following corrections (No particular order):</p>
              <p>1: Remove unnecessary depature sounds from the test suite routes. (Some are carelessly left out)</p>
              <p>2: Renumber the PSDs, currently the numbering is based solely on the current rail 0 for simplistic sake. It will change to based on each platform HW / TW. So that takes time to figure out. (There is a purpose for doing so, see point 5)</p>
              <p>3: Adding Emergency Exit direction desto</p>
              <p>4: Adding placeholder for direction details destos. It will be the same as the terminus destos (Like what is seen as "To X -&gt;"), but actually, in fact it is in every alternate PSDs will have the route details instead of all PSDs are Terminus destos. It takes time for me to create them, consider that each stations uses a different ones. So I will on hold that.</p>
              <p>5: Adding what Joey has pointed out, the lack of cuboids (Only 1st gen PSDs got) -- But lack of high quality image and other factors, it will take time.</p>

              <p>Basically this object is ready to release, with the exception of Point 5. It needs more time to research in order to create it. The numbering are all now fixed and the emergency exit destos are placed correctly for all directions (From LAV - RFP, where Island Platform, is actually LAV &amp; BGS, given that both of such details are the same.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do note that things like Esclator, Lifts, Emergency Stop Plunger, CCTV, in - station destos, Emergency exit sign board on top of each doors, complete walls with the look &amp; feel and passengers view board (The one rectangle board having the top as the destination, and the travel time one) are not intended to included in the meanwhile. Tiles, more correct design of the 1G PSD can be included, but I have a lack of such image. Note: Tiles can be quite tricky because it is impossible to have a photograph that shows the entire station length, and partial photograph have proven tricky to merge them one by one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, my intention of putting such PSD, is to faciliate the start of coding of underground stations with the more tricky and important / essential ones that affects the core functionality done.</p>

              <p>I see, thanks. Due to lazy nature in the past, this had inevitably bitten me. I have solved this issue, and today have successfully created a 1G PSD light object.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, with the help of Willis Chong, on the function on the on / off lights (Becoz I just merely retrieve code from Willis' original PSD light in CGA is not sufficient.), I am installing them gradually.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hopefully, by tomorrow, I can complete all becoz on Apr 19 (2010), is my school (poly) reopens, which means I have to do Final Year Project, and the project have to halted down considerably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will try to do this by order:</p>
              <p>1: Finish up this station object as last update (AND FINAL, so dont ask for better interior or lifts / esclators / CCTV / Emergency Stop plunger etc.......)</p>
              <p>2: Integrate existing PSR - BDK U/C sector to BDK - BGS sector and release it.</p>
              <p>3: Integrate JCQH's C651's patch and spin off to other trains (you will see the new train number, permission granted from Jcqh)</p>
              <p>4: Integrate The Soon's advanced stuffs such as thrid rail, standard gauge. (Considering to make this as a spin off, can be a variant of the EWL route. Stay tuned.)</p>

              <p>Alas! Completed one such. Now the to-dos on this object:</p>
              <p>1: Change the glass screen onto the correct one (It was using a CGA one)</p>
              <p>2: Change the internal doors onto correct one (Damn hard to photograph one, scare my only phone dropped onto the tracks)</p>
