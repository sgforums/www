              <p>But isnt Willis developed the underground section -- CGA? I think it isnt that difficult, in fact it is <em>easier</em> due to the fact that there is nothing about scenry except the station adverts? Yes, you cannot see the track layout clearly (Except NEL) but I think developers can do guess work by refering to Street Directory right? (The real difficulty apart of station insides such as Esclators / PSDs which also applies to overground is that the height of the stations. Some stations located at B2 while others at B1 and few even at B4 / B5. How to set the correct depth is another issue.)</p>

              <p>I suggest one thing, if you really cannot wait, then try to develop Joo Koon - Chinese Garden. The only tricky part is about the train curves when approaching / departing stations as well as crossovers in Joo Koon, Boon Lay and Lakeside. Jurong East is damn difficult and I know that the NSL developers are trying to develop and Clementi is already released up to Queenstown.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other thing I agree with Veryon is that the C951 train is a Downtown line train, which is under construction. So unless you have / are a some worker / rail manager / LTA personnel, I doubt you will know the track diagrams (Still possible to find on net) and all the other details. In theory, this train can be deployed in Circle due to the fact that both are standard gauge, and both use 3rd rail with CTBC (Instead of EWL / NSL's traditional ATC) which is an automated train.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, in personal capacity, I disagree with the developers saying that because this is automated train so pointless to make one because</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1:) EWL &amp; NSL neither are they fully manual. They are semi-auto train such that it just needed a person to look after the train at all times but probably in usual day &amp; time, no peak hour, no fault / technical glitch and bad weather as well as construction or certain incidents like suicides and smoke coming from "some industrial accident" somewhere, they probably just sit there and do nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2:) Even in NEL, CCL, DTL and future CTBC lines (All lines in future will be fully automated), there are times where it happens technical glitch or whatever that needs someone to drive manually. Nowadays it seemed like all CTBC train are equipped with a staff not only to prevent "joker" like me who did mount and board a train to Bartley TBS twice and unsuccessfully trying to board test train towards Dhoby Ghaut a few days ago in Bartley or some terrorists but also to adjust PA system (I did have a few photos in NEL but as my phone has lost, all is gone), and some other thing the staff has looked which I am not sure what is it for (Sure, out of scope for [Open]BVE, but my point is they must be prepared to CM train at anytime, just like those Nepalese police are ready to fight and die for Singapore at anytime). Hence, maybe the developers can still do it but at a later stage, and I still think that it should be done.</p>
