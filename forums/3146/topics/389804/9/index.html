              <p>I think the HHPSD, not at the moment, even if the NSL also mentioned that before. His EB from Clementi - Queenstown (Commonwealth) does not have underground sectors and thus no PSDs.</p>

              <p>Anyway, for mine PSR - BGS, only LAV &amp; BGS got FHPSD (Initally not planned, but later managed to add) and other stations do not have HHPSD either, coz I decided to assume as Pre HHPSD era.</p>

              <p>Later stages. More important is the skeletion route in passenger service one. I know roughly how to do, or if you want, join us to develop, maybe EWL (Ask me on Eastern part of EWL or Veyron for Western part of EWL because that is what we did on the respective EWL sectors) or NSL (Ask jerry, joey or flip) , depend on your preference lor. I think the CGL is rougly completed, since there are only 2 stations and a skeletion for the whole sector is already done, ready to be released @ 21 Apr 2010 IF there are no major problems such as the actual event for the "Intended April Fool Joke" (If that were to happen, should it be called as "You reap what you sow"?? Lol!).</p>

              <p>Yes, I planned that. But it will be first Pasir Ris to Outram Park. I expect that will be the next after the upcoming release (PSR - BGS)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With that, I may want to release an LTE package. Lol! Stay tuned :D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, actually the first train coming out from depot for LTE starts from CLE to ALJ and TNM - OTP depending which depot is the train coming out from. I may prioritize do that then a classic ALJ - OTP</p>

              <p><strong>History of OpenBVE Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) And Light
                                      Rapid Transit (LRT) system</strong><br> The 2000s was an era of great technical changes for the world of
                                      train simulation. The leaders of the train fans world across the
                                      world were convinced of the need to create a train simulation that
                                      not just focused on arcade gaming side which often at the expensive
                                      of realism, but also support it with a realistic and accurate
                                      technical details to support the world of train simulation.</p>
              <p>To this end, Takashi Kojima (Mackoy) had commissioned a project
                                      called BVE (Boso View Express TrainSim) in 2000 to create the
                                      initial possibility of realistic train simulation game. Amongst
                                      others, the initial product pointed such to a possibility for such
                                      realism rail transit system. As a result, it has developed with
                                      Version 2 and 4 of BVE in year 2001 and 2005 respectively with the
                                      third version were scrapped off due to development issues.</p>
              <p>Despite so, it does not feature support for train exteriors,
                                      animated 3D cab environments and animated scenery that led to a
                                      lack of cab ambiance and caused a minus point for realism. It is
                                      also not released under public domain which upsets some hobbyists.
                                      Thus, an independent team from Michelle in 2009 had stepped forward
                                      to reinforce the initial BVE for a rail simulation that features
                                      those aforementioned features that was not present in BVE. It was
                                      named as OpenBVE.</p>
              <p><br> <strong>2009 - The Work Began</strong><br> In 2009, as the Singapore government in the world of train
                                      simulation had still not implemented a MRT system, thus the MRT
                                      system in the world of train simulation was in turn become a BTO
                                      (Built To Order) scheme. Hence, BVESG community was formed which is
                                      led by Willis Chong and Wenjie who had also formed WCVP (Willis
                                      Chong Video Production) Consortium that gives the go-ahead due to
                                      the maturity of train simulation along with the demand of it is
                                      ever increasing and work on the construction of the openBVE MRT
                                      began. The countless time and effort was put in and targeted to be
                                      completed with fully realistic train simulation without a
                                      deadline.</p>
              <p>The 6 km-long route would boast 3 stations, of which 2 would be
                                      above ground and 1 underground. The Changi Airport Branch line was
                                      implemented first as businessmen need to be ferried across the busy
                                      Changi Airport and the Changi Business Park, which is located at
                                      Expo.</p>
              <p>On 21 July 2009, when its first section from Changi Airport to
                                      Expo was opened, thousands flocked to experience travelling on the
                                      MRT on a PC. The CEO for the WCVP Consortium, Mr Willis Chong¸
                                      officiated the launching of the BVE forum on 19 April 2009. The
                                      remainder of the system was opened in stages and the final section
                                      of Changi Airport Branch Line was completed in 21 April 2010.<br>  <br> <strong>North South Line</strong><br> In 7 July 2009, Jerry Transit Coporation announced its decision to
                                      extend the OpenBVE MRT system to Bukit Batok &amp; Choa Chu Kang.
                                      Work on this 4.6km extension was completed on 7 September 2009.
                                      With the new MRT extension up and running, commuters can now choose
                                      to take off on a fast train.<br>  <br> <strong>Woodlands Extension, Bishan Extension, Jurong East
                                      Extension</strong><br> In September 2009, Jerry Transit Consortium was formed along with
                                      Network Rail Transit System Limited (NRTS), whose CEO is Joey Foo
                                      and Matthew Rapid Transit Coporation (MRTC) which announced their
                                      decision to extend the OpenBVE MRT system beyond Choa Chu Kang, and
                                      goes through Woodlands, Sembawang New Town, Yishun New Town, Ang Mo
                                      Kio and Bishan Town. Provision plans to extend the North South Line
                                      to Jurong East was also conducted in March 2010.</p>
              <p>Work on this 26.2km extension was completed on 17 March 2010
                                      with the exception of Bishan. With the new MRT extension up and
                                      running, commuters can now choose to take off on a fast train to
                                      travel between the Western and Northern part of Singapore.<br>  <br> <strong>East West Line</strong><br> In 15 September 2009, The Soon Transit had announced the decision
                                      to further extend the OpenBVE MRT system eastwards, starting from
                                      Pasir Ris to Tanah Merah Station. This 6km extension will further
                                      enhance Eastern Region’s limited MRT connection of Changi Airport –
                                      Tanah Merah. However, the construction progress was not very smooth
                                      as compared to other lines and as of now, neither of the stations
                                      was opened to public yet.</p>
              <p>In 15 February 2010, Veyron Transit Coporation (VTC) by Jek had
                                      announced its decision to further extend the OpenBVE MRT system to
                                      Clementi &amp; Redhill, with the help of NRTS and Matthew Rapid
                                      Transit Coporation, both of them who have prior experience on
                                      Woodlands Extension. The first sector of the work on this 8km
                                      extension that covers Clementi to Commonwealth was completed on 21
                                      February 2010. The sector from Commonwealth was completed on 4 April 2010. With the new MRT extension up and running, commuters
                                      can now choose to take off on a fast train towards the South
                                      Western parts of Singapore. The other sectors of
                                      Redhill are expected to be opened by Late April or
                                      May respectively.</p>
              <p>Futhermore, on March 6 2010, the Union of Super Samuel Rail
                                      (USSR) had announced the decision to extend the OpenBVE MRT system
                                      from Bedok to Aljunied and more. With the reference of previous
                                      experience in NSL and VC's EWL, the initial 6.5km sector was
                                      completed March 14 2010. Also, the USSR had a joint venture with
                                      Jian Rong Group for future railway extensions such that provisions
                                      can be made to further extend the system Eastwards to Pasir Ris
                                      which allows people from Changi and Pasir Ris can have a direct
                                      transit connection to the busy CBD, which the construction has been
                                      halted down due to the technical challenging constraints.<br>  <br> <strong>Boon Lay Extension</strong><br> Although no formal announcement has made, it is widely expected
                                      that either Redhill section completed or Bugis / Pasir Ris sector
                                      had completed first, the next major extension estimated to be 8km
                                      will target on connecting Joo Koon, which is part of 3.8km Boon Lay
                                      Extension (Pioneer &amp; Joo Koon) to Clementi (Consists of Boon
                                      Lay, Lakeside, Chinese Garden, Jurong East and Clementi), to
                                      complete the Western part of the East West Line. The USSR has
                                      expressed itself in private that it hopes to see a completed EWL in
                                      someday future.</p>
              <p><strong>North Shore Line Extension</strong></p>
              <p><strong>19 March 2010, 10AM</strong></p>
              <p>Jerry Transit Coporation has started planning for a new route in
                                      the world of openBVE. The naming of the line and stations are under
                                      planning, but working name of the line has been announced, namely
                                      "North Shore Line Extension".</p>
              <p>With this new line, people coming back from Malaysia can hop
                                      onto the station near Woodlands Checkpoint, bringing them to
                                      shopping malls or more MRT lines to go to the city for
                                      sightseeing.</p>
              <p>The fare will be low and consistent for all stations, which is
                                      at SGD$1.20  The fare price may change as time goes.</p>
              <p><strong>North East Line, Bukit Panjang LRT, Sengkang &amp;
                                      Punggol LRT, Circle Line and beyond</strong></p>
              <p>It is widely expected that after the completion of the full
                                      initial MRT network that is 89 km-long route consisted of 56
                                      stations, where 40 would be above ground and 16 under ground, the
                                      next target would likely be North East Line (NEL), Circle Line
                                      (CCL), Bukit Pangjang LRT (BPLRT) as well as Sengkang &amp; Punggol
                                      LRT (SKPGLRT). All these rail lines will bring benefits to people
                                      in the North East (NEL, CCL and SKPGLRT), South West (CCL -- In
                                      Pasir Panjang &amp; Telok Blangah areas) and Bukit Panjang Town
                                      (BPLRT) region of the Singapore OpenBVE world. However, due to the
                                      number of population density in North East region (Notably Sengkang
                                      and Punggol) as well as Bukit Panjang is relatively low along with
                                      the lack of demands in certain portion of Circle Line (Notably
                                      Thomson and West Coast areas), priority to build such lines is low
                                      at the moment.</p>
              <p><strong>Rolling stock</strong></p>
              <p>The openBVE MRT government purchased 66 sets of the C151 trains.
                                      These are the oldest trains on the system, which have been running
                                      since the MRT system's inception in 17 September 2009, and are
                                      still in operation today. Originally, these trains were meant to
                                      operate of the North South Line and the Changi Airport Branch of
                                      the East West Line. However, with the expansion of the MRT network
                                      to the East West Line, more trains are required to ply on the
                                      lines. The C151 train contract was won by WCVP who will be
                                      responsible for building such trains.</p>
              <p>The openBVE MRT government then confirmed another order of 19
                                      sets of the second generation trains, the C651. The first C651
                                      arrived on the 19th of March 2010, reducing the commuters waiting
                                      time for a train. For this, WCVP did not participate in the bidding
                                      instead which had then the train contract had won by JVC (JCQH
                                      Vehicle Coporation) who will then be responsible for building C651
                                      trains. However, it seemed that JVC had the intention to transfer
                                      such tendership and thus a re-tender of C651 is a ongoing process.
                                      Currently, some of the companies interested in enhancing the
