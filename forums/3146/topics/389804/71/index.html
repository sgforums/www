              <p>Here are the Harbourvale Routes :D (Currently there's an IEL being developed by Dragon, so I suppose you could link both systems up or something? The line runs from HL6 Central to CG2 Changi Airport. Harbourvale City is 200-300km northeast of Singapore, in the sea. :P However there's no need to link up both if you dunwan) I'm using this as an official template for my documentations too.</p>
              <p>The lines are arranged in chronological order of line's official opening.</p>
              <p><strong>Harbourvale Line</strong></p>
              <p>Termini: HL1 Harbourvale, HL16 Blackton Junction (future: HL18 Lower Ends)<br>Rolling Stock: C100A<br>Depot(s): Square Quays Depot, District Depot<br>Length of line: 11km<br>Duration between termini: 21 minutes<br>Number of closed stations: Zero<br>Random Fact: The Harbourvale Line was the first line in the city to be opened! :D</p>
              <p><strong>Airport Express Line</strong></p>
              <p>Termini: AE1 Stadium, AE4 East Harbour<br>Rolling Stock: C100B<br>Depot(s): South Coast Depot<br>Length of line: 5km<br>Duration between termini: Approximately 10 minutes<br>Number of closed stations: Zero<br>Random Fact: The Airport Express Line was intended to be a branch from the Harbourvale Line.</p>
              <p><strong>North West Line </strong><em>[Under Construction]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: NW1 South Coast, NW10 City Square<br>Rolling Stock: C100A<br>Depot(s): Square Quays Depot, District Depot<br>Length of line: To-be-confirmed<br>Duration between termini: To-be-confirmed<br>Number of closed stations: Zero<br>Random Fact: The line was built under HLRT's supervision until HCRT took over, thus the monotonous designs from NW1 to NW6.</p>
              <p><strong>Blackton Line</strong> <em>[Under Construction]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: BL1 Townsville, BL13 Promenade<br>Rolling Stock: C591<br>Depot(s): Caroye Depot<br>Length of line: NIL<br>Duration between termini: NIL<br>Number of closed stations: One, BL4 <br>Random Fact: The tracks in this line never diverge and converge, they are always 8m apart from each other. The middle portion of the viaducts may be used for recreational purposes like a park along the tracks, obviously with fencing beside the tracks.</p>
              <p><strong>Evergreen Fields Line </strong><em>[Future]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: EF1 East Harbour, EF15 City Square<br>Rolling Stock: C100C<br>Depot(s): Lexington Depot<br>Length of line: NIL<br>Duration between termini: NIL<br>Number of closed stations: Two, EF2 Lexington and EF13 Town Hall<br>Random Fact: The current structure and route of the line was derived from an abandoned line with the same name. Old tracks can be found in the undeveloped Evergreen Parks district, 1km east of Evergreen Fields. Evergreen Parks was scheduled for extremely heavy developement and this district was supposed to take over Central as the city's CBD area, but plans were shelved after three newly built buildings collapsed in less than a month due to the marine clay in that area.</p>
              <p><strong>Kegstone Line </strong><em>[Future]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: KS1 Lowland, KS10 Gateway<br>Rolling Stock: C591<br>Depot(s): Caroye Depot<br>Length of line: NIL<br>Duration between termini: NIL<br>Number of closed stations: Zero<br>Random Fact: The current Kegstone Line was an accidental line. There were no plans for this line at all, even after the Harbourvale Line fully opened from HL1 to HL16.</p>
              <p><strong>City Line </strong><em>[Future]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: NIL (Trains can switch directions seamlessly at the following stations: CT1 South Coast, CT9 Lowland, CT14 Shorevale, CT22 Promenade)<br>Rolling Stock: C398<br>Depot(s): South Coast Depot<br>Length of line: NIL, expected to be at least 30km long<br>Duration between termini: NIL<br>Number of closed stations: To-be-confirmed<br>Random Fact: The City Line will efficiently cut travelling time, as passengers who want to get to and fro areas within the outskirts of the city, they can take this line without having to go through and interchange at the city centre.</p>

              <p><strong>North West Line</strong> <em>[Under
                  Construction]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: NW1 South Coast, NW10 City Square<br> Rolling Stock: C100A<br> Depot(s): Square Quays Depot, District Depot<br> Length of line: To-be-confirmed<br> Duration between termini: To-be-confirmed<br> Number of closed stations: Zero<br> Random Fact: The line was built under HLRT's supervision until HCRT
                  took over, thus the monotonous designs from NW1 to NW6.</p>
              <p><strong>Blackton Line</strong> <em>[Under Construction]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: BL1 Townsville, BL13 Promenade<br> Rolling Stock: C591<br> Depot(s): Caroye Depot<br> Length of line: NIL<br> Duration between termini: NIL<br> Number of closed stations: One, BL4<br> Random Fact: The tracks in this line never diverge and converge,
                  they are always 8m apart from each other. The middle portion of the
                  viaducts may be used for recreational purposes like a park along
                  the tracks, obviously with fencing beside the tracks.</p>
              <p><strong>Evergreen Fields Line</strong> <em>[Future]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: EF1 East Harbour, EF15 City Square<br> Rolling Stock: C100C<br> Depot(s): Lexington Depot<br> Length of line: NIL<br> Duration between termini: NIL<br> Number of closed stations: Two, EF2 Lexington and EF13 Town
                  Hall<br> Random Fact: The current structure and route of the line was
                  derived from an abandoned line with the same name. Old tracks can
                  be found in the undeveloped Evergreen Parks district, 1km east of
                  Evergreen Fields. Evergreen Parks was scheduled for extremely heavy
                  developement and this district was supposed to take over Central as
                  the city's CBD area, but plans were shelved after three newly built
                  buildings collapsed in less than a month due to the marine clay in
                  that area.</p>
              <p><strong>Kegstone Line</strong> <em>[Future]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: KS1 Lowland, KS10 Gateway<br> Rolling Stock: C591<br> Depot(s): Caroye Depot<br> Length of line: NIL<br> Duration between termini: NIL<br> Number of closed stations: Zero<br> Random Fact: The current Kegstone Line was an accidental line.
                  There were no plans for this line at all, even after the
                  Harbourvale Line fully opened from HL1 to HL16.</p>
              <p><strong>City Line</strong> <em>[Future]</em></p>
              <p>Termini: NIL (Trains
                  can switch directions seamlessly at the following
                  stations: CT1 South Coast, CT9 Lowland, CT14 Shorevale, CT22
                  Promenade)<br> Rolling Stock: C398<br> Depot(s): South Coast Depot<br> Length of line: NIL, expected to be at least 30km long<br> Duration between termini: NIL<br> Number of closed stations: To-be-confirmed<br> Random Fact: The City Line will efficiently cut travelling time, as
                  passengers who want to get to and fro areas within the outskirts of
                  the city, they can take this line without having to go through and
                  interchange at the city centre.</p>

              <p>Great info! Although I did say above that it was only for SG routes only, I might try to do a map of all the countries :)</p>
              <p>Maybe a more rectangular-y shaped map since 200-300km in pixel terms, means doing a over 3000pixels (length or height) map.</p>
