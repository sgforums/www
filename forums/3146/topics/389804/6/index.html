              <p><strong>History of OpenBVE Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) And Light Rapid 
                                  Transit (LRT) system</strong><br>The 2000s was an era of great technical 
                                  changes for the world of train simulation. The leaders of the train fans
                                   world across the world were convinced of the need to create a train 
                                  simulation that not just focused on arcade gaming side which often at 
                                  the expensive of realism, but also support it with a realistic and 
                                  accurate technical details to support the world of train simulation.</p>
              <p>To this end, Takashi Kojima (Mackoy) had commissioned a project 
                                  called BVE (Boso View Express TrainSim) in 2000 to create the initial 
                                  possibility of realistic train simulation game. Amongst others, the 
                                  initial product pointed such to a possibility for such realism rail 
                                  transit system. As a result, it has developed with Version 2 and 4 of 
                                  BVE in year 2001 and 2005 respectively with the third version were 
                                  scrapped off due to development issues.</p>
              <p>Despite so, it does not feature support for train exteriors, 
                                  animated 3D cab environments and animated scenery that led to a lack of 
                                  cab ambiance and caused a minus point for realism. It is also not 
                                  released under public domain which upsets some hobbyists. Thus, an 
                                  independent team from Michelle in 2009 had stepped forward to reinforce 
                                  the initial BVE for a rail simulation that features those aforementioned
                                   features that was not present in BVE. It was named as OpenBVE.</p>
              <p><br><strong>2009 - The Work Began</strong><br>In 2009, as the Singapore 
                                  government in the world of train simulation had still not implemented a 
                                  MRT system, thus the MRT system in the world of train simulation was in 
                                  turn become a BTO (Built To Order) scheme. Hence, BVESG community was 
                                  formed which is led by Willis Chong and Wenjie who had also formed WCVP 
                                  (Willis Chong Video Production) Consortium that gives the go-ahead due 
                                  to the maturity of train simulation along with the demand of it is ever 
                                  increasing and work on the construction of the openBVE MRT began. The 
                                  countless time and effort was put in and targeted to be completed with 
                                  fully realistic train simulation without a deadline.</p>
              <p>The 6 km-long route would boast 3 stations, of which 2 would be 
                                  above ground and 1 underground. The Changi Airport Branch line was 
                                  implemented first as businessmen need to be ferried across the busy 
                                  Changi Airport and the Changi Business Park, which is located at Expo.</p>
              <p>On 21 July 2009, when its first section from Changi Airport to 
                                  Expo was opened, thousands flocked to experience travelling on the MRT 
                                  on a PC. The CEO for the WCVP Consortium, Mr Willis Chong¸ officiated the 
                                  launching of the BVE forum on 19 April 2009. The remainder of the system was opened in stages and 
                                  the final section of Changi Airport Branch Line was completed in 21 
                                  April 2010.<br> <br><strong>North South Line</strong><br>In 7 July 2009, Jerry 
                                  Transit Coporation announced its decision to extend the OpenBVE MRT 
                                  system to Bukit Batok &amp; Choa Chu Kang. Work on this 4.6km extension 
                                  was completed on 7 September 2009. With the new MRT extension up and 
                                  running, commuters can now choose to take off on a fast train.<br> <br><strong>Woodlands
                                   Extension, Bishan Extension, Jurong East Extension</strong><br>In September 
                                  2009, Jerry Transit Consortium was formed along with Network Rail Transit System Limited (NRTS), whose CEO is Joey Foo and Matthew Rapid Transit Coporation (MRTC) which 
                                  announced their decision to extend the OpenBVE MRT system beyond Choa 
                                  Chu Kang, and goes through Woodlands, Sembawang New Town, Yishun New 
                                  Town, Ang Mo Kio and Bishan Town. Provision plans to extend the North 
                                  South Line to Jurong East was also conducted in March 2010.</p>
              <p>Work on this 26.2km extension was completed on 17 March 2010 with
                                   the exception of Bishan. With the new MRT extension up and running, 
                                  commuters can now choose to take off on a fast train to travel between 
                                  the Western and Northern part of Singapore.<br> <br><strong>East West Line</strong><br>In
                                   15 September 2009, The Soon Transit had announced the decision to 
                                  further extend the OpenBVE MRT system eastwards, starting from Pasir Ris
                                   to Tanah Merah Station. This 6km extension will further enhance Eastern
                                   Region’s limited MRT connection of Changi Airport – Tanah Merah. 
                                  However, the construction progress was not very smooth as compared to 
                                  other lines and as of now, neither of the stations was opened to public 
                                  yet.</p>
              <p>In 15 February 2010, Veyron Coporation (VC) by Veyron had announced 
                                  its decision to further extend the OpenBVE MRT system to Clementi &amp; 
                                  Redhill, with the help of NRTS and Matthew Rapid 
                                  Transit Coporation, both of them who have prior experience on Woodlands 
                                  Extension. The first sector of the work on this 8km extension that 
                                  covers Clementi to Commonwealth was completed on 21 February 2010. With 
                                  the new MRT extension up and running, commuters can now choose to take 
                                  off on a fast train towards the South Western parts of Singapore. The 
                                  other sectors of Queenstown and Redhill are expected to be opened by 
                                  Late March 2010 and April or May respectively.</p>
              <p>Futhermore, on March 6 2010, the Union of Super Samuel Rail 
                                  (USSR) had announced the decision to extend the OpenBVE MRT system from 
                                  Bedok to Aljunied and more. With the reference of previous experience in
                                   NSL and VC's EWL, the initial 6.5km sector was completed March 14 
                                  2010. Also, the USSR had a joint venture with Jian Rong Group for future 
                              railway extensions such that provisions can be made to further extend the system Eastwards to 
                                  Pasir Ris which allows people from Changi and Pasir Ris can have a 
                                  direct transit connection to the busy CBD, which the construction has 
                                  been halted down due to the technical challenging constraints. <br> <br><strong>Boon
                                   Lay Extension</strong><br>Although no formal announcement has made, it is 
                                  widely expected that either Redhill section completed or Bugis / Pasir 
                                  Ris sector had completed first, the next major extension estimated to be
                                   8km will target on connecting Joo Koon, which is part of 3.8km Boon Lay
                                   Extension (Pioneer &amp; Joo Koon) to Clementi (Consists of Boon Lay, 
                                  Lakeside, Chinese Garden, Jurong East and Clementi), to complete the 
                                  Western part of the East West Line. The USSR has expressed itself in 
                                  private that it hopes to see a completed EWL in someday future.</p>

              <p>The fare will be low and consistent for all 
                                      stations, which is
                                                              at SGD$1.20  The fare price may change as 
                                  time

              <p><strong>North East Line, Bukit Panjang LRT, Sengkang &amp; Punggol 
                                  LRT, Circle Line and beyond</strong></p>
              <p>It is widely expected that after the completion of the full 
                                  initial MRT network that is 89 km-long route consisted of 56 stations, 
                                  where 40 would be above
                                       ground and 16 under ground, the next target would likely be North 
                                  East Line (NEL), Circle Line (CCL), Bukit Pangjang LRT (BPLRT) as well 
                                  as Sengkang &amp; Punggol LRT (SKPGLRT). All these rail lines will bring
                                   benefits to people in the North East (NEL, CCL and SKPGLRT), South West
                                   (CCL -- In Pasir Panjang &amp; Telok Blangah areas) and Bukit Panjang 
                                  Town (BPLRT) region of the Singapore OpenBVE world. However, due to the 
                                  number of population density in North East region (Notably Sengkang and 
                                  Punggol) as well as Bukit Panjang is relatively low along with the lack 
                                  of demands in certain portion of Circle Line (Notably Thomson and West 
                                  Coast areas), priority to build such lines is low at the moment.</p>
              <p><strong>Rolling stock</strong></p>
              <p>The openBVE MRT government purchased 66 sets of the C151 trains. These are the oldest trains on the system, which have been running
                          since the MRT system's inception in 17 September 2009, and are still in operation
                          today. Originally, these
                          trains were meant to operate of the North South Line and the Changi Airport Branch of the East West Line. However, with the expansion of the MRT network to the East West Line, more trains are required to ply on the lines. The C151 train contract was won by WCVP who will be responsible for building such trains.</p>
              <p>The openBVE MRT government then confirmed another order of 19 sets of the second generation trains, the C651. The first C651 arrived on the 19th of March 2010, reducing the commuters waiting time for a train. For this, WCVP did not participate in the bidding instead which had then the train contract had won by JVC (JCQH Vehicle Coporation) who will then be responsible for building C651 trains. However, it seemed that JVC had the intention to transfer such tendership and thus a re-tender of C651 is a ongoing process. Currently, some of the companies interested in enhancing the existing C651s included NRTS, JTC and USSR with different levels of progress, where NRTS is known for enhancing the existing motors while USSR had a train that had enhanced on the power and braking notchs.</p>
              <p>On the order list is the C751B , with the first trainset expected to arrive sometime in April this year. This train's contract was won by SBS Engineering Coporation, with SBS7322B as the CEO.</p>
