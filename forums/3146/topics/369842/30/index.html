              <p>Actually there is a 25m limit in (open)BVE and even though there is a workaround, that only applies to objects (So that only things like station length can be not in multiples of 25m, like what PSDs in LAV / BGS is) and not the tracks / viaducts (Actually EWL uses objects to workaround the walls -- which is the viaduct of 25m limit).</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>In short, due to the 25m issue, some of them prefer to round up / down in terms of 25m, and adding that up might gives a difference of 100m in just 10 stations or even less.</p>

              <p>Suggestion: Because of unrealistic timings, I think we should follow the timetable at each station, you know the signboard that says how long it goes from one station to another?

              <p>Actually different people / players will have different acclerate timings etc, as you have mentioned and I mean, unless we can get the timetable from SMRT, the only best thing is to view the videos as that might be more accurate than timing in the game (Sometimes this exposes length issue while timing in the game sounds a hackish method.)</p>

              <p>Actually, the signboardsÂ no update. Between Braddell and
              Toa Payoh, SMRT calculated as 2mins in the train timing BUT the
              signboards shows 1min... That's mean It is not accurate..</p>
              <p>Anyone know: the former timing Orchard to Somerset - 1min why
              shifted to Somerset to Dhoby Ghaut???</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Maybe SMRT wants to trick us into thinking that going by MRT is the fastest? I guess the most accurate would be to do measurements yourself. Calculate accelaration rate, distance between both stations, decelaration rate :P</p>

              <p>[EDIT] From the looks of your post, you're trying to tell me that you're putting HHPSDs on every station on the NSL, but then you're unable to put it on Ang Mo Kio because you only have the HHPSDs that open on the right side only. And at Khatib station, you're trying to tell me that you <span style="color: #ffffff;">have failed badly in coding, and </span>are trying to say the HHPSDs that supposed to be on the other side, came on Platform B.</p>

              <p>Erm, spotted some bugs. First of all, the tracks are buried under the ballast. This is either caused by me accidentally overwriting files or maybe there are some errors in the coding. I am not sure about this, but I think it can be solved by editing the Track.csv file to increase the height of the rails by 0.15 m as stated by joey earlier. I might be able to do this but it is going to take some time. Secondly, the tracks after Bukit Batok, I think, are straight tracks, which mean they would are not the curved tracks, which Joey wanted it to be. I might be able to change that with a little bit of twitching to the .csv file. Thirdly, the straight tracks used have a different ballast compared to the curved track. I can replace the ballast .bmp and alter the height of the rails to do that. That's all. Now for the good points:</p>
              <p>1. Nice rain and fog effect.</p>
              <p>2. Nice roof at JUR</p>
              <p>3. Nice advertisements on HHPSDs and PSDs</p>
              <p>Flip might want to help me to edit those points stated above. You might want to PM me so that we can work together and release version 1.0! *Exciting* That's all for now.</p>
              <p>Oh yeah, Joey, good luck working on your Harbourvale City Light Rail! :D</p>
              <p>[EDIT] Fourth thing to do, change the signal limit between JUR and Bukit Batok.</p>

              <p>What do you mean by "it's going into my train"? The rain effect is quite decent actually.</p>
              <p>You mean the signal limit between JUR and Bukit Batok? Maybe Joey set it wrongly. But it is not really much to worry about, because they are no signals between the two stations. Maybe you can add that to our checklist of things to do.</p>
