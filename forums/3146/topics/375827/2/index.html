              <p>Hmm. I have no mood for maths now LOL. And, I doubt I can do it as i'm only in Primary 6 this year... But, you can test it using the MTR's door script. I may/may not be able to help as I only designed train's exteriors in the past... HOW DID YOU GUYS LEARNT HOW TO MAKE TRAINS AND ROUTES!?</p>

              <p>I don't quite understand the reason of you doing that. It's fine to add the SMRT logo but editing the speedometer to 150kmh makes no sense. The maximum speed that can be achieved from our train are at most 80kmh or 90kmh. I'd rather make that speedometer more accurate than adjusting it to 150kmh.</p>

              <p>I agree that our trains has no 150kmh. By the way, NEL train can run up to 100kmh but actual service is like no more than 90kmh (The time when Buangkok have not open, I live there @ that time so I know, as in frequent board NEL and got chances to see the insides)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember the EWL / NSL can only up to 90kmh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a side note, I do not remember there is SMRT logo in the cabin during my Bishan (Depot) Stunt and went to the TO cabin (without authorization)</p>

              <p>Max 90 kmh, correct. Just that to note that it should not be too easy to accelerate to 90kmh. (This is not a Ferrari Car that acclerate from 0 to 100 in less than 5 seconds)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, the inside view is not easy to explain because the front has 2 levers (1 is for accelerate, the other not sure), 1 or 2 screens and it has left / right controls --- On the front left side and front right side. (The TO sits and faces at front right side). There are some light indicator of greens and reds as well. On the front bottom, here is where one open / close doors and emergency horn is there. Then on the back, there are some controls. The more notable ones is the service lights (You see DNBs do dim the light) and some indicator as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: It is not 100% accurate for the above message as I just recall it. Maybe if someone willing to accompany me for such stunts with Video camcorder (As I do not have, do not that such stunts is illegal), life will be easier.</p>

              <p>There are somebody mentioned that as well. That person (cant remember the name) said it is still illegal though to ask for such access from TOs (Staff). So, both are "illegal" too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Extracted from Rapid Transit Act</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Operating rapid transit system without
              licence</strong><br><strong>12.</strong> —(1)
              No
              person except the Authority or a person licensed by the Authority shall
              operate any rapid transit system.</p>
              <p>(2)
              Any person who operates any rapid transit
              system in contravention of subsection (1) shall be guilty of an
              offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000
              or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both and,
              in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $5,000
              for every day during which the offence continues after conviction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus, unless someone really CM the train (Nah, in depot do such thing, probably need to violate red lights, it may derail the train and I dont GTA the TOs), I cant really find offence doing such stunts apart of Trespassing.</p>
