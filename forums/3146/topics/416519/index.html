              <p>Hello? Do you know that it is very hard to think of a route to make? It takes alot of creativity to make up station names and designs you know? You think you just find a random word in a dictionary and just smack that word as the station name? You have to mix and match words to make up one station name. As for station designs, you have to think very hard to make one you see? Fictional routes are like that, it's very hard to think of new elements in the route.</p>
              <p>And also, SGBVE won't sound unrealistic even though the operator name doesn't sound very nice. In fact, it makes the route more unique. Only one line, so what? It's at least better than nothing.</p>
              <p>No one cares if any other train doesn't fit into the station or anything as the station is designed to fit its designated train. Any other train which goes in, it's just for fun, and no realism is to be expected.</p>
              <p>Please, put your shoes into the route developers' before saying such things.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The above letter was written by Willis Chong, he appears to have problems posting this on SGForums, therefore I'm posting this on his behalf.</p>
              <p>As for me, all I can say is, I'm already having tons of trouble thinking up of fictional names that are sensible and are not dumb. Names like "Sillytown" or "Thundervale" do not make the cut for realism.</p>
              <p>Fictional routes are tough to make, I can't say I'm experienced in creating them. You guys don't have any idea how much time I spend sitting and thinking up of names. After the station names are done up, then here comes the station architecture part. You don't just think I jump straight into the creating of the roofing of the station in CSV, do you? I actually spend an hour designing a station. All stations on the Blackton Line have a particular design behind them, and I painstakingly take an hour to draw the plans out. I already have done up 4 station plans (which are Townsville, Science Park, Benoi and the future-to-be station between Benoi and Museum).</p>
              <p>My words may sound harsh here, but recently there has been a sudden surge in fictional cities springing up. It isn't as easy as you think to design a city's transit infrastructure. The original plans of Harbourvale City were far from what they are today. There was no such thing as the Kegstone Line, City Line or even the District LRT.</p>
              <p>A fictional city comes a long way from scratch. The hugest difficulty about fictional routes, is to create a fictional city from elements from the real world. Some of my textures are actually real world textures and they are used in many different ways. For example, an image of a road viaduct in Singapore can be used to texture a metro viaduct in Harbourvale.</p>
              <p>My routes place an emphasis on station design, because honestly I think that is the only component that separates your routes from other typical fictional routes.</p>
              <p>Once again, I apologise for the harsh words. I typed this in reply to Bngauw's comment, "Look, he doesn't even have a station design."</p>

              <p><br>And by the way, Felix is intending to do four routes, not just one. All will be scheduled to be released by December 2013. Developers like him set their sights far ahead, and these are the developers that will eventually succeed.

              <p> Letter to Bngauw:</p>
              <p>Excuse me? Do you know that it is very difficult to think about a station's design? It takes alot of creativity to think of designs. As for me, I can't really say that I'm good in designing. You don't know I've spent how much precious time I've spend on designs. You know, I don't just straight away jump into coding the station design after i finish the route skeleton, I spend time designing them on paper/drawing programmes on my computer. I guess you've just seen my Kegstone Line Gateway station's design. You see, the design, I've spend 1D and 1N designing the station. So you see, Nickgoh's Harbourvale Line/North West Line/Other Lines have so many beautiful stations. Cos' he spent time thinking (As stated @ the above post). And, I have to spent my free time checking other country train station videos/pictures. For what? For the station designs! And I've to consider if their designs suits the area/station name a not. I take 1 hour to draw out the station plans, only when i have the inspiration of a design. So please, after I tell you my 'story' of designing stations, I seriously hope that you can change your thinking. It's not easy to think up with a station design. And, that's all I've to say. <br><br> From: Bryanwee1</p>

              <p><br>There is a way to stop the PSD doors of the non-3 car PSD doors from opening. It can be seen in action in the HK animated PSDs. So you need not worry about this aspect when it comes to the rolling stock mix.</p>
              <p>It isn't fictional for rolling stock mixes. New York has different carriage formations and they are used during different times of the day. There may be about 10 carriages during peak hours and only 4 carriages in the non-peak hours.</p>
              <p>And to Bngauw: If you think the C830 will look terribly short in the station, all you have to do is to place the C830's stopping position such that the C830 stops in the middle of the station. That way the C830 won't look too short.</p>

              <p>This post is<strong> not directed/pointed to anyone</strong>, that means I am not insulting anyone here.</p>
              <p>Station design don't just take one day to complete. It can take days, weeks or even months, especially if it is very complex. New developers don't straight away learn how to code stuff, it takes time. You can't just jump to conclusions that if any developer, whether be it an amateur or professional, creates a thread must already have created the skeleton of the route or other stuff. The developer should have enough time which is 2 days to provide proof, but of course I can't say anything if the developer doesn't provide proof.</p>
              <p>Giving negative critisicms will discourage the developer and as long as there are many negative critisicms, the developer will be discouraged and soon the developer will stop developing for BVE, or even worse, quit BVE for good. It's like many people stealing a developer's objects from a realistic route. The developer will soon get angry and so he can either remove the download and develop for himself OR leave the BVE community for good because of these kind of people in the society.</p>
              <p>Now since Felix have extra time to post proof, it's best to lower down the requests for proof. Give the developer some time to do the route and stations. Why lower the requests down? Because the more you request for proof, the more the developer will have to RUSH. Rushed work doesn't look good right? Everyone in the BVE community knows that.</p>
              <p>I don't mind if many fictional lines/cities suddenly appear here, as long as they have potential in them.</p>
              <p>Hope this letter, and letters above me will knock some sense into people's head.</p>
