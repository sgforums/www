            <div class='col-md body'>I think you all have heard too much stuff like "All man is born equal" and you all will tend to attribute it to factors like.e.g. not borned crippled or mentally-impaired.<br><br>Have you ever thought of other areas in which a man might be born unequal? If you think hard enough, the answer will be a man's look. Being borned handsome is certainly an advantage. Cos girls will always come knocking on your door and you will find it easier to find a beautiful girlfriend. In addition, you will have more self-confidence.<br><br>I am borned ugly. I am borned with a "worst-than-shit" face as i would describe it. Why must God give me such a face? Why can't God give all an equally handsome face? I do asked some people. Their answer is " If there isn't ugly people in this world, then the handsome boys would not be distinguished". But why must i be born ugly and be used to distinguish the handsome ones. Why! Why! Why!<br><br>God also said "You lose some, you gain some". But what did God give me? Oh, maybe he gave me an intelligent brain for me to score lots of ADs which i already scored. However, if i am really granted an intelligent brain, then why did i have to study so hard to score ADs. I can simply relax and score my ADs and not slog to get ADs. In the end, i decided. What the use of scoring ADs when you have a "worst-than-shit" face. Without self-confident due to ugly looks, what can my ADs do?? Get a better job? I believed Singapore employers not only go for quality but also partly looks too.<br><br>So in the end, i decided to let loose of my studies. "Wo Bu Gan Xin". What sins have i committed to have deserved such a face? God, can you tell me? Tell me to ease my sorrow and shame. I am willing to exchange my life span in return for a better look.<br><br>God, do u know how much setback and painful memories my face have bought me?? I dare not chase after the girl i loved, only to see her being taken away by other boys. I dare not speak up, i dare not lift my head high be it in school or outside. I dare not attend friend's party only to fear that i might be laughed at for my looks. I dare not strike up a conversation with any girl. So sometimes, i really feel like taking a knife and cut my own face to end it all.<br><br>God, if you are really out there, can you please explain why you have given me such an ugly face??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well............... i am really disapponited in my looks to the extent that it troubled me everyday. I onced asked 2 female class mates to rate my look. I took the upmost courage to ask them through the ICQ. One rated my face 6.5/10  ----- i knew she was trying to console me. The other one rated me 5/10......whom i more believed in. U all know something.......... i really feel very inferior comparing myself to other boys out there. I just kinda felt that i looks weird.............real weird. My hairstyle and dressing...................so weird .........so different from other boys. Girls don't approach me at all..........it seems that i am down right worthless............like scraped metals. I do not want to be born ugly..........no one wish to be born ugly rite.......... If this goes no, i afraid i might one day decide to end it all....</div>

And at this stage in poly life you should strive to get good grades instead of thinking how people feel about you. After you graduate with good grades, you could even get good career.

He was with a girl (his gf) and I was quite surprise that she wasn't too bad and was on the cute side. This is a classic case where looks alone doesn't win everything for you - in the end, it still boils down to your character and how you deal with yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>*Note: I mentioned nothing about life/god because you are the master of your own fate.
