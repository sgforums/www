So i was thinking if you could tell me what is the freshmen orientation is about and what should i expect from it ? (like what kind of games etc and what they do)<br>Considering if i should go for the camp. Tbh , i'm not really interested in playing games. I'm more of the workaholic type (dont judge me)..... So please give me some ideas (any poly) , it would be great if you are from NP since i'm enrolling in NP soon. Thanks :)</p></div>

              <p>If you want get your license by enrol driving school, approx overall fee will be $2K just for the practical driving course only. Not to forget must pass eye test before they closed at about 5pm in weekday or 12pm in weekend, and must renew and pay for the provisional driving license every six month if you cannot completed your course within six month. And worst the booking must be done about 1 month in advanced cos you might not be 'lucky' to get the slot or date/time you want since it always booked full house. For some, maybe NS time might be the best time to get the license.</p>
