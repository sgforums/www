            <div class='col-md body'>It is good news to know that there is going to be a fourth university in Singapore. It will not be any good if it follows the steps of the NUS and NTU.<br>So far the 2 local public universities have a quite number of undergraduates &amp; graduates including foreigners. In order not to over populate these 2 universities, another public university, SMU had been form 2 years ago. More Singaporeans have more opportunities to pursue a degree. Its idea of accepting applicants who achieve the minimum SAT scores regardless of local A-levels/diploma holders or foreigners, is a very good method which uses in foreign universities in the States, Australia, UK, etc. This will help to improve the university &amp; the republic standard other than grooming more local talents. Unlike NTU and NUS, diploma holders from local polytechnics have a higher chances of getting a degree in an public university as they sit for the same SAT papers although the intake of diploma holders are not that high. Too bad for those who are from IT, design &amp; engineering faculties, there are only business management, accounting &amp; commerce program in this 3rd public university.<br>As for the other 2 universities, their main purpose is to get as many A-level holders as possible to get a degree. The chances for local diploma holders to get a place in certain programs are seriously very dim especially Temasek and Nanyang Polytechnics graduates. These 2 polytechnics are not like the other 2 polytechnics, Singapore and Nee Ang Polytechnics, which they have stronger ties with the 2 universities. Some may wonder if they were infiltrated just like Methodist Girls Secondary School to Anglo Chinese Junior Collage.<br>Every year, around 500 graduates each from SP and NP entered NTU or NUS comparing to less than 40 graduates from TP and NYP who are lucky and good enough to get a spot there. The different between these 2 sums is relatively big. Many think that TP and NYP are new and they are not strongly recognized or the students are not bright enough. Even though the 2 local universities accept higher percentage of SP and NP graduates, many still cannot make it even they have tried so hard in their diploma studies. All the four polytechnics students are told that top 10% of each faculty including those who receive Certificates Of Merit (COM), will stand a chance in NTU and NUS. In the end only those from SP and NP get the places. Even a COM holder fm NYP is rejected.<br>Most of the time, foreign students, esp. Malaysians and those who get a place in JC, topped their respective faculty. Seldom students who cannot get into JC are COM holders. Time flies, teenagers nowadays are not happy with a diploma. They believe having a degree will have better future with more job opportunities. They could not get into JC because of not that smart and end up in polytechnics just the same as demoted to a normal stream in secondary or ITE after N/O levels. After working so hard, they still fail to get to the top 10% and most of them will stop their education. For those who can study in JC are brighter &amp; more talent but choose to study in polytechnic, either SP or NP as they know these 2 polytechnics stand higher chances of getting to NTU/NUS. That's why they are the ones who usually get to the top and easily enter the local universities. Foreigners are usually talents because polytechnics will only accept the best, same goes to the universities. How does a person who cannot even study in JC beat foreign talents?<br>All the JC, NTU and NUS always get support from the government. Every week in the newspapers and on television, you can see/hear praises and good comments from ministers, directors from both government and private sectors. Once in the full moon, you can hear about any polytechnics through any kind of media. JC students enjoy so much good stuff including funds, privileges, discounts, scholarships, etc. Although a polytechnic student who is around the same age as them are treated like a fully matured university undergraduate but not as good as those undergraduates. For example, a polytechnic student who is 17 years old uses an adult Transit link farecard (blue) but as for a JC year 1 student, he uses a student farecard (pink). Why does it so? Aren't they both the same age and are students? Another question, why does NTU and NUS strongly accept a A-level holder over a diploma holder? Why do so many scholarships given out to A-level holders and not diploma holders?  Isn't diploma a better and higher qualification?<br>Since NTU and NUS generally accept A-level holders, diploma holders have no other choices but to start work after graduating from polytechnics. The purpose is to get a saving to study overseas. Of cause people think that overseas degrees are better than local universities after all NTU and NUS are not as good as what u have read in the papers but can you buy yourself a ticket to a foreign land. If one has money, he/she will pursue a degree overseas immediately but too bad most of us are not rich. Who still have the money for further studies after paying about $1800 to the polytechnics annually? For an A-level holder, their school fees are so low yet enjoyed so much benefits. More than 85% will secured a place in NTU or NUS which they enjoyed student grant from the government. No need to be rich to get a degree, only have to study JC. Their only worry is to get the degree program they wanted. Even a all C graded A-level holder will stand higher chances of ensuring a place in NTU or NUS than a top 10% diploma holder from local Poly. You will be 'trap' in polytechnics if you are neither rich nor super smart. Therefore, a public university here which accept diploma holders will be a great relieve.<br>Why studying in polytechnic is a bad choice? The fees are high, around $900 for a semester and have to complete a total of 6 semesters to complete a diploma. It is equivalent to studying there for 4 years where most people mistaken as 3 because it started in June. As a polytechnic student, u will not be treated as a student outside and therefore no student price nor discount for u. Upon graduated, u are not likely to study in local universities as they are only for A-level and a few good diploma holders. After working for a few years, u will not think of getting a degree anymore because u has aged. After completing payless NS, u will be 23 the minimum. To get enough saving to study for a full time or part time degree with a diploma salary, it takes about 5 years or so. At around the age of 28, I rather use this amount of money on other things such as marriage, open a business shop or save for a few more years to get a car if possible. Also u will feel uneasy studying with a bunch of young A-level holders in the university. Who will cares to help this group of diploma holders who wish to get a higher education before getting a permanent well pay job? Must it be always a must to work for a study saving until a certain age after polytechnic like what I say previously? Why this group of people cannot live like those A-level holders who can study in university at such young age and get such a high salary job?<br>In JC, people will think highly and will be treated and supported very well by teachers, friends, government and companies. You can read about praises on them about how well they do in their studies, co-curricular activities and sports. Many scholarships have been given to them each year. They can even be seen appearing on TVs and newspaper if you get PSC awards. Rarely such things will fall onto a local polytechnic student. If you are neither rich nor smart, polytechnic is definite not a place for you. I rather repeat a year in secondary to retake O-levels until JC accepts. You will serve NS a year earlier and more confident of studying in universities than Poly graduates. You save time and lots of money. So think thrice before choosing to study in polytechnics. Advice to all secondary students, better study hard to get into JC. If you think people will treat you well after coming out for work with a diploma then you are totally wrong. Poly are just like ITE where a place to keep weak students.<br>The upcoming public university should have a different system from the current universities. NTU and NUS take in students base on 'A' levels results while SMU bases on SAT tests. Those with who have diploma fm local polytechnics must obtain excellent results and depending on the vacancies left in then universities. It's quite reasonable and fair for the intakes since any applicant will have to go through SAT tests. Although NTU and NUS will go have this system starting from 2003, all 3 are still bias for 'A' lever holders over diploma holders, which is very unfair. How can a diploma holder continue to upgrade their education if no universities can accept him and he cannot afford to study overseas even distance learning? You can blame him for not studying hard enough but not everyone has a bright brain. He cannot enter junior collage does not means he can do well in polytechnics. His academic results is still above average even though he cannot make it for any scholarships where there are only few. In this case, something should be done to help him.<br>The fourth university's student population should have around 60% of diploma holders from any local polytechnics, 20% from junior collages and 20% foreign students under undergraduate programs. All 'A' level holders and those who do not have any relevant qualifications for some programs must go through at least 1 year of foundation or bridging courses. Foundation or bridging courses are part of the 3 or 4 years (Hon's) degree programs. Relevant diploma holders for some programs will not need to do the foundation or bridging courses. Therefore, their 3 or 4 years (Hon's) program will cut down by at least 1 to 2 semesters. Foreign applicants must have relevant qualifications and the minimum SAT or TOEFL scores. 'A' level holders from local junior collages should have good academic results and good performances in their CCA, as it will be very competitive. Diploma holders from any local polytechnics now stands higher chances to get a degree and no need to be depressed or worry about program fees. Through this kind of intake system, it will create the best quality and professional university locally and internationally.<br>You may think that this is a stupid idea system but this is a dream from all polytechnics' students and working adults. You can debate that everyone will have a degree and the education level standard will be pulled down. Soon a Bachelor degree is as good as a 'A' level qualification. Think again, 4 polytechnics population applying for only a university is still very competitive. How many can it holds comparing to 3 universities for 15 junior collage population? There are many reasons why the future population of this fourth university accepts only 20% of 'A' holders. This is because they have higher chances of studying in the other 3 universities. This fourth is just another study option given to them. Moreover, they do not have any working experiences through attachments like in polytechnics, modules teaching methods which used in all universities globally and professional specializations base on their job interests. For example, someone who wish to become a mechanical engineer will pick up a bachelor degree program which have more effective solution to solve problems during their studies because they might came across once in their polytechnic studies or project. As for a fresh JC graduate, he do not really understand what a actual mechanical engineer does since they never study anything about it or experience doing an industry project himself. Another reason is very simple and everyone knows it. Diploma itself is a higher qualification than 'A' level. That is why they can be exempted from foundation or bridging course. Some more, they serve their NS late because the 3-year diploma program starts in late June. This balance the age range of all the males in Singapore getting a Bachelor degree no matter you are from JC or Poly.<br>This is just my opinion and hope you can appreciate. You may think I am crazy and treat this as a junk. I sincerely give my best wishes to the upcoming fourth quality local university.<br></div>
