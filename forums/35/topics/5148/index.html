            <div class='col-md body'>I too believe that this NS idea is rather pointless. True, strategically a small force can do great damage (like hidden strike forces in other larger countries  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br>But asking... no forcing every single male to become a lean mean KILLING machine? I think this is rather obvious.<br><br>I mean, do any of you honestly believe that we're going to learn how to gently persuade our foes not to shoot at us? No we're learning how to best maim, murder, slaughter, snipe, strangle, gut and plainly KILL!<br><br>Not only will this psychologically harm those who may not all be that comfortable with bayoneting someone, but there is also the possibility that someone who is not quite sound of mind will be taught how to kill and avoid getting caught. O.o is THAT what these guys want? Please tell me they at least examine each and every recruit to ensure they won't slip a blade into someone's ribs sometime in the near future!<br><br>Well, that's all I have to say. Anyone with objections? I would most certainly like to hear your views.</div>
