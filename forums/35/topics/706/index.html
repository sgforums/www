            <div class='col-md body'>I am an ECE graduate from NP. Together with  my peers, we hope to get into the local universities to further our studies. However, the local uni seems to adopt a rather translucent admission system for poly graduates. According to the uni, only graduates with "good academic performance" will be accepted. What is the definition of "good academic performance" ? 10,20 or 30ADs ??!! How will u rate a C.O.M holder with respect to an A-level graduate with<br>3-As?<br>Next, the no. of places reserved for poly students is also not revealed. Finally, I feel that more places should be reserved for poly students with good results. Being a poly graduate doesn't mean that you do not have that intellectual capacity to go to the local uni. In fact, many of the poly graduates have make it big in overseas uni.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>Adrian</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's not start a quarrel over here on why poly graduates are at an disadvantage in getting into local uni compared to A-level holders. But i hope i can point out some of the reasons why it is so. (These are what I had read from other sources).<br><br>Firstly, i must agree with Xinke that it is indeed a small proportion of poly graduates who are able to make it into local uni despite their excellent results.<br><br>Many of them who were rejected by local uni went abroad to pursue their degrees and most came back with 1st class honours. So why is it that local uni do not accept them?<br><br>Firstly, it was said that Spore is a small economy. The authorities need to "regulate" the number of graduates so that there will not be a situation of over supply of graduates in the local scene. Take a look at countries such as the Philippines, they have so much graduates that most ppl find that their degrees are useless. They could earn much more income by coming to Spore to work as a domestic maid! Yes, the maid u have at home might have a degree back in the Philippines!!!<br><br>Secondly, after O-levels, students have 2 choices: to pursue an A-level, which is the DIRECT route to a uni; or to pursue a poly diploma.<br><br>We are aware that local education is heavily subsidised by the Gov, where this money comes from taxpayer money. With this in mind, we also know that an A-level education is considered a secondary education while a poly education is a tertiary education.<br><br>So the Gov is trying to be fair by allowing students have a fair share of tertiary education. Poly graduates had already enjoyed the benefits of heavy subsidy, while A-level graduates have not. So by fair chance, more places should be made available for A-level students to enjoy the benefit of such heavy subsidy which their peers had already enjoyed while pursuing their diploma.<br><br>This is the fair part: Gov do not want some group of the citizens to enjoy "double subsidy" which creates a burden on taxpayers. That is the reason why less positions is available for poly graduates.<br><br>Lastly, it rewards those who are willing to take up the challenge to pursue an A-level course after their O-levels. Since we know that the direct route to a uni is tru A-levels, why are some ppl not taking up A-levels in the first place? Because they can't make it into JC based on their best 6 subjects? Because they wanted to avoid GP (General Paper)? Or because they do not want to wear school uniform?<br><br>Sorry, i am not trying to create an argument here, but these are the most "popular" reasons why ppl rather take up poly course than A-levels. So to be fair, A-level students should be rewarded with higher chances of getting into local uni although they might not have better capabilities than their peers holding a diploma.<br><br>Hope this should solve some of the mysteries in your mind~!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Yoohoo ! Thanks for the reply ! I must say that your point on "double subsidy" for poly students is really thought provoking.<br>However, I don't really agree on the part where you mention about rewarding secondary students who take up the A-Level challenge.<br>Personally, I think that poly examinations and projects are just as challenging if not more challenging than the A-level examination. It is by no means an easy feat to get a C.O.M.(Certificate Of Merit) Diploma in poly. In fact, many of my poly peers wanted to do their A-levels. Unfortunately, they couldn't make it to the college because of their poor English results. The education system shouldn't condemn a person just because of his handicap in language. I have a friend who couldn't make it to the college because of his poor grade in English (E<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. He scored straight distinctions for the rest of his subjects. He is currently a silver medalist from Singapore Poly Electrical Engineering Dept. He has proved that language is not an insurmountable obstacle in acquiring skills and knowledge. He has applied for a place in NTU. I am sure a person of his calibre will definitely excel in his university studies as well, .... if given the <strong>CHANCE.</strong><br><br>------------------<br><strong>Adrian</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, Xinke I also agree with you that Poly exams/projects are by no means an easy one. But the fact is that lecturers usually try their best not to fail students if they showed that they have some knowledge in the module (true for Poly / Uni). Of course these students will not score, but will just scrap tru.<br><br>But A-level exams are also not as easy as u might think~! I must say that the workload is very heavy as there are so many topics to cover. Furthermore, it is not exactly a 2 yr course. After the release of O-level results, term will start somewhere in mid April, ends in Nov. Following which the final yr will start in Jan, and ends by Oct.<br><br>With the heavy schedule and miminal time, it really pushes the best out of an A-level student.<br><br>With a poor english results in O-level, do u think that the student will   survive in GP (General paper)? Most likely he will flunk or don't do well. This will mean a waste of time during the "2" yr A-level course should he not be able to gain entry to a local uni. Hence, common sense will tell that it is advisible to pursue a poly dip where english is not an important criteral for the course.<br><br>Of course if your frenz do well in poly with a COM, then he will most likely be able to further his studies in local uni and hence, still get to enjoy the "double subsidy", but with an extra effort of 1 yr difference. Economically speaking, this is the "price" that reflects the opportunity cost of not being good in english.<br><br>My english is not that fantastic too! so i shall end here... ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well the MOE is really crappy to come up with SAT test for poly grads , sooner or later u will fine the hard work u put in is only worth 60% of the whole local uni application.<br><br>Can see some bias in NTU/NUS as basically u didn;t see lots of NYP ot TP grads in there ,they still prefer SP and NP diplomas.<br><br>There are various reason why students choose poly instead of 'A' levels , firstly it can be the student's 'O's is not that terrific or he wants to avoid GP , secondly maybe he wants to learn skills and have "hands on" experience rather than the dry and boring 'A's .Thirdly he may want a change of environment .<br><br>However it a 'O's student have what it takes to make it to JCs , he should take the 'A' path as it gives him a much higher chance to go local uni , can u imagine a average C and D 'A's student stands better chance than a average B student. Is poly's standard really that low ?<br><br>So for those will receive their 'O's result next yr , they must consider this fact carefully .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SG universities sux big time. They only go for those good and top students but then how come the govt is still recruiting so many foreign talents? So irony.<br><br>NUS and NTU keep proclaiming that they are number 1 or 2 or 3 but wats the use? They can't compared to renowned Universities like MIT, LSE, Cambridge and Oxford.<br><br>I think is high time for NUS/NTU to reflect on the admission system. Don't just take in those who can perform well academically. They are not as talented as i see.<br><br>*spit* on NUS and NTU<br><br>------------------<br>Love is priceless, either you have it or lost it.</div>

But as NP student, if u can get into local Uni, I"m v proud of u.<br><br>Btw, I'm currently studying in Curtin Uni of Technology-Marketing n Advertising. I graduated frm BS this June 2002. I din get COM....but I scored some ADs, took the SAT test. I din bother to try for local UNI becoz i chose to experience syllabus outside S'pore.<br><br>I get to interact with students from countries all over and it's a great feeling. However, i do feel that good results do play a part.<br><br>To those still in NP, do ur best if u wan to further ur studies.</div>
