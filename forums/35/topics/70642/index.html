            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking of doing a full time dip in either NYP or NP after my national service. I am quite looking forward to it  But one thing that worries me is will i be too old for it? I will be 22 / 23 . Naturually, i heard that there are alot/some of the full time dip students in the various polytechnics who are also in their early or mid 20s. Some are even in their late 20s. But those are just rumors. I have no prior experience with polytechnic lifestyle. So just wanted a feedback from you guys. Will the age of 22 / 23 going into first year full time dip in NP be considered a freak of nature <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Seriously though, feedbacks will be much appreciated.
