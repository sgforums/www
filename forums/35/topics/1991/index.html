            <div class='col-md body'>Look, I have no idea who this girl is, how she dresses or even where this Biotech course takes place. But one thing I do know, she is proud of her looks, or at least does not care what others say of her if she is aware of this page. For that one must admire her for her carefree spirit.<br><br>What's all this talk about the Malay ladies hm? Didn't we skip past all this racist junk a few decades ago?<br><br>Flirt24, if you dislike the sight of her so much, why have you taken so much to observe her and describe her in such great detail, or is most of this just something you cooked up to let off some steam?<br><br>Lion Heart, how do you define dignity anyway? Does dignity mean wearing the same thing as everyone else? Does dignity mean taking the criticism of people one barely knows as the devine words of some all-powerful deity and obeying like a frightened peasant? Cheerio indeed to Mr/Ms Flirt24 for bringing hate to this forum.<br><br>Hm, correct me if I am wrong, but apparently Malay females are rather blessed in the chest area, and you believe it... unconservative? And if I may present this situation, would you have the same views if there was some Chinese/Caucasian/Indian who dressed in such a manner that their clothes "show off" their bosoms?<br><br>Well, once again, objections are very welcome and I will object as well or agree according to circumstances. Thank you.</div>

And somehow... it'll just affect one. No matter how immuned to those comments, i'll still be affected in some ways. Kinda view this society as... chio gals are always before ppl's eyes.. and pple like me are nonexistent... so i hope... people who read this will try to understand how we feel.. especially when guys just pass some silly comments...*not purposely.. but more for fun* Cheerz!</div>
