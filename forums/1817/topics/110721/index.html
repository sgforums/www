            <div class='col-md body'>True vs. False (IV)<br><br>TRUE AND FALSE GOSPEL<br><br>I'd like to first talk to you who don't believe that Jesus Christ is the only way<br>to God. If you say this, then you should just come out and admit that you do not believe the Bible, because Jesus Himself said in John 14:6, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me." So if you think that Buddhism is a path to God, or meditation or some kind of spirituality devoid of Christ is a path to God, you believe a false gospel. You believe that your own works can get you closer to God and put you in communion with God. But here's the truth for all of you who will listen: The ONLY way that a man can be in communion with God is that God's wrath must be appeased toward that person, and that this person must have a perfect righteousness. The ONLY WAY is through the atoning blood and imputed righteousness of Christ. Christ was punished for the sins of His people, and Christ's perfect righteousness is imputed to His people. The ONLY ones who have communion with God are the ones for whom Christ died and to whom God imputes Christ's righteousness. There is no other way.<br><br>I'd now like to talk to you who say you believe that Jesus Christ is the only way to God, but you also believe that Jesus Christ died for every single person without exception. You may be a zealous, sincere, conservative church-goer. You may despise immorality. Yet you're lost. You're just as lost as the person who follows the Buddhist path to god, or even the atheist who's a god unto himself. You believe a false gospel of works salvation. You might protest, "I despise works-salvation! I believe in salvation by grace alone!" Yet what you believe about the work of Christ shows that you are still not submitted to the righteousness of God revealed in the gospel. Let me explain. You believe that Jesus Christ died for every single person without exception. Thus, you believe that Jesus Christ died for those who are in heaven as well as those who are in hell. So what do you believe makes the ultimate difference between heaven and hell? Before you say, "Jesus Christ," think about it. You believe that Jesus Christ died for those in hell. So did the death of Christ make the difference for these people? You might say, "they rejected Christ." So their rejection of Christ is what overrides the death of Christ for them, right? The death of Christ had no effect for them, because the death of Christ did not actually secure ANYTHING for them. So what about those in heaven? Did the death of Christ make the ultimate difference between them and those in hell? Think about it. You believe that Christ died for those in heaven AND those in hell. Thus, you must believe that it is NOT the work of Christ that makes the difference between heaven and hell, since Christ did the same thing for those in heaven as he did for those in hell. So what makes the ultimate difference is what? It is the WORK OF THE PERSON. This is the epitome of the false gospel. You believe that your FAITH is what makes the difference between your going to heaven and your going to hell. You believe that Jesus Christ did all he could do on the cross for everyone without exception, and now it's up to YOU to make the difference. This is absolute blasphemy against God. Do you know how much you trample on the blood of Christ? Do you really know how much you make the blood of Christ of no effect? Think about it! What did the blood of Christ actually ACCOMPLISH? What did it DO, in and of itself? Did it really do ANYTHING? We're talking about the precious blood of Christ here! And you're saying that it did not actually accomplish salvation for all for whom it was intended? What VALUE do you put on the blood of Christ? You put on it no value at all. You spit in the face of Christ and trample on His blood as if it were nothing. You believe in a God who is a liar - who said that his wrath was appeased at the cross, but yet sends to hell some of those for whom his wrath was appeased. Your God punishes the same sins twice - first in the person of Christ and then in the sinner in hell. You also believe in a weak Christ who wishes that everyone without exception would be saved but who is thwarted by the work of mortal man. What a horrendous blasphemy.<br><br>The TRUE GOSPEL is one of Christ's EFFECTUAL WORK. Christ's blood DID accomplish something. It accomplished what Christ intended to accomplish - the salvation of ALL for whom He died on the cross. It is the work of Christ ALONE that makes the only difference between heaven and hell. It is the work of Christ ALONE that appeases God's wrath so that NOT ONE PERSON for whom Christ died will end up in hell. It is the work of Christ ALONE that MAKES SALVATION TOTALLY SURE AND CERTAIN for ALL whom Christ represented on the cross. Anything less is a hellish false gospel - a doctrine of demons. I hope you will see this. I hope you will see how much your gospel casts shame and reproach on the one true gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Lastly, I'd like to address those who say that Jesus Christ is the only way to God and that Christ's death actually accomplished salvation for all whom He represented, yet you say that some who believe that Christ died for everyone are your brothers in Christ. You, too, are lost. 2 John 9-11 says that when you speak peace to such a person, you are a participant in the evil deeds of the one who believes the blasphemy of the false gospel. You are as much a blasphemer as the one who tramples the blood of Christ underfoot. You say you believe the true gospel of sovereign grace, but you do not value it. You do not value it because you do not judge by it. You actually believe that the gospel of universal atonement is the same gospel you believe, even though it might be a little less consistent. You have not yet repented of dead works and idolatry, because what God calls dead works and idolatry, you call works of a believer. You are yet dead in your sins.<br><br>due to post is too long,pls refer such<br><br><a href="http://www.outsidethecamp.org/truefalse4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.outsidethecamp.org/truefalse4.htm</a></div>

At about 5pm more than 100 people arrived at the church in western Sri Lanka and told the pastor to stop holding worship services.<br><br>He was warned that if he did not close down the church, they would kill him. Later that night, the church came under attack with a barrage of stones and rocks. The roof tiles of the church were broken, one door and several windows were also damaged. The police took three people into custody.<br><br>An Assemblies of God church in Yakkala (26km north east of Colombo ) has been attacked several times by people throwing excrement against the walls of the church. The latest incident happened on November 14 at 2.30am. Engine oil was also poured into their well.<br><br>Meanwhile a constitutional amendment is being proposed by the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) party, declaring Buddhism to be the state religion.<br><br>The purpose of the bill (the 19th Amendment) as stated in the Gazette notification of October 29 is "A Bill to amend the Constitution of Sri Lanka; to provide for declaration of Buddhism as the official religion of the Republic; to provide for binding persons practicing Buddhism to bring up their offspring in the same (faith); to provide for prohibiting conversion of Buddhists; to provide for establishing a council to advise the President on such matters and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto."<br><br>While declaring Buddhism to be the State religion, the bill goes on to say that other forms of religion may be practised, "in peace and harmony with Buddha Sasana". Freedom of worship for other religions is subject to public order and morals. Section 9.5 explicitly prohibits converting Buddhists into other forms of worship or to "spread other forms of worship among the Buddhists".<br><br>The Venerable Omalpe Sobhitha MP of the JHU, made a statement on television on December 1 making three demands of the government. These were the appointment of a Presidential commission into the death of  Ven. Gangodawila Soma Thero, closing down all alcohol outlets in supermarkets and specifying a time frame for taking up the government's 'Prohibition of forcible conversions' bill in Parliament for voting.<br><br>The JHU issued an ultimatum to the government that if these demands are not met by 6am on December 12, the JHU will begin a fast-unto-death.<br><br>December 12 is a day of special significance, as it marks the first anniversary of the death of Buddhist monk, the Venerable Gangodawila Soma Thero. The JHU has made clear their intention to select this day to lay down their lives, as a mark of respect for the late monk.<br><br>There is growing concern that the anniversary of Ven. Soma Thero and the JHU's ultimatum will precipitate more violence against Christian churches, following the pattern of the aftermath of his funeral on Christmas Eve 2003. At that time dozens of churches were attacked.<br><br>CSW partners, the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka said in a statement: "There appears to be a deliberate attempt to re-kindle anti-Christian sentiments, disrupting the celebration of Christmas by the Christian community. There may also be those who wish to monopolize on this situation and create trouble. Please pray for the Church and for Sri Lanka ."<br><br>ever heard of some Storm buddhists who have such violence acts!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

Those who practise the Buddhadharma will not have a mind of hatred or likings of violence, and so there had been no violent buddhist coalitions. How can a mind full of compassion towards all sentient beings alike, and not being deluded by doctrines or authority blindly, choose to cause violence and sufferings? No act of Violence, except for layman to defend their countries (e.g NS), in whatever circumstances whether is it to defend its name of Buddhism or something else, is approved in buddhist doctrines at all.<br><br>In history there are no lack of Buddhists who became a Buddhist because of he has seen the sufferings or futility of war. A famous example was a once-ruthless King Ashoka, he had slayed countless enemies and brought India to unity. But later on he had converted to Buddhism after having seen how much miseries he has caused. He later actively promoted Buddhism in India and made Buddhism the state religion. All these info can actually be found in a secondary one history textbook.<br><br><blockquote> It is also very clear that Buddhism was the most influential force in Asoka's life and that he hoped his subjects likewise would adopt his religion. He went on pilgrimages to Lumbini and Bodh Gaya, sent teaching monks to various regions in India and beyond its borders, and he was familiar enough with the sacred texts to recommend some of them to the monastic community. It is also very clear that Asoka saw the reforms he instituted as being a part of his duties as a Buddhist. But, while he was an enthusiastic Buddhist, he was not partisan towards his own religion or intolerant of other religions. He seems to have genuinely hoped to be able to encourage everyone to practice his or her own religion with the same conviction that he practiced his.</blockquote>Again, not saying all Buddhists are perfect, as we don't know who is practising the dharma (what the buddha taught) and who is not.</div>
