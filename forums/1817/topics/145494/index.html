            <div class='col-md body'>The play <span style="font-style: italic;">Macbeth</span> by William Shakespeare inspired the Lost Prophecy in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Harry Potter</span> books, as an interview with JKR recently revealed. In the play, the general Macbeth is accosted by three diviners while returning from war. One addresses him as Thain of Glamis, another calls him the Thain of Cawdor (a post he assumes when his predecessor is relieved of his duty) and the third says he will be King of the Scots. The final prophecy is fulfilled with Duncan's homicide (abetted by Lady Macbeth). Being Duncan's closest blood relation, Macbeth succeeds him as king.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</span>, Sybill Trelawney is revealed as the seer who predicted Voldypoo's downfall in the hands of one lad born at the end of July. Although there is more than one person born at the same time, Voldypoo chooses to go after the one who has a similar heritage as himself. His attempts to kill Harry after mowing down James and Lily fails, and he is forced underground. Albus Dumbledore later tells Harry that he is the Chosen One who will defeat the Dark Lord and restore order to the world. Could it be the reason why Harry survived the Killing Curse?<br><br>Perhaps the legend of Oedipus inspired both plot lines. Oedipus was sent away at a young age because some soothsayer predicted he would kill his father and seize the throne. Sure enough, Oedipus returned to his hometown, usurped his father's throne, killed the old man and married his (Oedipus') own mother without knowing who she was.<br><br>It has got me thinking if Divination is to be trusted or whether prophecies are self-fulfilling. What if someone predicts CSJ will seize power in a coup? Will the SDP chief dare to attempt that operation? If he does, what reason will he give? Surely not that "someone predicted I'd stage a revolution" crap. Also, will the MIW's attempts to prevent this day from coming only hasten its arrival?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't forget that only someone conceived by Caesarian section could kill Macbeth, and that person was none other than Macduff. Macbeth was told to beware of Macduff, so he had the family of the latter massacred. Macduff survived, of course, and delivered the fatal blow to Macbeth and freed Scotland from tyranny.</div>
