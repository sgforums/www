If some kind of energy is involved, where does<br>this energy come from?<br>------------------------------------------------<br>Hi, David !!<br>Well, at first, Einstein thought that the space was NOT<br>expanding, and used in his calculations a factor, named<br>COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT - so that the expansion<br>would be cancelled.<br>Later on he understood that the expansion of the universe<br>really happens. His theory had showed him this fact !!!<br>The shift of the light to the red confirms this expansion.<br>The universe has a constant energy since the beginning.<br>Mankind has lost Fred Hoyle, the scientist who created<br>the expression "Big Bang"  some weeks ago, at the age<br>of 86. He was against the idea of the "Big Bang" to explain<br>the origin of the universe. What really happens is a change<br>of energy from a type to another. Mass is a concentrated form of energy.<br>To explain the expansion of the universe, there is the theory<br>of spontaneous generation of matter, what means, mass<br>appears from energy to fill the space so as to contradict<br>the "Big Bang" theory.<br>But, anyway, the energy of the universe is constant. It was<br>already there at the beginning and is still there today.<br>All that happens is a change in the form of energy.<br>all the best !!!<br>Alcir Grohmann<br><br><a href="http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy00/phy00406.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy00/phy00406.htm</a></div>

Mentally running the expansion backwards, we see that there must have been a point in time when all the matter of the Universe was together in an arbitrarily small volume; the 'event' that created our Universe is known as the Big Bang (a term coined by the English astrophysicist Fred Hoyle in 1950. Hoyle, who championed a rival cosmological theory (steady state), meant the "Big Bang" to be a term of derision, but the name was so catchy that it stuck.). Though the Big Bang suggests a colossal explosion, it wasn't really an "explosion" in the sense that we understand it. Space itself exploded.<br><br><a href="http://kosmoi.com/Science/Astronomy/Cosmology/Big_Bang/" rel="nofollow">http://kosmoi.com/Science/Astronomy/Cosmology/Big_Bang/</a></div>

"It requires new physics beyond the everyday experience."<br><br>The studies led by Fabian and Steve Allen, both from the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, England, suggest that if the universe continues to expand at its current pace, stars could fade from night view in 100 billion years.<br><br><a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/space/2577828" rel="nofollow">http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/space/2577828</a></div>

When the universe was smaller and the density of matter therefore higher, dark energy would have had a negligible effect. Gravity would have exerted its familiar universal attraction, slowing cosmic expansion.<br>Z.
