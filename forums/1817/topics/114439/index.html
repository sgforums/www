Every Individual has their own perspective of everything in this Realm of Existence including religions. A simple analogy, I like coffee but does not necessary mean all will like coffee, some may like tea or other beverages &amp; some may don't even drink any of the beverages. That is probably why there different followers of Various Religions &amp; free thinkers. True or False is perhaps separated by a thin veil, Is it important to know?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>religion is the WAY OF LIFE. it is not solely on spiritual. It consist of everthing.<br><br>Teachings of religions can apply on daily lives and give us motivation, faith to do things</blockquote>It depends on wat is your definition of "real". If u say tat religion is there to fulfil man's insecurity moltivation, faith etc, then there is such a thing as religion. There is such a thing called Islam, Buddhist etc. However if u meant real as in whether does the things a religion proclaim real or not, then my answer is most religion, if not all religion, r not real. The events they claimed and people they mentioned etc r not real, or exaggerated to the point tat no one know which is correct or wrong. They r likely to be manmade and is nothing but superstitious and story writing. In short there is no such thing as god, allah, guanyin or shiva.<br><br>As in the story of santa claus, u can say there is a person called St Nicolas, but he is not the person wearing red, go around the world giving presents to the children who r nice nor do they ask elves to help them make presents etc. There r people who believe in santa claus, but it is not real.<br><br><blockquote>Man now lacks of spiritual food. We have all we want on this earth, but we lack of this 'spiritual food' that make us spiritually hungry now. This is why there is constant sense of insecure in many ppl's life/<br><br></blockquote>So u believe in a religion not because it is real or factual but just because it make u feel at ease ? IMO, it is better for men to face reality and grow stronger instead of escapism and believe in something just because they need to believe.<br><br><blockquote>Religion dun NEED anyone to believe it. Lao Tze, Buddha, Jesus, Mohumad etc..they setup religion, schools, it is for the benefit of mankind, it is their compassion for mankind that led to forming of religion. How noble they are</blockquote>Really ? I can interprete it as a means to control the masses as well. Tat is why religion tat is supported by the politic system r allowed to thrive while the others tat may speak of the truth but against politics r branded as cults and destroyed. U say they r noble, but they may turn out to be mere stories which anybody can write anything they want. I can easily write the trials of a fiction character going through hell 10 million times for men u know.. writing without verification is very easy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Well, very well then. In fact what you mentioned 'facing reality, be strong' etc.. it is already part of the teachings in some religion. </blockquote>Just because it teaches people to do good things doesn't prove it is true. All religion teaches people to do good deeds but it all can't be true since they tell complete different stories like how the world is created or wat happened after death etc.<br><br><blockquote>Control the masses? Lao Tze controls no one and taoism it self had done alot in shaping the oriental culture and wisdom. </blockquote>Shaping the oriental culture is controlling the masses<br><br><blockquote>There are alot of unexplained and paranormal issues out there. Concluding the non-existance of spirits is the same as bragging that the whole univserse contain only mankind and no other 'aliens'. </blockquote>Spirits r the lifeform of Human being after death, and therefore it is not about aliens. If u believe in spirits, u show us the evidence of spirits. U say a lot of unexplained and paranormal issues, but it never show any specified religion to be true<br><br><blockquote>We need to have an open heart to see this. some ppl see 'no' reasons in believing their existance and claim that they are not real..but on the other hand, is there a clear cut evidence that prove their non-existance?</blockquote>Anyone can claims all the crap they want. I can claim a blue rhino makes the universe or in earth there is an existence of a creature with 3 duck heads, lion body, caterpillars legs and a scorpion tail on earth. Can u prove me wrong ? Doesn't it make more sense for the peopel to prove a phenmenon instead of asking people to show a prove of it otherwise.<br><br><blockquote>Religion touches alot on moral values and provide comfort for others. of course religion is more then that, but this is one of their values. </blockquote>But it is a lie and not true. If u believe in a religion u should treat it like a history book. In short, u believe in their theories of life after death or how the world is created etc.  Religion teaches good things just because <strong>if</strong> it is not, they will be treated as a cult and get weeded off by the politic system. All religion teaches good deeds but all can't be true isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Take Taoism for example. not all deities and sages are without verification. many are historical figures and they leave behind great works of wisdom and credits. </blockquote>I am not very clear about taoism but if it tell stories of people capable of flying or transforming themselves into foxes etc, then it is not true. The journey of the west is also based on a real monk. But is it true ?<br><br><blockquote>The contributiong taoism gave include chinese medicine, qi gong, taiji quan, philosophy, culture etc..shows it is NOT mere 'superstious'. </blockquote>Just because it comes out with a set of taiji kongfu doesn't means its theories such as life after death or reincarnation is real. All the relgion in the world can come out with its own portion where it boasts it is correct. But surely it is not possible they all r since they tell of totally different things. A correctness in a part of their teachings does not means everything in it will be right. An error in it, however can shows the whole scripture is unreliable<br></div>

It is prophecised that this current buddha sassana will last for 5000 years. 2500 years have already passed. When the Buddha sassana ends, and this cycle ends, the next Buddha will appear.
