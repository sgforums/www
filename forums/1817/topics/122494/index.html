A Pratyekabuddha means a solitarily enlightened person. Although he is enlightened he does not preach the dharma like Shakyamuni Buddha for 49 years, going throughout his country [India] to teach the truth, with thousands/tens of thousands of monks and nuns disciples. Buddha got enlightened by practising the path of Mahayana/Bodhisattvayana (an example of Bodhisattva [pu sa] we all know is Guan Yin). Lao Tzu wrote what he has realised in only 81 verses, but I think it is a great piece of work.<br><br>However modern Taoism is not only focusing on Lao Tzu's teachings [tao te ching] alone, but is heavily influenced by alchemist and worship of gods and deities. At worst, some of its components have degenerated into the "Gui-Shen realm" of practise. People who are too superstitious on certain aspect, will be reborned as a ghost in the next life because of their links &amp; karma with those spirits during his life. This is not part of the Buddhist path, so that's the huge difference.<br>Xabir took over this account on 15/10/2004.<br><br>Leading moderator in: ~ Buddhism: Wisdom Bliss ~<br></div>

Shakyamuni Buddha is the 4th. Maitreya will appear as Maitreya Buddha [Mi Le Fo] as the 5th Buddha a long time later. He has not come, but many cults stated he has already taken human form attained Buddhahood. In reality Maitreya Bodhisattva (not yet a Buddha) is currently residing in the Tus h i t a Heaven and teaching the truth to the gods (devas). I personally believe he also takes human form on Earth, like the Bu Dai Monk. But at the end of his life, he stated that in his humanly rebirths his identitity is not known and concealed to ordinary men. According to Buddhism the day when Maitreya Buddha attains Buddhahood is still a long time later, during a time which technology allows interstellar travel and lifespan is very long with virtually no diseases. Details can be found in the Buddhist sutra itself if you are interested.<br><br>However, a Pratyekabuddha is in a different path compared to Buddha, therefore he is not considered one of the 1000 Buddhas.<br><br>[This message was edited by An Eternal Now on 2005-02-15 18:12:41.]<br>Xabir took over this account on 15/10/2004.<br><br>Leading moderator in: ~ Buddhism: Wisdom Bliss ~<br></div>

BUT it does not have this only 1 scripture. Taoism has thousand of scriptures written by Sages and immortals. Many of them, but ALL revolve around Tao Te Ching.<br><br>How can we know that? cos those who wrote these classics, are enlightened beings, such as Partirachs Wang chongyang, Qiu Changchun, Lu Dongbin, Zhang Sanfeng etc..<br><br>Some are heavenly divines, passing down these words personally.<br><br>Tao Te Ching does talk about deities and spirits. Worshipping many deities is NOT wrong in Taoism view and certainly still consider orthodox taoism.<br><br>We must see the meaning behind worshipping them.<br><br>Not that most taoist divines, heavenly ones, are ALL enlighthened. only certain lower ranked divines are not, but they still follow the way of heaven, way of tao.<br><br>Superstious come in only ppl have lack of proper knowledge on Taoism and thus add in these unwanted elements.<br><br>Taosim rituals and rites are NOT superstious too. It was the Yellow Emperor who advocate worshipping of heaven, and it was Celestial Master Zhang Daoling that teaches the ppl rituals and magic.<br><br>Rituals and magics are all about easing sufferings, REPENTENCE, blessings and accumulating of merits.<br><br>Achelmy etc..improve standard of living and indirectly assist ppl in learning the way of tao more convienently.<br><br>A healthy body promote and enchance a healthy and clear mind for cultivating.<br><br>Taoism has 3 treasures too, they are the Tao, Jing, and shi, namely the Tao (Lord of Primival aka Yuan shi tian zun), Jing, teachings, scriptures(Lord of Numinous Treasures aka lingbao tian zun) and lastly Shi, Spiritual teachers( Lord of Tao and virtue aka Daode tian zun, tai shang lao jun or lao tze)<br><br>NO rituals or worship in Taoism is complete without acknowledging the 3 treausres. The heavenly Jade Emperor was from the 3 treasures aka three pure ones too. Thus worshipping heaven, is equavilent to worshipping and paying homage to the three pure ones and jade emperor. both represent the ultimate Wuji and Taiji - the tao.<br><br>Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you going to get -- Forrest Gump<br><br>A journey to a thousand mile begins with the first step - Lao Tze<br>http://taoism.sgforums.com<br><br></div>

There is also arguments as to where Buddha was borned exactly. Some say Nepal, some say somewhere in India.<br><br>As for Lao Tzu incarnation, I don't really believe in the different incarnations . When Buddhadharma was almost absorbed to become part of Hinduism about 1000 years after Buddha entered parinirvana, the hindu priests explained that Buddha is one of the incarnations of Vishnu. In fact if memory serves, Buddha is supposedly the 9th of the 10th incarnation of Vishnu to come to Earth. This view is something true Buddhists cannot accept, because Buddha is not a samsaric being like the hindu deities.<br><br>Anyway, I think I will not go further into who is who's incarnation as we don't have the power to go back in time. These are personal beliefs.<br>Xabir took over this account on 15/10/2004.<br><br>Leading moderator in: ~ Buddhism: Wisdom Bliss ~<br><br>Be With Buddha!<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>
