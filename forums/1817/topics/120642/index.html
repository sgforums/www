I have been studying and researching on Vampires for 9 years now. What really upsets me is the misconception and the misleading articles about vampires. I have came upon hundreds of books, movies, stories and people who proclaim themselves to be Vampires in my years of work in this field.<br><br>To be honest with you, 98% of the things you read in books or watch in the movies about Vampires are NOT true. Most of all, the internet doesn't give you the information you need. I have surfed through so many websites about vampires and it really amuses me.<br><br>For example - The legendary way to kill a vampire is by driving a stake through the heart of a vampire. Well, anyone would die from that even if he/she isn't a vampire.<br><br>I will take this oppurtunity to enlighten to the many out there who are having the wrong facts about vampires. For a start, I won't be using the word "Vampire" but "Vampyre". Many might argue that its a name re-spelled for games and role-plays but I think otherwise.<br><br>In my years of work, I have came across goths, posers, wannabes and of course the curious. I saw someone posting about seeing few guys wearing black with their face being pale at city hall. Well, they could be goths. People have often get confused between Gothic Lifestyle and Vampyrsim.<br><br>The Gothic Lifestyle is just a fashion statement or some say sub-culture. It does have the roots connected to darkness but not to Vampyrsim. There are also articles saying that Vampyres carry a book known as The Book of Nod. Which is nothing more than a myth. The Book of Nod does'nt even exist in this face of Earth.<br><br>The common MYTHS about Vampyres are :<br><br>1- Vampyres fear sunlight...<br>2- Vampyres fear garlic...<br>3- Vampyres fear holy water...<br>4- Vampyres suck and survive on blood...<br>5- Vampyres have fangs...<br>6- Vampyres are immortal...<br>7- Vampyres can shapeshift - like turn to bats and such...<br>8- Vampyres have super human senses...<br>9- Vampyres are soldiers to Satan and connected to Satanism...<br>10- Vampyres are killed by driving a stake through the heart...<br><br>All of the above are nothing but myths and it really amuses me of how, a few well crafted rumours about Vampyres have taken the world by storm.<br><br>Vampyres or Vampyrism is in fact a forbidden knowledge and culture. What are Vampyres? They are just like us, living breathing beings who have their regular food, day in and out to survive. They don't go around sucking blood. The movies have made it so. Vampyres die too, they are not immortals. Everything that breathes, will die one day. Most of all, Vampyrism is not a religion. They can't shapeshift - imagine a whole body mass turning into a bat. Where does the other excess of body mass goes to? Sunlight, garlic and the holy water have no effect on Vampyres. There are people who are allergic to sunlight and its a medical condition. Does that make them a Vampyre? Garlic and holy water - God knows who came up with that idea in Hollywood.<br><br>As i have said, driving a stake through the heart of a Vampyre kills it. It will kill you too. Satanism and Vampyrism are never connected. Vampyres are known to be the rebels - therefore got the name as the "undead". They are known to fight against all odds, fighting against Hell and Heaven. They don't have a religion, so how could they be satanist if they fight against hell.<br><br>To my understanding, Vampyres do exist, but its not how they look or dress as you might think. They work, eat and sleep (Yes, they sleep at night too). So you might be asking, what makes a Vampyre a Vampyre? Well its the belief and the knowledge of their culture they carry on. In the historical time, trouble makers are often labelled as blood suckers in the society. I am sure even nowadays, some of our parents call us blood suckers. If translated in some foreign language like greek if I am not wrong, blood sucker comes as "Vampyr" - Broken down in English would be "Vampire".<br><br>So, these Vampyres being the outcast of society need some secrecy to survive in the society itself. They need to mingle with the crowd without exposing who they are. And that secrecy is being followed till today. Of course there are some who don't follow that and their identity get exposed but not their belief. Its just a "custom" and culture for them.<br><br>Vampyres in the movies and books are not what they are. Hollywood is making money by pushing their imagination of a blood sucking rebel or should I say a trouble maker...<br><br>There are many things I have not covered in Vampyrsim in my years of research. If any of you do have a question, do post one here. I would be pleased to clear your doubts.<br><br>hahhahaha<br><br>[This message was edited by water_rat on 2005-01-06 16:34:36.]<br>Would you sing a song for me of "WonDerin" !<br><br>wouldn't you :&gt;<a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*ahem* Actually, vampires isn't how you do things.<br><br>It does have to do with partaking of blood. It has nothing to do with Satanism but something to do with ancient shamanic practices. In ancient Rome, people worship Mithras, the god of soldier. It was in the early 8th century that a deviant group from these worshippers were discovered drinking 'blood' as ties between their brotherhood. Enemies would even sit together, drinking each others' blood mixed with water and salt as a symbol of their brotherhood in their places of worship.<br><br>Sources?
