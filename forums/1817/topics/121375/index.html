To me, datuk is a malay term and seems from the above picture ...a muslim? then how can Islam, a monotheistic religion come out with such deity worship? is it some deviated islamic teachings or is it well known and accepted.<br><br></div>

And this is what is unique about Taoism and thus it is able to embrace alot of things and tolerate alot of issues.<br><br>Look at any Taoist rituals, study them and you will realize that every rituals target diff deities group. and these deities that are invited and add up to hundredth, depending on the size of the rituals.<br><br>And the point i mentioned earlier, on righteous, upright spirit as deities, is a very important concept in the spiritual part of the religion. Without that, the number of deities in Taoism will at least 'decreased' by half.<br><br>Worship of the great soil, earth, land, started with a main deity (hou tu, goddess/deity of soil), but slowly, it become that every district has a tu di gong(earth deity) that report directly of the command of the Goddess of Soil(hou tu). Some of these earth deities are past sage and great men.<br><br>Allah, Christ etc.. Taoism RECONGIZED them, in fact as divines, spiritual deities. Worthy of worship. However ,the mutual respect comes in, cos out of respect, it is not appropriate to include them in the Taoist panthon.<br>Taoists have no problem in bowing, paying respect to any of them, if there is a need, out of respect etc..<br><br>It is ONLY in Taoist temples, one sees deities, Buddhas from Buddhism, Confuciusm etc.. This is respect, this is tolerance and embracement.<br><br>But because they are founders or God of other faith, it is best to remain a 'distant' out of respect.<br><br>However, although Taoism and Taoist recongnized them, it is also impt that Taoism/Taoists only recongnized them as Divines, worthy of respect but their way of seeking the  truth, the path is DIFFERENT from Taoism and thus there is a need to differentiate too. And it is only to distingush which is which, which is the Taoist path and other path, and no conflict is to be involved because there is no need for that as all is seeking the Truth.</div>
