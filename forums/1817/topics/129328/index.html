            <div class='col-md body'>Is the mental disorder due to a chemical disorder? And is the chemical disorder due, in its turn, to psychological distresses affecting the adrenals? It would be rash and premature to affirm it. The most we can say is that some kind of a prima facie case has been made out. Meanwhile the clue is being systematically followed, the sleuthsÂ—biochemists , psychiatrists, psychologistsÂ—are on the trail.<br><br><a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/doors.htm#target1" rel="nofollow">http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/doors.htm#target1</a><br><br>Be Blessed.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Enjoy!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lo, the poor Indian, whose untutored mind<br>Clothes him in front, but leaves him bare behind.<br><br>"If you started in the wrong way," I said in answer to the investigator's questions, "everything that happened would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It would all be self-validating, You couldn't draw a breath without knowing it was part of the plot."<br>"So you think you know where madness lies?"<br>My answer was a convinced and heartfelt, "Yes."<br>"And you couldn't control it?"<br>"No I couldn't control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on to the conclusion."<br>"Would you be able," my wife asked, "to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of The Dead calls the Clear Light?"<br>I was doubtful.<br>"Would it keep the evil away, if you could hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?"<br>I considered the question for some time. "Perhaps," I answered at last, "perhaps I couldÂ—but only if there were somebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's the point, I suppose, of the Tibetan ritualÂ—someone sitting there all the time and telling you what's what."<br><br>After listening to the record of this part of the experiment, I took down my copy of Evans-Wentz's edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and opened at random. "O nobly born, let not thy mind be distracted." That was the problemÂ—to remain undistracted. Undistracted by the memory of past sins, by imagined pleasure, by the bitter aftertaste of old wrongs and humiliations, by all the fears and hates and cravings that ordinarily eclipse the Light. What those Buddhist monks did for the dying and the dead, might not the modern psychiatrist do for the insane? Let there be a voice to assure them, by day and even while they are asleep, that in spite of all the terror, all the bewilderment and confusion, the ultimate Reality remains unshakably itself and is of the same substance as the inner light of even the most cruelly tormented mind. By means of such devices as recorders, clock-controlled switches, public address systems and pillow speakers it should be very easy to keep the inmates of even an understaffed institution constantly reminded of this primordial fact. Perhaps a few of the lost souls might in this way be helped to win some measure of control over the universeÂ—at once beautiful and appalling, but always other than human, always totally incomprehensible-in which they find themselves condemned to live.<br><br><a href="http://www.thebigview.com/discussion/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=3&amp;t=189&amp;s=99810d76a80a83e5b70ff4ae4092450c&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigview.com/discussion/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=3&amp;t=189&amp;s=99810d76a80a83e5b70ff4ae4092450c<br></a></div>
