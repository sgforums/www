              <p id="article_credit">TOKYO —</p>
              <p>Nobuyuki Tsujii, a blind Japanese pianist who shared the first prize at the 
              13th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, Texas, returned 
              home recently and said he was relieved to be back.</p>
              <p>The 20-year-old Tsujii, who said he rarely cries but tears welled up in his 
              eyes at the award ceremony, then went home for the first time in quite a 
              while.</p>
              <p>But he said he was a little bewildered by all the fuss surrounding him. In 
              response to reporters’ questions, Tsujii said, ‘‘Although I am blind, I am 
              satisfied as I can see with mental eyes,’’ adding his next objective is to 
              become a ‘‘pianist of high caliber.’’<br><br>‘‘I would like people to listen to 
              my performance just as a pianist,’’ he added.<br><br>Tsujii was born blind; his 
              father Takashi is an obstetrician and gynecologist, and his mother Itsuko is a 
              former announcer.<br><br>He was late both in beginning to walk and speak. But 
              while the Tokyo-born Tsujii was still crawling at age 2 years and 3 months, he 
              started playing a toy piano.<br><br>He grew up as a boy who did not feel at ease 
              without a piano near him.<br><br>While traveling overseas, Tsujii heard a piano 
              at a shopping center and approached it, hoping to play it. A sales clerk let him 
              try it, and when he performed, he received thunderous ovation from shoppers, 
              finding out how enjoyable it was to play a piano in front of others.<br><br>When 
              he is not playing piano, he is a karaoke-loving university junior. He likes 
              ‘‘enka’’ and pop singers Kiyoshi Hikawa and Yosui Inoue, and goes to karaoke 
              places with his friends.<br><br>After he received the award June 7 to become the 
              first Japanese to win the Van Cliburn prize, there has been a rush of orders for 
              his recordings such as ‘‘Debut,’’ and concert tickets have been sold 
              out.<br><br>Yukio Yokoyama, his piano teacher since junior high school, said, 
              ‘‘I want people to watch how he, having started his musical career with the 
              prize, will mature from now on.’’</p>
