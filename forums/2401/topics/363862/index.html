              <p id="paragrah">Kabuki actor and designated Living National Treasure Sakata 
              Tojuro (b. 1931) stages an opera, for the first time in his career, this month 
              at the New National Theatre.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><img src="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/images/photos2009/ft20090612a1a.jpg" alt="News photo"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 10px;"><strong>Traditions combined: Sakata Tojuro helps Akie Amou prepare for her performance as Kaede in "Shuzenji Monogatari." </strong>YOSHIAKI MIURA PHOTO</span></p>
              <p>"At first, I politely refused the commission, as opera is a 
              closed book to me," says Tojuro, recalling the moment, around a year and a half 
              ago, when he was asked to stage the opera by the theater's artistic director 
              Hiroshi Wakasugi (b. 1935), a close friend of his.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"Shuzenji Monogatari," composed by Japanese musician Osamu 
              Shimizu (1911-86) and premiered in 1954, is based on a <em>shin</em>-kabuki 
              (new-style kabuki) play written by Japanese author Kido Okamoto (1872-1939).</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Unlike classical kabuki of the Edo Period (1603-1867), which was 
              written by staff from each theater for specific kabuki stars, since the end of 
              the 19th century, shin-kabuki has been created by outside authors independent of 
              any theater.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"Shuzenji Monogatari" is set at the beginning of the Kamakura 
              Period (1185-1333) and tells the story of a mask-maker named Yashao, and his 
              daughter, Katsura. Yashao, a resident of Shuzenji village on the Izu Peninsula 
              in today's Shizuoka Prefecture, was ordered by former Shogun Yoriie to carve his 
              face into a mask. Yoriie has been expelled by the Kamakura Shogunate and is 
              confined in this remote little village. Yashao tries to produce the carving 
              again and again, but each attempt leaves the mask with a look of death, and so 
              Yoriie is not presented with the mask. Frustrated at being kept waiting, Yoriie 
              visits Yashao, but the mask maker refuses to show him his work. Then, his 
              daughter, Katsura, who longs to marry a knight or a court noble — very different 
              from her younger sister Kaede, who has already married Haruhiko, a apprentice of 
              her father — shows the mask to Yoriie. Satisfied, Yoriie takes the mask with 
              him, as well as the beautiful Katsura as his wife.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">That evening, a group of samurai commanded by the Hojo family in 
              Kamakura approach to assassinate Yoriie. Katsura, in love with Yoriie, fights 
              bravely against the attack, putting on the mask to disguise herself as him. 
              Yoriie is killed. Katsura, seriously wounded, runs away to her father's house, 
              where Yashao sketches her face as a model of a young woman at the moment of 
              death.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"I performed as Katsura when I was a teenager," says Tojuro, who 
              played in "Shuzenji Monogatari" under the direction of Tetsuji Takechi, who 
              would later direct the opera version as well. Tojuro was guided by Ichikawa 
              Jukai, who performed the role of Katsura at the premiere of the kabuki play in 
              1911.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"So I could say that I have had a connection with this work since 
              its inception. My teacher Jukai explained to me the spirit of each character in 
              the story and what I learned from him is embedded in my mind to this day, " says 
              Tojuro.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"Perhaps Wakasugi knew I had had such an experience. He told me 
              that he wanted to let a kabuki expert direct this opera, as it is based on a 
              kabuki story. Wakasugi's intention was to give the opera as much of a kabuki 
              flavor as he possibly could."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">So Tojuro is going to adopt the elements of kabuki to this opera, 
              from words and gestures to makeup, costumes, wigs and the stage sets.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"It will be interesting to produce an opera that includes 
              elements of kabuki. It could be an authentic Japanese opera, something different 
              from what is produced overseas."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">That was the reason why Tojuro undertook this commission. In 
              addition, he was happy to be able to collaborate with his friend Wakasugi as 
              conductor, an undertaking that was, however, sadly canceled because of 
              Wakasugi's deteriorating health.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The story demonstrates complicated emotional conflict between a 
              father and his daughter. Yashao, the father who is proud of being a talented 
              artisan; and Katsura, his daughter who has a high opinion of herself and does 
              not want to stay in the poverty-stricken countryside as an artisan's 
              daughter.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"Katsura is a very strong-minded woman. In the last scene, Yashao 
              says, 'Katsura, show me your face,' and she replies, 'Ai,' which means 'Yes, 
              father.' This is her final word before her death, telling her father to look at 
              her dying face. I was often told by my teacher Jukai that my way of saying this 
              'Ai' is too weak to express Katsura's strong character," recounts Tojuro.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Katsura resists her father and rebels against her position in 
              life. Yashao, when informed about Yoriie's death, bursts out in joyful laughter, 
              saying: "It was not my hands that faltered. Yoriie's death at the hands of an 
              assassin could be seen in the mask I carved as an unmistakable mask of death." 
              Then Katsura says, also proudly with a smile, "I am the greatest lady myself 
              now. . . . I do not regret dying."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"It is a strong character, very different from traditional female 
              roles in kabuki," Tojuro says.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">" 'Shuzenji Monogatari' is a new kabuki work, and I think that 
              Shimizu was inspired by its new idea to compose an opera based on it. His music 
              is wonderful, adapting the rhythm and intonation of Japanese words written by 
              Okamoto."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">As a leading kabuki figure, Tojuro often performs overseas with 
              his troupe Chikamatsu-za.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"We provide subtitles or earphones so our work can be translated 
              into the local language. It depends on countries. But foreign audiences, who are 
              interested in theater and Japanese culture, seem to be well informed about the 
              story line in advance and they enjoy the characters that emerge in the live 
              performances, even though they don't understand Japanese," Tojuro comments.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"On tour, we face Western customs, such as curtain calls and 
              standing ovations, which do not exist in our kabuki world. It is unusual for us 
              to appear on stage again and again just after suicide scenes at the end of 
              stories. But we have got used to it," Tojuro says with smile.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"When I first met the singers and staff members who were set to 
              work on this opera, I said, 'If we perform this successfully, we could take it 
              overseas." Everybody laughed, but I hope that we can create an original Japanese 
              opera. It is my honor to work on such a project."</p>
