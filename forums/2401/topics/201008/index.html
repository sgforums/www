            <div class='col-md body'>On 28 July ,we celebrate the Greatest Composer of the Baroque Era<br><br>Johann Sebastian Bach<br><br>I hold a collection of his concertos ,and suites,interested person please pm<br>for your email<br><br>i will send a MP3 filelist upon request<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/JSBach.jpg/179px-JSBach.jpg"><br><br>Bach" redirects here. For other uses, see Bach (disambiguation).<br>Johann Sebastian Bach (pronounced [ˈyohan zɛˈbastjan ˈbax]) (21 March 1685 O.S. Â– 28 July 1750 N.S.) was a prolific German composer and organist whose sacred and secular works for choir, orchestra and solo instruments drew together the strands of the baroque genre and brought it to its ultimate maturity. Although he introduced no new forms, he enriched the prevailing German style with a robust contrapuntal technique, a control of harmonic and motivic organisation from the smallest to the largest scales, and the adaptation of rhythms and textures from abroad, particularly Italy and France. Many people consider him to be the greatest Baroque composer, and one of the greatest composers of all time. He was one of the leading figures, along with the likes of George Frideric Handel, in the transition from baroque to Classical music.<br><br>Revered for their intellectual depth, technical command and artistic beauty, J.S. Bach's works include the Brandenburg concertos, the keyboard suites and partitas, the Mass in B Minor, the St. Matthew Passion, The Musical Offering, The Art of Fugue and a large number of cantatas, of which about 220 survive. An example of some of these stylistic traits appears below, in the chorus Ehre sei Gott in der HÃ¶he from the Christmas Oratorio, written in 1734 during his mature period.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Main articles: BWV, and List of Compositions by Bach.<br>J.S. BachÂ’s works are indexed with BWV numbers, an initialism for Bach Werke Verzeichnis (Bach Works Catalogue). The catalogue, published in 1950, was compiled by Wolfgang Schmieder. The catalogue is organised thematically, rather than chronologically: BWV 1Â–224 are cantatas, BWV 225Â–249 the large-scale choral works, BWV 250Â–524 chorales and sacred songs, BWV 525Â–748 organ works, BWV 772Â–994 other keyboard works, BWV 995Â–1000 lute music, BWV 1001Â–40 chamber music, BWV 1041Â–71 orchestral music, and BWV 1072Â–1126 canons and fugues. In compiling the catalogue, Schmieder largely followed the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe, a comprehensive edition of the composer's works that was produced between 1850 and 1905. For a list of works catalogued by BWV number, see List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach.<br><br>[edit]<br>Organ works<br>Bach was best known during his lifetime as an organist, organ consultant, and composer of organ works both in the traditional German free genres such as preludes, fantasias, and toccatas, and stricter forms such as chorale preludes and fugues. He established a reputation at a young age for his great creativity and ability to integrate aspects of several different national styles into his organ works. A decidedly North German influence was exerted by Georg BÃ¶hm, whom Bach came in contact with in LÃ¼neburg, and Dieterich Buxtehude in LÃ¼beck, whom the young organist visited in 1704 on an extended leave of absence from his job in Arnstadt. Around this time Bach also copied the works of numerous French and Italian composers in order to gain insights into their compositional languages, and later even arranged several violin concertos by Vivaldi and others for organ. His most productive period (1708Â–14) saw not only the composition of several pairs of preludes and fugues and toccatas and fugues, but also the writing of the OrgelbÃ¼chlein ("Little Organ Book", an unfinished collection of forty-nine short chorale preludes intended to demonstrate various compositional techniques that could be used in setting chorale tunes. After he left Weimar, Bach's output for organ fell off, although his most well-known works (the six trio sonatas, the ClavierÃ¼bung III of 1739, and the "Great Eighteen" chorales, revised very late in his life) were all composed after this time. Bach was also extensively engaged later in his life in consulting on various organ projects, testing newly built organs, and dedicating organs in afternoon recitals.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[edit]<br>Other keyboard works<br>Bach wrote many works for the harpsichord, some of which may also have been played on the clavichord. Many of his keyboard works are anthologies that show an eagerness to encompass whole theoretical systems in an encyclopaedic fashion, as it were.<br><br>The Well-Tempered Clavier, Books 1 and 2 (BWV 846Â–893). Each book comprises a prelude and fugue in each of the 24 major and minor keys (thus, the whole collection is often referred to as Â‘the 48Â’). Â“Well-temperedÂ” in the title refers to the temperament (system of tuning); many temperaments before BachÂ’s time were not flexible enough to allow compositions to move through more than just a few keys.<br>The 15 Inventions and 15 Sinfonias (BWV 772Â–801). These are short two- and three-part contrapuntal works arranged in order of key signatures of increasing sharps and flats, omitting some of the less used ones. The pieces were intended by Bach for instructional purposes.<br>Three collections of dance suites: the English Suites (BWV 806Â–811), the French Suites (BWV 812Â–817) and the Partitas for keyboard (BWV 825Â–830). Each collection contains six suites built on the standard model (AllemandeÂ–CouranteÂ–SarabandeÂ–(optional movement)Â–Gigue). The English Suites closely follow the traditional model, adding a prelude before the allemande and including a single movement between the sarabande and the gigue. The French Suites omit preludes, but have multiple movements between the sarabande and the gigue. The partitas expand the model further with elaborate introductory movements and miscellaneous movements between the basic elements of the model.<br>The Goldberg Variations (BWV 98, an aria with thirty variations. The collection has a complex and unconventional structure: the variations build on the bass line of the aria, rather than its melody, and musical canons are interpolated according to a grand plan.<br>Miscellaneous pieces such as the Overture in the French Style (French Overture, BWV 831) Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue (BWV 903), and the Italian Concerto (BWV 971).<br>Among BachÂ’s lesser known keyboard works are seven toccatas (BWV 910Â–916), four duets (BWV 802Â–805), sonatas for keyboard (BWV 963Â–967), the Six Little Preludes (BWV 933Â–93 and the Aria variata alla maniera italiana (BWV 989).<br><br>[edit]<br>Orchestral and chamber music<br>Bach wrote music for single instruments, duets and small ensembles. Bach's works for solo instruments Â– the six sonatas and partitas for violin (BWV1001Â–1006), the six cello suites (BWV 1007Â–1012) and the Partita for solo flute (BWV1013) Â– may be listed among the most profound works in the repertoire. Bach has also composed a suite and several other works for solo lute. He wrote trio sonatas; solo sonatas (accompanied by continuo) for the flute and for the viola da gamba; and a large number of canons and ricercare, mostly for unspecified instrumentation. The most significant examples of the latter are contained in The Art of Fugue and The Musical Offering.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bach's best-known orchestral works are the Brandenburg concertos, so named because he submitted them in the hope of gaining employment from the Margrave of Brandenburg in 1721. (His application was unsuccessful.) These works are examples of the concerto grosso genre. Other surviving works in the concerto form include two violin concertos; a concerto for two violins, often referred to as BachÂ’s "double" concerto; and concertos for one, two, three and even four harpsichords. It is widely accepted that many of the harpsichord concertos were not original works, but arrangements of his concertos for other instruments now lost. A number of violin, oboe and flute concertos have been reconstructed from these. In addition to concertos, Bach also wrote four orchestral suites, a series of stylised dances for orchestra. The work now known as the Air on the G string, for instance, is an arrangement for the violin made in the nineteenth century from the second movement of the Orchestral Suite No. 3.<br><br>[edit]<br>Vocal and choral works<br>Bach performed a cantata every Sunday at the Thomaskirche, on a theme corresponding to the lectionary readings of the week. Although he performed cantatas by other composers, he also composed at least three entire sets of cantatas, one for each Sunday and holiday of the church year, at Leipzig, in addition to those composed at MÃ¼hlhausen and Weimar. In total he wrote more than 300 sacred cantatas, of which only about 195 survive.<br><br>His cantatas vary greatly in form and instrumentation. Some of them are only for a solo singer; some are single choruses; some are for grand orchestras, some only a few instruments. A very common format, however, includes a large opening chorus followed by one or more recitative-aria pairs for soloists (or duets), and a concluding chorale. The recitative is part of the corresponding Bible reading for the week and the aria is a contemporary reflection on it. The concluding chorale often also appears as a chorale prelude in a central movement, and occasionally as a cantus firmus in the opening chorus as well. The best known of these cantatas are Cantata No. 4 ("Christ lag in Todesbanden", Cantata No. 80 ("Ein' feste Burg", Cantata No. 140 ("Wachet auf" and Cantata No. 147 ("Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben".<br><br>In addition, Bach wrote a number of secular cantatas, usually for civic events such as weddings. The two Wedding Cantatas and the Coffee Cantata, which concerns a girl whose father will not let her marry until she gives up her coffee addiction, are among the best known of these.<br><br>BachÂ’s large choral-orchestral works include the famous St Matthew Passion and St John Passion, both written for Holy Week services at the St ThomasÂ’s Church, the Christmas Oratorio (a set of six cantatas for use in the Liturgical season of Christmas). The Magnificat in two versions (one in E-flat major, with extra movements interpolated among the movements of the Magnificat text, and the later and better-known version in D major) and the Easter Oratorio compare to large, elaborated cantatas, of a lesser extent than the Passions and the Christmas Oratorio.</div>
