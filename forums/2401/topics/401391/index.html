              <p>hello syncopation_music,</p>
              <p>i was looking through some of your posts and i realised that you're a private tutor who teaches a wide range of subjects, including English. However, I was (and still am) very disturbed by the fact that your written English is chock-full of grammatical errors. This would have a severe impact on your tutees' command of the English language and affect their grades adversely. I'm sure you're aware that language flaws are hard to correct, and it would be hard for your tutees to correct the language flaws that came about as a result of what you taught them.</p>
              <p>At the same time, I noticed that you were previously unable to solve a number of primary school maths problems, despite them being pretty easy, which led to a user commenting that your practices were unethical. I must say that there certainly is such truth in this statement. If the questions were genuinely difficult, I would have nothing to say. But they were not!</p>
              <p>I hope you get what I am trying to say. Don't harm your students and their future. Teach only those subjects which you really have the ability to teach. I believe that you'll do the right thing, considering that you honestly do seem to have passion for teaching, and I wish you all the best!</p>
