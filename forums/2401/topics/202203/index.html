            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/Vivaldi.jpg/210px-Vivaldi.jpg"><br><br>Biography<br>Antonio Lucio Vivaldi was born on March 4, 1678 in Venice, Italy. He was baptized immediately at his home by the midwife due to "danger of death" . It is not determined what that means, but it probably referred to the infant's poor health or the earthquake that shook the city that day. Vivaldi's official church baptism (at least, the rites which remained other than the actual baptism itself) did not take place until two months later. His father, Giovanni Battista, a barber before becoming a professional violinist, taught him to play violin at first and then toured Venice playing violin with his son. Vivaldi had a medical problem which he called the tightening of the chest (probably some form of asthma). His medical problem, however, did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing and taking part in the prescribed musical activities. At the age of 15 (1693), he began studying to become a priest. In 1703, at the age of 25, Vivaldi was ordained as a priest, soon nicknamed Il Prete Rosso, "The Red Priest," probably because of his red hair.<br><br>Not long after, in 1704, he was given a dispensation from celebrating the Holy Mass because of his ill health. In late 1706 he withdrew from the priesthood and became maestro di violino at an orphanage for girls called the Pio Ospedale della PietÃ  in Venice. Shortly after his appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too; Vivaldi wrote for them most of his concertos, cantatas, and sacred music. In 1705, the first collection (Raccolta) of his works was published. Many others would follow. At the orphanage he covered several different duties, only interrupting them for his many travels. In 1709, he was let go for economic reasons but in 1711, he was offered the job again and in 1713, became responsible for the musical activity of the institute.<br><br>Vivaldi was promoted to maestro de' concerti in 1716. It was during these years that Vivaldi wrote much of his music, including many operas and concertos. In 1718, Vivaldi began to travel. Despite his frequent travels, the PietÃ  paid him to write two concertos a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least four times when in Venice. The PietÃ 's records show that he was paid for 140 concertos between 1723 and 1729.<br><br>Most of his repertoire was rediscovered only in the first half of the 20th century in Turin and Genoa and was published in the second half. Vivaldi's music is innovative, breaking a consolidated tradition in schemes; he gave brightness to the formal and the rhythmic structure of the concerto, repeatedly looking for harmonic contrasts and invented innovative melodies and themes. Moreover, Vivaldi was able to compose non-academic music, particularly meant to be appreciated by the wide public and not only by an intellectual minority. The joyful appearance of his music reveals in this regard a transmissible joy of composing. These are among the causes of the vast popularity of his music. This popularity soon made him famous in other countries such as France which was, at the time, very independent concerning its musical taste.<br><br></div>
