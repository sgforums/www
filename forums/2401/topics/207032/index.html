For other uses, see Haydn (disambiguation).<br>Franz Joseph Haydn[1] (March 31 or April 1, 1732 Â– May 31, 1809) was one of the most prominent composers of the Classical period, called the "Father of the Symphony" and "Father of the String Quartet".<br><br>A life-long resident of Austria, Haydn spent most of his career as a court musician for the wealthy EszterhÃ¡zy family on their remote estate. Being isolated from other composers and trends in music until the later part of his long life, he was, as he put it, "forced to become original".<br><br>Joseph Haydn was the brother of Michael Haydn, himself a highly regarded composer, and Johann Evangelist Haydn, a tenor.<br><br>Portrait by Thomas Hardy, 1792Contents [hide]<br>1 Life<br>1.1 Childhood<br>1.2 Struggles as a freelancer<br>1.3 The years as Kapellmeister<br>1.4 The London journeys<br>1.5 Final years in Vienna<br>2 Character and appearance<br>3 Works<br>3.1 Structure and character of the music<br>3.2 Evolution of Haydn's style<br>4 Catalogues<br>5 Notes<br>6 See also<br>6.1 Works<br>6.1.1 Overviews<br>6.1.2 Articles on works by Joseph Haydn<br>6.2 Contemporaries<br>6.3 Other topics<br>7 Further reading<br>8 External links<br><br>[edit]<br>Life<br>[edit]<br>Childhood<br>Joseph Haydn was born in 1732 in the Austrian village of Rohrau near the Hungarian border. His father was Matthias Haydn, a wheelwright who also served as "Marktrichter", an office akin to village mayor. Haydn's mother, the former Maria Koller, had previously worked as a cook in the palace of Count Harrach, the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau. Neither parent could read music. However, Matthias was an enthusiastic folk musician, who during the journeyman period of his career had taught himself to play the harp. According to Haydn's later reminiscences, his childhood family was extremely musical, and frequently sang together and with their neighbors.<br><br>Haydn's parents were perceptive enough to notice that their son was musically talented and knew that in Rohrau he would have no chance to obtain any serious musical training. It was for this reason that they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Franck, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in Hainburg, that Haydn be apprenticed to Franck in his home to train as a musician. Haydn thus went off with Franck to Hainburg (ten miles away) and never again lived with his parents. At the time he was not quite six.<br><br>Life in the Franck household was not easy for Haydn, who later remembered being frequently hungry as well as constantly humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing. However, he did begin his musical training there, and soon was able to play both harpsichord and violin. The people of Hainburg were soon hearing him sing treble parts in the church choir.<br><br>There is reason to think that Haydn's singing impressed those who heard him, because two years later (1740), he was brought to the attention of Georg von Reutter, the director of music in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, who was touring the provinces looking for talented choirboys. Haydn passed his audition with Reutter, and soon moved off to Vienna, where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister, the last four in the company of his younger brother Michael.<br><br>Like Franck before him, Reutter didn't always bother to make sure Haydn was properly fed. The young Haydn greatly looked forward to performances before aristocratic audiences, where the singers sometimes had the opportunity to satisfy their hunger by devouring the refreshments. Reutter also did little to further his choristers' musical education. However, St. Stephen's was at the time one of the leading musical centers in Europe, with many performances of new music by leading composers. Haydn was able to learn a great deal by osmosis simply by serving as a professional musician there.<br><br>[edit]<br>Struggles as a freelancer<br>In 1749, Haydn had matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts. On a weak pretext, he was summarily dismissed from his job. He evidently spent one night homeless on a park bench, but was taken in by friends and began to pursue a career as a freelance musician. During this arduous period, which lasted ten years, Haydn worked many different jobs, including valetÂ–accompanist for the Italian composer NicolÃ² Porpora, from whom he later said he learned "the true fundamentals of composition". He laboured to fill the gaps in his training, and eventually wrote his first string quartets and his first opera. During this time Haydn's professional reputation gradually increased.<br><br>[edit]<br>The years as Kapellmeister<br>Portrait by Ludwig Guttenbrunn, ca. 1770In 1759 (1757 according to the New Grove Encyclopedia), Haydn received his first important position, that of Kapellmeister (music director) for Count Karl von Morzin. In this capacity, he directed the count's small orchestra, and for this ensemble wrote his first symphonies. Count Morzin soon suffered financial reverses that forced him to dismiss his musical establishment, but Haydn was quickly offered a similar job (1761) as assistant Kapellmeister to the EszterhÃ¡zy family, one of the wealthiest and most important in the Austrian Empire. When the old Kapellmeister, Gregor Werner, died in 1766, Haydn was elevated to full Kapellmeister.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn</a></div>
