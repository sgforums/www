His piano, chamber-music and orchestral works have become staples of repertoire.<br><br>Ravel's piano compositions, such as Miroirs and Gaspard de la Nuit, are virtuosic, and his orchestrations, as in Daphnis et ChloÃ© and his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, are notable for their effective use of tonal color and variety of sound and instrumentation.<br><br>To the general public, Ravel is probably best known for his orchestral work, BolÃ©ro, which he considered trivial and once described as "a piece for orchestra without music."<br><br>According to Sacem, Ravel's estate earns more royalties than that of any other French musician.<br><br>Contents [hide]<br>1 Biography<br>2 Musical style<br>3 Musical Influence<br>4 Notable compositions<br>5 Media<br>6 See also<br>7 External links<br>8 References<br><br>[edit] Biography<br>Ravel was born in Ciboure, France near Biarritz, part of the French Basque region, bordering on Spain. His mother, Marie Delouart, was Basque while his father, Joseph Ravel, was a Swiss inventor and industrialist. A few of Joseph's inventions are quite important; among them are an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, "The Whirlwind of Death" (an automotive loop-the-loop that was quite a hit in the early 1900s). After the family moved to Paris, Ravel's younger brother Edouard was born. At seven years old, young Maurice began piano lessons and composed pieces beginning about five or six years later. His parents encouraged his musical pursuits and sent him to the Conservatoire de Paris, first as a preparatory student and eventually as a piano major. During his schooling in Paris, Ravel joined with a number of innovative young artists who referred to themselves as the "Apaches" ("hooligans") because of their wild abandon. The group was well known for its drunken revelry.<br><br>He studied music at the Conservatoire under Gabriel FaurÃ© for a remarkable fourteen years. During his years at the conservatory, Ravel tried numerous times to win the prestigious Prix de Rome, but to no avail. After a scandal involving his loss of the prize in 1905 (to Victor Gallois), even though he was considered the favourite to win that year, Ravel left the conservatory. The incidentÂ—named the Ravel Affair by the Parisian pressÂ—also led to the resignation of the Conservatoire's director, ThÃ©odore Dubois.<br></div>
