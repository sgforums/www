            <div class='col-md body'>Malcolm Arnold<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>Jump to: navigation, search<br>Sir Malcolm Henry Arnold, KBE (born 21 October 1921, Northampton, UK) is an English composer.<br><br>Arnold began his career as a professional trumpeter, but by the time he was thirty he was composing full-time, being bracketed with Britten and Walton as one of the most sought-after composers in Britain. His natural melodic gift has earned him a reputation as a composer of light music in works such as the sets of English, Scottish and Welsh Dances, or the scores to the St TrinianÂ’s films and Hobson's Choice.<br><br>Contents [hide]<br>1 Biography<br>1.1 Career highlights<br>2 Key works<br>3 Selected recordings<br>4 External links<br><br>[edit]<br>Biography<br>He was born in Northampton and studied at the Royal College of Music before joining the London Philharmonic Orchestra as a trumpeter (he eventually became principal trumpet). By the end of the 1940s he was concentrating entirely on composition. He was made a CBE in 1970, and was knighted in 1993.<br><br>Arnold is a relatively conservative composer of tonal works, but a prolific and popular one. He has acknowledged Hector Berlioz as an influence, and several commentators have drawn a comparison with Jean Sibelius. Arnold's most significant works are generally considered to be his nine symphonies. He has also written a number of concertos, including one for guitar for Julian Bream, and one for harmonica for Larry Adler. His sets of dances, which consist of two sets of English Dances (Op.27 and Op. 33[1]), and one set each of Scottish Dances (Op. 59), Irish Dances (Op. 126), Welsh Dances (Op. 13<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and Cornish Dances (Op. 91), are in a lighter vein and also popular (one of the English Dances is used as the theme music for the British television programme What the Papers Say). Another popular short work is his Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet (Op 37).<br><br>Arnold has also written a number of film scores, winning an Academy Award for The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), and also providing music for The Belles of St Trinian's (1954), The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (195<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and Whistle Down the Wind (1961) among many others. He conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the recording of Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra, and conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the group's organist Jon Lord's Gemini Suite.<br><br>His works are particularly popular with youth and amateur orchestras, partly because of their playability, and also because of the accessibility of his unique style, which combines the musical elements of classical, jazz, popular and folk. He is also currently the patron of the Rochdale Youth Orchestra.<br><br>The Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra always had a soft spot for the music of Malcolm Arnold, making the first commercial recording of Divertimento for the Pye label in July 1967 and performing many of his works. Arnold also conducted the orchestra in a 1963 De Montfort Hall concert.<br><br>After a decline in both finances and health, Arnold moved to Attleborough, Norfolk, UK, where he still lives under full time care. The care has not only nursed him, but helped Arnold align his finances and, more recently, helped fight a bitter family battle which could have seen his daughter win sole rights over her father's fortune.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Arnold<br><br>The Bridge on the River Kwai Concert Suite (1957; orchestra)<br>Four Scottish Dances (1957; orchestra or brass band)</div>
