              <p>Nearly every researcher agrees that early childhood traumas (i.e. those 
              that happen before the age of six) lie at the root of most long-term 
              depression and anxiety, and many emotional and psychological illnesses. 
              Severe traumas can even alter the very chemistry and physiology of the 
              brain itself!</p>
              <p>Among mental health professionals, and even some childhood
               development specialists, there is sometimes a lack of understanding 
              over exactly what constitutes childhood trauma.</p>
              <p>In addition to physical, sexual and verbal abuse, this can include 
              anything that causes the child to feel worthless, unlovable, insecure, 
              and even endangered, or as if his only value lies in meeting someone 
              else's needs. Examples cited in the report include "belittling, 
              degrading or ridiculing a child; making him or her feel unsafe 
              [including threat of abandonment]; failing to express affection, caring 
              and love; neglecting mental health, medical or educational needs."</p>
              <p>I believe some form of Education is needed to inform the General Public about the Inportance of Childhood Trauma. We need to stop the Trauma from happening . We need to start from young as there are many cases of adults still having some form of phobia or nightmares because of their childhood trauma experience, Those people need to knoe where they seek help. There is no guarantee that they can be cured fully but at least they can lessen the pain. Well thats my opinion hope it helps.</p>

              <p>i think that early childhood trauma will cause people to be aggressive and violent towards other people. because they are have been abused before and it caused them to have trauma, they grow up being violent. they treat other people like how they are treated before.</p>
              <p>also, they will not be around other people because they are afraid that other people may treat them badly. when they make friends and be with other people, they are afraid that other people may treat them just the same.</p>
              <p>when people have early childhood trauma, they behave differently from other people. they can be a loner, always sad most of the time and be very violent. they do not want to friend others and they often feel like scolding other people.</p>
