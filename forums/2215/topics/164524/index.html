One would often get the attacks in an enormous amount of stress, cigarette smoking, alcohol, lack of sleep, taking foods that trigger it, hormonal changes during menstruation or puberty, certain medication, bright light or loud noises.<br><br>It is uncertain as for the cause but is typically classified into two types, classic migraine and common migraine, in which the sole differentiation is that those with classic migraine experience an aura before going into an attack...<br><br>The aura can be visual or sensory, visual being able to see zig-zag lines, dotty vision and flashes of lights, and sensory being feeling numbness over the site of pre-emptive pain.<br><br>When you know you are going to suffer an attack soon, try to calm down yourself, get away from your work-desk or whatever that has been giving you the trigger factor. Sleep in a silent and dark room, most people find this the best way to get off it.

This is so because you have a blind access when carrying out this blunt procedure. Worst is, there are certain people who would use metal diggers or matchsticks to dig their ear. Trauma to the external auditory canal is very common for people who adopts such practice, hence leading to recurrent infection of the external ear, which may progress to involve the middle ear.<br><br>The ear has it's own cleansing mechanism, a simple rub with a wet cloth after bathing over the exposed area of the ear would suffice.</div>

Increased body weight and prolonged straining in the toilet are two of the main causative factors that exacerbate this condition.<br><br>The vessels (veins) in the anal mucosa are collectively clumped underneath and under normal condition appear as soft bulges which provides the cushioning effect for the stools to be passed out. Characteristically, there are three of them located at 3, 7 and 11 o clock positions when the person is lying supine.<br><br>Under great pressure and compression from straining of stools (from constipation), the veins will lose its flexibility and the elastic muscles that holds them in location will also give way. The veins will balloon outwards from the normal soft bulge and pushes it out further more making the small bulge into a big unsupported lump.<br><br>Depending on severity, the lump will be forced to escape from the anus after pooping and fresh red blood will be passed out, often noticed by the person through wiping with toilet tissue or in the toilet bowl. If it is minor, the lump may return to its normal location by itself, but if it is major, it may not.<br><br>If you are suffering from this condition, it's best to seek a GP's help to acquire certain cream and medication that aids in the vessel's integrity and prevent bacterial infection of the perianal area. Start to switch to soft diet, reduce intake of red meat or anything hard. Drink more fluids, take more fiber and don't retain poop for a long time as this will only exacerbate the condition. Exercise often to reduce weight.</div>
