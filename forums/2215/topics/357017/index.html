              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Serbia taps crisis-hit Westerners for medical tourism</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">BELGRADE, April 21, 2009 (AFP) - Each summer, Julia Karstens of Germany has her teeth seen to in Serbia, where authorities are eager to lure tourists seeking cheaper medical bills amid the global economic crisis.</span></p>
              <span style="color: #333333;">Â </span><span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://www.fashionmag.com/newsletters/images/20090421/cosmeticsurgery77.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span>
              <p><br><span style="color: #333333;">"A friend of Serbian origin invited me to come with her to see a dentist in her country. This is how it all began," said Karstens. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Karstens said she was "very satisfied with the quality of service," but insisted cheaper prices were the main reason for her trips to the former Yugoslav republic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"In Germany, I pay 60 euros (80 dollars) for a tooth filling, while here the whole crown costs less," she explained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Inspired by such cases, Serbia has begun to develop its medical tourism industry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">And, hit by fallout from the worldwide financial crisis, many in the West have been looking out for destinations where treatment can be much cheaper than in their home countries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Serbia, while lacking the sun and sand of established medical tourism hubs mainly in Asia, was well positioned close to the European Union, with high standards of treatment, said its economic ministry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"We offer good quality medical services as well as competitive prices," said Renata Pindzo, an official in charge of tourism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Pindzo noted however that stronger investments were necessary in order to offer services which would satisfy the demands of foreign tourists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Doctor Milan Radivojevic of the private clinic Medical Centar in Belgrade said he has treated patients from abroad, mainly for cosmetic surgery, for more than 15 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"We have had customers coming even from Australia, Canada," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Radivojevic said surgery in Serbia was much cheaper than in Western Europe.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"For breast augumentation, for example, the price is about 2,500 euros (3,320 dollars). This amount includes all prices linked to this service" including accommodation, he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"Nose surgery costs between 1,600 and 2,000 euros (2,120 and 2,650 dollars)."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Private-owned clinics have joined the ranks in order to promote medical tourism in Serbia, getting in touch with tourism officials and economic experts from various ministries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The plan is to offer patients who come to Serbia surgery or other medical services while presenting them other benefits, like discovering the country's sites or visiting its numerous thermal spas, said doctor Ivana Vranic, one of the promoters of the initiative.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Public hospitals, mostly due to their obsolete infrastructure and outdated equipment, neglected during years of crisis and 1990s economic sanctions, are presently unable to offer such services.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The first offers of medical tourism in Serbia were mostly aimed at the country's large global migrant community who take advantage of family visits to obtain medical care at reasonable prices.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"They were happy with our services and recommended us to their friends. The word of mouth did the rest," Radivojevic explained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Radivojevic said he is convinced the negative image of Serbia, present in the West during a decade of wars in 1990s in the Balkans, is now a thing of the past.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">He said he had confidence in Serbia's future in medical tourism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"The fear of the Balkans is beginning to disappear and we now have the same status as other clinics in the world," he said. <br><br>By Suzana Markovic</span></p>
