            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to find out if there is anyone with fusion done in this forum?<br><br>some info about me, I was involved in a car accident almost 2 years before, been a passenger directly behind the driver, traveling back to Singapore from a photography trip in malaysia. The car which I was in got into a head on with a lorry, probably lucky that everyone was asleep (except for the driver) and had our seatbelts on, but the accident left me with some serious injuries. I had an emergency surgery done for internal bleeding in my intenstine, stomach, colon. Family moved me back to Singapore where they discover I had a fracture in my L3-L4, I undergo a fusion for my lumbar spine. So much for my spine, back to my other injuries, the wound on my tummy wasn't healing and the doc decides to remove a few stitches to help the healing processes and it was left opened till they decided that I needed to do a skin graft over the open wound to help the healing, so I go through with another surgery to help the skin over my tummy to heal faster.<br><br>All is well, my back feels fine now, after so much rest. No physio was recommended, except for pilate, which I didn't attend. My stomach region has a badly disfigured scar, not one of those surgery scar, but rather a healed, closed up open wound, look like a vertical eye. Secondly, the sides of my body is now improportion, the left side looks bigger than the right. My digestion is abeit screwed as well. Previously, I had no problems taking any degree of spicy food (my family is peranaka), but since the accident, I get the runs easily, any chillies will cause me the runs. Right now I have totally changed my diet because of it. I'm now waiting to receive the medical report from the JB hospital, so I can go seek a local specialist for my digestion and piles problem (I contracted the piles because of the frequent toilet visits)<br><br>my main concerns is the sides, the disfigured tummy and my digestion. Planning to go for a plastic surgery in the near future to mend my tummy. I haven't had a followup since late 2005, and enquires at the local GP on the irregular differences on the side of my body came up with no question. I do feel some aches everytime I lay on the left side.<br><br>I find having people with similar problems to talk to, helps mentally. Although the accident has been almost 2 years now, the bad memories is still fresh.<br><br>any comment is greatly appreciated.<br>TIA<br>Simon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like the fusion is the least of your problems now...from your post it appears it is the psychological trauma you have difficulty coming to terms with.</div>
