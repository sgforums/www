              <p>Hi. I am suffering from fluoroquinolone toxicity syndrome. 
              Fluoroquinolone is a class of antibiotics and I am suffering from a rare
               adverse reaction from taking it. I've been suffering tremendous nerve 
              pain and uncontrollable twitching all over my body and horrible panic 
              attacks, drug-induced depression, insomnia and vision problems amongst 
              many other symptoms for a month now. I was a student athlete. Now 
              because of all the pain I'm in I have to put all of that aside. I have 
              not been to school for a month now. These adverse reactions has been 
              reported in medical journals but most of the doctors I've seen are 
              ignorant of the fact that such adverse reactions could occur because it 
              is so rare and they ignored my case. And that's the purpose of me 
              writing this thread. I'm looking for a doctor who could help me 
              alleviate my suffering and treat my condition. So if you are a medical 
              professional who knows about fluoroquinolone toxicity, I beg you to 
              contact me at 98571007.<br> <br> This website contains medical journals and research papers supporting 
              the adverse effects caused by these antibiotics as well their mode of 
              action. I need a doctor to look through these journals and research so 
              that he can help me find a cure.<br> <a href="http://www.survivingcipro.com/http:/www.survivingcipro.com/uncategorized/117/my-favorite-links/for-physicians/">http://www.survivingcipro.com/http:/...or-physicians/</a><br> <br> Other sufferers, mostly in the United states, claimed that ozone therapy
               as well as detoxification through IV glutahione helped them a lot. I've
               been to emergency rooms and all they gave me was vitamins and 
              painkillers. I soon found out after researching the net that pain 
              killers actually will make the pain last longer. There has not been much
               research into this adverse reactions and there has not been a 
              definitive cure yet. I've spent over 2k with no avail. Every day is a 
              struggle. So again, if any doctor would like to help me please contact 
              me at 98571007.</p>

              <p> There are recent and established journals which addresses the matter and even though those on the website are outdated, why can't it be true? Adverse side effects have affected many around the world. Even the pharmacutical companies have mentioned about these adverse side effects. But what's important right now is that I desperately need treatment from a doctor who knows his stuff. I'm frustrated being rejected doctor after doctor. The pain is getting unbearable and my will to go on looking for a cure is getting weaker. How can this even happen in SINGAPORE? I used the drug for an eye infection for a month. I believe that it has been absorbed by my body through systemic absorption. Everyone has a limit to how much fluoroquinolone in their body they can take. Once that limit is reached, adverse side effects will occur. I didn't have any reactions my first week taking it.</p>
