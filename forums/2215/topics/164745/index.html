            <div class='col-md body'>I decided to start this thread in view of recent events in the UK and an exchange of letters between MOH and Mui Hoong, the Straits Times columnist.<br><br>There are now many new anti-cancer drugs that are much more effective than the ones previously available. At the same time, there are better and more accurate diagnostic tests that can predict responsiveness to such newer treatments. However, all of these are expensive and are not available to most Singaporeans.<br><br>The government does not want to put these drugs into the standard drug list because they are expensive. So patients in the West with mammary gland cancer, for example, have a better chance of a cure because they have access to these newer drugs. On the other hand, Minister of Health has said that he wants to moderate, not increase, the expectations of Singaporeans where healthcare is concerned.<br><br>The journalist Chua Mui Hoong is fortunate in that she was given the drug Herceptin when she developed breast cancer as a postgraduate student in Harvard. Our patients do not have access to this drug and it is unlikely to be subsidized by the government.<br><br>As pointed out by another journalist, Herceptin increases the chance of a cure for early breast cancer from 60% to 80%. That means 20% pf patients will die from the cancer even with the drug and 60% will be cured anyway, with or without this new drug. There are lots of women with early breast cancer now that we are doing breast screening to pick them up early; and it will cost a lot to subsidize Herceptin treatment for all of them.<br><br>There are many new anti-cancer drugs like Herceptin, some are more effective and with less side effects. But they are all expensive and with our budding biomedical industry in Singapore, there is no way we can follow the Thais and Indians who use local legislation to make generics, ignoring their patents.<br><br>Is it cost effective to pay thousands of dollars just to improve the cure rate by 20%, even though it is clearly statistically significant? The question is, what if you fall in that 20%?<br><br>Another question that often confronts us: Is it cost-effective to pay thousands of dollars to increase the lifespan of a cancer patient by 15 months? What about 12 months? 5 months? 3 months?<br><br>What about a drug that does not improve overall survival time but gives you a better quality of life during that period? Is it cost-effective to give such a drug?<br><br>There are times when I feel disillusioned. My work has contributed in a small way to improving diagnosis and treatment of cancer; but only the rich can benefit from it.<br><br>If there is interest, perhaps I can use this thread to talk about some of these newer drugs...<br><br>(Just realized that the common word for mammary gland is banned or something...each time I type'breas_' it turns out gabbage...wonder why?)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, Singapore is not like other countries, who is willing subsidize a lot. Singapore's economy is not as strong as the countries even though we are quite developed when compared with other Asian countries. Our economy cannot support these huge subsidies. If we want, our people have to pay more taxes and higher taxes. This will cause a lot of Singaporeans to migrate and therefore losing our first and only resource - humans.<br><br>If we lose this only resource, we will get poorer, and maybe we will no longer able to subsidize all the medication we are taking now.<br><br>Another thing is that Singapore doesn't like to give free gifts. This will result in misuse. One very good example is Britain. Because their healthcare is free, they misuse it. We don't want this as this will cripple our economy.<br><br>Although I understood what you mean, these drugs can be further improved and therefore could be cheaper.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zodi:</div><div class="quote_body">Perhaps doctors can at least inform your patients the price differences between the various medicine options available BEFORE prescribing?<br><br>I believe patients &amp;/or their immediate families would appreciate making <span style="text-decoration: underline;">informed decisions</span>. In general, they should be the one making the economical decision while the doctors make the medical recommendations/decisions?<br></div></blockquote>Sometimes that is easier said than done. It is difficult to tell a cancer patient and his family  that there is a treatment that can remove the cancer and give him possibly a few extra years of life but that the treatment will cost him more than $10,000. The patient and his family will naturally demand the medication even if they cannot afford it and it puts the medical doctor in a very difficult position.<br><br>That is why often the doctor will look at the patient's financial background before deciding whether or not to tell him of the possibility of a more expensive but better medicine. The government has also been telling doctors not to raise the expectations of our patients.<br><br>It is not a situation the doctor wants to find himself. Doctors would rather dispense medical advice rather than function as gatekeepers of health economics or MCs but these responsibilities are thrust upon us whether or not we want them. No doctor wants to have distressed relatives weeping and accusing them of being heartless for not prescribing a potentially life-saving medication that he has told them about in the first place. It is easier to keep quiet if the patient is obviously not able to afford it.<br><br></div>
