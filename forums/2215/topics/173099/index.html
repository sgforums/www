            <div class='col-md body'>Hello to all the honorable and benevolent doctors here!<br><br>Finally stumbled upon this forum, sgForums is just too extensive and vast. &gt;.&gt;<br>Okay, pressing onto the matters...<br><br>I think i'm born out of bad genes.<br>Well...before all that, i'm 18m chinese.<br><br><strong>Problem1: Knees</strong><br>This has been a worry for me. During one of the PE lesson back in primary 2, i've severely injured my leg, well sort of. We're supposed to do some exercise with one leg up in the air, while the other leg on the ground, together with the two hands. Suddenly my knee just gave way and a sharp pain was felt. Extremely painful. Well...i believe this is not the cause of my problem, but rather, a discovery to my defect. You see, not only one of my knee suffers, but both.<br><br>I was pretty heavy back then, not to the extend of noticeably and obviously fat, but rather, just slightly plump, but this has already taken a toll on my knees already. Whenever i walk, a "click" sound could be heard, and whenever i try to swing my legs while sitting, i can feel that the joints aren't in the "right place", like where it should be. Sometimes, my knees can go into a "lockage" where its hard to fully stretch my legs. The pain persisted and the "clicking" persisted till secondary school days where the PE teacher refused to accept my claims that my knees are in pain and thus i am forced to run and do strenous exercise which i felt would be detrimental to myself. What if i'm crippled because of one silly PE teacher's disproval on my claims?<br><br>So i suggested to my parents to try consulting specialist over at Tan Tock Seng. Did X-ray scanning on both knees. And went to consult the specialist, however, it was a junior medical officer that attended to me. He was rather unsure of the cause, since the X-ray doesn't shows any abnormalities. He suggested that i have to do CAT scan. My parent didn't approve of that decision due to the high cost that involves with the procedure, thus my consultation in TTS came to a halt. However, at the same time, i went to the physiologist at TTS to examine the cause as referred to by that junior medical offier.<br><br>At least the physiologist gave me a better answer, after stretching and kneading and twisting my knees around and being asked to stand on one leg each time, he told me that there's something wrong with my knees which cannot be treated, however, the thigh muscles can be worked on, having seen that my thigh muscles are indeed very weak.<br><br>But i stopped the treatment as well. Over the years, i've been trying to reduce my weight, so now i'm actually underweight. The problem subsided, yet if i put myself through strenous exercise, or climbing flight of stairs with great exertion on my knees, the problem will come back. Else, no more "clicking" or "lockage" of knees. I've also came out with an answer myself, because the physiologist didn't exactly tell me what is the root, so i think that the cause might be my pelvis actually.<br><br>Perhaps the position of my pelvis have affected the thigh muscles, and the knees. It seems to me that my pelvis is actually higher. I don't know why. I also have a natural "slouching upper back". Could this be due to my pelvis as well?<br><br><strong>Problem2: Eyes</strong><br>My left and right eyes, last i've checked, is 25degrees and 50degrees.<br>I do not wear spectacles.<br>However, i have alot of floaters in my eyes, especially my right, thread-likes. My left have one distinct floater, a single black, circular floater. I suspect that it is a dead red blood cell, but i'm entirely sure either.<br>However, my left eye has significantly more floaters.<br><br>This is what puzzles me. I'm young, 18years old. I have near perfect eyesight. yet i have tons of floaters. What gives? I've consulted eye specialist at the national eye center and he said there is no problem with my eyes. But i am getting worried as floaters might be signs of something serious, like retinal detachment? Because sometimes i can see "flashes" as well.<br><br>And i read sources that said floaters will be out of the vision after awhile. Its been 3years since they first appeared, when i was 15years old, and they're still in the center of my vision. Darn right? =p<br><br>Thanks in advance!

I hope i've provided all the necessary details. Appreciates any sound inputs. (:   [/b]</blockquote>The Knee Joint<br><br>Can you tell us more about what do you mean by slouching upper back? Yes, abnormalities in the spine positioning can lead to changes in height of both sides of the pelvis which can alter the positioning of the thighs, knees and ankles and may lead to abnormal posture when carrying on normal activities. The abnormal displacement of pressure across the joint (due to the abnormal positioning because of the abovementioned factors) can lead to extreme pain and with strenuous activities and trauma, it will happily predispose you to joint surface rubbing and degeneration (osteochondritis --&gt; osteoarthritis). Do read up about the two conditions mention as osteochondritis (an inflammation of the cartilage overlying the bony surface in the joint) can lead to dispersion of foreign body into the joint area, which leads to the click sound and lock phenomenon upon joint movement.<br><br>The Eye<br><br>Floaters occur commonly in 2 conditions, one in diabetic patients who has succumbed to the complications of diabetes in the eye (diabetic retinopathy) which leads to vitreous (the liquid at the back of the eye) detachment or tear. This will cause some of the vitreous membrane to fall into the posterior chamber of the eye and float around the pool of liquid. These are transparent and hence you will often see it floating around when you are looking at a bright light and then towards a dim area. Flashes are commonly seen as the light that enters your eye do not get reflected at a suitable angle for it to exit the eye. One of the good mediums for vision is a clear vitreous, but because of floaters, it disperses the refraction of the one light leading to stimulation of more than one area of the retina (by right a light entering the eye will fall into one place on the retina, stimulate it, and u see it as one image, but in this case, more than one area is stimulated coz of the floaters, hence you will see a cumulative effect of lighting pattern which we interpret as flashes).<br><br>The other condition that occur is for patients who are short-sightedness where they have longer eyeballs which predispose to easier detachment of the vitreous from the retina.<br><br>Retinal detachment is dangerous and often occludes vision gradually rather than cause flashes.[/b]</div>

In terms of astigmatism, the light fails to penetrate directly as the corneal fiber arrangements (which under normal conditions allow clarity of vision by lattice arrangement of the collagen) is disturbed. A patient who has astigmatism will tell you that they can't 'see well' and on confirmation, the image they perceive can be 'blurred' 'out of place' or 'can't really tell'.</div>
