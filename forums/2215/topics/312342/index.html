              <p>Two teaspoons of cod liver oil a day can cut the number of powerful painkillers needed to ease the pain of arthritis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Researchers said many patients given the supplements were able
              to reduce their daily dose of anti-inflammatory drugs - some by more
              than 30 per cent.</p>
              <p>The findings are a further indication that the fish oil is a
              cheap and natural way of helping sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis, one
              of the most common forms of the condition.</p>
              <p>The ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
              (NSAIDs) prescribed to millions of patients each year have been linked
              to a range of side-effects.</p>
              <p>Long-term use of high doses to quell the pain and swelling of
              inflamed joints can double the threat of heart attack and raise the
              risk of strokes and heart disease.</p>
              <p>Aisla Bosworth, of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society,
              said: "Sufferers still rely heavily on anti-inflammatories, even though
              their safety is under scrutiny.</p>
              <p>"It's in this context that this new research provides some
              promising new evidence that cod liver oil may reduce the need for
              anti-inflammatories."</p>
              <p>The researchers from Dundee University and the city's Ninewells
              Hospital tracked the health of almost 100 rheumatoid arthritis patients
              taking NSAIDs.</p>
              <p>Half were given 10g of cod liver oil - the equivalent of two
              teaspoons - to take alongside their daily dose of painkillers while
              half were given dummy capsules.</p>
              <p>After three months, the volunteers were asked to try to gradually reduce their reliance on NSAIDs.</p>
              <p>Nine months into the study, 39 per cent of those in the cod
              liver oil group had cut their daily dose of the painkillers by more
              than 30 per cent.</p>
              <p>Just 10 per cent of those in the other group achieved the same result.</p>
              <p>Crucially, those who cut their intake of painkillers did not
              find their symptoms worsened as a result, reported the journal
              Rheumatology.</p>
              <p>Researcher Professor Jill Belch said: "This study offers hope
              to many patients for whom cod liver oil can offer a natural pain
              treatment without the harmful side-effects associated with
              anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
              <p>"It reinforces previous research that has shown cod liver oil,
              and its high contact of omega-3 essential fatty acids, to have
              significant anti-inflammatory properties in patients with rheumatoid
              arthritis."</p>
              <p>The researchers added their finding was important at a time
              "when there are increasing concerns about adverse events associated
              with NSAID use".</p>
              <p>They said: "One study reported regular NSAID use in over 70 per cent of the rheumatoid arthritis patients studied."</p>
              <p>Previous research has shown the benefits of fish oils in staving
              off heart disease, cancer, depression and Alzheimer's disease in the
              elderly.</p>
