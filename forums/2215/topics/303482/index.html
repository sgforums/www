Check. Hypertension? Check. Risk of diabetes? Check.<br><br>In three out of four key health indicators, a group of lowerÂ—income, mainly elderly, residents at Henderson Road are faring poorer compared to the national average. These are the findings from the pilot healthÂ—mapping survey by the Singapore Heart Foundation, meant to highlight health issues to policyÂ—makers and the Community Development Councils.<br><br>The health screening showed that the obesity rate of 285 households was nearly double the 6.9 per cent of Singaporeans found to be obese in the 2004 National Health survey. Likewise, 32.4 per cent in the lower income group had hypertension, compared to the national figure of 24.9 per cent.<br><br>High cholesterol was the only indicator that measured lower among the residents (10 per cent) than the wider population.<br><br>While the participant size was too small to draw conclusive inferences, the results could be indicative of common recurring problems in communities with elder residents, said SHF chief executive officer Ho Sun Yee.<br><br>What was of greater concern to SHF was that many of the 1,132 households approached to participate in November did not want to be screened.<br><br>Many from the lower income group do not want to know about their health status, as they do not have resources to spend on their health, said SHF vice chairman Terrance Chua, who told reporters of the need to raise awareness of "lowÂ—cost or free" healthcare services.<br><br>The Singapore AntiÂ—Tuberculosis Association, for one, will offer free medical services to the area in late February or early March. The SHF hopes its healthÂ—mapping programme will help individuals, organisations, community members and policyÂ—makers to combine their health promotion efforts and provide targeted support.<br><br>In another survey last year on heart awareness, some 1,600 respondents were found to be largely aware of health matters. But "a significant number still have misconceptions," the SHF said.<br><br>For instance, 53.8 per cent thought lowering their blood pressure would be enough to reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke.
