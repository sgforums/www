            <div class='col-md body'>There are two hormones which decrease - oestrogen and progesterone.<br>If the egg in the womb after the ovulation isn't fertilised, the levels of oestrogen and progesterone produced by the ovary begin to fall. Without the supporting action of these hormones, the lining of the womb, which is full of blood, is shed, resulting in a period. Norethisterone is a synthetic form of progesterone, when its level increases, the periods doesn't start.<br>Norethisterone should be used 5 to 3 days before the start of the period. After you stop to take it, the level of progesterone drops again and the period can start. This takes 1 to 3 days, it's individual by every woman.<br><br>But as I have told you, don't use it for delaying the period, this wasn't the main purpose of this drug. It should handle medical problems related to hormones and it is used for women in menopause which are taking hormone replacement therapy with oestrogen.<br>There are many ugly side effects, I was considering taking this pill from the sam reason as you are asking, but after I read the side effect, I said NEVER. I won't spoil my hormones and health. One my friend was taking it and then she had to shave her face, really. Undesired growth of hair is one of the side effects. Others are depressions, nausea, gaining of weight, headaches, pimples and the list goes on. Your period may become messy, irregular after.<br><br>The maximum dosage depends on the weight of the person.<br>Warning: Hormonal pills can cause more harm then use if you don't need them from some medical reason. They disturb your hormonal balance.</div>
