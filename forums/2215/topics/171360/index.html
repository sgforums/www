Happens to me, and alfagal has taught me some relaxation techniques and now I am better. Heart palpitations still come back to me once in a while, but not as often when I am stressed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About your feet problem - I think you have a problem with the congestion in your legs/feet. It can be, that you block some of your blood vessels in the legs when you sit and then not enough blood reaches your feet. Or Sometimes the<br>congestion problems can be related to heart problems. How long have you been having these feet aches? Is is since you started to have the arrhytmia or since you started to take the medicaments for it? What kind of pain is it?<br>The other cause which is in my mind is, that you pinch some nerves in your legs when sitting.<br><br>Now about the arrhytmia: An arrhythmia is a change in the regular beat of the heart. The heart may seem to skip a beat or beat irregularly or very fast or very slowly. Heart disease may cause arrhythmias, but many arrhythmias<br>occur in people who do not have underlying heart disease.  Other causes include: stress, caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, diet pills, and cough and cold medicines.<br><br>Arrhythmias occur commonly in middle-age adults. As people get older, they are more likely to experience an arrhythmia. The vast majority of people with arrhythmias have nothing to fear. They do not need extensive exams or special treatments for their condition. In some people, arrhythmias are associated with heart disease. In these cases, heart disease, not the arrhythmia, poses the greatest risk to the patient.<br>In a very small number of people with serious symptoms, arrhythmias themselves are dangerous. These arrhythmias require medical treatment to keep the heartbeat regular. But when you are taking medicaments, it still doesn't mean that you should be over worried. Hasn't your doc found out the reason for you arrhitmia? He should find the reason, the cause. Then you will know if it is serious or not. If he hasn't done it yet, you should ask him for<br>a check up. I hope he is a cardiologist, if not, then ask for a cardiologist.<br><br>There are two origins of arrhitmia: originating in the atria and originating in the ventricles.<br><br>originating in the atria:<br><br>Sinus arrhythmia: Cyclic changes in the heart rate during breathing. Common in children and often found in adults.<br><br>Sinus tachycardia: The sinus node sends out electrical signals faster than usual, speeding up the heart rate.<br><br>Sick sinus syndrome: The sinus node does not fire its signals properly, so that the heart rate slows down. Sometimes the rate changes back and forth between a slow and fast rate.<br><br>Premature supraventricular contractions or premature atrial contractions (PAC): A beat occurs early in the atria, causing the heart to beat before the next regular heartbeat.<br><br>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT):<br>A series of early beats in the atria speed up the heart rate (the number of times a heart beats per minute). In paroxysmal tachycardia, repeated periods of very fast heartbeats begin and end suddenly.<br><br>Atrial flutter: Rapidly fired signals cause the muscles in the atria to contract quickly, leading to a very fast, steady heartbeat.<br><br>Atrial fibrillation: Electrical signals in the atria are fired in a very fast and uncontrolled manner. Electrical signals arrive in the ventricles in a completely irregular fashion, so the heart beat is completely irregular.<br><br>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Abnormal pathways between the atria and ventricles cause the electrical signal to arrive at the ventricles too soon and to be transmitted back into the atria. Very fast heart rates may develop as the electrical signal ricochets between the atria and ventricles.<br><br>originating in the ventricles:<br><br>Premature ventricular complexes (PVC): An electrical signal from the ventricles causes an early heart beat that generally goes unnoticed. The heart then seems to pause until the next beat of the ventricle occurs in a regular fashion.<br><br>Ventricular tachycardia: The heart beats fast due to electrical signals arising from the ventricles (rather than from the atria).<br><br>Ventricular fibrillation: Electrical signals in the ventricles are fired in a very fast and uncontrolled manner, causing the heart to quiver rather than beat and pump blood.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all for your kind advise and information.<br><br>Well, I think I might want to consider a detailed check with a cardiologist just in case. I'm already 40-ish, and have been smoking the past 25 year, but have just recently quit smoking - I know, this doesn't automatically put me in the safe zone... heheheee..<br><br>This palpitation has been dogging me since my teens, I sort of grew up with it. But now, it seems different - meaning I feel a tad bit more breathless when it happens. This sensation of not being able to take a full breath, and the harder it mis-fires, or the harder it kicks, the more breathless or exhausted I feel.<br><br>I usually experience palpitations a couple times a year, each episode lasting up to or less than a week. Usually it coincides with work related stress, emotional stress (arguing with wife, etc.), and occasional activities like cycling a little too long or too hard on my mountain bike.<br><br>My recent palpitation I discovered, was triggered by my consumption of a certain drink; Allswell, Plum Juice. I've been drinking this particular drink for a month or so, but have now stopped drinking it after confirming that it may be the cause by calling my family GP.<br><br>I think you are probably right about my aching feet being due to circulatory issues, as I often sit or drive for long periods. But how can I improve my blood circulation when my GP advises me against strenuous activities? Oh and I have an age old spinal injury - a mild slip-disc which prohibits me from any vigorous activities.<br><br>This pain in my feet, is sometimes concentrated more on either the left or right foot, but both will ache with one aching much more than the other. The pain is akin to pain you get from sitting cross-legged on the floor for too long. And the pain originates from the joints of my left foot's (topside between toes, sometimes under the arch) - those bones that lead to my little toe, 4th, 3rd, &amp; 2nd toes. Please pardon me as I don't have any medical education hence my crude terms of description.<br><br>My wife will usually massage my major aching foot by squeezing in between the toe bones really hard. This produces excruciating "relief pain", and gradually the pain fades after the initial intense pain. After a while, it's as if there was no pain to begin with.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As you have been prone to the arrhitmia already since your teens, you should take care of yourself and avoid everything what could trigger it. Avoid all energy drinks. The cardiologist will tell you more after the check up. You can also tell him about the pain in your feet, to confirm whether it is related to your heart issues or the medication you are taking for it.<br><br>When you have the pain in your feet, are there also some cramps, for example the toes are in cramps?<br>There is a natural way of improving the blood circulation, it's gingko biloba. Gingko dilatates the constricted blood vessles and improves the blood circulation. There are gingko pills. Though gingko pills are natural and safe, you should ask your gp before using them, maybe you have some indications for which the gingko effect wouldn't be good.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You need a proper assessment. The episodic nature suggests paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) which is quite common, but a complete workup is needed to classify the type of SVT and to recommend proper treatment.</div>
