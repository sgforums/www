            <div class='col-md body'><p>Khoo Teck Puat Hospital is now open in Yishun, so Singaporeans living in the North should be happy with the ruling party. The hospital serving the medical needs of virtually everyone in the north from Ang Mo Kio to Yishun, from Sembawang to Woodlands and even SengKang. The PAP government has promise us this Hospital, it was first announced as an election promise by the PAP in the 2001 general elections. Finally we got it after 9 years! They delivered as Promised.<br><br>http://www.geraldtan.com/medaffairs/hospitals-jgh_ngh_ygh.html<br><br><br>From Channel News Asia - <br><strong>Keep politics out of healthcare</strong> and minimise market distortions so as to create a sustainable healthcare system — this was the Singapore Health Minister’s prescription at the Healthcare in Asia conference.<br><br>Governments the world over are dealing with having to keep healthcare costs down, and yet providing quality care.<br><br>In Singapore, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the principle is to keep to the basics. This means recognising that healthcare can never be free, making sure people take charge of their own health, and keeping politics out.<br><br>He said: "The more politicians do not speak the truth. For example, like healthcare is free, vote for me, I will give you free medicine. You distort the market because you do not allow facts and rational thinking to surface.<br><br>"I gave a few examples of how healthcare need not fail. Not that it is possible to achieve a perfect market, but as a stretched target I think we must be clear which direction we must be going.<br><br>"Today all our healthcare systems are heavily distorted, Singapore included. But at least if you know the direction forward, I think each time whoever is in charge, you try not to bring in new distortion and try to remove as much distortion as you can."<br><br>Vijay Vaitheeswaran, health correspondent, The Economist said: "The thing to remember about Singapore is that it has an extraordinary value conscious health system with a relatively low spending per GDP and a high contribution by the individual.<br><br>"These things, sometimes called "Skin in the game", mean that individuals actually see the effects of cost increases and they are more likely to make smarter choices about what healthcare they want and what they don’t want.<br><br>"So I think relative to other countries in the region, Singapore is well poised to manage health inflation."<br><br>Singapore’s total healthcare spending is currently less than four per cent of its GDP, which is a relatively low figure compared to other countries. But Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said he expects the figure to continue to go up, especially with Singapore’s ageing population.<br><br>He added that it would be a remarkable achievement if Singapore could sustain its healthcare spending at a single digit percentage of its GDP.</p></div>

              <p>If they stuck to one direction and insisted on being right, nobody can still complain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But recent events have shown they tend to flip flop on things and are not consistent.  One day say healtch costs are affordable, next day say go JB for hospitalisation because it is cheaper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Similar for high HDB prices which they flip flop and say 2 contrasting things on the issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's like if you cannot please the voters, confuse them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
