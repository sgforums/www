Who can help?</div></blockquote>Clinically, I may know very little about it... but what I know goes like this... I may be wrong...<br><br>Our human body contains up to several thousands of water molecules, even in the organs, we do have a certain amount of fluids to keep our bodily functions stable.<br><br>The functions of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is self-explanatory through its name... When the body of a person is placed in the machine (the whole area is a magnetic field), it will release a resonance or a wave to resonate the water molecule (which have a slight magnetic charge polarity) around the main magnetic field which is static. This is then picked up by a receiver coil and translated into a data.<br><br>This, in conjunction with radio waves can be used to produce very detailed and high definition images (slices) of the brain.<br><br>Radio waves are of a relatively low frequency and are thus harmless. There is no evidence that exposure to magnetic fields are in any way harmful, provided that you do not have any magnetic materials on or inside your body such as a cardiac pacemaker.<br><br>I don't know any further about electromagnetics and the units of tesla they use, perhaps someone can come in and enlighten...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>read bout something ineresting in my email:<br>STROKE IDENTIFICATION<br><br>During a BBQ a friend stumbled and took a little fall - she assured everyone that she was fine (they offered to call paramedics) and just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food - while she appeared a bit shaken up, Ingrid went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. Ingrid's husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital (at 6:00pm, Ingrid passed away.)<br><br>She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ - had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke perhaps Ingrid would be with us today. It only takes a minute to read this - Recognizing a Stroke ----- A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke... totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed and getting to the patient within 3 hours which is tough.<br><br>RECOGNIZING A STROKE<br><br>Thank God for the sense to remember the "3" steps. Read and Learn. Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify.<br><br>Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.<br><br>Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1. *Ask the individual to SMILE.<br><br>&gt; 2. *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3. *Ask the person to SAY A SIMPLE SENTENCE<br>&gt; (Coherently)<br>&gt; (example: "It is sunny today")<br><br>If he or she has trouble with any of these tasks, call 9-1-1 immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher. After discovering that a group of non-medical volunteers could identify facial weakness, arm weakness and speech problems, researchers urged the general public to learn the three questions. They presented their conclusions at the American Stroke Association's annual meeting last February. Widespread use of this test could result in prompt diagnosis and treatment of the stroke and prevent brain damage.<br></div>
