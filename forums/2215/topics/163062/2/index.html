They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food - while she appeared a bit shaken up, Ingrid went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. Ingrid's husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital (at 6:00pm, Ingrid passed away.)<br><br>She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ - had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke perhaps Ingrid would be with us today. It only takes a minute to read this - Recognizing a Stroke ----- A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke... totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed and getting to the patient within 3 hours which is tough.<br><br>RECOGNIZING A STROKE<br><br>Thank God for the sense to remember the "3" steps. Read and Learn. Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify.<br><br>Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.<br><br>Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1. *Ask the individual to SMILE.<br><br>&gt; 2. *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3. *Ask the person to SAY A SIMPLE SENTENCE<br>&gt; (Coherently)<br>&gt; (example: "It is sunny today")<br><br>If he or she has trouble with any of these tasks, call 9-1-1 immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher. After discovering that a group of non-medical volunteers could identify facial weakness, arm weakness and speech problems, researchers urged the general public to learn the three questions. They presented their conclusions at the American Stroke Association's annual meeting last February. Widespread use of this test could result in prompt diagnosis and treatment of the stroke and prevent brain damage.<br></div></blockquote>See this before. But I doubt it is true. I mean I know depending on where the stroke strikes, it will affect different parts of your body. Just asking them do these three things to diagnose seems very slipshod.</div>

(guess not..) if not, then how come they suggested with three of those tests only? wats e rational behind such tests?</div></blockquote>There are two kinds of stroke, one is such of thrombotic (clotting) and the other is hemorrhagic (bleeding)...<br><br>90% happens to be thrombotic while only 10% or even less is hemorrhagic. These two are more common and occurs widely in the population that they are considered more than other rarities.<br><br>There are two basic sites of stroke events, you have to know the anatomy to understand it better. But suffice to say, that the brain has three major circulations - anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries originating from the Circle of Willis (formed anteriorly by the carotids and posteriorly by the vertebral arteries).<br><br>The carotids branch out (generally to say) to become the anterior and middle cerebral arteries while the vertebral artery becomes the posterior cerebral artery.<br><br>The carotids are commonly blocked up with embolism from the heart or primarily through atherosclerosis. If this happens, the motor and sensory area supplied by the anterior and middle circulation will be affected and the patient will present with motor and sensory impairment.<br><br>If the posterior artery is blocked, it mainly affects speech (slurry), coordination, balance, gait and posture. This happens because most of the circulation supplies the cerebellum (and as you know functions as an organ for coordination and balance).<br><br>It is very hard for me to elaborate on stroke, as the above discussion is just put in such a way to help you understand that stroke can happen in any part of the brain, but it's presentation is basically divided into the two mentioned above...<br><br>The 3 questions are used to test the presence of a stroke, not the location of the stroke (this can be better shown in a CT scan, though clinical examination by a renowned neurologist can identify specifically the area that is involved). Location however is unimportant in stroke, as what is important primarily is what kind of stroke are we facing here, is it a clot or is it a bleed? Improper management can lead to death if this is not identified.</div>
