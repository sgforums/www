              <p>My dad was down with heart valve disease and had an operation during sept 09. The operation for the valve repair was successful but somewhere in the middle of the operation, they broke the aorta which causes complication - aortic dissection. He nearly passed away that night and we were all shocked  because the doctor told us that the mortality rate was 1%. But after the operation, he told us that the mortality was 70-80%. </p>
              <p>Fortunately, he managed to pull through and was discharged one month later. Now, he will have to go for regular medical check up and the last time he went for the medical check up, the doctor told him that he is recovering and will only need to go for regular check once every 3 years.</p>
              <p>However, Im a little worried because one of my neighbour passed away just few days ago. To my surprise, my neighbour was also down with heart valve disease and he was assured by the doctor that he had fully recovered. Yet, in less than two years, my neighbour passed away due to Heart Valve problem. (He just fainted and then gone) </p>
              <p>After hearing about my neighbour's death, My dad has been thinking alot and keep asking me whether the doctor have told us about his lifespan and he keep saying things like usually no more than 5 years(Coz thats what the people in his company told him) . In fact, the doctor did not mention anything and all i could do was to do researching work on the internet. I feel rather helpless and do not know how to answer his question. What should i do? </p>
              <p>Can we still trust the doctor?</p>

              <p>Dear CfCJ,</p>
              <p>Greetings to you, and I am sorry to hear about your father's and your plight. It must have been horrible to find out that a doctor, someone you willingly entrusted your loved one's life with has increased the chances of said loved one's fatality due to a mistake.</p>
              <p>I strongly suggest that you seek help from a lawyer immediately to assess the situation and see what can be done. If you think you aren't able to afford such fees, then speak to someone from your community centre or FSC (Family Service Centre) for counselling help regarding this matter. If they are unable to help, you should try writing to the MP of your GRC.</p>
              <p>I wish you all the best and hope for your father's speedy recovery.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>Hi Naiwarai</p>
              <p>Im from an average family in singapore. My sisters and i did thought of Legal action but we didnt go ahead because it will be fighting against government. We do not have that much of wealth and it might cause alot of trouble and stress to my dad.. thanks for your advise anyway. really appreciate it =)</p>

              <p>CFCJ,</p>
              <p>Not everyone is able to afford a lawyer, but that doesn't mean justice cannot be served for everyone. I don't quite understand what you meant when you said that you'd be fighting 'against government', though. The doctor is different from the hospital, although the hospital will try to defend their doctor first, but in no way would the government be fighting against you in court. Those are two different entities.</p>
              <p>In any case, the more important issue now is about the doctor's performance. You are too kind to continue trusting your doctor after what happened, as most people would be too horrified to continue after the operation and immediate switch doctors. I do urge you to seek the medical opinion of other doctors to get a realistic gauge of his lifespan, though. Whether you want to trust this doctor or not is entirely up to you. Are you confident that he has done a good enough job and that it was just an accident? Or would you prefer someone who is more capable? Bearing in mind the situation, you can even have a case against him.</p>

              <p>The reason which the doctor gave for the complication was due to my dad's artery vein wall being too thin as a result causing the complication. We do suspect that there might be existence of neglience coz nobody know what have happened inside the theatre.</p>
              <p>Plus,the surgeon who performed the surgery was one of the most reputable and experienced surgeon in SGH. We dare not change the doctor as we do not have any contacts of other specialist who are reliable. I was wondering is it true to say that private hospital has got better specialist than the government ones?  </p>

              <p>i agreed with mancha you might want to go for 2nd opinon and your father would need to make lifestyle adjustment if necessary. What you want to do is to calm your father and not let him drift into this mental state and wasting energy on worrying about kicking the bucket.</p>

              <p>Actually right after my dad's operation (2 days later), there is another patient having the same heart problem and operation as my dad. but that patient was not so lucky and didnt make it out of the theatre. Before the operation there will be some documents tat requires you to sign. Things like they wont be responsible for certain event that causes complication. All the risks that was being told by the doctor are <strong>1%</strong> which was so unrealistic!</p>
              <p>I do agree with you that our law may not be patient friendly. Coz all the evidences are in their hand. God knows what they will do to all the documentation if legal issue are to arise. As for now, i will keep looking out for contacts of reliable specialist in singapore. </p>
