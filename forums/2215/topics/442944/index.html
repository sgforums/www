              Hi all, i am new to this community but i am not new in motherhood. I am having a 21 months old baby girl who is also yearning to have a sister or brother. haha.... maybe that is like what me and my hubby wanting more. 
              
              My last AF was on 5th Nov 2011, 14 days later (19th Nov 2011) which was believed to be my ovulation day, i had sex with hubby. Due to his busy work schedule, we only had sex once last month. A few days later, which was around 23rd Nov 2011, i started to feel nausea, giddy, headache, poor appetite, thirsty, crampy and all these are the signs and symptoms which i had gone thru in my first pregnancy. But i nv expect "them" to come as early as 4 days after conception. 
              
               i did a HPT 3 days before 3rd Dec 2011 which is my next expected AF (28 days cycle), but i turns out to be negative, my hubby think it was too early to test.
              
              My period had always been so "on the dot" for the one year plus or so after my first pregnancy. And so i can pretty confirmed that "I AM PREGNANT". I did another HPT on the next day 4th dec 2011 morning, but still it is negative......
              
              on the same day, some time in the noon, i started to bleed, thinking that it was the arrival of my AF, but the colour and feelings and duration are not alike my normal menses period. pinkish, turn red, back to pink, to brownish, and the amount of flow is very little. i believed that it is implantation bleeding which nv experienced in my first pregnancy.
              
              Today 6th Dec 2011, everything is back to normal. no more bleeding, continue to have nausea, giddy, headache, a bit of crampy. I want to take the HPT again!!
              
              But when can i take the HPT again?? If positive, we will be delighted, but if negative, why am i having all the morning sickness and why the AF so funny and short??
              
              Please advice me and hope to hear from anyone who have this experience before. Thanks in advance.....
