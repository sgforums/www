Thalassaemia (or Mediterranean Sea anaemia, which is what that Greek term means) is a genetic condition resulting in a defect of globin chain production. Haemoglobin, the pigment in red blood cells that transports oxygen, is composed of haeme (which contains iron), alpha and beta globin chains. There are 4 alleles (copies) of the alpha globin gene and 2 of the beta globin gene. Inadequate production of the alpha and beta globin chains results in alpha and beta thalassaemia respectively. Depending on the degree of abnormality, the disease varies in severity:<br><br>Alpha thalassaemia:<br>1 or 2 allele defect: alpha thalassaemia trait (alpha-1 and alpha-2 thalassaemia)<br>3 allele defect: Haemoglobin H disease (fairly severe and may require occasional blood transfusions)<br>4 allele defect: Haemoglobin Bart's disease (incompatible with life, usually stillborn)<br><br>Beta thalassaemia:<br>1 allele defect: beta thalassaemia minor (asymptomatic or very mild)<br>2 allele defect: beta thalassaemia major (requires regular blood transfusions and death in teenage or young adult life)<br><br>As the name implies, thalassaemia is common in the Mediterranean Sea areas, as well as in South East Asia. However, the disease we see in Asia tends to be more severe. Whereas thalassaemic patients in the Mediterranean region tend to get a mutation of the globin chain genes, we tend to get a deletion of the entire allele(s).<br><br>As Reno said, thalassaemia confers some resistance to malaria like sickle cell anaemia does. The red cells in these conditions are defective and so malaria parasites tend to die within them, rather than replicating in them. However, the flip side of it is that haemolytic anaemia like thalassaemia may undergo massive haemolysis in the presence of infection by Parvovirus B19.<br></div>
