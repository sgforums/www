              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore's first Zika cluster of 2017 reported at Simon Place</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: Two cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infections have been confirmed at Simon Place in Hougang, the National Environment Agency said on Wednesday (Mar 29).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>This is the first Zika cluster reported in Singapore this year.</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>Both cases are residents from the same household, NEA added in a media release.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Zika cluster was confirmed on Tuesday and vector control operations are being carried out in the area.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“As of Mar 29, NEA has inspected about 120 premises out of about 400 premises in the Simon Place cluster to check for mosquito breeding and also conducted ground checks in the vicinity," said the agency.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"10 breeding habitats – comprising seven in homes and three in common areas/other premises – have been detected and destroyed."</div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>
              <div>NEA added that it has carried out indoor spraying of insecticides, as well as thermal fogging and misting in the outdoor areas. In addition, outreach efforts are being conducted by NEA officers and grassroot volunteers in the area to distribute Zika information leaflets and insect repellent to households.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>NEA also urged residents to allow officers to carry out inspections and indoor spraying of residents' homes if required. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>"Most people infected with the Zika virus do not develop symptoms, which heightens the risk of a Zika resurgence as it may take some time before a reintroduced Zika virus is detected. With the presence of the Aedes mosquito vector here, everyone must therefore continue to maintain vigilance and play his part to prevent future localised transmission through eradicating mosquito breeding habitats in our neighbourhoods," said NEA.</div>

              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: Two cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection have been confirmed at the Poh Huat Terrace and Terrasse Lane area near Hougang, said the National Environment Agency on Tuesday (Apr 11).</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Both cases are residents in the area, it added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>NEA said it was notified of the cluster on Tuesday and has started operations to kill mosquitoes in the area. It urged residents to let NEA officers carry out inspections and indoor spraying of their homes.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The latest cluster is not far from the two other Zika clusters reported in Singapore this year. The first cluster, at Simon Place, was closed on Tuesday, nearly two weeks after cases there were confirmed. NEA said the area will be kept under surveillance.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The agency is also continuing with operations to control the mosquito population in the Flower Road and Hendry Close area, where two cases were confirmed last Thursday.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>It added that even before the latest cluster was notified, "NEA has been conducting preventive inspections in the vicinity to detect and destroy any potential mosquito breeding habitats."</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Members of the public are advised to seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash, said NEA.</div>

              <p>SINGAPORE: A new Zika cluster has been confirmed at Highland Road and Jansen Close near Kovan, with two cases of locally transmitted infection, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Tuesday (Apr 25).</p>
              <p>Both are residents in the area, said NEA, adding that it has started operations to kill mosquitoes in the area.</p>
              <p>There are now three active Zika clusters in Singapore around the same neighbourhood. NEA said an additional case was confirmed at the Glasgow Road cluster on Monday and another new case at the Poh Huat Road West/Poh Huat Terrace/Terrasse Lane cluster on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The cluster at Flower Road/Hendry Close closed on Tuesday and is being kept under surveillance, said NEA.</p>
              <p>It urged residents to be vigilant and continue to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats, as there could still be "asymptomatic or mild, undiagnosed cases which might result in further transmission of the virus if there are mosquitoes in the vicinity".</p>
