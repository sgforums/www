            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Channel NewsAsia -  26 minutes ago</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Significant minority still has misconceptions about heart risks</span></strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: Many Singaporeans seem to know the answers when it comes to heart health matters, but the Singapore Heart Foundation remains concerned about the significant minority who still has misconceptions about heart risks.<br><br>In a survey of 1,588 Singaporeans during the National Heart Week in September last year, nine out of ten respondents said they knew that heart disease and stroke did not only affect the elderly, and almost nine in ten said women were as much at risk as men when it came to getting heart disease.<br><br>Almost eight in ten respondents also had their blood pressure checked in the last 12 months, while almost seven in ten had their cholesterol level reading taken over the same period.<br><br>The Singapore Heart Foundation said while the results are heartening, it is concerned there are still misconceptions about heart disease management.<br><br>This is because four in ten respondents believed they did not need to worry about cholesterol if their blood pressure was under control. And about 23 percent thought they need not worry about heart disease unless their blood pressure and cholesterol were very high.<br><br>Almost 30 percent said they could stop their medication when they reach their required blood pressure or cholesterol level.<br><br>Dr Terence Chua, ViceÂ—Chairman of Singapore Heart Foundation, said: "This survey is actually very helpful because although it doesnÂ’t represent all of Singapore, it helps to identify areas where we might want to focus more attention on to drive the content of the public health message."<br><br>The Foundation is working with other stakeholders such as Community Development Councils and SATA to conduct health screenings and public forums to highlight the importance of heart disease knowledge.<br><br>It also conducted another survey last November, targeted at the lowÂ—income elderly.<br><br>Some 300 households in four blocks in Henderson took part in the survey carried out by students, SATA nurses and grassroots leaders.<br><br>Information such as blood pressure, cholesterol level and family history of interviewees were collected. The height, weight and nutrition of the residents were also taken.<br><br>The exercise found that almost half of them had medical ailments such as diabetes, high cholesterol and heart problems.<br><br>Ho Sun Yee, CEO of Singapore Heart Foundation, said: "We still need to refine the survey instrument to have a more meaningful comparison, but I think at the end of it, they want to be able to find out what are the issues confronting them in terms of diet, so that we can, perhaps, influence some policy making to better help the residents. As I said, this is not a simple survey but we want to hit many objectives as we go along."<br><br>To help these lowÂ—income elderly, the Foundation has set up a holistic support programme, which includes a free medical followÂ—up with SATA and home visits by volunteers to ensure that they take their medication regularly.<br><br>"One concern is that they donÂ’t want to know about their health problems to avoid worrying about them. This is a shortÂ—sighted view but perhaps itÂ’s natural if you already have a lot of worries about income," said Dr Chua.<br><br>The Singapore Heart Foundation will be carrying out a similar survey in Jurong next month, in partnership with the NUS Medical Society.<br><br>Medical students as well as other volunteers will be going houseÂ—toÂ—house to collect residentsÂ’ medical data.<br><br>The project will be carried out over three years with followÂ—up treatment given to those who need help.<br><br>To contribute to the FoundationÂ’s community project, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has donated some S$90,000.
