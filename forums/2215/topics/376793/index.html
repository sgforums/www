              <p>Thailand people are poor and uneducated meh so very easy to fool them to volunteer to test the vaccine.</p>
              <p>Maybe give them some free bread to eat than they volunteer already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I bet they don't even know what vaccine they are trying. If they know its for aids I bet they won't volunteer</p>

              <p>i don't think, when they say "became infected " means getting AIDS.</p>
              <p>just a wild guess, they might have draw the blood of those who had taken the placebo and the vaccine and mix it with the AIDS virus and observe the process, outcome, wadever.</p>
              <p>not literally infecting those people with AIDS virus.</p>
