              <p>Doctors have succeeded in ridding a man of the HIV virus by giving
              him a bone marrow transplant in what they claim is the closest
              treatment yet to a cure for the disease.</p>
              <p>The remarkable case gives new impetus to the development of gene
              therapy for HIV which could ultimately replace the need for expensive
              and toxic antiretroviral drugs. Instead of taking drugs for life, HIV
              sufferers might instead have a one-off treatment that would leave them
              virus-free.</p>
              <p>The 42-year-old American had been infected with HIV for a decade. He
              was treated with antiretroviral drugs in Berlin, where he lives, for
              four years to hold the disease in check, but then developed leukaemia.
              Since being given a bone marrow transplant two years ago, he has not
              taken antiretroviral drugs to control HIV and has had no resurgence of
              either disease. He is believed to be the longest HIV-free survivor who
              was previously treated with antiretroviral drugs. Full details of the
              case are published for the first time today in The New England Journal
              of Medicine. An editorial in the journal says it "places further
              emphasis on gene therapies" for HIV, adding: "The case paves the way
              for innovative approaches that provide long-lasting viral control with
              limited toxicities for persons with HIV infection."</p>
              <p>The man's treatment began with a search by doctors at Berlin's
              Charité Hospital for a bone marrow donor with a genetic resistance to
              HIV. One of the strangest features of the disease is the way some
              people who have been exposed to the virus on many occasions remain
              uninfected. Twenty years ago, it was noticed that certain prostitutes
              in Nairobi remained uninfected despite exposure to the virus through
              thousands of sexual contacts.</p>
              <p>It has since emerged that some people carry a mutation of a gene
              (CCR5) that confers protection against HIV. In Western populations an
              estimated one to three per cent have the mutation.</p>
              <p>Dr Gero Hutter, a haematologist at the Berlin Charité Hospital, and
              colleagues tested 61 potential donors before they found one with the
              CCR5 genetic mutation, who agreed to the operation.</p>
              <p>The American recipient of the transplant, who runs a holiday rentals
              business in the German capital, has undergone regular checks in the two
              years since the treatment. The doctors have tested his bone marrow,
              blood and tissues and found no sign of HIV. "For as long as the viral
              load remains undetectable, this patient will not require antiretroviral
              therapy," they say in the journal.</p>
              <p>Speaking to The Independent yesterday, Dr Hutter said there had been
              several previous reports of patients being virus-free following
              treatment but none to compare with the latest case. "The difference is
              that in our patient we had a plan. It was not an accident," he added.
              "It is the longest time someone who has had antiretroviral therapy and
              stopped has lasted without the virus rebounding. Normally it rebounds
              within weeks. It is the closest we have come to a cure."</p>
              <p>Dr Hutter said a bone marrow transplant would be too risky as a
              routine treatment for HIV and too difficult to find donors with the
              right genetic make-up. But a modification of the approach using gene
              therapy to render a patient HIV-resistant could work, he said.</p>
              <p>Even a costly treatment could be worthwhile. The price of treatment
              with antiretrovirals in Europe is €70,000 to €80,000 (£63,000 to
              £72,000) a year compared with a one-off cost of €20,000 to €30,000 for
              a bone marrow transplant.</p>
              <p>Dr Hutter said: "When I started in medicine, HIV was completely
              untreatable. Now the situation has changed completely. Perhaps our case
              is a glimpse of hope for the future."</p>
              <p>Professor Jay Levy, an Aids specialist at the University of
              California, and author of the US journal's editorial, said claims that
              the patient had been cured of HIV would be premature because of the
              virus's capacity to hide in other parts of the body including the
              brain, gut, liver and lymphatic system, from which it could always
              re-emerge.</p>
              <p>"Nevertheless, the results… provide further encouragement for those
              examining approaches to treatment that reduce CCR5 expression in
              persons with HIV infection," he writes.In 2007, an estimated two
              million people died from Aids and 2.7 million were newly infected with
              HIV.</p>
              <p>25 years of research: The HIV virus</p>
              <p>When the discovery of HIV was announced in 1984, US politicians
              predicted that a cure for Aids would be found within five years, but it
              is still a distant prospect.</p>
              <p>Over the past 10 years, a cocktail of aggressive antiretroviral
              drugs has been developed to help keep the effects of the disease at
              bay. Eliminating it has proved far more difficult because of the
              virus's unique nature.</p>
              <p>HIV integrates itself into an infected person's DNA and attacks the
              cells the immune system sends to attack it. Once infected, these
              T-cells take the virus deeper into the body. Gene therapy is a new
              approach that harnesses the natural resistance to HIV shared by 3 per
              cent of people.</p>
              <p>Experts hope that by tweaking a sufferer's DNA, they can achieve "long-lasting viral control".</p>
