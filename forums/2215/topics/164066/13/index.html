To make sure that your body doesn't overheat, you sweat. When the sweat evaporates, it leaves a cooling effect, therefore cooling your body.<br><br>I guess the same thing applies.

There are some pills (diuretics) which cause peeing often, but I don't think your grandma has to take them everyday.<br><br>The reason for visiting the toilet very often can be: Diabetes - does your grandma have diabetes?
