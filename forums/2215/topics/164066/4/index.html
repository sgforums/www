            <div class='col-md body'>My questions is<br>1.	What is the definition of Â“DeathÂ” ?<br>2.	Should thay have told him his illness?<br>3.	If yes, should the doctor tell the patient his suitation or the family tell him instead.<br>4.	Is this the appropriate place to ask these questions?<br><br>Hi Lin Yu,<br><br>Sorry to hear bout ur loss of a close one...Just trying to see what i can help you with here..<br><br>1. Death: is a biological fact. though it comprimises of many other aspects eg social, cultural, historical, religious, legal, psychological, developmental, medical and ethical aspects..these are closely inter-twined..<br><br>most are cultural n religious based: e.g if u are a buddhist, it is jus a way of life, there is nothing that lasts forever (wu chang in chinese), although death is a universal experience..<br><br>generally, death is a cessation of bodily process.  however, it became more complex (medical) after e introduction of of apparatus that can prolong life.  eg. if a patient is brain dead, he/she can still b alive as long as e respirator is on (correct me if i m wrong doc), as e brain can no longer function to signal e body to do basic bodily processes eg breathing n heartbeat.  and in certain aspects, it relates to if the person has e right to die (ethical)<br><br>2. yes i believe that e patient him/herself has e right to know how his/her condition is. especially when it comes to ethical issues, e patient has the right to choose if he/she wishes to die even if there are ways to keep the body working.<br><br>3. yes. they do have the right to know. although sometimes, truth hurts, but it happens. i m sure that u rather b prepared for his death, than suddenly losing someone right?<br><br>after death, it is only natural to grief, grief work and experiece bereavement: the adjustment after the death of a loved one..in which shock n disbelief, preoccupation with the memory of the deceased and lastly resolution follows respectively.<br><br>death is a type of development. according to a psyhcosocial theory from eric erikson the 8th stage of life: integrity vs despair.<br><br>from what u described, your grandfather has gone thru the following: denial, anger, bargainin for extra time, depression and ultimately acceptance. the first 4 stages shows the despair in him and in the end where he accepted the fact of his condition, he achieved wisdom. wisdom in facing and handling death. therefore a type of development in life.<br><br>if he were to b kept in the dark then most probably, he wld not have met this wisdom stage in life. giving him time to accept the painful truth did him good in the end as you can see, he started to talk to u guys and he passed away in peace and dignity. i am quite sure he enjoyed his last month of life.<br><br>ending off with a lil quote:<br>...there are things to be gained, accomplished in dying. time with and for those whom we are close to, achieving a final and enduring sense of self-worth, and a readiness to let go are priceless elements of a good death...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After listening to the talk on this topic today, i agree that the patient should be told of his condition.
