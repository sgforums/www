The aorta does not fold over on itself as much as it did before.<br><br>The process of aorta calcification  is started by an irritation of the outer cell-layer of the innermost tissue of the artery Â– the endothelium.  Once this irritation is detected, various mechanisms of the immune system take over.  White blood cells (monocytes) rush to the injured tissue and infiltrate the wall of the artery, the blood cells undergo a metamorphic process while they infiltrate and become now macrophages.  This leads to the appearance of macrophage-derived foam cells, which are laden with lipids, i.e., fatty elements.<br><br>When the white blood cells keep on rushing to the irritated tissue, the lipid-core that has accumulated underneath the endothelium, increases in size and causes eventually the swelling to rupture. This rupturing in turn triggers another process of the defensive mechanisms Â– platelet aggregation.  Platelets play a major role in wound healing, since they possess the ability to glue themselves to wounded tissue and to each other, thereby forming a platelet plug.  This form for plug is formed shortly after the just mentioned rupturing, closing the wound.  The negative kickback of this process is that parts of this plug can break away from the artery wall and cause smaller blood vessels to be blocked.<br>Aorta calcification should be taken seriously, it might lead to heart attack.<br><br>mild scoliosis<br><br>When you see the spine from behind, it should be straigt. If it's curved, this is called scoliosis - lateral or sideways curve in the spine. The severity of scoliosis is measured in degrees. Mild scoliosis is less then 20 degrees, many people have it, I think around 50% of the population.<br><br>pleural thickening and associated blunting of the costophrenic angle<br><br>The pleural angle is the curving in the place where the ribs and pleura meet or touch each other. Pleural thickening is scarring (replacement and disruption of the normal cellular pattern by fibrous tissue) in the pleura usually after a variety of inflammatory processes involving the pleura. This involves the pleural membrane which covers the lungs. Usually affecting both lungs although not necessarily to the same extent. This thickening leads to constriction of the lung with consequent loss of lung volume and increasing breathlessness. Due to the more mass of the tissue, the costophrenic angle gets blunted.<br><br></div>
