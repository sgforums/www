            <div class='col-md body'>Hello...<br>I got some questions here regarding feeling constant fatigue. It have been a problem for me about 5 years or so? Anyway when the symptoms started in the initial stage, I was clinically depressed and i got well with about 1-2 years. I don't know whether my depression was because of the fatigue and loss of concentration or was it the stress in my life. Anyway that was in the past. After a while been on anti-depressants I swithced to just taking vitamins and after some time seems i got to feel better. Anyway recently I did a few full blood counts and it seems everything is fine, except my MCV is higher and my RBC on the low normal range. Like, 3.81(3.80-5.80) and MCV 100(80-97) I repeated my blood counts for many times over the past half year and I am always having problems with these. Actually I am just wondering is there any need for me to feel worried now especially my result is just slightly off the normal. But I still feel very very tired ! and low motivation ! I also have done my ESR once and it was about 60 plus. The normal range is about 10-15. I am worried because when I test my ESR I was only having slight cough..is it going to really elevate my ESR so much meh? oh my god. I think I am worrying sick.<br><br>Then I went to my gp who treated me since I was 6 years old. I really trust his knowledge and his experience. Then I told him about my fatigue problem but he tell me there are many causes and doesn't seem interested to help me find out.. anyway I also checked on my thyroid, still within normal lah, but I heard there is a thing call borderline hypothyroid right? and also I tested in the evening about 9pm in which I read that TSH during that time is lower than in the day or morning. It is not that I want to find problems to worry myself lah but the fatigue I feel is really REAL... no matter how much rest is still the same. So sianz right.. the results of thyroid is okay, but tsh is really high and on the upper high normal and T4 on lower normal range...<br><br>do u think i got some problems? do i need to check on my B12 and folate but my mcv is only slightly elevated and higher than normal. do i need to be concern about that? Then my gp kinda say i will worry myself mad if i keep thinking i have this or that.. but i am worried because the fatigue i feel is real. I have been living on vitamins haha, if not for that I won have the energy to wake up every morning, and coffee of course..<br><br>Any advices?<br>Thanks in advance for any inputs.. heh<br></div>

They will then start to cry out for help by giving out such pins and needles sensation and also a feeling of numbness.<br><br>The thing is, did you have this problem only recently or did you have this problem over a long period of time, and having difficulty in sleeping as well, as the pain comes at night.<br><br>Did you feel the same pins and numbness sensation over your left fingers as well particularly your thumb, index finger, middle finger and half of your ring finger?<br><br>Are you on any medications as well?<br><br>Mods, I will be away for a few more days, so if you see this post and the consult, please continue the relevant question on Carpal Tunnel syndrome of this problem is prolonged and chronic.

Did you particularly feel heaty at night and up to a point where you need a bath to cool your body down during the night itself? How is your appetite, did you find it reduced as in loss of interest in eating or loss of appetite totally? How is your weight? Has it been in a declining fashion or increasing trend?<br><br>Have you done a blood glucose level check as well?<br><br>You can have your Vit B12 and Folate Acid levels check, but seldom would it affect males (if you are a guy), but it is worth a go to ensure that all your levels are well within normal limits. As deficiencies of the above may lead to nerve problems. Yes, you may suspect the possiblities of thyroid, but borderline thyroid is more for patients who are elderly and is having a chronic illness which does not seem to recover and may manifest through thyroid problem as well...<br><br>Did you also have a recent viral infection which lasted for quite some time, probably a few weeks and didn't seem to recover over a long period of time? Sometimes recovery from chronic (long term) viral infection may also cause the above complains such as tiredness, fatigue, lack of motivation and slowness in activities. This is well known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (you may wish to find out more through the Net)...<br><br>Once the above levels are normal, and you are found to be physically fit, but still feeling gloomy and down without any motivation, and don't feel the oomph! in your daily routine activities and pleasurable activities, you may want to seek help from a psychiatrist again. Clinical depression can recur.</div>

Maybe increased in appertite and increasing trend in weight.<br><br>I checked my blood glucose and hba1c both are good values and well within normal range.<br><br>I don't think is CFS as this problem persisted for like 5 years already. In the first year or so, I only developed a whole body rashes with no other symptoms and later on I seen around 4 different docs with 7 trips to the clinics.. almost burnt a hole in my wallet and later a skin doc treated me with oral bethamethasone and caused my wrist and ankles to swell slightly and my palms turned blue. After i told him the side effects he said there wont be any. and continued to put me on it for a lower dose. He tell me is muscles but I don't know how it can developed immediatedly after I taken the meds. In 2 weeks time I totally recovered from the strange rashes. Then that was around the time my life started to crash and etc etc..<br><br>I don't have viral only bacterial infection and tonsilitis 1 month ago.. but then after 2 weeks i recovered completely then after the recovery only felt extreme fatigue for like one week...now is okay but I still feel the fatigue and low motivation is still there, and I don't think it is same as the one I get from illness. Every mornings, I find it difficult to wake up even if I sleep 7 or 8 hours.<br><br>I want to check my B12 and folate long time ago. But I don't know how to tell my gp or other doc I want to check it. I cannot order the test like that myself without a reason. They will ask me why I need to do that. I don't know how to convince my gp anyway i think that gp also don't really care.<br><br>usually how is CFS treated with? how to diagnose it?</div>

After the pox, the virus can stay within the nerve and resurface as shingles, altho' it's unknown why some get it and some don't.<br><br>As it's related to the nerves, that's why the blisters that appear are found on 1 side of the body or face only, but never cross over. Apparently, the fluid from the burst blisters can be infectious and cause someone who has yet to have chickenpox to get it (the pox). Luckily, I had my pox already.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Once into the course of disease itself, you should grant them food in the fluid form, porridge, oats and milk if possible to reduce the pain on chewing and biting.<br><br>Yes, in shingles, the pain can be so severe as it affects the nerves in the head, neck and the body itself, it courses through the nerve root from the spine in the body and follow it right to the midline in the front before terminating. By right, it should not cross the center for the nerve has already terminated prior to reaching the midline. Though there may be some forms of complex shingles which may give rise to such condition.<br><br>Headaches and increased sensitivity is rather normal as the involvement is generalized. Be sure to note that the blisters do not start popping out on the eyebrows and the nose itself, for these are early signs which will progress to the involvement of the eyes that may lead to blindness... Such condition warrants aggressive treatment with acyclovir.<br><br>You may want to read about Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (search on the net), this is one of the dangerous complications and warrants and emergency treatment. Otherwise, the course of the disease may take from 4-6 weeks depending on the individual to recover from the illness.<br><br>Is your SO taking any antiviral medications for his illness or just the pain killers? It has been shown that such antivirals such as acyclovir terminates the proliferation of such viruses by preventing its reproduction hence leading to a shorter course of illness. It may also help in relieving pain and is a welcome sight for the patient.</div>

This may help, but eventually ergonomics is rather important in your working environment. You should suit your need and comfort to your working place so as to relieve pressure on your hands.<br><br>If you discover that the numbness and stinging sensation returns, try to cease from what you are doing and let your arm rest.<br><br>The pain described with association with the heart problem is a referred pain or sensation when one has a heart attack. Heart attack is hardly a problem in ladies (if you are a lady) in the premenopausal stage as there is a protective hormone called estrogen that smooths out the blood flow and maintain the elasticity of the blood vessels.<br><br>If you are interested to know more about heart attack, you can search for it in Virtual Clinic 4 in this forum, first and second page.

In the first year or so, I only developed a whole body rashes with no other symptoms and later on I seen around 4 different docs with 7 trips to the clinics.. almost burnt a hole in my wallet and later a skin doc treated me with oral bethamethasone and caused my wrist and ankles to swell slightly and my palms turned blue. After i told him the side effects he said there wont be any. and continued to put me on it for a lower dose.

That is with regards of my practice here in Malaysia. Otherwise, the main causative problems is blood iron levels which is the ulterior one that is commonly assessed. If they are within normal range, you are likely to be fine off with anemia. Also with regards to your MCV count of 100, I doubt there is much abnormalities in your B12 and folate levels either, as deficiency in these nutrients will raise the MCV count almost dramatically to a point where the red cells are big in size (MCV measures the size of the blood cell).<br><br>Aside from all the discussion above, I would want to know why were you treated with steroids in the first place, and did the skin specialist told you what your problem was?</div>
