After some time the itch stops but the next day at night the same thing happen again until it reaches another time before the itch subside. I dunno if the medicated oil have anything to do with it and for some reason the itch stops at the afternoon on both days. I don't feel like seeing a doctor(no money and a bit embarassing altho i might if the itch refuses to go off after a week).
