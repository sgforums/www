Hi, just wondering how come sometime when we have fever, we have a sleep then sweat out everything.. the fever sorta resided.. how come ah?</div></blockquote>Fever kills the viruses and some bacterias, so when your body is infected, the natural defensive reaction of the body is to increase the temperature to kill the beasts. When the viruses or bacterias get killed, the natural reaction of the body is to lower the temperature. Through sweating toxical and junky substances get out of the body.<br><br>Hence you shouldn't take paracethamol or panadol in the moment when you realize you have fever, becasue you take your body the chance to help itself. You should wait few hours, ofcourse when you have like 39 C, you better take the pill, becasue too high temperature can be harmful.</div>

To make sure that your body doesn't overheat, you sweat. When the sweat evaporates, it leaves a cooling effect, therefore cooling your body.<br><br>I guess the same thing applies. My bio teacher explained, not me. </div></blockquote>Say when you have a viral fever, the virus stimulates the release of various chemicals known as cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). They reset the thermostat in the hypothalamus of the brain to raise the body temperature.<br><br>When you take panadol or when these chemicals tail off as you recover, the thermostat is brought back to the normal level. The human body's main mechanism for losing heat is by sweating, which comes into play as it does when you exercise. In exercise, the body temperature is raised by physical activity whilst in a viral infection, it is the virus that raised the body temperature. The way we lose heat to maintain normal temperature is the same: by sweating.</div>

The type of T cell response leads to a humoral versus cellular type of immune reaction.

Since the skin is snuggly attached to the cartilaginous structure of both the outer ear and the outer part of the canal, any swelling will increase the tautness of the skin leading to extreme sensitivity to touch (pain).<br><br>Best to get it seen by a GP.</div>
