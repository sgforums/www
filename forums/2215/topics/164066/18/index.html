Like very high leh. I learn in biology that the ratio is 1:500.<br><br>She is discharged liao.<br><br>Also, she has fever and diarrhoea.<br><br>The symptoms remind me of leukemia.<br><br>Does discharging means that there is nothing wrong?<br><br></div></blockquote>You have a very low threshold of worrying... the normal WCC is between 4000-11000. White cell count normally increases to fight off a simple infection such as a urinary tract infection, bladder infection, common cough and cold, ear infection or sore throat. It can also be elevated after an injury or during healing of a wound.<br><br>You shouldn't be thinking of leukemia as it is a very very serious disease. Patients usually come in with loss of appetite, loss of significant weight over a short period of time, abdominal pain, abdominal bloatedness and swelling, rashes, fever would be mild if it is a chronic problem, easily prone to be infected, easily bruised and have constant symptoms of dizziness, pale appearance, light-headedness and racing heart beat. There may even be long term bone pain or multiple joint pain.<br><br>Yes, discharging means the patient is on a recovering trend and can be managed at home. Usually they are advised on returning to the hospital's outpatient dept if they continue to suffer the symptoms or if it gets worse...<br><br>My advise to you:- try not to think that everything is serious. I presume that your friend is young, vibrant, healthy and in good condition, try to relate the logic with logic.

When do you usually get them, how often, which part of your head, how long do they take, do you take some painkillers, how strong are they, do you have any other symptoms during the headaches (nausea, blurred sigh)?<br><br>Some headaches are still a "mystery" , we can explain some kinds of headaches, but there are also headaches for which the explanation seems to be difficult.<br>Please, answer my questions and write your own comments too, let's see what we can figure out from your description.</div>
