            <div class='col-md body'>Vit C was once thought to be one of the main causative factor for oxalate stones in the kidneys, because it's metabolism or breakdown produces oxalic acid which in turn gets excreted in the urine and can be measured for it's quantity. Higher intake gives rise to raised oxaluria, but later randomized clinical trial showed that this was not significant enough to show the formation of kidney stones. In fact, it has been shown to reduce the chances of stone formation. However, there remains a strong debate on it, so I dare not comment further...<br><br><strong>STUDY</strong><br><br>[Vitamin C and stone risk. Review of the literature]<br><br>[Article in French]<br><br>Traxer O, Pearle MS, Gattegno B, Thibault P.<br><br>Service d'Urologie, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France. olivier.traxer@tnn.ap-hop-paris.fr<br><br>The popularity of vitamin C can be attributed to Linus Pauling who, in the 1970s, recommended the use of vitamin C for the prevention of influenza. Vitamin C has subsequently been used extensively in a wide range of diseases. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been incriminated as a possible risk factor for calcium oxalate stones due to its enzymatic conversion into oxalate. However, this lithogenic role has never been clearly established. Studies evaluating the effect of ascorbic acid on lithogenesis have reported contradictory results. Ascorbic acid has also been extensively used as an urine acidifier for the treatment of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection. Once again, the data of the literature are contradictory. The purpose of this article was to review the effects of ascorbic acid on lithogenesis and urinary pH based on a review of the literature.<br><br><strong>CONTRADICTORY STUDY</strong> &lt;--this is trusted more as it is a randomized clinical trial (Level 1 Evidence)<br><br>Ascorbate increases human oxaluria and kidney stone risk.<br><br>Massey LK, Liebman M, Kynast-Gales SA.<br><br>Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Washington State University, Spokane, WA, USA. massey@wsu.edu<br><br>Currently, the recommended upper limit for ascorbic acid (AA) intake is 2000 mg/d. However, because AA is endogenously converted to oxalate and appears to increase the absorption of dietary oxalate, supplementation may increase the risk of kidney stones. The effect of AA supplementation on urinary oxalate was studied in a randomized, crossover, controlled design in which subjects consumed a controlled diet in a university metabolic unit. Stoneformers (n = 29; SF) and age- and gender-matched non-stoneformers (n = 19; NSF) consumed 1000 mg AA twice each day with each morning and evening meal for 6 d (treatment A), and no AA for 6 d (treatment N) in random order. After 5 d of adaptation to a low-oxalate diet, participants lived for 24 h in a metabolic unit, during which they were given 136 mg oxalate, including 18 mg 13C2 oxalic acid, 2 h before breakfast; they then consumed a controlled very low-oxalate diet for 24 h. Of the 48 participants, 19 (12 stoneformers, 7 non-stoneformers) were identified as responders, defined by an increase in 24-h total oxalate excretion &gt; 10% after treatment A compared with N. Responders had a greater 24-h Tiselius Risk Index (TRI) with AA supplementation (1.10 +/- 0.66 treatment A vs. 0.76 +/- 0.42 treatment N) because of a 31% increase in the percentage of oxalate absorption (10.5 +/- 3.2% treatment A vs. 8.0 +/- 2.4% treatment N) and a 39% increase in endogenous oxalate synthesis with treatment A than during treatment N (544 +/- 131 A vs. 391 +/- 71 micromol/d N). The 1000 mg AA twice each day increased urinary oxalate and TRI for calcium oxalate kidney stones in 40% of participants, both stoneformers and non-stoneformers.<br></div>

Allergic conjunctivitis is fairly common, which is closely followed by viral conjunctivitis. Since it is allergic, you may want to find out if there has been a history of you having asthma, eczema, drug allergies or having allergic rhinitis (persistent nose block, watery discharge and sneezing).<br><br>Itchiness, dryness and red eyes being the common complains, but pain rarely. The swelling is a fake layer of membrane formed overlying to the conjunctiva, and can be so severe as to disrupt vision, but not occlude the field, hence we can still see clearly, though it is rather irritating.<br><br>The very best nature of your condition, to help you get back to normal or near normal activity is to try your best to avoid the triggering factor. If you are allergic, consult your GP for antihistamines.<br><br>I hope the above may help, though it's quite late, I didn't really saw this post... sorry...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

When one is asleep, the eyelids shut tight and prevent the fluids from clearing off, hence it gets collected at and around the conjunctiva (mostly in the lower eyelids - known as palpebral conjunctiva).<br><br>It is normal to have wet eyes when you wake up. It's a self cleansing mechanism to remove the accumulated tears (some of which is solidified and becomes the greenish mucus you see when you rub it off).<br><br>If you feel a little breathless over such matter, it goes to show that either you need to start exercising to speed up your blood flow rate or you need to reduce your weight.

If you do, you might undoubtedly rub your eyes with it and you may be allergic towards it, but this is not in your case.<br><br>It is common (note the bolded statement you mentioned) for the itch to be in the inner corner as the tear duct (self cleansing and clearing tear mechanism) is located in that place. All the dusts accumulated, the tears and dead epithelial debris is brought to that place to be cast off, and if you have sensitive eyes, it is likely that the itch will be present there, since the concentration of the particulates are more compared to the rest of the conjunctiva.<br><br>*the flow of tears is in that direction*</div>
