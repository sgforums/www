              <p>I got an uncle who got diagnosed with cancer stage 3... Tumor growth near the shoulder blade.... But the thing is he has been going to the polyclinics many times complaining his shoulder is painful and every single time they diagnose muscle ache and just give pain killers....</p>
              <p>Its only when he went to a family doctor after 4 months of the shoulder pain when the doctor say there could be a growth and need to go for X-ray.... After X-ray then realized there is a tumor...</p>

              <p>Negligence must be proved. Can your uncle (or his lawyers) prove that the doctor has been given enough information, and failed to act reasonably competently in accordance with his expertise. Note, the standards differs from locum, regular GP, and specialists.</p>
              <p>The doctor need only show that he did act correctly according to the information given to him at the time of the visits.</p>

              <p>TS, by all means, go for it. sue the polyclinic.</p>
              <p>Who have 
                  better and more advance equipment? Polyclinic or GPs? If your GP is able
                   to diagnose possible cancerous growth on the first visit, assuming that
                   he did it by visual means, your polyclinic doctors should be ashamed of
                   themselves.</p>
              <p>The cancer was left undiagnosed for 4 months, and 
                  many things could have happened during this period. For cancer, the 
                  earlier you detect, and the earlier you do something about it the 
                  better. Treatment could be less complicated and less costly if the 
                  doctors have detected it 4 months earlier.</p>
              <p>Stage 3 cancer is no 
                  joke, and the chance of recovery is much lower than stage 1 cancer, 
                  where a simple surgical removal of the tumor will cure your uncle of 
                  cancer. At stage 3, he would have to go for surgery, and go through a 
                  painful chemotherapy and radiotherapy regime, where it is also very 
                  costly too. It can easily cost a very hundred thousands, depending on 
                  severity.</p>
              <p>In the event that your uncle couldn't make it, that 4 
                  months lost would also be very significant. He could have better prepare
                   his family for bad news with the 4 extra months.</p>
              <p>Who is 
                  responsible for this act of negligence? Your uncle was responsible. He 
                  knew that something was not right, and therefore he did the right thing 
                  to seek medical advice, from professionally trained doctors. And the 
                  fact that he did so on multiple occasions reaffirm he has acted 
                  responsibly.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, doctors had repeatedly 
                  misdiagnosed him, when he seeked their medical advice. Given their 
                  capacities as trained medical doctors, your uncle had followed their 
                  professional judgement, and was punished with cancer, and to me, i 
                  considered that a criminal breach of trust, gross incompetence, and 
                  criminally negligent.</p>
              <p>If you merely submit a complaint, it would 
                  be kind of useless, unless your uncle are very very very well off, and 
                  care more about face than money.</p>
              <p>They will probably go through a 
                  lengthy investigation, which usually will take around 1,2 years, even 
                  for the most simple and obvious of cases. And after that, the most they 
                  will do is to give a warning letter to the doctor, and a letter of 
                  apology for the patient.</p>
              <p>Will that letter of apology improve your 
                  uncle's health? Will it reduce the cost of medical treatment? especially
                   when the medical cost is exacerbated due to their misdiagnosis.</p>
              <p>You
                   will need solid compensation to cover for the cost of treatment, and to
                   ensure that the doctor is duely punished. If not by hanging his 
                  license, at least make him feel some pain in his pockets.</p>
              <p>Cancer 
                  is no small matter, and a misdiagnosis and the subsequent delay in 
                  treatment can result in death of the patient. When your life is at stake
                   due to someone's negligence and incompetence, that person should be 
                  held accountable and responsible.</p>
              <p>As for cost of legal advice, usually your estate would offer free legal clinics for free legal consultation. Sometimes, lawyers also take on pro bono cases.</p>
