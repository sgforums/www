            <div class='col-md body'><p><span><span class="update"><em>By Hetty Musfirah Abdul Khamid, Channel NewsAsia<br></em></span><span class="update"><em>Posted: 09 October 2008 2225 hrs</em> <br></span><br>SINGAPORE: There is a global shortage of bone marrow donors, especially among minority groups, and the situation in Singapore is no different. <br><br>Of 43,000 donors registered with the Bone Marrow Donor Programme (BMDP) since it started in 1993, Indian and Malay donors only make up a mere 8 per cent. <br><br>Thus, BMDP is embarking on a campaign to educate and recruit some 5,000 donors, especially among the minority communities. <br><br><strong>Each day in Singapore, at least six people are diagnosed with leukaemia, lymphoma and other blood related diseases,<strong> and 34-year-old Sebha Elizabeth Punnem is one of them.</strong> <br></strong><br>Diagnosed with leukaemia in April 2008, she is now recovering after a transplant from a German donor in August through a successful search done by BMDP. <br><br><strong>However, not all patients are as lucky. The possibility of finding a suitable donor is 1 in 4 among siblings, and 1 in 20,000 for outsiders. <br></strong><br>In Singapore, experts say it is not difficult to find donors for Chinese patients, as they can also come from Taiwan or China. But finding a match for Malay and Indian patients is harder. <br><br>In 2007, only one of 11 Malay patients received a match and transplant. However, there was not a single match for the 11 Indian patients in the same year. <br><br>Senior consultant at the department of paediatrics at National University Hospital, Associate Professor Quah Thuan Chong, said: "Of all the three races in Singapore, it is not difficult to find donors for the Chinese patients because if we cannot find them in Singapore, we can find them in Taiwan, or China. <br><br>"But so far, India does not have a good registry, so sometimes we might get donors from the United States. For the Malays, it is even more difficult, as there are very few Malays in the western countries." <br><br>Professor Quah added that though the blood type of Malay patients is quite close to the Indonesians, Malaysians and Filipinos, unfortunately, all three countries do not have extensive bone marrow registers. <br><br><strong>Hence, there is a need to expand the register of donors in Singapore. In the next three months, there will be a recruitment campaign, which also serves to dispel any misconceptions the public may have.</strong> <br><br>President of the BMDP, Jane Prior, said: "The important thing is that, being a bone marrow donor or being on our register, it is a finger prick, it is not giving us a sample of your bone marrow, we don't want that at this stage. <br><br><strong><span style="color: #339966;">"We just want a drop of blood, we like (to obtain) contact details and then you go about your business, back to work, whatever it may be, and if you come up as a match, only at that time will you be asked to do a bone marrow donation."</span></strong> <br><br>The campaign will include road shows at Singapore's main shopping centres such as Millenia Walk and Suntec City. <br><br>- CNA/yt </span></p></div>
