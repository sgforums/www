The next time when you develop the same infection (reinfection), the common antibiotic may render to be useless now. So that's why you have to get a more expensive and more powerful antibiotic.<br><br>Penicillin used to be the famous medication prescribed so commonly, but resistance by certain bacteria is so great, that they have to progress onwards to broader spectrum (bigger coverage of bacteria) drugs to kill more effectively.</div>
