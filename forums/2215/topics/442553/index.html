                      are we doing this?<br> <span style="color: #333333;">Young people are at the forefront of the global
                      AIDS epidemic. They remain the most vulnerable group to HIV infection due to,
                      among other factors, lack of information, access to resources and social
                      alienation. It is estimated that 4.9 million youths (aged 15 to 24 years)
                      worldwide are living with HIV. In 2009, about 41% of new HIV infections were
                      among youths, with 3,000 infected each day.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;  background: white;"><span><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333; background: white;'>In Singapore,
                      the median age for sexual experimentation is 15 years of age. An increasing
                      number of youths are getting infected with HIV/AIDS each year. Last year, there
                      were 78 newly infected people below the age of 29; in 2009 the figure was 68.
                      The statistics for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) are more startling. In
                      2009, 681 youths aged 10 to 19 were diagnosed with STI. STIs increase the risk
                      of HIV infections by up to 5 times and there are simple steps to prevent the
                      spread of STIs, including HIV/AIDS.</span></span></p>

                      trying to find job, some HIV/AIDS carries was fired by their company. Their
                      friends stay away from them, their family didn’t gave them support but chase
                      them away from home. The treatment for HIV/AIDS is not cheap, some aids carries
                      face problem buying their medicine some even gave up half way by not going for
                      doctor appointment and totally gave up. In our page, We share with people the

              <p>HI Emoslacker We are from ITE Collage Central (YISHUN).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi Darkness_hacker99</p>
              <p>Thank you, Well I learn that there's actually groups that comes out to help hiv/aids carriers in singapore. We have Action for AIDS Singapore (AFA) helping out hiv/aids carriers.</p>
              <p>Q2: We choose social media network for our project, most teen or even adults usally spet lots of time online. We hope that we can spread useful information about hiv/aids and no discrimination towards hiv/aids carriers. If we have such chance again next time, maybe I wish that we can have more chance to speak to the public directly. </p>
              <p>Q3: For now I used to tell people around me that if they came across a hiv/aids carriers treat them like a normal person because a hiv/aids carriers are still normal human like us, they still need people to talk to them.</p>
              <p>Q4: My team, I'm a assitance leader in them them above me is my leader we are a team of 6 people. We named our team name: Educator, why educator? Because we aim to educate people about hiv/aids and not discriminate hiv/aids carriers. Teamwork well I'm the one doing stuff online, my leader is planning with other member a Photo Gallery in my school ITE Yishun for our schoolmates.  Weakness, I believe everyone have weakness but because of our teamwork we still manage to do the project smoothly.</p>

              <p>Hi Rooney_07</p>
              <p>Before I start, please note that having HIV does not means that you have AIDS. Some people may have HIV but they are not a AIDS patients. </p>
              <p>HIV also known as (Human immunodeficiency virus) is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome). The virus damages or destroys the cells of the immune system, leaving them unable to fight infection and certain cancer.</p>
              <p>There's no cure for aids patients, there is only medicine to help aids patients so that they can live longer.</p>
              <p>South Africa, has the most hiv/aids patients there are a total of 5,600,000 people living with hiv/aids in South Africa. Nigeria with 3,300,000 and India with 2,400,000. In asia, Tailand has 530,000 hiv/aids people living with hiv/aids. Indonesia with 310,000 and Vietnam with 280,000. There are total number of 4,845 singaporean living with HIV in 2010. Till 31 Dec 2010 2,319 person has asymptomatic carries, 1,137 have or had AIDS-related illnesses and 1,389 have died.</p>
              <p>Like our facebook fan page today to have more hiv/aids information!</p>
