            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i think i am pretty worried for my kidney after reading how chronic kidney disease can develop and the symptoms are not readily known so there is no way to detect until it is too late.<br><br>But anyway, since young i have a high tedency to clear my bladder because it will always give me the urge to release them. And this becomes more pronounced if i drink more water, hence i tend to take low amount of water because of the inconvenience.<br><br>But i am generally very weak as well, i get tired easily even in the daytime, and have eye bags under my eyes (though could be from insomnia) and whenever i stand up after sitting for too long i could feel light-headed and my eyes would go blurry for a moment.<br><br>And now and then my kidney seems to have something moving in them, although it is very very rare, and the feel is very very mild, i wouldn't know if there are kidney stones or cyst inside. Sometimes eating a highly salty meal, i could experience some very very mild and dull pain on my kidney. Not sure if it results from the meal but i wouldn't know for sure.<br><br>I am not obese, but underweight, and i'm 19yrs old this year, not sure if this helps but i think i should go for kidney test?<br><br>I don't think kidney problems can be prevented right?<br><br>Thanks in advance!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don't be offended when i say this but you sound like you are a hypercondriac! And with the net being able to provide all sorts diagnosis' at a click of a button it's easy to think you've got something major when you haven't. I bet you've read some about kidney infections, etc and it's made you paranoid.<br><br>For starters, if you had a kidney stone or a cyst in your kidney then you'd be in real bad pain! but in  regards to getting sick, puffy eyebags, etc... You sound like you need to change your lifestyle. Incorporate a bit of excercise maybe, a healthier diet, some multi vitamins (to help boost your immune system) and some proper sleep rather than reading about possible health problems late at night. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But I suggest that you should just go to the doctor. He or she will probably test your urine and see if there are traces of blood in your urine or send it for analysis. Young people very rarely get kidney problems at your age.</div>

No doubt people thinks that young people don't really get illnesses most of the time but i'm not on the luckier side when it comes to this.<br><br>Went to consult chinese physician at the chinese association hospital (zhong hwa something something) and he found that my kidney is pretty weak. So now i'm under chinese medications. And he prompted me to start gaining weight and eat meals properly. Oh well...<br><br>I'm still thinking if i should go do some urinary test.</div>
