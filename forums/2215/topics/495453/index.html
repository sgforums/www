              In order to truly reduce the health care costs, people should identify the toxins that can harm the body and disrupt the normal functions of the cells:
                      
                      1. Sodium Laurel sulfate or SLS : a cancer causing agent that cause the bubbles found in shampoos and body bath. 
                      
                      2. Emulsifier, thickener: found in pan cake/cake mix, yogurt
                      
                      3. Alphabet followed by a number e.g. E120 : found in cake mix,
                      
                      4. GMO : genetically modified organisms: our body does not recognise and start to attack the cells that absorbed the digested GMO food. Whatever modified food e.g. seedless fruits, golden kiwi, modified corn/beans/eggs etc.
                      
                      5. Processed salt: can cause high blood pressure: found in instant noodles, biscuits, cake, tidbits, potato chips, salted nuts etc.
                      
                      6. Sulphite/Nitrate: found in processed food like hot dog, bacon, ham, smoked salmon, red dates, raw meat to extend shelf life.
                      
                      7. Colouring found in probiotic drinks, candies, cake, yogurt
                      
                      8. Coffee contains caffeine which is a drug. Many people mistakenly thought coffee can boost the energy. Conversely, it temporarily gives the coffee drinker the "fake" booster then the drinker will need another boost just like the drug addict. In fact, when the temporary boost fizzles out, the coffee drinker ends up feeling tired. A drug is a drug. Caffein can cause insomnia, nervousness, stomach irritation, restlessness, rapid heart rate, headache, agitation, ringing in the ears.
                      
                      9. Medicines: the side effects can harm the body. For instance, one of the side effects of pain killer can cause stroke or heart attack even to people without prior history. ALL medicines have side effects. Read the side effects before you decide it can heal or kill. 
                      
                      10. Incense: scientists have discovered it to be more toxic than cigarette smoking. The carcinogenic chemicals can damage the DNA causing the development of cancer cells. I met an Indian lady who told me she has leaky gut syndrome. She said no matter how many doctors she consulted she was unable to heal. She burned the joss stick. I told her one of the causes of leaky gut syndrome was the overloading of toxins. In order to heal she should stop burning the incense. Any form of burning will release toxin. It does not matter if you burn forest, car petrol, essential oils, cigarette., coal, charcoal ,etc. It also will harm the environment.
                      
                      11. Gas: many people use gas to cook. I use electricity. Bear in mind people use has to commit suicide.
                      
                      12. Fogging
                      
                      13. Processed sugar : can cause chronic diseases including dementia, diabetes
                      
                      14. Energy or carbonated drink
                      
                      15. Pesticides
                      
                      16. Mosquito coil
                      
                      17. Bananas that use calcium carbide to ripen. Black patches will appear instead of dots.
                      
                      18. Processed oil in a bottle: causes plaque to build up and blockages triggering stroke or heart attack. Eat natural oil from scaly fish and unsalted nuts
              
                       19. Eat  or  drink  the  products  of  the  animals injected with  antibiotics and  hormones  like  chickens and  cows.
                      
                      Know what you are eating, drinking, inhaling and applying to your body. If a product contains a toxic ingredient, it is better not to use or consume it. 
                      
                      If you don't poison your body you won't feel lethargic, numbness, pain, aches or weakness. Ultimately, you can live a painless life with zero health problem unless you are the victim of the 2nd or 3rd hand smoker.
