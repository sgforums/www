            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I've read up on the systoms of Atrial Fibrillation and feel they match what I'm going through now. This is my third time feeling the chronic symptoms in the past two weeks.<br><br>Cramps in the chest area near the heart was also experienced last year in April for numerous times. Visits to hospitals and doing both the treadmill and 2D-echo tests proved I am totally healthy.<br><br>I'm currently feeling very frustrated because doctors appear very sceptic of my situation due to my relatively young age. Furthermore, palpitations, irregular heart beat, shortness of breath and chest discomfort i experience are chronic, lasting about 5-10 seconds each time, and hence will not be detectable by a ECG test it seems.<br><br>I feel exhaustingly dizzy very time I do sprints due to my heart beat increasing very rapidly within a few seconds. I only manage to last at most about 20 minutes in a soccer match. However, I'm totally fine with long distances and have the ability to pass fitness tests. So I do not reckon the cause to be lack of fitness.<br><br>I am not sure if all these symptoms are life threatening, but currently everyone seems to assume that I'm just over suspicious and take my complains as a pinch of salt. Furthermore, I'll be enlisting as a fully healthy recruit soon. I feel a lack of support and seriously need someone who understands to advise me on what to do. Thank You.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know it's frustrating when the tests haven't shown anything. Sometimes when a person is observing himself, reads info on some diseases and is worried to get the symptoms, this stress may develop such symptoms. Then it's a psychical problem.<br><br>Anyway, to find out if you have any heart problems or not, I suggest you ask for the Holter's heart monitor, it's a portable monitor of the size of a walkman which monitors your heart activity, ECG and blood pressure. You wear it for 24 hrs and do your normal activities which you do in your life or by which you feel the symptoms, it records the monitored data and then the doctors transfer those data to a computer which analyzes them. If there is something wrong, the doctor will see it. The only problem is whether the doctor takes your complaining about the symptoms seriously and agrees with the holter's monitor test.<br><br>Does anyone in your family (one of your parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts and also in earlier age then usually) have the same problems like you?</div>

It could be a psychical problem I've also tried asking myself that. After the 2D echo test i was convinced I was alright. But i suddenly experienced the symtoms two days ago. I dont think anyone in the family has these conditions. Well, thanks for yr help. Just need someone to share this with. Hope thing will start to get better anyway cuz i dont think i can afford the medical fee for Holter's. Thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
