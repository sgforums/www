Research done shown that in adults - it has low or no protective effect against Pulmonary TB - in a lucky few yes but not all .<br><br>A vaccine is just to let your immune system "recognise" the bacteria and destroy it  .Whenever that particular bacteria invades , because of the vaccine , your immune system knows how to deal with it.  Even if you have ( for example) whooping cough aka diptheria vaccination - u come across a person who has antibiotic resistant diptheria - you might not acquire it because your body will recognise the bacteria.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria only change part of their structure to compensate for hiding their weak points from the drug but not all of their genetic structure which the immune system will recognise and destroy on sight .<br><br>Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection , therefore antibiotics are the treatment option for it. They usually test what  MDR - TB  is susceptible to . We call that culture and sensitivity . If there are some drugs which can work on MDR TB - then they put the patient on it but those are very very expensive . The usual antibiotic cocktail is isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for non MDR-TB . The new ones are rifapentin , capreomycin  and cycloserine . Those are very expensive .<br><br>If all antibiotics fail  ( and let's include the new ones)  , then the person can just wait to hope for the best that the drug company actually comes up with something new - but if not , just wait for death and hope   it will be painless ( that would be a miracle).<br><br>Not the first time it happen that someone dies from a multi resistant bacteria . It is because of people abusing antibiotics as a "miracle cure" for a viral cold , not finishing off their antibiotics  or maybe farmers use it as growth inducer (avoparcin is one such antibiotic used)  in animals  that you have resistant bacteria everywhere - i.e MRSA , VRE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Natural resistance doesn't mean that "Oh a new strain therefore the vaccine is ineffective."<br><br>All bacteria have natural resistance to some components and yes they do evolve against newer treatments but we all know that it is part of darwinian evolutionary theory .<br><br>In theory , you can kill 99% of the bacterial colony in the body but there will be a 1% who will form some resistance against the drug .<br>Although these are viral examples but let's think of this examples of how human ourselves form resistances .  Just like why some people survived small pox and are immune against it while others die. Just like SARS - some survived , some didn't . Just about any infectious disease  Just an analogy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The only reason why 1% can survive and remain dormant in the body is because to actually produce a resistant gene takes up more energy in the resistant bacteria rather than a susceptible bacteria . For example if you expand alot of energy just standing on one spot (i.e. skipping alot) - you will find you are too tired to move on - same goes for the resistant bacteria - they expand abit more energy so they cannot multiply as quickly as susceptible bacteria in theory . Therefore the same goes for the bacteria . However MRSA is endemic (meaning: common)  in hospitals - all those lovely methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus can expand easily because almost everyone of them have the resistant gene and that is their turf . Just flora and fauna thing with them - refer to microbiology textbooks - I am sure some of them will explain how ecology works .<br><br>By the way some transfer immunity via plasmid ( genetic material) to other bacteria strains . Read on VRE. It will be interesting <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">BCG has varying effectiveness  (0-76%) in individuals and no one actually can say why - some say it is a varying genetic changes between TB bacteria ( but this happened WAY before MDR-TB - they learnt that in 1969) , some say it is due to the individual immune systems . Research done shown that in adults - it has low or no protective effect against Pulmonary TB - in a lucky few yes but not all .<br><br><span style="color: red;">A vaccine is just to let your immune system "recognise" the bacteria and destroy it </span> .Whenever that particular bacteria invades , because of the vaccine , your immune system knows how to deal with it.  Even if you have ( for example) whooping cough aka diptheria vaccination - u come across a person who has antibiotic resistant diptheria - you might not acquire it because your body will recognise the bacteria.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria only change part of their structure to compensate for hiding their weak points from the drug but not all of their genetic structure which the immune system will recognise and destroy on sight .<br><br>Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection , therefore antibiotics are the treatment option for it. They usually test what  MDR - TB  is susceptible to . We call that culture and sensitivity . If there are some drugs which can work on MDR TB - then they put the patient on it but those are very very expensive . The usual antibiotic cocktail is isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for non MDR-TB . The new ones are rifapentin , capreomycin  and cycloserine . Those are very expensive .<br><br>If all antibiotics fail  ( and let's include the new ones)  , then the person can just wait to hope for the best that the drug company actually comes up with something new - but if not , just wait for death and hope   it will be painless ( that would be a miracle).<br><br>Not the first time it happen that someone dies from a multi resistant bacteria . It is because of people abusing antibiotics as a "miracle cure" for a viral cold , not finishing off their antibiotics  or maybe farmers use it as growth inducer (avoparcin is one such antibiotic used)  in animals  that you have resistant bacteria everywhere - i.e MRSA , VRE.  </div></blockquote>so a vaccine wrks exactly like an anti virus software in coms...</div>
