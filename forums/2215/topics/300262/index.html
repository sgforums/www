            <div class='col-md body'>Note : The following article is only meant as a <strong>reference material </strong>to the <strong>intended recipients </strong>and advices should be sought from the medical experts to establish the authenticity of its contents. For your information, I get this sickness while living abroad indirectly from <strong>depression </strong>(<strong>Schizophrenia</strong>) through subsequent <strong>allergy and overdosage </strong>of the related-medications (<strong>Risperdal</strong>) and I hope that the information given below will be useful to the intended readers.<br><br><strong>Eyelid twitching</strong>, which is lately referred to as Blepharospasm or <strong>Myokymia </strong>is actually a symptom of involuntary and uncontrollable movements in the muscles around a person's eyes which in turn make them appear like <strong>'blinking non-stop' </strong>to other people.<br><br>Generally, the <strong>movements of one's muscle </strong>is controlled by the <strong>nerves</strong> around them that in turn receive <strong>signals </strong>from the <strong>brains </strong>which ultimately dictate the variety of 'ways' in which such movements are to be conducted based on a person's <strong>will</strong>.<br><br>The causes of such eyelid-twitching symptom <strong>in most common cases </strong>may just due to <strong>short-term stress</strong>, <strong>over-tiredness</strong>, <strong>over-straining of one's eyes</strong>, <strong>occasional anxiety</strong>, <strong>temporary panic fits </strong>and nervousness which in turn can be easily relieved and recover naturally by a <strong>good rest</strong>, <strong>more relaxation </strong>and trying to <strong>calm oneself down to stop getting anxious, panic and worried and stressful</strong> over certain things. In this regard, such phenomena tend to be quite common among certain students and other professionals.<br><br>However, in the cases of a persistent uncontrollable twitchings of the eyelids which only get aggravated rather than improved over time and last for months and even years, it may just probably imply that the nerves around the eyes organ are simply not 'properly functionable' enough to bring about the desired movements of the muscles based on the mental instructions from the brains of a person.<br><br>Except for any brain and other eye muscle damages/eye muscle disorders caused by permanent lack of certain nutrients and minerals etc or other irritations to that organ like dry eyes, sore eyes, bacteria infections etc, such a chronic eyelid-twitching sickness may likely be caused by certain disturbances and disorders that affect or weaken the functionality of the nerves around the eyes to bring about the desired movements of this organ based on the person's will.<br><br>In this regard, the possible reasons of such <strong>chronic eyelid-twitching </strong>sickness may probably due to the causes as mentioned above which is experienced by a person over a <strong>considerably long period of time </strong>rather than just temporarily. Apart from that, other likely causes maybe be certain <strong>traumas</strong>, especially the emotional ones, allergy to or overdosage of certain medications that carry such <strong>side effects </strong>as <strong>muscle spasms</strong>, particularly <strong>photophobia </strong>in the case of eyelid-twitching symptom.<br><br>In fact, I myself have also been suffering from such a sickness due to allergy and overdosage to such medications like <strong>Risperdal </strong>and other similar drugs. As such, I would very much like to share my own genuine personal experience with you over the course of my treatment of such a sickness and I hope that it will somehow be helpful to a certain extent especially to those who have been having the similar experience as mine and I would to emphasize that it again only is meant as a reference material to anyone reading it.<br><br>For your information, I have been suffering from this sickness in the past few years whereby my eyelids also tend to twitch both continuously and uncontrollably without me being able to do anything to control the twitchings at all. As a result, my eyes would seem like blinking all the while to anyone who looks at me and I totally could not drive, look directly and persistently at the pc or tv screens and most of the times, I simply canÂ’t read any books or newspaper properly.<br><br>And I have sought lots of medical treatments and advices as well as apply various kinds of <strong>eye drops</strong>, taking various types of <strong>vitamins</strong>, <strong>mineral pills </strong>as well as many types of <strong>anti-muscle spasm medications </strong>from lots of <strong>eye specialists</strong>, <strong>neurosurgeons </strong>and <strong>psychiatrists </strong>(who explain the medical theories mentioned above to me), <strong>ENT specialists </strong>and other <strong>general practitioners</strong>, and even have the <strong>MRI examinations </strong>taken to get my eyes cured , but these efforts turn out to be in vain as they fail to yield any positive results and my eyes still keep on blinking non-stop.<br><br>Luckily, just about a year after I suffer from such a sickness, I come across an <strong>acupuncture </strong>expert who studied and observed closely about my problems and then administer a therapy needle on the part of the flesh at the back of the palm which is about 1.5 cm vertically from the point of intersection between my thumb and my forefinger of my right hand ( as per illustration in  http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/387431  &amp; the <strong>follow-up description reply below</strong>) to strengthen the weakened and sensitive nerves around my eyes.  After that, he just ask me to press (using just mild force) that acupuncture point using such objects like toothpick /normal writing pen (which is the out-of-ink ones of course)  or anything with a blunt-pointed end for at least 2 hours a day and then consistently for about 2 months. Having done that persistently based on his order, my eyelid-twitching that makes my eyes blinking all the while just totally recover in time and I can drive, work with the pc screens, watch tv, movies and read as well as work like any other normal persons.<br><br>For your further information, I have also come across quite a couple of people in my real life annoyed by such an eyelid-twitching problem of different causes and degrees of severity, and accordingly, I just recommend the method as mentioned above to them and within weeks, they just experience significant improvements to their conditions after applying this therapy, and after a few months , they just recover totally from this sickness. . And I hope that by contributing this piece of article to you, it will somehow help you to in at least getting a clue about this sickness.<br><br>Lastly, I sincerely wish that the ones troubled by such an annoying eyelid-twitching sickness can recover finally from their illness. Thank you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is worthy to take note that in terms of the eyelid-twitching sickness, if the cause of it is clearly identifified as being induced to an individual by overdosage of or allergy to certain types of medications, especially the ones that have strong neurological effects and carry the side effects of muscle spasms such as certain drugs that are meant to cure depression, psychotic sicknesses  and other neurological-related complications like epilepsy etc, it is thus necessary to at best stop taking such medications and replace them with something else if possible in order to at least stop such eyelid-twitching problem from getting further worsened as well as to prevent a relapse of such sickness after a person gets cured from it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Note : The following is only intended as a follow-up of my previous article and the information given are meant to serve only as <strong>reference materials </strong>to the <strong>intended readers</strong>. Relevant medical advices should be sought to establish the authenticity of the contents below.<br><br>About my personal experience of getting totally healed from this <strong>eyelid-twitching sickness</strong>, well, in fact  initially I was instructed by a <strong>psychiatrist </strong>to take <strong>Rispderdal </strong>in the first place for the treatment of my <strong>Schizophrenia </strong>sickness. And having taken this medication for about one year based on his prescribed dosage, my eyelids started to twitch, quite unnoticeable by me at first, but when more and more people began to ask me the reason why I kept on blinking my eyes to anyone who looked at me, I started to sense this particular, eyelid-twitching symptom but without being aware of its underlying causes at all.<br><br>It was only when my eyelids began to twitch non-stop and violently day after day without me being able to do anything to deal with it, I then just referred this problem to my psychiatrist who subsequently told me that he couldn't do anything about it and referred me instead to a the <strong>eye doctors</strong>, <strong>ENT Specialists </strong>and <strong>neurosurgeons</strong>. Having examined my conditions, medical history as well as my diet and the existing medications that I was taking by that time, they all unanimously arrived at the diagnosis that the eyelid-twitching was definitely and undoubtedly caused by the <strong>prolonged intake of Risperdal</strong> which actually carried such <strong>side effects </strong>of <strong>muscle spasms </strong>especially the ones inflicted on the <strong>upper part of the face </strong>of a person who took it for a certain period of time.<br><br>In fact, by that time, I just accordingly followed  the advice of the new psychiatrist and replaced this <strong>Risperdal </strong>with an alternative medication called <strong>Seroquel</strong>,which was actually a<strong> second-generation drug </strong>that didn't cause that much muscle-spasms side effects. However, even after I had <strong>quit taking Risperdal for more than 6 months</strong>, the violent non-stop twtichings still persisted. And actually before I decided to seek acupuncture treatment (as recommended by my friends) to deal with this sickness, I did accept the suggestion of a neurosurgeon to take <strong>Botox injections </strong>to deal with the problematic eyelid-muscles that caused all the twitchings. Next, the Botox injections, in fact did give positive results in the first place whereby my eyelids just didn't twitch that violently after being given the injections.<br><br>However, upon knowing from the neurosurgeon that Botox injections was actually not an effective cure for this eyelid-twitching sickness, for the very reason that the medications would just serve to sort of <strong>'half-paralyse' </strong>the eyelid <strong>muscles </strong>without being able to do anything curative to the problematic <strong>nerves </strong>around the twitching eye muscles, coupled with the fact that such Botox medications would tend to<strong> get immunized by the human body</strong>, thus, it would just mean that larger and larger dosages of such medications would be required for each subsequent injection therapy (which last for <strong>3-6 months </strong>each) in order to achieve the similar healing effect of the previous ones.<br><br>Besides, it was also actually a very expensive therapy as it would cost me about 5,000 dollars for each injection therapy session and hence, to keep on spending such huge sums of money to stop my eyelids from twitching would just be very unreasonable.<br><br>Whilst the neurosurgeon mentioned to me also about a <strong>surgical treatment </strong>to effectively cure the eyelid-twitching, the operation, apart from being very costly, was also actually a very <strong>risky </strong>one as its <strong>failure </strong>may very well bring <strong>blindness </strong>to the persons being operated. At the same time, even such surgery were to turn out to be successful, it would also be unable to  achieve 100% complete healing to anyone being operated in the sense that the eyelid-twitching conditions can never 'look perfectly normal' like the ones who were totally not troubled by such a sickness at all. So, I just eventually gave up the idea of getting a surgery to treat the sickness.<br><br>Being terribly desperate, I just came to the decision of referring my eyelid-twitching sickness to an <strong>acupuncture </strong>expert which was recommended to me previously by my friends. Frankly speaking, I didn't actually have any faith in such a needle-based therapy and I hardly believed that these needles alone would be able to get my eyelid-twiching healed. Next, having received such therapy, my eyelids still twitched violently like before without any improvements.<br><br>However, after taking a good sleep at night that particular day after the acupuncture treatment, I just woke up and found that there were lots of dried mucus that stuck around my eyes, and surprisingly, after rubbing away these dried mucus to open up my eyes, my eyelids just don't twitch so violently anymore and immediately I was able to do the simple readings and watch tv as well as work with the PC screen without getting any discomfort. And based on the acupuncturist who dealt with my sickness,  that acupuncture point as mentioned in that main article was actually directly interconnected with the bundle of nerves around the eye muslces, and so by administering treatment to it, that will sort of applying some kind of 'reflexology stimulus' to the nerves around the eye-muscles to improve the blood circulation around that area  as well as to strengthen these specific nerves and to enable any unwanted  metabolism wastes, blockages and toxins accumulated around that eye areas to be effective purged out of a person's body (through mucus around one's eyes)  And having applied that therapy on my own as instructed by the acupuncturist, my eyelid-twitching condition just got better and better  day after day and within 2 months, the sickness was totally gone whereby my I just appeared to be perfectly normal to anyone who talked to, look and stared at me.<br><br>Though the therapy mechanism  mentioned above could hardly be scientifially verified and proven by the modern medical science,  however, as far as a patient suffering from this sickness is concerned, it is more the very  effective cure  for such sickness itself rather than all other medical and scientific reasonings and theories  that would eventually matter the most to the patients.  As such, this is the main reason why I would seek acupuncture treatment as a <strong>last resort </strong>to deal with my eyelid-twitching sickness.<br><br>And being subsequently encouraged by the dozens of successful cases of those other people in my real life who had been troubled persistently by such non-stop eyelid-twitching sickness and who then eventually got effectively and totally healed in time through the acupuncture technique that I recommended to them, I was thus greatly inspired to post such article about my very own genuine personal experience of getting totally cured from such a sickness to at least give a clue and some guidelines to the ones who are still being troubled by it so that the similar wonderful thing will happen to them too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Subsequent Experience With Seroquel Drug<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Note: The following is only meant as <strong>reference materials </strong>to the <strong>intended readers</strong>. Advices from medical experts should be sought to establish the authenticity of the information below.<br><br>When I switched from <strong>Risperdal </strong>to <strong>Seroquel </strong>for the treatment of my <strong>Schizophrenia </strong>sickness, apart from enabling me to <strong>avoid a relapse of the eyelid-twitching sickness</strong> after I get totally cured from it through acupuncture treatment, it helped me also to a very great extent to enable me to have a very good sleep at night. But when I was at work and hence had to refrain myself from taking such medicine so as not to let its <strong>drowsiness effect </strong>affect my work performance, I just became quite <strong>irritable </strong>without any known causes or reasons. And over time, I simply needed such medication to help me sleep at night, and to stop becoming irritable or get angry/frustrated very easily without any reasons.<br><br>About one and a half years ago, I was advised by a <strong>pyschiatrist </strong>that it was possible for a person to quit Seroquel and then lead a very normal life just like other persons. However, it would take<strong> a very strong determination </strong>and <strong>a great deal of emotional as well as counselling /communication support </strong>from the other people to achieve that goal.<br><br>For the sleeping issue, one would need to <strong>cut down the dosage of the Seroquel drug progressively over a reasonable stretch of time</strong>, such as starting from 200mg to 100 mg , and then 2-3 weeks later from 100 mg to 50 mg and finally to physically break up the tablet into separate parts to achieve a much lower dosage to finally reduce and then totally quit the intake of such medication for the particular person. However, since a progressively lower intake of Seroquel dosage would definitely cause difficulties of sleeping to the particular persons, he/she would then need to put in certain extra efforts on their own, such as doing some <strong>exercise </strong>a few hours ago to get oneself tired before sleeping, <strong>reading </strong>some really boring novels /<strong>watching some really boring TV programmes</strong> or even<strong> listening to some sentimental/ sleep-inducing musics </strong>before getting to sleep.<br><br>Next, since <strong>Seroquel </strong>is meant for the treatment of such sicknesses as <strong>bipolar disorders</strong>, <strong>Schizophrenia </strong>symptoms etc, it certainly has its own medicational values as an <strong>anti-psychotic drug</strong>. Hence, to effectively reduce and eventually quit the intake of Seroquel in order to enable a person to stop becoming irritable to it due it its addiction whilst at the same time to prevent the mental sicknesses mentioned above from getting worsened due to decreased intake or eventual quiting of such medication, one would need to <strong>reach out more to and have more communications and interactions with the other people</strong> around them, especially the close kin to seek more <strong>emotional support</strong>, <strong>increased fellowships </strong>and in some cases, get involved in more <strong>social/ religious gatherings </strong>/<strong>indoor/outdoor activities</strong>, engage oneself in a <strong>hobby/ meaningful activities </strong>for each one has deep interest in such as drawing, doing other sports etc, and <strong>obtain more conselling advices </strong>from the trained counsellors in order to improve the sanity /state of mental condition of the patient.<br><br>As far as my own experience is concerned a cheerful and <strong>contented attitude to life</strong> as well as a <strong>balanced approach of living a healthy life </strong>are conducive to <strong>developing a greater sanity and sounder state of mind </strong>for any patients troubled with any mental sickness. And I hope that my suggestions will be useful to you.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>

Well, regarding the <strong>acupuncture point </strong>I have mentioned in my article for the suggested cure for <strong>eyelid-twitching</strong>, its exact location is <strong>at the back of the palm of one's right hand</strong>, which is <strong>1.5 cm measured vertically from the point of intersection</strong> (that would appear visibly when the fingers are <strong>closed loosely  </strong>together) <strong>between the thumb and the forefinger</strong>. (Kindly take note that this point is located at a much '<strong>fleshy'</strong> instead of a much 'boney' area - perhaps you would need to briefly explore that part of your right hand at the same time to locate that point, and I hope you will understand that the hand structures of each person differ from one another).<br><br>When the acupuncture point is identified and marked accordingly, you can then re-open your hand , and then what you all can do is to sit down, and at the same time press that point  (using just mild force) with any long blunt-pointed object such as toothpick, a normal writing pen (which is<strong> out of ink </strong>of course) etc against your chin (suggested for convenience purpose) for a continuous 2 hours, and it's preferably to do that  when you are about to go to sleep at night (so that you have more free time to do it). However , if you are eager to find out the very exact location of that particular acupuncture point to further verify  the information given above, I would suggest you to seek consultancy from a licensed acupuncturist.<br><br>Please be reminded that a good sleep at night throughout the therapy period is essential for the healing to be effectively done. And a person shouldn't associate oneself  again with the underlying causes such as over-straining of the eyes, excessive cafeine intake, allergy/overdosage of certain medication (with muscle spasms side effects) that causes this eyelid-twitching to the particular person in the first place <strong>to avoid a relapse of that sickness</strong>, especially after getting cured from it.<br><br>Please refer to the weblink : http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/387431<br>for a pictorial illustration of that acupuncture point.

              <p> </p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>Note : The information given below is only meant as<strong> reference materials</strong> for the intended readers.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>In fact, my confidence in the effectiveness of the acupuncture technique that I recommend in this website is built upon the very fact of the final recovery (which can be observed within weeks &amp; a few months ) of dozens of such people in my real life over the past few years who have suffered persistently from such non-stop eye-blinking problems, especially the ones who get this sickness in the first place from the muscle spasms side effects of certain medication, long-term emotional traumas that affect their central nervous system etc, who in turn get almost an observable obvious immediate relief (within a few days time), of which I have witnessed these myself, from the acupuncture method I recommend personally to them.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>Actually these people shared almost the same painful experience as me from such debilitating sickness and for your information, there were many of them who were not so well-to-do, and hence they could not afford such expensive medical bills of seeing the medical specialists or to get Botox injections / surgical treatment to deal with their non-stop eye blinking problems. Therefore, when I recommended such an acupuncuture technique to them, I did it out of charity, sympathy and compassion, and thank God that it worked on each and everyone of them.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>Since I am not belonging to the medical field or an acupuncturist myself, I thus would not know whether such an acupuncture technique would actually work in the case of genetical eye blinking sickness, and honestly speaking, out of so many people to whom I have personally recommended that acupuncture treatment, I have not yet come across any of such cases before. Nevertheless, I am pretty sure that most of the people with non-stop eye blinking problems actually get this sickness from other post-birth causes rather than genetically, and I believe that once the acupuncture point is clearly identitified, the recommended technique would work effectively to provide reliefs to the ones suffer from post-birth causes-induced non-stop eye blinking sickness.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>I have actually posted some articles on my very own healing experience from such non-stop eye blinking sickness in <a href="http://www.valuemd.com/health-fitness/149667-risperdal-induced-non-stop-persistent-eyelid-twitching.html">http://www.valuemd.com/health-fitness/149667-risperdal-induced-non-stop-persistent-eyelid-twitching.html</a></p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>However, I still have to admit that although I have recently received some reply emails from the intended readers who say that this acupuncture technique actually works effectively on them to deal with their non-stop eye blinking problems, I would still strongly advise the ones interested in the acupuncture treatment to seek consultancy about its validity &amp; the very acupuncture treatment for this sickness from the licensed acupuncturist in view of the very fact that I could not personally point out to them the exact location of such acupuncture point.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>Another thing is that since the ones to whom I have personally recommended such acupuncture treatment for the treatment of non-stop eye blinking sickness are actually all grown adults, the "1.5 cm measure" mentioned in these articles mentioned above would thus definitely not be applicable to the young children whose hand structures are naturally very much smaller. Next, given that the skin textures of small children tend to be very much delicate and tender, and hence more fragile than that of the adults, they thus should definitely be attented to by the licensed acupuncturists to deal with their eye blinking problems in the case where they choose this choice of therapy.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>In addition, I would like to tell you very frankly that in the very first place when I was treated by my acupuncture physician to deal with my own non-stop eye blinking sickness, I was actually annoyed by such needle-based therapy and as a matter of fact, I really feel very uncomfortable with both the prospect and the very circumstance of getting my hand stuck with such acupuncture needles that are pierced right into the flesh through that acupuncture point for such acupuncture therapy. Furthermore, given the fact that his acupuncture practice is located distant away in the other state from the place I live, I thus have requested him to provide me with an alternative acupuncture method to deal with my eye blinking sickness. And as a matter of fact, that alternative acupuncture method which requires the use of blunt-pointed object rather than sharp-pointed acupuncture needle and involves pressing (using just mild force) onto the surface of the identified acupuncture point rather than piercing of acupuncture needle right into the flesh, did make me feel a lot more comfortable and mind-easing.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>Besides, given that I could administer this simple therapy on my own without having to travel all the way to look for the acupuncture physician to get follow-up treatment for my non-stop eye-blinking sickness, it thus tremendously affords me a great deal of flexibility as well as time-and- cost-saving conveniences in helping me to deal with this sickness and get it cured in the end (I personally have applied this therapy for about 2 months and stopped that until now once I get cured.). Thank you.</p>

              <div>[b]Traditional Acupressure Vs Acupuncture Cure Suggested Above[/b]</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Based on the acupuncturist who deal with my[b] chronic eyelid-twitching [/b] sickness, unlike the other traditional method of [b] acupressure [/b] which involves the use of [b] fingers [/b] to press and massage the [b]acupuncture point[/b], the use of [b]blunt-pointed object [/b]as instructed to me for the treatment of such chronic eyelid-twtiching is actually both intended as a [b] substitute [/b] for the acupuncture needle and meant as a [b]'leverage' [/b] to provide an adequately focused and hence a [b]'reflexology stimulus' [/b] that is strong enough to deal more precisely and effectively with that acupuncture point as mentioned above.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Whereas, if that acupuncture point is to be treated with fingers, the stimulus effect generated would be very much smaller due to the fact that such pressings and massagings would reasonably not last long enough to provide any reliefs for the chronic eyelid-twitching. Besides, given the larger suface area of the fingers as well as their rounded physical shape (compared to the blunt-pointed objects), a large part of the forces produced from such pressings and massagings would then be reasonably applied onto the related [b]muscles [/b] rather than directly onto the intended [b] nerves [/b] through the related acupuncture point to deal effectively with such sickness.</div>

              <p>Summary :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tardive Dyskinesia actually falls under the EPS (extrapyramidal symptoms) syndrome which may well include dystonia, parkinsonism  etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such EPS syndrome (especially physical movement disorders, including Hemifacial Spasms triggered by bodily chemical imbalances) in turn is caused by disturbances to the dopamine receptors (one of the main neurotransmitters) of the nervous system which is normally induced  by most of the AAP's (atypical antipsychotics).</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>In fact most of the neurology-related disorders nowadays are closely connected to the side effects of modern medications especially the <strong>Atypical Antipsychotics</strong> that carry the side effects of <strong> <span style="color: #0000cc;"><a href="http://www.hubin.org/publicfamilyinfo/treatment/side_effects/side_effects_6_en.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extrapyramidal Symptoms </span></a> </span> </strong>(<strong>EPS</strong>), <a href="http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/common/standard/transform.jsp?requestURI=/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/tardive_dyskinesia.jsp"><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tardive Dyskinesia</strong></span></span></a><strong> </strong>(<strong>TD</strong>) etc that would potentially and eventually disturb the normal functioning of the <strong>dopamine receptors</strong> (one of the main <strong>neurotransmitters </strong>/ <strong>key elements of neurons</strong> in our <strong>nervous system</strong> essential for the<strong> control of human body motions</strong>) such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">blocking</span> them etc (in carrying out their medical mechanisms to cure certain other sicknesses and unfortunately is also one of the unavoidable side effects of such medications). Next, such a situation would then lead to <strong>bodily chemical imbalances</strong> and then <strong>potential interruptions to the "message sending, conveying and relaying" neuron operations</strong> between the <span style="font-weight: bold;">human brain</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">any parts of the human body</span> that would in turn trigger off <strong>a variety of largely uncontrollable involuntary and purposeless movement disorders on any parts of our body</strong> that are substantially beyond control of the ones suffering from them. <br><br></div>

              <div> </div>
              <p> </p>
              <div>Next, no matter how sophisticated the modern drugs are being invented and developed, especially the second-generation antipsychotics, such a potential side effect remains inherent in such medications that carry the side effects of antagonizing the dopamine receptors. Even though the possibility of manifestation of such neuromuscular symptoms may be very small or even negligible as proven by the established scientific research, other experimental and clinical verifications, it would still depend on such other factors as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">different physical conditions</span> of the users of such drugs, other <span style="font-weight: bold;">unexpected possible allergy cases</span> etc. <br><br><br><br><br><br>All in all, it would be the amount of <span style="font-weight: bold;">medical attention and professional care of the medical personnel</span> dealing with the specific cases of their patients and dispensing the drugs with such dopamine-disturbing side effects that would be primarily essential to ensure the non-occurrence of such disorders or minimize the risk of getting such disastrous and undesired neuromuscular side effects. </div>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A New Version For The Self-administered Acupuncture Cure For Non-stop Persistent Eyelid-twitching</span></span><br><br><br><br>Thanks for taking an interest in my posts made in this website. At the same time, I also have received lots of positive feedbacks from my email inbox from other persons (troubled by such annoying non-stop eyelid twitching sickness) giving thanks to me for the curative benefits they experience upon exercising the suggested alternative instrument-aided self-administered acupuncture method. <br><br><br><br>In response to the additional enquiries about the suggested self-administered acupuncture method that these persons have made to me so far through the emails, I thus would like to provide to the intended readers a new version about this acupuncture therapy which contains other extra and more in-depth details as follows : -<br><br><br><br>Well, regarding the 'He Gu' acupuncture point I have mentioned in my prior articles for the suggested cure for non-stop eyelid-twitching, its exact location is <span style="font-weight: bold;">at the back of the palm of one's right hand</span>, which is <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.5 cm (applicable to the average grown adults only) measured vertically from the point of intersection</span> (that would appear visibly when the fingers are <span style="font-weight: bold;">closed loosely </span>together) <span style="font-weight: bold;">between the thumb and the forefinger</span>. (Kindly take note that this point is located at a much <span style="font-weight: bold;">'fleshy'</span> instead of a much 'boney' area - perhaps you would need to briefly explore that part of your right hand at the same time to locate that point, and I hope you will understand that the hand structures of each person differ from one another). <br><br><br><br>When the acupuncture point is identified and marked accordingly, you can then re-open your hand , and then what you all can do is to sit down, and at the same time press onto the surface of that acupuncture point (<span style="font-weight: bold;">using just mild force</span>) with any long <span style="font-weight: bold;">blunt-pointed object </span>such as toothpick, a normal writing pen (which is <span style="font-weight: bold;">out of ink</span> of course) etc against your chin (suggested for convenience purpose) for a continuous 2 hours (during any time in a day), and it's preferably to do that when you are about to go to sleep at night (so that you have more free time to do it). However , if you are eager to find out the very exact location of that particular acupuncture point to further verify the information given above, I would suggest you to seek consultancy from a licensed acupuncturist. <br><br><br><br>In this regard, based on the acupuncturist, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">blunt-pointed objects </span>such as normal writing pen (which is <span style="font-weight: bold;">out-of-ink </span>of course) etc instructed to me for such self-administred therapy is actually intended as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">substitute </span>for the acupuncture needle to deal effectively with the particular acupuncture point. <br><br><br><br>Unlike the other method of <span style="font-weight: bold;">acupressure </span>which involves the use of fingers to press and massage the acupuncture points, the use of blunt-pointed object in such a case for the treatment of chronic eyelid-twtiching is actually meant as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">'leverage' </span>to provide an adequately focused and hence a 'reflexology stimulus' that is strong enough to deal more precisely and effectively with that acupuncture point. <br><br><br><br>Whereas, if that acupuncture point is to be treated with fingers, the stimulus effect generated would be very much smaller due to the facts that such pressings and massagings would reasonably not last long enough to provide any reliefs for the chronic eyelid-twitching. Besides, given the larger suface area of the fingers as well as their rounded physical shape (compared to the blunt-pointed objects), a large part of the forces produced from such pressings and massagings would then be reasonably applied onto the related <span style="font-weight: bold;">muscles </span>rather than directly onto the intended <span style="font-weight: bold;">nerves </span>through the related acupuncture point to deal effectively with such sickness. <br><br><br><br>Please be reminded that a good sleep at night throughout the therapy period is essential for the healing to be effectively done. And a person shouldn't associate oneself again with the underlying causes such as over-straining of the eyes, excessive cafeine intake, allergy/overdosage of certain medication (with muscle spasms side effects) that causes this eyelid-twitching to the particular person in the first place to<span style="font-weight: bold;"> avoid a relapse of that sickness</span>, especially after getting cured from it. <br><br><br><br>Please take note that one should continually apply that method in the case where it proves to be effective in dealing with the eyelid twitching problem (after trying it for about 3 days' time). <br><br><br><br>For your reference, I get my eyelid twitching stopped the next day after the acupuncture treatment. But when I stop the treatment for the next few days, the twitchings just come back again. Based on the acupuncturist, the explanation for the relapse is such that if one were to apply just one-off / short-term treatment, it would then only serve to <span style="font-weight: bold;">disperse</span> the dopamine-disturbing toxin / other 'contaminating agents' around one's eye nerves enabling the twitching to stop just temporarily (without totally purging such toxins / 'contaminating agents' out of the human body). So, it works just like doing a physiotherapy whereby one should complete the whole course of treatment (in this case, applying that self-administered technique persistently for weeks/ a few months) to get the eyelid-twitching sickness totally cured effectively <span style="font-weight: bold;">once and for all</span> in the end. <br><br><br><br>Next, the suggested duration of two-hour period/day (continuous non-stop healing process) for that self-administered treatment is just what I have recommended so far to other persons having the similar symptoms based on my very own healing experience from this eyelid-twitching sickness and the others who suffer from it (who eventually get it totally cured). All in all, it would acutally depend on one's healing progress for the eyelid twitching sickness upon applying that suggested self-administered acupuncture method. <br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Related References :</span></span></p>
