              <div>First of all, thank you for all the generous supports given so far to all the posts made in this website. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Acupuncture has been well-known throughout the generations to be especially effective in treating a variety of sicknesses, particularly the ones caused by <strong>bodily chemical imbalances</strong> (especially the ones caused by <strong>disruptions to the neurotransmitter chemicals</strong>) knowingly through stimulation of release of <strong>endorphin</strong> (<strong>a neurochemical occurring naturally in the brain and having analgesic</strong>) in the process of administering such a therapy to restore the <strong>'ying yang'</strong> / <strong>bodily chemical balances</strong> of the <strong>nervous system</strong>. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Actually by making those posts in this website, I'm just trying to tell something about my healing experience from the (<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.drugs.com/risperdal.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Risperdal</strong></span></a></span>) / <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/common/standard/transform.jsp?requestURI=/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/tardive_dyskinesia.jsp"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></strong></a> </span> / <span style="font-weight: bold;">medication-induced non-stop rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold;">countless times in a split second and it eventually causes me to lose my job</span>) to the intended readers who are still suffering from such 'visually-incapacitating' sickness, especially as a result of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">neurological movement disorders muscle spasms side effects of medications</span>. <br><br><br>By the way, as to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">suggested alternative instrument-aided self-administered acupuncture cure</span> mentioned in one of the posts above (which is naturally <span style="font-weight: bold;">free-of-charge</span>) especially for such chronic medication-induced rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking, it is exactly the technique that the relevant acupuncturist attending to my eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking sickness has instructed to me (<span style="font-weight: bold;">because I feel annoyed with such needle-piercing therapy</span>) and exercising that technique consistently actually get my sickness gradually and totally cured in the end. <br><br><br>Next, I have spent quite a couple of years (ever since I get totally cured a few years back) recommending this suggested self-administered acupuncture technique both in my real life and through emails (from those seeking helps from me) to the numerous other individuals suffering from the similar chronic rapid eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking sickness like what I have gone through before, and apart from the ones that I have witnessed in person, most of them (including the ones seeking helps from me through emails) in turn would tend to give almost immediate positive feedbacks about the effectiveness of this acupuncture techinque in dealing with their like-sickness. In this regard, a majority of them have actually got their like-sickness totally cured once and for all. <br><br><br>In connection, the post entitled <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Primary Vs Secondary Blepharospasm / Brain-damage-induced Vs Non-brain-damage-induced Eyelid-twitching / Eye-blinking'</span> is actually something about my recent research about this Blepharospasm sickness and I hope that by contributing this article to the others, it will somehow help the intended readers to get at least some general ideas and basic understandings about neurology studies, mechanisms and operations. <br><br><br>Lastly, for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">further follow-up about my healing experience</span> from such Tardive Dyskinesia / medication-induced involuntary uncontrollable purposeless rapid non-stop eyelid-twitching / eye-blinking sickness, please refer to the weblink below : <br><br></div>

              <div><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Additional Information About Antipsychotics / Neuroleptics (Please Refer to The Prior Post Entitled '</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>My Subsequent Experience With Seroquel Drug')<br></strong></span> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In addition, clinical evidences also indicate that those troubled with mental disorders, especially the serious ones, shouldn't just rely solely upon the medications as the one and only means of solution to their mental problems.</div>
              <div><br> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>To put it bluntly, such medications, they are no different from sleeping pills whereby their calming effects just 'come and go' after the lapse of their effective period whilst their potential disastrous side effects can be permanent upon manifestations. In medical sense, such mental disorders, especially the serious ones are mainly caused by the malfunctionings of the mood regulator neurotransmitter, especially Serotonin in the brain. Next, though the related medications can to a certain extent bring such a severe mental disorder under control by 'artificially' regulating, blocking and controlling the re-uptake of it in the brain of the persons suffering from it, medications alone however, by no means would be able to deal conclusively with the problems due to the fact that the root causes of such a disorder is actually resulting largely from the environmental, circumstantial and other interpersonal factors (or the changes of them) that are deemed to be emotionally and adversely unacceptable to the ones suffering from it to a very great extent. Such negative changes in turn actually account for the negative behavioural changes in them as described</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In short, it remains the truth that most of the antipsychotics / neuroleptics meant for especially the treatment of chronic mental illnesses would tend to work in such a way that they would need to change / alter the chemical balances in the brain of those taking such medications in the process of bringing such disorders under control. In the process of doing so, such a mechanism would unavoidably and eventually antagonize the neurotransmitters of the nervous system, especially the serotonin and dopamine (which is necessary for various neuromuscular functions), and hence disturb and interfere with the normal functionings of the nerves of the human body.</div>
              <div><br> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Next, though it may take years for such undesirable side effects / scenario to manifest onto the ones taking such medications, I am just in the opinion that in the case of the medications having potentially such unwanted side effects, it would naturally be the duty of the medical personnel / specialists-in-charge to take all the precautionary measures to safeguard the well-being of the patients for the sake of their healthcare and welfare.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The real-life examples that I have come across so far is such that for the ones relying merely upon medications and nothing else to deal with their mental disorders, they would tend to develop both emotional and psychological dependences upon such medictions over the long-term whilst getting their mental conditions deteriorated from time to time, eg, from neurosis to psychosis and then just acquire all those almost irreversibly disastrous undesirable side effects like Extrapyramidal Symptoms, Tardive Dyskinesia, Dystonia, Akathisia, Parkinsonism disorders etc from such medications in the end.</div>
              <div><br> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In such a connection, psychotherapy, emotional and other communication supports would be needed to complement the use of the related medications to achieve greater curative effects for such patients troubled by chronic mental disorder.</div>
              <div><br> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>As such, medications is one thing, but the mental / cognitive abilities of the patients themselves to eventually change their views and perceptions about their environments / surroundings, circumstances and people they are facing in a more positve way, particularly developed through the help of such counselling supports from the others in order for them to really get better and gradually develop positive behavioural / personal changes, is simply another thing that cannot achieved solely with the help of medications alone.</div>
              <div><br> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In a nutshell, medications alone by no means can be a substitute for the positive interpersonal experiences that such patients would eventually need for genuine improvement and recovery of their sanity and the use of them should at the same time be complemented by other psychotherapy efforts to achieve the purpose of holistic healing.</div>
              <div><br> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Lastly, I hope that the information given above will turn out to be useful to its intended readers. Thank you.</div>

              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">General Cognitive Behavioural Process</span></span> <br><br><br><br><br>Well, a psychologist has actually explained to me before that any human actions / behaviours are generally dictated by a cognitive mental process summarized such as follows, and it would apply as well to the ones suffering from any mental disorders, but nevertheless are still mentally and cognitively well-aware of their surroundings and other objects / factors around them. Next, I find that such reasonings really make great senses, and hence, I just feel like to share it with the intended readers :- <br><br></span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">
              </span></p><p><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Perceptions</span> (anything we see, we hear, we know, we taste, we touch etc from our surroundings / other people) =&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feelings</span> (the way we feel about our surroundings and other people based on anything we see, hear, know, taste, touch etc) =&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thoughts</span> (the types of views and opinions that we form in our minds based on the types of feelings we have for anything we perceive) =&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Actions</span> (how we choose to react in response to those surroundings / other people based on the feelings and thoughts that arise in our minds). <br><br><br></p>
              <p>In such a regard, the underlying problem faced by the ones with schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and other mental disorders are such that they would tend to treat their perceptions (as mentioned above) in a very much negatively different way, and that in turn results in them forming all those negative feelings, thoughts and then all those negative actions of which others get to label them as <span style="font-weight: bold;">negative behavioural / personality changes</span>. <br><br><br></p>
              <p>For example, a person suffering from schizophrenia may, after 'observing' his surroundings, (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Perceptions</span>), just in turn, for certain reasons like past traumatic experiences, anxiety disorders, panic attacks etc, would tend to spontaneously and directly feel very much uncomfortable, anxious, scared and fearful for what they get to see, hear, know, touch etc (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Feelings</span>) , and in extreme cases, maybe they may get to hear 'voices' and feel very much threatened by their surroundings then have such false and unreal imaginations of which they subconsciously choose to firmly believe in that someone out there is 'really' / 'actually' threatening his life (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thoughts</span> or in this case, purely false hallucinations), and finally just try his very best based on his own misguided judgements, to subconsciously become violently defensive and hostile against the others in order to save himself, from being killed etc (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Actions</span>). <br><br><br></p>
              <p>Similarly, such an explanation to a certain extent would apply as well to the ones having such disorders like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Claustrophobia (a morbid fear of being closed in a confined space) etc whereby a given surrounding, which may appear normal to other people, would nevertheless and otherwise appear to be abnormally unacceptable to them possibly because of past traumatic experiences, anxiety disorders, panic attacks and other reasons. Next, the feelings and thoughts that such people would have based what they perceive for the given surrounding in turn would be largely uncontrollable, if not subconciously involuntary, while their subsequent responses/ reactions / actions based on their such negative feelings and thoughts, would in turn be very much the so-called reflex reactions which are substantially and in most cases, totally beyond their self-control. <br><br><br></p>
              <p>In this regard, it would be very much helpful for the ones dealing with such persons to understand their basic underlying problems and difficulties and in turn treat them considerately and thoughtfully with care, respects and most importantly, compassion, whilst at the same time, also try to be friendly and amicable to them in such as a way that rather than feeling uncomfortable with a given surrounding and becoming agitated, these persons would on the other hand, feel more mind-easing, emotionally calm, placated, pacified, soothed, comfortable and relaxing with that given 'uneasy' / 'uncomfortable' / 'threatening' surroundings that they perceive. Subsequently, all these efforts will definitely be tremendously conducive to the improvements of the conditions of their disorders and possibly the final recovery in the end. <br><br><br></p>
              <p>With all due respect, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">antipsychotics</span> and other <span style="font-weight: bold;">neuroleptics</span> just serve to <span style="font-weight: bold;">temporarily block such negative nerve impulses</span> about their such <span style="font-weight: bold;">negative perceptions</span> from getting sent to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">brain</span> of the ones having such disorders so as to <span style="font-weight: bold;">artificially block all those negative feelings, thoughts, and then the actions</span>. Hence, they are simply <span style="font-weight: bold;">not a conclusive and permanent solution</span> to such disorders. <br><br><br></p>
              <p>Well, in such a context, the most direct way of treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the most effective, and maybe largely hypothetical way would be for such persons to totally change their perceptions about their surroundings, environments, the other people in a positive way and to start having positive and realistic thoughts and at the same time, to get rid of those hallucinations, fanciful ideas, little by little gradually and slowly out of their mind and replace them with anything normal, practical, realistic and positive. Theorectically, <span style="font-weight: bold;">positive perceptions</span> =&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">positive feelings</span> =&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">positive thoughts</span> =&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">positive actions</span>. <br><br><br></p>
              <p>In this sense, a great deal of <span style="font-weight: bold;">interpersonal, interactive, communications and emotional supports</span> from the ones genuinely willing to help them would be very much essential in getting this achieved, essentially in changing the ways they perceive, feel and think for anything they deal with so as to enable them to come to a decision on their own to have positive actions. <br><br><br></p>
              <p>Nonetheless, above all these external constructive helps from the others, all the <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-initiatives</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-controls</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-disciplines</span> that are meant to be exercised, essentially on the parts of the ones suffering from such a disorder, particularly to 'mentally-train' themselves to think <span style="font-weight: bold;">realistically</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">positively</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">optimistically</span> and to cast out / expel all those weird thoughts, hallucinations, fanciful imaginations and preposterous urges and whims little by little out of their minds and get them replaced with the positive, practical and realistic ones, so as to slowly develop <span style="font-weight: bold;">positive behavioural changes</span> in themselves, would in turn actually be the decisive factor in determining whether their conditions will pracitcally improve or not, slowly and gradually in the end.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As a summary,  <br> <br> <br> <br>I'm suggesting the following as a solution to <strong>mental disorders</strong> : <br> <br> <br> <br>1/3 of <strong>medicational helps</strong> + 1/3 of <strong>psychotherapies, interactive, interpersonal, emotional, communication, conselling supports from the others</strong> + 1/3 of <strong>self-determinations, self-initiatives, self-controls, self-wills and self-disciplines to think positively, rationally, realistically and practically as well as to lead a normal and healthy life</strong><br><strong></strong> <br><strong></strong> <br><strong></strong> <br>These are actually the advices I have obtained from many neurologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists and psychologists as well as the very conclusions I have experienced myself. <br> <br> <br> <br>Lastly, I hope that the information given will be relevant and useful to the intended readers.

Whilst the same approaches would be effective for the other mental disorders too, such as the ones mentioned above. <br><br><br><br>So, the ways of overcoming these hallucinations / delusions, other mental disorders etc, on one point, would be to use certain related medications to temporarily bring such a condition under control (<span style="font-weight: bold;">temporarily</span> in the sense that medications have their <span style="font-weight: bold;">limitations</span> especially in terms of their <span style="font-weight: bold;">effective curative period</span>, whilst at the same time, such a <span style="font-weight: bold;">'temporary healing'</span> is actually achieved through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">artificial suppressing of negative nerve impulses to block all such negative feelings, thoughts - in this case, mainly the hallucinations</span>, and finally the actions which arise from negative perceptions). <br><br><br><br>On the other hand, one's <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-initiatives</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-efforts</span> to exercise <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-controls</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-disciplines</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-rationalisings</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-reasonings</span> etc to overcome all those delusions and hallucinations would be of <span style="font-weight: bold;">utmost essential</span> in helping oneself to cope with such mental disorders. <br><br><br><br>This is to say, in order to overcome all those delusions, hallucinations etc, one would need to exercise all those self-initiatives, self-controls etc to exercise self-reasonings and self-rationalisings, so as to enable oneself to gradually and slowly <span style="font-weight: bold;">think positively, rationally, realistically, reasonably, practically and sensibly</span>, as well as, at the same time, to <span style="font-weight: bold;">replace all those delusional, hallucinational thoughts, wild imaginations etc, bit by bit, with rational and reasonable thoughts and senses</span>, just like the what the normal healthy people do. <br><br><br><br>In the meantime, one would reasonably require certain <span style="font-weight: bold;">psychotherapy</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">emotional</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">interactive</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">interpersonal</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">communication supports</span> in getting such goals achieved. In this regard, such other activities as doing sports, playing indoor games (such as chess, card games etc), engagings in one's favourite hobbies, watching comedies, reading something interesting, positively inspiring etc, would all be useful in both distracting one's mind from having delusions, hallucinations etc, whilst at the same time, <span style="font-weight: bold;">subconsciously instilling into their minds all those optimistic and positive thoughts</span> that one would need to deal with such disorders. <br><br><br><br>In short, having hallucinations, which to a certain extent might be associated with certain mental disorders, as well as the mental disorders themselves, well, they may be painful experiences to most people, however, it would take just the <span style="font-weight: bold;">right treatments</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">other related remedial factors</span> to achieve <span style="font-weight: bold;">holistic healings</span> for such disorders of hallucinations / delusions, other mental disorders etc.</span></p></div>

In such connection, as to the cognitive / thinking abilities / processes of different individuals, one of the simplest examples will be the process of learning a knowledge or something else whereby a person can get the best text materials, teachers, lecturers, tutors etc to assist one in his / her learnings, however, it would still ultimately depend on the very cognitive ability / process pertaining to that particular person which is then the key decisive factor in determining whether the knowledge is successfully acquired in the end or not. <br><br><br><br>In short, those <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-efforts</span> (related to <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-cognitions</span>), in the very end, will eventually be very much essential, or rather the <span style="font-weight: bold;">decisive factor in determining whether the persons having mental disorders will achieve improvements / recoveries for their mental conditions</span> or not.</span></p></div>

              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">Generally, mental disorders / mental illnesses can be summarized into the two broad categories of neurosis and psychosis as explained below : -</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">-  In the case of <strong>mental disorders</strong> / <strong>mental illnesses</strong> which <strong>mildly</strong> <strong>disturb</strong> the normal functionings of one's cognitive / thinking abilities, functions and processes (of the brains), this would give rise to <strong>behavioural problems</strong> (that affects only part of the personality), which are quite uncontrollable and involuntary. Next, such scenarios are generally labelled as <strong> </strong></span><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/neurosis"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">neuroses</span></strong></span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">. Its common examples would be <strong>depression</strong>, <strong>panic</strong>, <strong>anxiety</strong>, <strong>insecurity</strong>, <strong>irrational fears</strong>, <strong>obsessive- compulsive Disorders</strong> (<strong>OCD</strong>) etc. In this regard, such <strong>antidepressants</strong> like <strong>Prozac</strong> etc are actually meant for such mental disorders / mental illnesses.  As such, please refer to the website below for further details : </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></div>
              <div><a href="http://www.drugs.com/mtm/prozac.html"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.drugs.com/mtm/prozac.html</span></strong></span></span></a></div>

              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">-  In the very much serious cases of mental disorders / mental illnesses whereby one's cognitive / thinking abilities,  functions and processes (of the brains) are <strong>severely disturbed and impaired</strong>, this would then cause the much more serious <strong>personality disorders</strong> which may involve such <strong>mentally dissociative states</strong> of <strong>delusions</strong>, <strong>hallucinations </strong>and in the worst case scenario, <strong>insanities</strong>. The most common examples would be <strong>scizophrenia</strong>,<strong>schizoaffective disorder</strong>,<strong> schizophreniform disorder</strong>, <strong>bipolar disorder</strong>,  <strong>paranoia</strong> etc - which are generally labelled as<strong> </strong></span><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/psychosis"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>psychosis</strong></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong> </strong></span>.  In such a connection, such <strong>powerful tranquilizers</strong> as the <strong>antipsychotics</strong> / <strong>neuroleptics</strong> etc will usually be needed to deal with such much more serious mental disorders / mental illnesses.  As such, please refer to the website below for further details : </span></div>
