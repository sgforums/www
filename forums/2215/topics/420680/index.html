              <p>Hi Users,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm a 18 year old male currently in ITE 2nd year and i've been putting on glasses for eternity; 6-18 year old. I look good without the spectacle on which led me to discover more on how about can i cure Myopia. My degree for my left eye checked is 100 Degree while my right eye is 200 degree. Is the degree still under the least damaged or have gradually climbed to medium/High probability for vision loss and possible glaucauma or retina detachment diseas in the long term especially after 20 years old. I'm feeling eerie for the time being because i don't wish to put on glasses for the rest of my life. I don't want to be blind in the mere future. Is there any cure for myopia through eye exercises? i've surfed the net and most cures require you to buy a book which seems ostensible. Any possible cure would be either LASIK or Contact lenses but i don't want both of them, i want my god given eyesight to be able to recover from this ailing myopia which i'm facing in my life. My self-esteem was affected because some classified me as 'nerds' because of my outstanding grades in school. My parents told me that to recover one's vision to 20/20 is to stop wearing glasses and be blind to everywhere you go? is that true? I tried the 'Palming' method but i'm not sure if i do it properly.</p>
              <p>Please help me with this, this is probably the biggest hurdle of my life knowing the fact the eye is the great of all organ even though it is timid and hidden.</p>
              <p>I wish to recover from Myopia completely.. is there by any chance can i get regain my vision :'(....</p>

              <p>Dear Zen.Hacker,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quote you "<em>... or have gradually climbed to medium/High probability for vision loss and possible glaucauma or retina detachment diseas in the long term...</em>"</p>
              <p>From your statement, I can tell that you are very concerned about the topic on myopia, the above quoted statement is often used in prognostics pertaining to ophthalomology... You may have visited some websites/forums discussing medical issues..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Currently (22 years old), I am wearing spectacles to correct my eyesight. I stopped wearing spectacles for four to six months and my optician noted drastical reduction of my eye degree.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I was young like a teenage, I used to visit the optician once a year to make new spectacles. Becuase teenages are still under development, the eye sight degree may climb very rapidly at that age. As you grow old, there will not be so much major changes to the degree and will be stablized...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many reports on curing myopia by doing eye exercise... I wouldn't post journals for you, but will show you this <a href="http://cureyoureyes.com/blog/">website</a>.. You can google the topic, and try to see the trend. Some argue you can't improve eyesight by doing exercise, while other believes eye sight problem can be improve...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no way, by natural means, you can recover your eyesight to 20/20. Fortunately, you can improve your eyesight close to perfect... Your parents suggested not wearing spectacles... this may be a common folktale, but it hold some truths..</p>
              <p>By not wearing your spectacles, you are actually allowing your eyes to be in the relax state (that's why you get blur vision). You will be tempted to strain your eyes &gt;.&lt;", which actually does the opposite of relaxing. I am not recommending you to stop wearing spectacle as it may posses dangers in real-life situation (look out for vehicles!), and may affect you academically if you couldn't see the words on the board.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LASIK, Contact Lens, Spectacles are not CURE for eye sight problems. There are temporarily eye sight "corrections" methods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The best way to improve your eye sight is by natural means. Exercising, reducing salt intake, practice good eye care habits (you should know this... HPB is promoting every year), and through diet control. Try to allow your eyes to be in the relax state and don't strain your eyes, take good care of it...</strong></p>
              <p>You are 18 this year... if a few years time, you eye sight will be stablizing.. What you can do right now is to follow the above advice. When you are still young, you still have hope.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding about recovering from myopia completely... I am afriad we still do not have the medical advancement yet. I believe clinical scientists [in US] are already in testing ways of recovering myopia/hyperopia completely using natural means, but it will still take many years before the new non-invasive technique is widely adopted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your case is not serious enough to discuss glaucauma or retina detachment, these are real medical problems that is associated with older age, accidents, genetics, ...</p>

              <p><strong>New clinical trials for high myopia</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Eye Research Institute will conduct a 
              new clinical trial in collaboration with Bayer HealthCare and Regeneron 
              Pharmaceuticals to tackle the problem of high myopia.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Singapore is known to be the myopia capital of the world with 40 per cent of adults suffering from the eye condition. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Of these, nearly 10 
              per cent have high myopia. Some of them may develop myopic CNV which is a
               potentially blinding condition where abnormal blood vessels grow and 
              leak blood and fluid into the retina.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Three out of four 
              patients picked for the trial will receive regular injections of a 
              compound known as VEGF Trap-Eye. The compound inhibits the growth of 
              abnormal blood vessels in the eye.<br><br>The procedure aims to best correct the patient's eyesight in 24 weeks.<br><br>The rest of the patients will be in the control group.<br><br>Researchers
               will investigate the safety and effectiveness of the compound for 
              two-and-a-half years. Close to 300 patients will take part in the trial.<br><br>With
               up to 10 per cent of teenagers in Singapore suffering from high myopia 
              or myopic CNV, researchers said the trial called the MYRROR study is 
              important.<br><br>Professor Wong Tien Yin, director, Singapore Eye 
              Research Institute, said: "The MYRROR study for the first time will look
               at how effective is a drug that has now been shown to be fairly 
              successful in treating wet age-related macular degeneration that occurs 
              in older age group of people. <br><br>"And now we are going to look at 
              how this drug will ... (work on) younger people with high myopia and 
              developing a condition called myopic CNV."<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>
