            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: blue;">Achilles Tendonitis</span></span><br><br>Achilles tendonitis is the bane of many runners. You should not allow this to turn into a chronic and troubling malady leading to moans about how it will never end, contributing to roadsides strewn with air cushioned clad runners all with ice packs attached to their heels. First, we will review some basic information about the achilles tendon.<br><br>The achilles tendon is the connection between the heel and the most powerful muscle group in the body. This has long been known as a site prone to disabling injury. It is named after Achilles, who according to myth was protected from wounds by being dipped in a magical pond by his mother. She held him by the heel, which was not immersed, and later died by an arrow wound in his heel. Although obviously, injuries to this area must have been known for more than 2,000 years, it was first reported in the medical literature by Ambroise Par?only 400 years ago.<br><br>The achilles tendon joins three muscles: the two heads of the gastrocnemius and the soleus. The gastrocnemius heads arise from the posterior portions of the femoral condyles. The soleus arises from the posterior aspect of the tibia and fibula.<br><br>The gastrocnemius is a muscle that crosses three joints: the knee, the ankle, and the subtalar joint. The functioning of these joints and influence of other muscles on these joints has a significant effect on the tension that occurs within the achilles tendon. As an example tight hamstrings impact the functioning of the ankle joint, the subtalar joint, and increase tension in the achilles tendon. The soleus does not cross the knee and is a biarticualar muscle.<br><br>The plantaris is a nearby muscle that has its separate tendon. It arises from the lateral condyle of the femur. It has a thin tendon that passes between the gastrocnemius and soleus and inserts into the calcaneus. When this musclculotendinous structure is injured it is frequently felt as a "pellet shot" in the back of the leg. The tear is usually about eight inches below the knee joint.<br><br>The bulk of the achilles tendon inserts into the posterior superior third of the calcaneus. Some fibers course distally and continue to where portions of the plantar fascia insert into the plantar aspect of the calcaneus.<br><br>The achilles tendon does not have a rich blood supply. It is not invested within a true tendon sheath. A paratenon composed of other soft tissue surround it. The outer layer is a portion of the deep fascia, the middle layer is called the mesotenon and the inner layer is a thin layer. The blood supply to the proximal portion of the tendon comes from the branches of the muscles themselves. The distal portion is supplied by branches from the tendon-bone interface. The mesotenon supplies the major blood supply to the Achilles tendon.<br><br><strong>Contributing Factors</strong><br><br>There are several factors that can contribute to achilles tendonitis. First, you should know that the biggest contributor to chronic achilles tendonitis is ignoring pain in your achillles tendon and runing through the pain of early achilles tendonitis. If your achilles tendon is getting sore it is time to pay attention to it, immediately.<br><br>Sudden increases in training can contribute to achilles tendonitis. Excessive hill running or a sudden addition of hills and speedwork can also contribute to this problem. Two sole construction flaws can also aggravate achilles tendonitis. The first is a sole that is too stiff, especially at the ball of the foot. (In case you are having difficulty locating the "ball" of your foot, I mean the part where the toes join the foot and at which the foot bends) If this area is stiff than the "lever arm" of the foot is longer and the achilles tendon will be under increased tension and the calf muscles must work harder to lift the heel off the ground.<br><br>The second contributing shoe design factor which may lead to continuuing achilles tendon problem is excessive heel cushioning. Air filled heels, while supposedly are now more resistant to deformation and leaks are not good for a sore achilles tendon. The reason for this is quite simple. If you are wearing a shoe that is designed to give great heel shock absorption what frequently happens is that after heel contact, the heel continues to sink lower while the shoe is absorbing the shock. This further stretches the achilles tendon, at a time when the leg and body are moving forward over the foot. Change your shoes to one without this "feature".<br><br>Of course another major factor is excessive tightness of the posterior leg muscles, the calf muscles and the hamstrings may contribute to prolonged achilles tendonitis. Gentle calf stretching should be performed preventatively. During a bout of acute achilles tendonitis, however, overly exuberant stretching should not be performed.<br><br><strong>Treatment</strong><br><br>The first thing to do is to cut back your training. If you are working out twice a day, change to once a day and take one or two days off per week. If you are working out every day cut back to every other day and decrease your mileage.  Training modification is essential to treatment of this potentially long lasting problem. You should also cut back on hill work and speed work. Post running ice may also help. Be sure to avoid excessive stretching. The first phase of healing should be accompanied by relative rest, which doesn't necessarily mean stopping running, but as I am emphasizing, a cut back in training. If this does not help quickly, consider the use of a 1/4 inch heel lift can also help. Do not start worrying if you will become dependent on this, concentrate on getting rid of the pain. Don't walk barefoot around your house, avoid excessively flat shoes, such as "sneakers", tennis shoes, cross trainers, etc.<br><br>In office treatment would initially consist of the use of the physical therapy modalities of electrical stimulation, (HVGS, high voltage galvanic stimulation), and ultrasound. Your sports medicine physician should also carefully check your shoes. A heel lift can also be used and control of excessive pronation by taping can also be incorporated into a program of achilles tendonitis rehabilitation therapy. Orthotics with a small heel lift are often helpful.<br><br><strong>Exercises to Avoid</strong><br><br>Excessive stretching is not good for your achilles tendon. The stretch that I most often recommend is the "wall stretch". I do not recommend the "stair stretch", the "incline stretch", or the "put a towel around your feet and pull up until it hurts stretch". If any of these are working for you, that's great, you don't need any advice. In most cases, for the patients I see, these stretches put too much tension on the already tender achilles tendon. Contracting the muscle when it is in a stretched position, as initial therapy of an injured achilles tendon is not a good thing.<br><br></div>
