              <p>Use natural food to heal chronic,  terminal and autoimmune diseases without any adverse side effects.  By eating the food our body needs can boost our immunity system and allow it to fight the bacteria, viruses or reverse the health diseases. 
                                                          
                                           I use appropriate food to combat obesity, arthritis, pigmentation, joint pain without the toxic medicines which have multiple side effects that can harm the immunity system and the vital organs.  It is feasible.</p>
              <p>1. Urinary Tract Infection : Unsweetened Cranberries</p>
              <p>2. Acid Reflux,  constipation: Banana.  Make sure it is not ripened using calcium         carbide.  Dots instead of black patches should appear as it ripened.</p>
              <p>3. Inflammation and dizziness : ginger</p>
              <p>4. Insomnia : tart cherries and pumpkin seeds</p>
              <p>5. Depression: Unsweetened dark chocolate at least 70% cacao</p>
              <p>6. Knee cap meniscus worn off: drink daily the gluey chopped lady's fingers cooked in water. Do not eat the white seeds which will damage the bones.</p>
              <p>7. Brain: scaly fish with omega 3 oil , egg(do not pan fry but must be thoroughly cooked) , unsalted walnuts,  unsalted almonds, sunflower seeds.  Please eat sparingly.  Too much will harm the body.  About 3 to 5 per serving</p>
              <p>8. Heart: scaly fish with omega 3 oil,  unsalted almonds</p>
              <p>9. Stomach: papaya,  dragon fruit,  banana</p>
              <p>10. High blood pressure : it is due to eating high processed salt food like biscuits,  instant noodles, tidbits and salted nuts.  Stop adding processed salt to the cooking and the high blood pressure problem can be resolved automatically. Some people even make the mistake of soaking the vegetables in salt water. 
                                                          
                                                          Exercise cannot heal any poisoned organs.  People have been known to have died while exercising.  Many athletes need to repair the damaged bones. Many people , including young people due to the damage caused by exercise had to undergo knee cap replacement surgery. Bone spurs can be the result of the body over repairing the damaged bones.   Exercise can promote the free radicals that eventually can cause cancer.  If exercise is good for the body then it should not cause any death or damage to the bones. Bob  Harper, a  celebrity personal  trainer  in  America , suffered  from  a  massive  heart  attack.
                                                          
                                                          Contrary to popular belief, it is the food,  fluid and inhalation of the air pollutants that trigger the poisoned organs and the cells to mutate causing the chronic, terminal and the autoimmune diseases to trigger.  It is also the hormonal imbalance that can cause cancer, arthritis, joint Pain,  depression, stroke, heart attack, autoimmune disease, diabetes, dementia and Parkinson's disease.  Similarly,  the side effects of the  toxic medicines can trigger the chronic, terminal or autoimmune diseases.  I discover sometimes the wrong culprits are blamed for certain health conditions.  For instance,  doctors and nutritionists often advise the people with high LDL to reduce taking eggs.  But eggs do not have any internal organs, therefore they will not cause high cholesterol. Egg, especially the yoke,  is good for the brain and the heart.  
                                                          
                                                      Ultimately,  it is the wrong food,  drink, inhalation of the air pollutants that trigger the health problems.  Hence, in order to truly heal, the source of the problem has to be tackled.  I am living a pain free life with no health problem.  This is true healing!</p>
