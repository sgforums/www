              <p>knn TS... you think make a drug is so easy ar?? You know how smart the HIV virus is anot? It can mutate and change its surface antigens. Our body immune system recognise the antigens once changed, the immune system have to re-adapt again. This is same for drugs. It targets only one sort of antigen.</p>
              <p>You fucking think scientist make drug is easy ar?? You go make la. You first need to identify from a large pool of potential drug candidates then you narrow into maybe a thousand candidates. Then from these 1000, only maybe 1 will work. You need to test on animals first, then you need to go for human trials. 3 rounds of human trials will take much effort, money and time.</p>
              <p>You knn want quick drugs right.. then what if you take drugs that hasnt been tested? Then you die liao who at fault?</p>
              <p>You got study some virology first then come here kpkb la. The H1N1 is a virus that re-emerges after disappearing for many years. The flu virus got 16 H and 9 N, therefore making it a total 144 different potential flu virus. Even if we may have vaccinations for H1N1, but this new strain is more powerful. Our vaccination for the old type has no effect on this type. This is because of antigenic drift and shift. If you ta ma de dont know anything you fucking shut your mouth up la.</p>
              <p>Go to mountain la... go there and die la..</p>

              <p>TS u are fucking retarded. Do you live in a hole? Someone's asshole i bet. No advancements in medical science? I laughed. I can't believe I'm getting trolled like this but, fuck you.</p>
              <p>Do you think it's such an easy task to find the cure for AIDS or cancers etc? Like what Manyzer said, viruses are so complex and constantly mutating, it's hard to actually find a cure. So if you expect vaccines and cures to be found overnight, go fuck yourself. Your left hand.</p>
              <p>Try to understand how viruses work and the countless difficulties people out there encounter while trying to look for a cure before coming here and spewing your nonsensical bullshit. I know it's hard for you to understand but, do try, degenerate fuckwit.</p>
              <p>Like manyzer said, do yourself and this world a damn favor - kill yourself. NOW. Or someone else will kill you for your idiocy, eventually.</p>

              <p>if you guys, after spending DECADES and trillions of $$$$ from
                  tax-payers, donations from rich guys and all around the world,
                  still can't find any cure for stuff like AIDS, the various cancers
                  etc......then, pls do the world a favor and GIVE UP all your
                  useless research.</p>
              <p>the more i think about this, the angrier i am. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>maybe we should just face it: we humans have reached the peak of
                  our scientific technology and unable to go any further.</p>
              <p>those trillions of $$$ can better spent on food and the
                  poor.</p>
              <p>so, all u scientists out there, pls drop all your pretence and
                  stop acting like you guys are saviors of the world. you're not. and
                  let's face it: illnesses and diseases in this world come out faster
                  than you guys can even handle, so give up already.</p>
              <p>the average man on the street, such as people like myself, WANT
                  TO SEE REAL RESULTS after all these universes of $$$ are spent. No
                  result?! Go back to hell. That's where u pretenders belong to.</p>

              <p>If you're so damn bloody smart, go into virology and immunology lah! Go write a doctoral thesis on why cancer and virology research is a total waste of time and resources! Can or not ah?</p>

Many of them work and read each others thesis and research papers so as to share ideas how to create cures that will work on more than 90% of the global population and not a measly 10%.</p>
              <p>You got no testicles to sacrifice yourself in the name of science, so why ask people like scientists, engineers and researchers to throw their lives away so you can live without worries?</p>

                  problems belong to those white-coat scientists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>(tiera)<br> So if you expect vaccines and cures to be found overnight, go fuck
                  yourself. Your left hand. No advancements in medical science? I
                  laughed. I can't believe I'm getting trolled like this but, fuck
                  you.</strong></p>
              <p>hello, i want to see REAL medical advancements.</p>
              <p>sure, there is advancements in medical scienece, but IT IS
                  GETTING NOWHERE.</p>
              <p>to use an analogy, we can compare our medical science to our
                  space exploration.</p>
              <p>after NASA has spent trillions $$$ on space exploration, we
                  can't even manage to send anyone to Mars. and just how many
                  countries have landed on the moon??!!</p>
              <p>hey! stop masturbating and use your RIGHT HAND to count,
                  retard.</p>
              <p>and to talk about landing on Jupiter, Uranus, exploring ETs,
                  going beyond the Milky Way, black holes etc.......</p>
              <p>our medical science is the same. Once in a blue moon, u see some
                  retards making press statements like "American scientist discover
                  potential cure for lung cancer".</p>
              <p>but it turns out to be a sham, a hoax, a false alarm.</p>
              <p>50 years ago, humans were HELPLESS against cancer, AIDs and
                  other illnesses.</p>
              <p>Now, in 2009, we are exactly in the SAME HELPLESS situation.</p>
              <p>these scientists and researchers should be paid peanuts, not big
                  bucks.</p>
              <p>they should be paid big bucks ONLY after they can deliver REAL
                  RESULTS.</p>
              <p>and......they MUST be audited by governments worldwide and post
                  all their results and data to the public in layman's terms for all
                  to understand.</p>
              <p>for e,g: set a deadline to achieve what goals, what objectives,
                  etc....</p>
              <p>for all we know, these udder-farkers in white coats are flirting
                  in their research labs.</p>
              <p>like i say, these are tax-payers' money and donations.</p>
              <p>stop farking around and show us real results.</p>
              <p>I don't care how these white-coats do it.....it's their
                  problem.</p>
              <p>you've trillions of $$$$ at your dispense and all the brightest
                  minds in the world working together, and u can't even develop a
                  small, tiny breakthrough (never mind the real actual results)?</p>
              <p>good for nothings!!!! (i may be a good-for-nothing too but at
                  least i'm not a false apostle or a sham-king)</p>
