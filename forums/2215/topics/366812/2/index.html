              <p>that's not my problem, scientist fanboy. And it's not your problem either. We're both the average man on the street. Such problems belong to those white-coat scientists.</p>

              <p>sure, there is advancements in medical scienece, but IT IS GETTING NOWHERE.</p>
              <p>to use an analogy, we can compare our medical science to our space exploration.</p>
              <p>after NASA has spent trillions $$$ on space exploration, we can't even manage to send anyone to Mars. and just how many countries have landed on the moon??!!</p>

              <p>our medical science is the same. Once in a blue moon, u see some retards making press statements like "American scientist discover potential cure for lung cancer".</p>
              <p>but it turns out to be a sham, a hoax, a false alarm.</p>
              <p>50 years ago, humans were HELPLESS against cancer, AIDs and other illnesses.</p>
              <p>Now, in 2009, we are exactly in the SAME HELPLESS situation.</p>
              <p>these scientists and researchers should be paid peanuts, not big bucks.</p>
              <p>they should be paid big bucks ONLY after they can deliver REAL RESULTS.</p>
              <p>and......they MUST be audited by governments worldwide and post all their results and data to the public in layman's terms for all to understand.</p>

              <p>hello, i just want to see actual results by those scientists ok? no results no talk.</p>
              <p>no need to argue so much. They've been working for decades trying to come up with cures for the many terminal diseases but we still see nothing, not even 1/10th of a cure.</p>
              <p>hate to say this, but i believe that these scientists nowadays are dis-illusioned.</p>
              <p>maybe instead of spending 100% of their time in researching and finding cures, they're spending 50% of the time in playing lab politics and another 40% of their time without a clear goal in their mind. The other 10% is on talking, holding pointless meetings and eating.</p>
              <p>i don't really blame them, though......i understand that sometimes when organisations get too big, especially modern labs, things get to the stage of "snail-pace" and people get dis-illusioned without clear goals of where they're heading.</p>
              <p>this pretty much sums up why, after these 6 - 7 decades, scientists are still trying to figure out how to spell the word "Cancer".</p>

              <p>low self-esteem effers like you should go before me, because though i've been posting serious threads based on my own views and opinions, you've been doing nothing but flaming on and on and being hostile. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>why not you go to hell first and tell me how king yama looks like? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>hello, i just want to see actual results by those scientists ok?
              no results no talk.</p>
              <p>no need to argue so much. They've been working for decades
              trying to come up with cures for the many terminal diseases but we
              still see nothing, not even 1/10th of a cure.</p>
              <p>hate to say this, but i believe that these scientists nowadays
              are dis-illusioned.</p>
              <p>maybe instead of spending 100% of their time in researching and
              finding cures, they're spending 50% of the time in playing lab
              politics and another 40% of their time without a clear goal in
              their mind. The other 10% is on talking, holding pointless meetings
              and eating.</p>
              <p>i don't really blame them, though......i understand that
              sometimes when organisations get too big, especially modern labs,
              things get to the stage of "snail-pace" and people get
              dis-illusioned without clear goals of where they're heading.</p>
              <p>this pretty much sums up why, after these 6 - 7 decades,
              scientists are still trying to figure out how to spell the word
              "Cancer".</p>

              <p>Well, you couldn't figure out how to check your SIM card balance.</p>
              <p>Or how to make a hole in a ceramic tile.</p>
              <p>Or where to buy a USB cable.</p>
