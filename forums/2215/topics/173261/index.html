As you know, Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires oxygen to thrive. That is why the upper lobes of the lungs (best ventilated areas)  are more susceptible to TB and are the first sites of involvement usually. By collapsing the lung, you create an oxygen-poor environment which is supposed to kill the bacteria. In practice they tend to stay dormant and may pass the infection to others. But without effective antibiotics I guess they did not have much of a choice. Incidentally, my grandmother was among the first patients to receive streptomycin from missonary doctors in China. It left her with deafness but she was cured from tuberculosis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mercury was quite commonly used as a medication (still exists in some traditional Chinese and Indian medicines) but of course it is toxic. It was also used in industry to soften the felt used to make hats and quite often the workers developed psychiatric symptoms. Now you know the basis of the saying, "Mad as a hatter".<br><br>Do you know that doctors used to treat syphilis with mercury? That is also the basis of another saying, which I think is quite cute:<br><br>"One night with Venus, a lifetime with Mercury."</div>
