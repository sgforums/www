            <div class='col-md body'>I have been observing for some time about my grandma's condition.<br><br>Her toilet going frequency, is getting worse. Sometimes, barely one minute later she needs to go to the toilet.<br><br>Now, she can't get up on her own without someone helping her. According the physiotherapist, it's due to the lack of exercising that caused the muscles to weaken. She has suggested some simple exercises and advised us to get a heat pad. My grandma doesn't want to do those exercises because it hurts to do so.<br><br>I got a few questions:<br><br>1) Is her toilet habits that are affecting her? The frequency is very short.<br><br>2) Does the medication affects? (I will post the medications and latest medical reports after I reach home)<br><br>3) Where can I get a heat pad?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not too sure about this, whether or not has it worsened.<br><br>I have noticed that my grandma's memory has worsened (in my opinion, not too sure though). Before that, she has just forgotten whether we have eaten or not. Doctors didn't say much for this, so I guess it is just part of ageing process.<br><br>But after she had been discharged from hospital, it seems worse. She has been asking ridiculous questions, like asking me to buy 4D and Toto (I am underaged, can't go into these shops to buy such things). She also can't remember most of the things have happened. For example, she asked where my father is in the afternoon. My father has already gone off to work in the morning and she asked this in the afternoon. Somehow, she doesn't seem to know what's the time of the day either. She has asked to eat breakfast in the evening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It can be due to the age, but it also can be due to some medication given to your grandma at hospital, usually tranquilisers.<br><br>It is also a sign of alzheimer disease, but in my opinion it's due to her age.<br><br>There are some medications - nootropic drugs which improve the memoery and the function of the brain of old people. Gingko Biloba contains nootropic substances, therefore I would suggest your grandma drinks gingko tea and takes gingko pills, for the gingko pills I would ask the doctor if your grandma can take them. Though ginkgo is not dangerous, it's always good to ask the doctor who knows the patient if it's ok to take the gingko pills.<br><br>I take gingko pills when I study  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
