            <div class='col-md body'>The causes are numerous and you may need to see your doctor for a proper diagnosis.<br><br>The possibilities (not exhaustive) include:<br>1. Physiological: related to male hormones which gives the typical male balding pattern.<br>2. Fungal infection: very common and may itch as well. A scrape for fungus will be useful.<br>3. Autoimmune: alopecia areata has a typical, sharply demarcated scarring hair loss pattern<br>4. Lichen planus: an inflammatory cause of hair loss. A biopsy will demonstrate it<br>5. Systemic disease eg. SLE (systemic lupus eruthematosis): more common in women6<br>6. Trauma: mainly in women with long hair and vigorous combing. a related psychological cause is trichotillomania (an urge to pull hair out)<br>7. Others: including nutritional deficiency, drug traetment eg. chemotherapy, toxins and idiopathic (we don't know why)</div>
