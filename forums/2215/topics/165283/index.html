            <div class='col-md body'>Breathing is automated in our bodies, so we don't feel it.<br><br>To prove that you are breathing through one nostrils most of the time, cover the one side of your nostrils. If you can breathe normally, then cover the other one. You will notice that you feel a little breathless when you cover the other side. The nostrils will alternate the breathing, meaning, like from 10am to 12pm, you are breathing through your left nostrils, and from 12pm to 2pm, you are breathing through the right nostrils.</div>

It is used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the condition of the heart.<br><br>The Eustachian tube is a membrane lined tube that connects the middle ear space to the back of the nose. Its function is to ventilate the middle ear, ensuring that the pressure inside the ear remains at near normal ambient air pressure and to drain any accumulated secretions, infection, or debris from the middle ear space.<br><br>Valsalva maneuver (close your mouth, hold your nose and try breath out holding your nose stuffed) causes that a small volume of air moves from the throat to the ears through the Eustachian tubes which connect them. This can be used to balance the pressure inside the ears.<br><br>About breathing with mouth in high altitudes - if you are about to become a jet pilot, you will get anyway oxygen to breath, the pilots have to put the breathing masks on when reaching certain altitude. Pilots simply must be healthy, breathing with your mouth isn't healthy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I think you should ask this some pilot, becasue I really don't know if they get to breath normal air, or air with higher percentage of oxygen.</div>

Also the mucous in the nose can get swollen (also by allergy) and you feel that breathing is harder. Both nostrils would get<br>blocked if the air stream coming in and out during breathing wouldn't keep its way open. You know that you have to empty your nose into a tissue or hanky, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Often both nostrils get blocked, by me it happens usually at night when I have flu and my breathing gets so shallow, that the air stream by breathing isn't strong enough to keep its way atleast in one nostril, or when I stop to breath for 10 - 20 sec - what happenes to me sometimes at night.<br><br>The nasal sprays should help you to keep both nostrils free when you have flu.<br></div>

When you stop to use the spray, te symptoms return back after some time. You should stay on the medication as long, as your doctor has told you.</div>

Hence once you are relieved symptomatically, there is an inevitable return of such symptoms once exposed to the things that you are allergic to. The body has these cells known as mast cells that release histamines in huge amount to trigger off such allergic symptoms. The thing is that the antibody IgE (which is the key to opening the door for the release of histamines by mast cells) is attached to mast cells after the first exposure to such allergens. Such attachment increases the rapidity of histamine release because they are already attached to the lock. What it needs is an allergen to sit on top of them (ref IgE) and turn them to open the door. Hence the analogy is that the mast cells are the door that contains histamine in the inside, the IgE is the key and the allergens are the hands that turn the key to open the door. (Note that none of the medications used can remove these IgE, antihistamines work by inhibiting the histamine chemical's effects on the receptors. Histamines once released will find their receptors and sit on them leading to allergic symptoms. Your loratidine works in such a way that it sits on these receptors first, but the magic is that they do not cause an effect. The histamines in the body would then be unable to sit on the receptors for they have been occupied. Steroids on the other hand works by easing up the bronchial muscles, reducing the inflammation and clearing the inflammatory chemicals from the site of the allergy, hence helping to reduce the symptoms).<br><br>The best way or the first line treatment is to avoid the things that you are allergic to. Remove your carpet if you have one in your bedroom or your house, keep your curtains clean (wash them weekly), reduce the number of pillows (hence the covering) or mattresses in your room, if you have pets and if you are allergic to their danders, its time to consider letting them out rather than in the house (if they are house pets), etc.<br><br><strong>The severity of your blocked nose dictates the course and frequency of medication you will be put on</strong>. Your's is a type of allergy known as perrenial allergic rhinitis (happening throughout the year when exposed to certain chemicals or dust that you are allergic to). There is another one known as seasonal allergic rhinitis (but this happens more often in countries that have four seasons, and their blocked and irritatations of the nose comes only in particularly one specific season repeated annually). As yours is yearly, you would often face these symptoms frequently.<br><br>Heed your ENT specialist advice on your medications intake and you will be fine.</div>
