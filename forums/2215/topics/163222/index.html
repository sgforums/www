Now I know what is your problem... you have thalassaemia minor, which means that your blood count may be in the inadequate side... Your Hb may be low, but I am not sure about this (you have your medical records?)<br><br>You see, inside the bone is a structure we call the bone marrow, which their main function is to produce and synthesize red blood cells, white blood cells and also platelets. In thalassaemia minor, part of your red blood cells synthesized are abnormal because of some defects in hemoglobin formation. Hence there will be premature death of red blood cells in the circulation (extracted by the spleen).<br><br>A normal life span of a red blood cell is up to 120 days (4 months or so), but with your medical condition, it may be around 30-60 days before it gets cleared up, but since your's is minor, the life span may be slightly longer.<br><br>Hence your bone marrow will go into action and excessively produce these blood cells to replace what is lost. The only way to do so and mass produce red blood cells is for it to become larger (the bone marrow) hence pushing the bone encovering it to become bigger as well, and because of your skull that is fused, they will tend to have lumps and bumps and lead to irregularity.<br><br>This happens more when you reach puberty as this is the phase of rapid growth in sexual development as well as physical growth.<br><br>Bones that contain bone marrows and participate mostly in blood cell regeneration and production includes the long bones, particularly the femur, the humerus, the pelvis, the sternum (where your ribs meet in front) and also your skull (which is a membranous bone).<br><br>I hope this helps!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
