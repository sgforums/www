              <p>A young man has become the first person in Singapore to die of dengue in the current epidemic.</p>
              <p>So far, more than 8,000 people have come down with this viral infection that is spread by the Aedes mosquito.</p>
              <p>Last week, 641 people were diagnosed with the disease.</p>
              <p>Experts expect Singapore to experience its worst dengue epidemic ever
               this year. The previous high was in 2005, when more than 14,000 people 
              were infected and 25 died.</p>

              <h2 class="news_brief">Twenty-year-old Ang Yong Han has become the first person to die of dengue in the current epidemic in Singapore.</h2>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A 20-year-old Singaporean Chinese has become the first person to die of dengue in the current epidemic in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The news of the death first broke on the Facebook page of Cuesports Singapore, a national sports association (NSA). </p>
              <p>It identified the man as Mr Ang Yong Han, a competitive pool player.</p>
              <p>In
               a joint statement released on Thursday evening, the Ministry of Health 
              (MOH) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said they have been 
              notified of the death of a dengue patient who lived at Hougang Avenue 1.</p>
              <p>They
               said this is the first dengue death case this year and it highlights 
              the urgency for greater community vigilance to stamp out possible 
              mosquito-breeding spots.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang was seen at Tan Tock Seng 
              Hospital's (TTSH) Emergency Department (ED) on 23 May and diagnosed as 
              having viral fever, said the statement.</p>
              <p>His condition was reported to be stable and he was discharged with advice to return to the ED if his symptoms worsened.</p>
              <p>He was also asked to visit an outpatient clinic for follow up and a repeat blood test.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang subsequently returned to TTSH's ED on 26 May and was admitted as a dengue case.</p>
              <p>His
               condition worsened despite the aggressive blood transfusion treatment, 
              organ systems support and close monitoring, said a TTSH statement. Mr 
              Ang died from Dengue Shock Syndrome on 29 May.</p>
              <p>Family members 
              of Mr Ang told reporters that his death was sudden, because he died just
               a few days after being admitted. They said that his blood platelet 
              count dropped to a dangerously low level in a matter of days. Questions 
              still remain on their minds as to how his illness was not detected 
              earlier.</p>
              <p>Those who knew Mr Ang said his future as an athlete was bright.</p>
              <p>As a pool player, he had just joined the national training squad.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Aaron Koh, who is in charge of the players at Cuesports Singapore, 
              said: "I think it's a great loss for the pool community because 
              character-wise he's a very nice guy and of course he had the potential 
              to be one of the top players in Singapore."</p>
              <p>NEA is conducting 
              thorough vector control operations at the vicinity of Mr Ang's residence
               in Hougang, which is a dengue cluster.</p>
              <p>Singapore is currently in the midst of a dengue fever outbreak.</p>
              <p>So far, more than 8,000 people have come down with the viral infection that is spread by the Aedes mosquito.</p>
              <p>The authorities urge residents to cooperate fully with NEA inspectors conducting ground operations.</p>
              <p>They
               also strongly encourage all Singaporeans to take appropriate 
              precautions to prevent mosquito breeding by doing the Mozzie Wipeout 
              weekly.</p>

              it is terrifying to know how a small mosquito can kill a human being...really can't imagine how these insects have grown to be so overpowering....
              
              and equally unimaginable is why medicine has progressed so much in the past decades and many diseases can be cured, organs can be replaced, blocked blood vessels can be balloned, etc, yet...dengue fever cannot be eliminated....
              
              has sufficient medical research funds been allocated for this area or they have been diverted to other more profitable areas?
