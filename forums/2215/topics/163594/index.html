            <div class='col-md body'>Sure, I can give detailed comments, but though I have "attacked" mom's books to search for the particular harmful strains, haven't found them. So it stays just by the comment.<br><br>There are more than 30 different strains of HPV, some of them referred to as high risk types, can lead to cancer of a woman's cervix or penile cancer. Other types that are not likely to cause this infection are designated as low risk.<br><br>All warts are caused by a strain of HPV. Some types of HPV cause genital warts whereas other types cause common skin warts. Genital warts can develop on the cervix, penis, or in the vaginal or rectal area. They look similar to warts that might appear on the hands, feet, or other parts of the body. (Warts on the<br>hands and feet are not transmitted to the genitals.)<br>Genital warts, like warts on other parts of the body, are dry and painless, firm and rough in texture, and usually grayish or skin color.<br><br>High risk strains of the virus are linked to cervical changes in women and could possibly lead to cervical cancer. High risk HPV strains are those that are least likely to cause genital warts. Two of these same high risk strains are those that can cause penile cancer in men or anal cancer in those individuals who engage in anal intercourse.<br><br>So you still can have HPV though you have no warts. That's even worse becuse this strain of HPV can cause cancer.</div>

Sometimes the blisters can occur on other place, like your hand, I know a person who had herpes in her eye. By immunodeficient persons (persons whose immune system is very weak, usually due to a strong infection, or AIDS, or other reasons like leucemia or overdosis of gold or malnutrition) herpes blisters can occur also in brain or other organs ad that can be really dangerous.<br><br>If you are a normal healthy person, you shouldn't worry much.
