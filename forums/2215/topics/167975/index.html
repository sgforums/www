(DOB 1982), and without NS liabilities (presumably M'sian from his bio), Renorenal should be a medical officer, or a medical student, who is indeed very enthusiastic about his new found textual knowledge. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Just being Kay-poh: Are you doing some part 1 exams, or are you in your pre-clinical years? No medical student can remember that much anatomy or physiology by the time he does his Final MBBS. Ask your consultants about Marfan syndrome, Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome or Stickler syndrome, specifically pathophysiology. With the exception of Medical Pathologists or Medical Geneticists, most would give you a blank stare and a tight slap on your butts (with compliments, of course).<br><br>Nevertheless, I applaud your obsession with medical jargon.

These valves are named mitral, aortic, tricuspid and the pulmonic valves. Under Marfan's, the valves which are made up of muscular and elastic tissue fails to get support (refer the first post of my reply to your question) and when they don't get enough support, they will tend to be lax and fail to shut as tight as they normally would, hence allowing blood to flow in the wrong direction when the heart is being pumped strongly. This will lead to symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain and may also present with blackouts as there are less blood being channeled to the brain. These lax valves are called regurgitation or prolapses.<br><br><img src="http://www.xaraxone.com/FeaturedArt/mar04/assets/images/cardiac_cycle.png"><br><br>For this picture, look at the arrows, these shows the blood flow across the 4 main heart valves...<br><br></div>

During the embryonic period, when the baby grows in the tummy and develop, problems arise as such and gives rise to the above condition (imagine pieces of corn placed on a soup and compare it with the pieces of corn placed on an ice cream, the more stable one would be the ice cream, as it holds the structures of cells and tissues in check and allow them to carry out their activities without much troublesome).<br><br>Basically, the disease has only one problem (lack of support in the connective tissue disease), and as I have put it in that way above and several posts before this, I hope that you have a rather good idea of why these problems can happen, especially the trend...<br><br>All of the above disorders listed, if noted carefully includes the bony tissues, the joints and the cartilage which requires a huge amount of steady matrix to support the functional units of that organ respectively.<br><br><img src="http://medicalimages.allrefer.com/large/marfans-syndrome.jpg"><br><br>In this picture, concentrate on the chest wall deformity, you can see an excavation in the middle and the long fingers (arachnodactyly) and of course the heart problem, the great vessel that comes out from the left side of the heart (the aorta) is dilated because it appears weaker than normal...</div>
