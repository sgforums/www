              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, please kindly pardon me if this is the wrong place for me to post this topic. My family and I are at a loss at where to go and what we should do. </p>
              <p>My brother started braces treatment and ever since, he is unable to seal his lips, he can't make any expressions - smile, pout, frown etc. There will be constant trapping of saliva in his mouth and they would drip out uncontrollably. He has to use his hand to close his mouth manually to chew and keep the food together in his mouth or when he wants to have a drink. His mouth will be wide open when at rest. He is unable to do proper pronunciation now. His speech is slurred (people can barely understand what he is saying) and he is having breathing difficulties - it is now slow and weak. His neck and facial muscles twitch when he is at rest. Thereafter, he started feeling weak in his arms and legs. His fingers would move on their own when he is at rest. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Has anyone encountered such a problem or know of anyone who encountered such problem? Could it be the braces that have caused this neurological problem? My brother was a very fit young man who just completed his National Service before starting braces. He had no problem with speech or any weakness in his limbs before starting braces. We have seen a doctor but doctor is unable to find any problem with his body. No tumours, everything normal. Can't find any abnormalities that is causing this. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or perhaps any one knows of a good neurologist to recommend? Or anyone knows where is a better place for posting of this topic? </p>
              <p>Please please kindly advice. Any advice will be very much appreciated. Many many thanks in advance!</p>
