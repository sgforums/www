            <div class='col-md body'>fymk,<br><br>I'm still not convinced by your explanations as to why you should be labelling the other forummites with the rather derogatory label of 'quacks'. Let's take it point by point:<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Oxford definition : quack<br><br>Â• noun 1 an unqualified person who dishonestly claims to have medical knowledge</strong></blockquote>Pardon me, but I don't seem to see anyone here who 'dishonestly claims to have medical knowledge'. Thinkdifferent herself said that she's not a doctor, but an assistant to the two doctors. As far as I can tell, there's no one here who's masquerading as a doctor or the like. Heck, for all you know, I myself could be pretending to be a combat medic. Touch my heart, I'm not pretending, but there's no way for me to prove that either without revealing my identity (which I won't). You're just going to have to take my word for it.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Your mom is doing what mothers do - they relieve ur symptoms from their own experience -. It is called maternal instinct , not quackery . It pains most mothers to see their child suffer . Sometimes decisions mother makes may not be right but they never intend their own child harm because the children are own flesh and blood . It is a protective instinct . That makes it so different from quack .</strong></blockquote>I won't underestimate the power of maternal instinct, but you shouldn't deny the power of a person's love for the common man, either. What if a Tan Ah Kow with no medical experience advises his friend to take clarinase for his runny nose? Is that quackery as well?<br><br>This is called human instinct.

First of all, the post on BCG vaccinations: it's true that she should have checked out her sources first before posting. However, that's what these forums are all about: to discuss, to advise, and to correct each other if necessary.<br><br>Besides, from my sources she's not completely wrong: BCG has an effective rate of between 50-80%, according to wikipedia. You see? Different sources give different information. So we share the information and decide what's the best route to take.<br><br>Second, nasal swelling. What's wrong with her saying 'I think'? If anything, I ought to be applauding her for correctly qualifying her statements at the very beginning. When she says 'I think', she's just giving a possible opinion, and that what she thinks may not necessarily be the case. I myself will always say 'I think' before explaining to the casualties I've encountered about what injuries/illness they might be having.<br><br>And since she thinks it's an allergy, of course she'll go more into allergies.<br><br>Thirdly, dry cough. What's wrong with asking about other symptoms? Surely you of all people should know about this. Whenever I'm doing triage duty, I always ask for other symptoms before sending the patients to the medical officer. If the patient says he has a cough, I sure as heck would ask him if there were any other symptoms of flu. That's the standard operational procedure.<br><br>If the forummites can't even ask about other possible symptoms, then what do you expect them to say?<br><br>'Hey, visit the doctor.'<br><br>'Hey, visit the doctor.'<br><br>'Hey, visit the doctor.'<br><br>If that's the only thing they can say, then it kind of defeats the purpose of having a health discussion forum, methinks.

To a hypochondriac , the symptoms are real but the tests may or maynot show otherwise . Ever heard of Munchausen's syndrome? Or Munchaunsen by proxy? Those are psychiatric illnesses whereby they make themselves sick and not tell the doctors that it is self inflicted and both are VERY HArd to diagnose . Even with patients in real life showing up at a doctor's practice or hospital - it is difficult to see who is very anxious to the point of having somatic pain or who is experiencing real pain. How would a doctor online make out a test when the patient themselves sometimes have no idea of the lab result except the usual " oh my doctor said I have anaemia" . Now anaemia comes in many forms : sickle cell anaemia , pernicuous anaemia , thalaessemia related anaemias etc .<br><br>Oh by the way , that was part of my medical history which I threw in - my doctors just said I am healthy except for high red cell count with beta thalaessemic minor . Oh yes I am a freak of nature according to them because people like me are usually anaemic or mildly but never with high red blood cell counts - one did say my body could be compensating for the poor binding capability in the heme .<br><br>That is why the forum needs a disclaimer to protect the moderators as well as the public from any thing untoward.</div></blockquote>Firstly, renorenal was flamed because of some unknown reasons. It's in the Marfan Syndrome thread. Secondly, PM didn't solve the problem. He went on to set up a forum. I shall not bring up that forum name, but if you are curious, just search around.

Other than a piece of physical paper, what other things are there? I know that there is a professional medical body out there that we can check with. </div></blockquote>You've just answered yourself.  Don't ever be satisfied with a piece of paper that someone waves at you - check with the organisation that issued the certificate (e.g. an SMC cert will have SMC written on it somewhere) and find out if the person is really registered with them.<br><br>Ok, for example, if Doctor Teo Tak Sai and waves a cert at you, all you need to do is go to <a href="http://www.moh-healthprofessionals.gov.sg/PRSCPDS/home/hpp/search.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.moh-healthprofessionals.gov.sg/PRSCPDS/home/hpp/search.jsp</a>, enter the name and hit search.  You will find that there is no record of him at the SMC and you will therefore know that his beautifully Photoshopped cert is bunkum.<br><br>On the other hand, if you look for Dr Ang Ai Ling (name randomly pulled out from the register), you will see that she's not only registered with them, but also that she's got an MBBS from Singapore and psychiatry training in the UK.<br><br>It's that simple to do a quick check of the person's bona fides with a regulatory body - why would you then want to trust a simple piece of paper?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been away for just two weeks for CNY and another flame war started? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Haven't had time to read all the comments (no point reading those in a flame war...bad for the heart and mind anyway). Many of the negative comments I read are not worth repeating...lots of angst, anger and even arrogance....but I do not want to re-start flame wars. Here are my views:<br><br>As I previously PM to alexkusu when the idea of such a forum came up, I suggested a disclaimer of sorts, but not for the reason some of you might think. To those who talked about disclaimers on websites, you may not realize that often they are not worth the paper they are printed on. Having a disclaimer does NOT protect you from litigation if someone suffers harm from your advice.<br><br>In a negligence suit, you have to prove a duty of care, dereliction of duty, damage and causation. If you receive medical advice from a website of the Mayo Clinic about your specific condition from one of its employees, you might reasonably suspect that a doctor-patient relationship exists. A disclaimer is useful in this context to inform the viewer that the website does not acknowledge such a relationship. However, it does not prevent you from arguing that having Dr ABC from Mayo Clinic telling you your condition requires a particular treatment constitutes a doctor-patient relationship, regardless of what the disclaimer says.....and you may indeed be right.<br><br>In a forum such as this, when the participants are anonymous and even as some critics admitted, they do not know if the moderators are health professionals, how is one going to argue that a doctor-patient relationship exist in the first place? I have said that I am a medical doctor but how is anyone to know?<br><br>As I have said before during the earlier flame war involving renorenal, a forum such as this is purely for information and entertainment. Nobody should or can successfully claim that a doctor-patient relationship exists simply because XYZ advises a particular course of action in a thread. Incidentally, one would have to sue Sgforums.com rather than some phantom entity who can dispense advice under a multitude of clones. Interestingly, I have not seen any disclaimers by Sgforums.com; and I would certainly put one up if I were Jason or Fireice. Not so much for fear of negligence suits (one would be laughed out of our courts) but the very real possibility of defamation (which is no laughing matter in Singapore).<br><br>Back to the reason I suggested a disclaimer so long ago...I thought it was a good idea just in case there are naive persons as suggested by certain critics, who might think that they can substitute the need to see a doctor by getting free consultation through cyberspace. To the cheapskates who might be tempted to save some money by not seeing a GP, the disclaimer would warn them that they would not have the full legal protection of a doctor-patient relationship by relying on information on the Web. In other words, the disclaimer is not placed to avoid being sued, it is to tell the patient that chances are that you will not be able to seek legal redress without a proper consultation in a doctor's office.<br><br>Incidentally, why would doctors and lawyers give free consultations when we should be earning good money for them? I am not allowed to advertise or I would leave my practice address here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>This is the form of a disclaimer I had in mind. If the other moderators are in favour, we can put it up. It has no legal effect but serves to inform, which is after all, the purpose of this forum as well:<br><br>"The information and materials on this forum are provided by the moderators and other users for general informational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing medical advice or giving a medical opinion on any specific facts or circumstances. Your use of this forum does not create a doctor-patient relationship between you and the moderators or any other users."</div>
