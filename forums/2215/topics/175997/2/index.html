            <div class='col-md body'>fymk,<br><br>I think you misunderstood what I was talking about. For starters, I do agree with you that there out to be disclaimers here or something. We need to remind people that whatever medical advice gets posted here are not used in lieu of a proper medical evaluation. If you're sick, by all means go and find out more about your illness, but you should still see the doctor.<br><br>However, I absolutely disagree with your usage of the word 'quacks'. I don't understand... how does their sharing of the medical information they have with others make them quacks? While you and I both may have formal medical training, bear in mind that we're both not qualified to make our own diagnoses. If I were to make a diagnosis and the guy gets worse, I'll be in deep trouble. I can only make my own field evaluations and patch the guy up enough for the medical officers to do a full evaluation. I imagine that the same goes for you.<br><br>In that respect, we're not much different from the other forummites who may not have formal medical training.<br><br>However, I don't see what's wrong with their sharing of information which they get from trusted sources and personal experience. What's wrong with a forummite who shares what he knows about (for example) colorectal cancer from the experience of his grandfather who has it? Just because he doesn't have formal training doesn't make him a quack.<br><br>For your information, half of what I know about first aid and medicine are lessons which I got from field experience. I didn't learn everything I know in the classroom. So if you say that the other forummites are quacks, then I suppose I'm one as well for sharing my field experiences.<br><br>I would like to kindly suggest that you take back what you said about quacks.</div>

That may be a bad judgement on my part I admit.<br><br>However I didn't start with flaming - check what I said in the first post of Just out of curiosity . I only asked - take a look for yourself .  The first post was asking about the qualifications . And I was accused of being a clone . Naturally the human thing to do is to answer back .<br><br>I bear my own consequences . Yes I admit I might not be right always. However I don't see the person involved even giving an answer like that.  That infuriates me .<br><br>It is because of people like these, I see patients delay treatment and one died on me - read what I said in the topic which the moderator has closed . If I can do my part by questioning them and maybe getting a huge disclaimer across which is a fairly easy thing to do for thinkdifferent to type out will do but instead she has chosen to prove how knowledgeable she is  instead of trying to put a disclaimer out there as a sticky asap. </div></blockquote>You could always get the Mods to place a disclaimer in a sensible tone and with proper explanation of your stand, instead of trying to go on a bombing run.And then you feign surprise when they launch counter-attacks, purely because you did not show some form of moderation in behavior and you expect them to believe at first instance.<br><br>A doctor ranting to a patient about his case will NOT make the patient any closer to listening to qualified advice.If you had made your point nicely and backed it up, they would be quite happy to rectify that oversight.You cannot expect people to silently take things do you?<br><br>Yes, medical advice might be misconstrued by individuals, and "first do no harm" also lives side by side with "buyer beware".So there..The chaps here have done us all a favor, and I'm sure their intentions are not out to hurt anyone.</div>

It bears no responsibility for those who takes its advice seriously .  Please go and see a doctor if you have an actual medical/health problem "<br><br>I am sure the other moderators won't mind at all unless they intended to use this forum as a real virtual clinic .

As for information - if you say who your mom is and your award winning essay - then I am very sure that you are able to back it up with what medically peer reviewed journals have said .<br><br>As for the  quack name  because you have gave me a reason enough to by telling me that you read books of medical knowledge when you were a child etc etc and therefore implying that you can give advice way beyond the scope of a layman . And it is well within reason.<br><br>Yes qualifications can be faked . Hey do you know that you can check a doctor's credentials online?

Well , you just have to make sure your facts are right or else a muslim may just hammer you back with the facts.

They would know about conducts and ethics of the medical profession if advice is given wrongly and some naive person really get harmed by the advice.<br><br>The Good Samaritan Act only covers when a person is in iminent danger and cpr is required and maybe ACLs when there is no other people or places nearby to help  but he dies - it covers the medical / healthcare professional within the limit he can practice. After that - open house on a law suit .<br><br>It certainly does not cover them from law suits ( yes , there are people who do that)  until their disclaimer comes up.<br><br>If I wanted to make trouble for them , I would not even say anything about a disclaimer. I won't even bother putting forth explanations.

However, let's go along with it for the moment.  Supposing you put forward an argument that concludes that certain factions of the Muslim community are prone to terrorist recruitment, and some reader comes along and burns down one of their mosques on the basis of what he's read in your posts.  Even if you are not tracked down and charged for sedition or inciting racial violence, you'll know that your seemingly innocent comments have led to a tragic result.<br><br>The same applies here, only with a greater degree of likelihood.  Even without the research evidence fymk provided, think about common experience: it's common for one person to tell another "don't worry about it, it's normal", and the other person ignores a problem upon the advice of an unqualified source because he or she prefers to live in blissful ignorance.  The same, of course, applies to hypochondriacs - they'll go with the advice that best fits their world view.<br><br>Also, qualification is a major issue.  Of course, one cannot dispute that "buyer beware" is an assumption in most situations, but does the buyer know what to be wary of?  In my experience, the buyer does not; I've lost count of the number of times someone has told me, "My counsellor turned up at my house one night uninvited", or something of the sort, and they're surprised when I ask them if they've discussed the issue with the Psychologists' Registration Board because they don't even know the Board exists!<br><br>How many lay persons are aware of what recourse they have if something goes wrong?  Very few, I'll wager.  As such, "buyer beware" is not a strong defence in any sense.<br><br>The greatest irony here is that it's the professionals who best understand these problems, when the people receiving the services are the ones most in need of such knowledge.  I've had people PM me about someone whose description fits the DSM-IV criteria for some illness or other, but I make a point not to label it because I'd be overstepping my professional bounds.  Instead, I refer them to someone suitably qualified like a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, and provide my views on the points that need to be emphasised when describing the person.  Of course, when I do that, I almost invariably get the objection, "But you're a psychologist, right?", because they don't know the difference between the various fields of psychology.  Sure, I've got the textbook stuff down pat, but my practical experience is in a corporate environment, not a clinical one, so any diagnosis or opinion I provide isn't worth the breath I take to utter it.  It's plain and simple: there's no room for ego when it comes to people's health and well-being.  If you don't know, you don't know - don't pretend because you're potentially opening a Pandora's Box.<br><br>Insipid afterthought: I take it that mayi was being facetious about Photoshopping qualifications.

I don't understand... how does their sharing of the medical information they have with others make them quacks? While you and I both may have formal medical training, bear in mind that we're both not qualified to make our own diagnoses. If I were to make a diagnosis and the guy gets worse, I'll be in deep trouble. I can only make my own field evaluations and patch the guy up enough for the medical officers to do a full evaluation. I imagine that the same goes for you.<br><br>In that respect, we're not much different from the other forummites who may not have formal medical training.<br><br>However, I don't see what's wrong with their sharing of information which they get from trusted sources and personal experience. What's wrong with a forummite who shares what he knows about (for example) colorectal cancer from the experience of his grandfather who has it? Just because he doesn't have formal training doesn't make him a quack.<br><br>For your information, half of what I know about first aid and medicine are lessons which I got from field experience. I didn't learn everything I know in the classroom. So if you say that the other forummites are quacks, then I suppose I'm one as well for sharing my field experiences.<br><br>I would like to kindly suggest that you take back what you said about quacks.</div></blockquote>Maybe you should read in detail about what I said.<br><br>If there is not much difference from other forumnites who may not have formal medical training - then why even bother with registration of medical personnel? If healthcare training is so passe- why even bother with registration of healthcare professionals?<br><br>I did say something about support groups - they do share something in common - the suffering of a similar disease - they however will keep within the scope of their afflicted disease.  Am I going to argue with a longterm renal patient - HELL NO - they sometimes do know their conditions very well - even more so than the doctors or nurses sometimes- bad days good days etc .<br><br>Either I could have misunderstood that but the way it was put forward- she gave me an impression that she  hijacked renorenal's answer ( to be fair reno gives sound answers)  and posed it as her own when she told the other forumner to post the link to it.<br><br>Do you know what a quack is? A person who passes off as a knowledgeable medical practitioner - but then again nowadays we have people passing off as nurses , psychologists , dietitians  etc .  They come under the collective word of "quack"  when they are not registered to even practice. Unless she is registered as a healthcare professional , even an occupational therapist , social worker, physiotherapist , nurse - then I will take the naming of '' quack' back . She has not once given me a cause to take it back.<br><br>Combat medics are exempt from that word  - they are in the field and they have some form of practical . They are employed and recognised by the army in a military sense - they are technically what I might say - registered with the army to practice within the army for the well being of the army .  They have first aid skills and basic training to cope with traumatic situations and I do have a healthy respect for them . They are military paramedics , just like our own ambulance paramedics - trained to cope first line .<br><br>To say they are not any different than any forumnites who don't have practical training - it is wrong - we both know theory and practical comes across as different  . I didn't say formal medical training - I did say practical healthcare training .<br><br>Fudgester :  Sharing your experiences is ok because it iS YOUR OWN - it does not make u a quack because u did what u were trained to do with the authority and blessing of the army .<br><br></div>

This disclaimer should adequately cover their legalities.<br><br>Maybe thinkdifferent, you should read what I said . I didn't ask for you to resign  . Don't get so dramatic .<br><br>I said maybe you should refer people to websites which are reputable like Mayo Clinic , or just tell them to see a doctor with their complaints IF none of your moderators , who presumably is qualified, is available to answer. As for information - if you say who your mom is and your award winning essay - then I am very sure that you are able to back it up with what medically peer reviewed journals have said .<br><br>As for the  quack name  because you have gave me a reason enough to by telling me that you read books of medical knowledge when you were a child etc etc and therefore implying that you can give advice way beyond the scope of a layman . And it is well within reason.<br><br>Yes qualifications can be faked . Hey do you know that you can check a doctor's credentials online? If anyone wants to impersonate a doctor , I am sure there are heavy penalties imposed by legislation . </div></blockquote>Fymk, as I've reiterated, do you feel the need to do another Hiroshima just to get your request for a disclaimer across?I'm sure that a few PMs and a simple, nice request would have done the trick.<br><br>Your constant usage of the word quack is highly debatable and fails to take into account the context of what is going on.If I give advice based on medical texts,  I am quoting a reviewed document and I am just a conduit and a facilitator of information here, if I choose to say dispense, then I will have a hunt on my tail, so..why not just say it's a semantics issue and once and for all, put this damned issue to rest? There will be ignorant fools online or in the real world anyway.<br><br>However, a disclaimer will protect all parties and this I definitely agree with.<br><br>Well, I hope this issue is solved amicably.It's just jarring to see such a flamefest going on early in the morning.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">Lordz, for most part I agree with you as usual, but this point's muddying the waters.<br><br>I don't agree with the example you provide because people are unlikely to act upon it.  However, let's go along with it for the moment.  Supposing you put forward an argument that concludes that certain factions of the Muslim community are prone to terrorist recruitment, and some reader comes along and burns down one of their mosques on the basis of what he's read in your posts.  Even if you are not tracked down and charged for sedition or inciting racial violence, you'll know that your seemingly innocent comments have led to a tragic result.<br><br>The same applies here, only with a greater degree of likelihood.  Even without the research evidence fymk provided, think about common experience: it's common for one person to tell another "don't worry about it, it's normal", and the other person ignores a problem upon the advice of an unqualified source because he or she prefers to live in blissful ignorance.  The same, of course, applies to hypochondriacs - they'll go with the advice that best fits their world view.<br><br>Also, qualification is a major issue.  Of course, one cannot dispute that "buyer beware" is an assumption in most situations, but does the buyer know what to be wary of?  In my experience, the buyer does not; I've lost count of the number of times someone has told me, "My counsellor turned up at my house one night uninvited", or something of the sort, and they're surprised when I ask them if they've discussed the issue with the Psychologists' Registration Board because they don't even know the Board exists!<br><br>How many lay persons are aware of what recourse they have if something goes wrong?  Very few, I'll wager.  As such, "buyer beware" is not a strong defence in any sense.<br><br>The greatest irony here is that it's the professionals who best understand these problems, when the people receiving the services are the ones most in need of such knowledge.  I've had people PM me about someone whose description fits the DSM-IV criteria for some illness or other, but I make a point not to label it because I'd be overstepping my professional bounds.  Instead, I refer them to someone suitably qualified like a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, and provide my views on the points that need to be emphasised when describing the person.  Of course, when I do that, I almost invariably get the objection, "But you're a psychologist, right?", because they don't know the difference between the various fields of psychology.  Sure, I've got the textbook stuff down pat, but my practical experience is in a corporate environment, not a clinical one, so any diagnosis or opinion I provide isn't worth the breath I take to utter it.  <span style="color: red;">It's plain and simple: there's no room for ego when it comes to people's health and well-being.  If you don't know, you don't know - don't pretend because you're potentially opening a Pandora's Box.</span><br><br>Insipid afterthought: I take it that mayi was being facetious about Photoshopping qualifications.  If you are professionally qualified, there will have to be a regulatory body who will affirm your credentials.</div></blockquote>This I have to agree, it is the basic fundamental of health care. Which is why the chaps here have always told the people who ask their advice, to follow up and see a real-life practitioner.In fact, other than the disclaimer, I see this place as a discussion forum for ailments, and where individuals from all walks of life can hang around and learn a bit here and there.<br><br>It's no substitute for professional medical opinions, but I dare say that there are fellows who might actually uncover something and actually go on to their doctors,subsequently being able to confirm that it's actually there.<br><br>Ah, a disclaimer.That a short little notice could cause such mayhem is something truly unique to us humans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

It is called maternal instinct  , not quackery . It pains most mothers to see their child suffer .

I went to check the definition of facetious, and its meaning is humourous. I am serious about it, anybody with enough skills can fake it. There is definitely a medical body who can affirm the doctors' credentials here. But can they find out whether this doctor's certificate is real? Unless you are a photoshop expert, a normal person can't tell between a real and fake picture.</div></blockquote>Gotta disagree with you there, mayi.<br><br>You're thinking about certification in terms of a physical piece of paper.  The paper is in fact nothing more than a representation of the person's registration with the regulatory body, the person having first passed the professional standards required by that body to practice in that particular field.<br><br>For example, if someone showed you a practising certificate from the Singapore Medical Council, you could call the SMC and ask if he is indeed a doctor.  No matter how well he Photoshopped the certificate, if the SMC says he's not on their list, you'll know he's a fake.<br><br>Anyway, you've just demonstrated a point that I made.  Lay people need to know these things about their health care providers, but they don't, and instead they count on certificates that can be faked without understanding the system behind those certificates.
