            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bros,<br><br>Just found out from this forum that many people do not know of other option to nursing home and maid, for their bedridden elderlies. I came across the below message:<br><br>************************<br>My grandmother was bedridden for 2 years due to massive stroke. We put her up in a nursing home. Her monthly cost for the nursing home was $2,000 to $3000. She passed away since. But during the 2 years, the family spent around $100,000, including hospital visits.<br><br>:happy4:<br>************************<br><br>There is a better and cheaper option. My father had a stroke and we were also in this predicament. AMK Community Hospital was chasing us to transfer my dad out of the hospital and we were hard-pressed to find him a caregiver. We called many nursing homes and yes, they were simply out of our budget ($1800 to $3000).<br><br>Fortunately one of our friends introduce us to an agency to get private nursing (only $900 salary a month). After using the private nurse, I found that this option is probably much better than the nursing home in many ways: (1) Cheaper (2) Need not travel daily to visit my dad (3) 1-on-1 nursing care (4) Now my house has a nurse (in case anything happens to my kids) (5) My dad is very happy as he need not go to a nursing home and he could be with his grand-kids.<br><br>I am very thankful to my friend for his recommendation. Hence, for all with bedridden folks in nursing homes (except those with no place for them in their house), this could be a better option ;-)<br><br>I know there are many who will be in the same predicament as I am. So, I hope to this option could help .... like it did to me</div>

What about weekends and days off? Can she/he administer injections and morphine?<br></div>
