              <p>Hi all.Â  Long-time lurker on these forums, but first time poster.</p>
              <p>SAR-21,</p>
              <div class="content">I decided to post for the first time to your thread because your question struck a chord with me because I have been interested in height research for a while now.<br> <br> Mind you, I'm talking about actual scientific research - not the
                  horrible scams and lies that are spread all over the internet. Believe
                  me when I say that I've searched through all of what's to be found out
                  there and there's just not much to be found as far as true, scientific
                  evidence.<br> <br> First and foremost, pills and injections, unless prescribed by and
                  taken under the strict guidance of a medical professional, should be
                  avoided at all costs. If you are talking about ordering substances like
                  these online, please reconsider for your own safety.<br> <br> The fact of the matter is that you are limited by your genetics - and
                  the fact that your natural growth process has completed. As you may
                  already know, adolescent children that are in the midst of their
                  natural growth cycles can undergo a series of hormone treatments that
                  have shown success at helping them grow taller than their natural
                  growth cycles have allowed.<br> <br> However, since you say you are 21 years old, this is naturally not an
                  option for you, as your natural growth phase is coming to a close.<br> <br> However, what is an option is what is known as optimizing your current
                  height through a series of stretching and exercise as well as
                  nutritional regimens. What these focused exercises (among other things)
                  do for you is take advantage, in large part, of the naturally-pliable
                  cartilage that binds the vertebrae in your spine together. While this
                  may sound a little scary, its really not. What happens is that through
                  proper nutrition that strengthens your cartilage and stretching
                  exercises that help strengthen the muscles in your back that surround
                  your spine, you are able to actually gain an inch or even a little more
                  in height after a few months of effort.<br> <br> Add in specific yoga and Pilates exercises that have been proven to
                  remedy any and all posture issues that you may have (and almost
                  everyone has, even if they cannot tell), there have been people that
                  have gained up to 3 inches in height naturally and safely.<br> <br> Even something seemingly as simple as sleeping on your back (in a
                  proper manner and definitely if you don't have any medical conditions
                  that prevent you from doing so) without a pillow. What this does is
                  gradually and safely straighten some of the natural arch in your spine
                  and neck. While some arch is perfectly normal (and necessary) many
                  people develop more of an arch than necessary simply due to habits such
                  as staring at a computer screen for hours per day or sitting improperly.<br> <br> All of these small factors add up.<br> <br> I've found a few videos on YouTube that give you an example of the
                  exercises that I'm referring to and the only website that I trust on
                  the subject since it demonstrates nothing but natural, safe methods to
                  go about gaining height in this manner.<br> <br> Personally, I believe that any kind of pills, lotions, or false shoe
                  lifts are not to be messed with. Faking your height with shoe lifts, in
                  my opinion, is kind of like living a lie. Sooner or later you may be
                  "found out." Also, popping strange pills or rubbing strange lotions on
                  your legs to "help you grow taller" is just junk science. If that stuff
                  worked, a major pharmaceutical company would have patented it and made
                  billions by now. Finally, scary surgery such as leg-lengthening surgery
                  costs a fortune ($50,000+), is extremely painful, and takes months or
                  even longer to heal. Added to that, if you make only your legs longer,
                  it seems to me that your body may look a little out-of-proportion.<br> <br> I do feel for you since I was a relatively short man at 28 years old at
                  5'7" but after dedicating myself to a few months of stretching
                  exercises and diet I can honestly say that I am now 5'9". Certainly not
                  a basketball player by any means, but I am happier now that I am of the
                  "average height" for a man in the United States. I still do the
                  stretching exercises once a day (the videos I posted recommend twice a
                  day - which I did at first as well as the other recommended things that
                  the poster of the videos recommends at his website that you can find on
                  the YouTube page) and I have kept the same height for over a year now.<br> <br> Good luck, SAR-21 and I hope this helps!</div>
