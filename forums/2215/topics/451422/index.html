              <p>Hello, it's me again.. My younger sister recently caught the virus from her kindergarten school, her school even closed down temporarily as 6 cases of HFMD was reported.</p>
              <p>And now I think I have it, small little pink bumps on my palms, not that many. Ulcers in my mouth, like 4. And now bumps are starting to appear on my feet too!</p>
              <p>My bloody Mid-year Exam next week and I studied so hard for it, should I tell my parents or just self-treat myself? Since there are no medication for this virus anyway.</p>
              <p>Help me, I really don't want to miss the exams! I'm taking N-Levels this year, I NEED to take this exam!</p>

              <p>Oh, I got it during Primary School day, according to doctor, the young ones will have fever, for those in secondary Sch, rashes and red spot bumps appear, no fever.</p>
              <p>The advice is drink alot of water, mine was able to cure faster thru traditional medication, I even went up to elizabeth hospital to see a specialist (my dad's doctor, fees borne by his company), but still it persist, then my grandma brought me to see the TCM singaporean doctor, what he prescribed was a very strong Liang Char, to him, it is heat, high heat in the body that causes this virus to enter yourbody thru open skin pores.</p>
              <p>After taking it, 2 days only, back to school</p>

              <p>Be kiasu la, go see a western doctor first to protect yourself with medical cert and tell your parents. Get the diagnosis 1st then decide on treatment later. Go western doctor because chinese doc that provide MC are not acceptable by some organizations.</p>
              <p>The school will allow you to defer if its a serious medical problem. Have a discussion with your school also.</p>
              <p>Also be considerate, don't go to the examiantion if you aren't suppose to and spread to other people.</p>
              <p>At most they will just quarantine you in a small room so  you can still do the examiantion.</p>

              <p>HFMD is <strong>highly contagious</strong>.. you need to seek medical help immediately.</p>
              <p>Idiots like you are culprits for spreading it when you go around public pretending you don't have the disease.</p>

              You have to tell your parents, go see the doctor, get a medical chit, tell your examiners, (get your parents to do that) and make arrangements so that you can take your exams.
