My mother likes to buy a lot of products during promotion and then keep at home till expire liao, then take out and let us eat... Is expiry goods (i.more than a few days; ii. more than 1 months) bad for health? How can I convince my mom not to do it frequently? I thought the chemical inside the products wil turn bad when expired?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ahem..between u n me, its safe to consume food past its expiry date or best before date provided its been stored well. (no damage to packaging, etc).<br><br>Manufacturers are quite conservative when it comes to best before dates. They tend to understate the dates for safety sake. For example, pasta can last 10years, but manufacturers may put 8 years instead. How they measure the dates is by testing the food via ASLT (Accelerated Shelf Life Testing) and from the results they estimate the shelf life. Hence the nearer the food it is to the deadline, the higher the increase in bacteria population in the food. This means if you are a strong, healthy individual, it wont be any problems eating food passed the deadline.

It all depends variably in one's immune system.

Manufacturers sterilise canned foods on the basis of 'botulinum cook' where the food is heated up to 121 degrees (enuf to kill/deactivate the c.bot). Hence if u get botulism from canned foods, you can get sue the company for millions...provided you are still alive. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>One salmon company faced similar circumstances <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
