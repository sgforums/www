            <div class='col-md body'>I think you have an allergy. It's better to remove the factor which triggers your nasal mucous tissue to swell then to cut it away. The nasal mucous tissue is very important for the nose. It moisturizes the air you are breathing, it catches the bacterias which are in the air and it allows you to smell.<br><br>Do you know what is the reason for the swellings? Have you done the allergy test?</div>

Sometimes it could be a chronic condition due to unknown causes .<br><br>Sinusitis is  poor drainage from one of the sinuses ( air pockets in the skull to keep it light)  . It feels like a blockage and gives a headache ( if it is maxillary - cheekbone side- it will feel better when u lie down). It can be caused by allergies but sometimes it could also be related to  the structure of how a person's sinus form inside the skull. Alot of causes .<br><br>There is a possibility that you have another condition called rhinitis - swelling of the nasal membranes - which have no operative solution.<br><br>For both - usually doctors will trial you on steroids to reduce inflammation and sometimes decongestants (i.e. Sudafed)  as well .<br><br>Go see a doctor - maybe if it does not resolve - ask for a referral to see an ENT ( ear neck throat) specialist . They will advise you on what you should do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok.. thx, well so far i've only used the spray before, and the gp gave me some medicine to take also, got help but then sometimes also quite block.. nope havent done any allergy test before, but i noe my dad also got this problem, maybe is genetic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's very probable that it is genetic. The doc should make a proper check on you and find out what is the reason, then without the reason no proper medication can be applied.</div>

That's my advice if the problem is not getting any better and the GP 's treatment doesn't work for you well.<br><br>Maybe it is genetic ...maybe not .

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like you have either allergic or vasomotor rhinitis. Housedust mites are a common cause of the former but I trust you have already made sure your beddings are clean and dust free. Vasomotor rhinitis is common (I have it too) and it tends to be worse with change in temperature, humidity etc.<br><br>I presume you have been using a pseudoephedrine-type nasal spray. Nasal decongestants are known to give temporary relief but you can get a rebound stuffiness after that. If you need a nasal spray, an antihistamine is better than a decongestant. I prefer to use an oral decongestant/antihistamine. Your doctor will be able to help you select the most appropriate one based on your response.<br><br></div>
