But if some simpleton actually really takes some of the advice seriously given by any of the moderators as qualified advice,    and something happens really wrongly -  the moderators are actually liable for giving the wrong advice  as well as the whole sgforum,  and if any of them are registered - they can lose their registration as well  . I saw the query section of taking age and questions and some history as well as PMs- frankly that is dangerous - you need to be able to palpate , ascultate the patient , see them in person before even giving a diagnosis or even a differential diagnosis.<br><br>For example , A panic attack can show the symptoms of a heart attack , and a heart attack in  a person with panic attacks can be REAL. You need an ECG , CK/TROP serials to actually make a diagnosis . Not guess from the question put forth. Even telemedicine has its limits - paramedics get the call and they HAVE to go see the person to ascertain if it is life threatening or not.<br><br>Asking for clarification on medical problems is fine . Certainly not giving the public wrong information , like  in the BCG column . Any practitioner will know BCG is effective in preventing TB meningitis and miliary disease in children but not in the cases of adult pulmonary tb and we have one moderator who and I quote<br><br><blockquote>Yes, it's against TB. BCG vaccination has been shown to give 70%-80% protection against TB. Atleast in the past time. If the effectivness would be only 5%, it wouldn't help to lower the number of TB cases so drastically in all countries where this vaccination has been used.<br><br>Nowdays new and resistant strains of TB appear, it can be that those are resistant even against this vaccination. </blockquote>That is wrong - VERY WRONG. MDR TB is resistant to the TB drugs , rifampicin , streptomycin etc - it cannot be assumed to be resistant against the vax .  BCG can be assumed to have  been paramount in protecting children against TB meningitis  but not adults. Even it has varying protection in individuals ( 0-76%) and no one actually knows why.   It was sanitation , medication and healthcare access as well as nutrition that helped curbed TB down. In USA , they have a problem with MDR TB but it cannot be assumed that the vaccine is ineffective against TB.  It is medication non compliance , poor healthcare access ( they use HMOs there and poor don't get much healthcare) as well as HIV ( due to poor immune system of an individual - bacterial growth heaven is there) . It can be due to other strains but they won't be new and resistant - it is a varying genome in the bacteria in parts of the world. Check the CDC site if you don't believe it.<br><br>There should be a disclaimer about them not being responsible should people take them seriously and to actually see a qualified doctor if they feel something is really wrong . I understand it is out of their kindness they want to help people in their health but sometimes , no good deed goes unpunished.<br><br>Just legalities .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like it or not , it will be an issue of information and public  safety . Even mayo clinic has a disclaimer on its website. This one doesn't have a huge public disclaimer  as required by any reputable practitioner who does medical Q &amp; A . The virtual clinic already suggests that this forum is ran by qualified medical /healthcare professionals  .  I don't even think thinkdifferent is qualified to even answer some of the questions - judging by her answers and plus the mommy thing . For the rest of the moderators, I have  fair enough a respect for how they answer , like renorenal .  But I think he may need to put up a disclaimer to protect himself , just in case another moderator makes a big boohoo of an answer.<br><br>I am just asking about the credentials of the moderators who are taking on questions which is way beyond the scope of a layman .  You might as well take the advice of the local gossip /fishmonger if you cannot establish who the moderators are.<br><br>Like it or not , there might actually be a someone  who actually may take advice as a diagnosis here . Not everyone will approach a doctor at all times. I am questioning this forum because I am concerned as a member of the public  and I seen some patients WHO actually believed somethings said on other websites - it is patient safety I am talking about.

Though I am not working, I know the ethics of the computer world, much like you doctors have medical ethics to follow. Asking me to check IP address to be sure that you are not a clone is not right.

The virtual clinic already suggests that this forum is ran by qualified medical /healthcare professionals  .  I don't even think thinkdifferent is qualified to even answer some of the questions - judging by her answers and plus the mommy thing .

That's what I have to say. Even over the counter drugs also warn you to consult a doctor before taking. This applies to forums as well.</div>

MDR TB is resistant to the TB drugs , rifampicin , streptomycin etc - it cannot be assumed to be resistant against the vax .  BCG can be assumed to have  been paramount in protecting children against TB meningitis  but not adults. Even it has varying protection in individuals ( 0-76%) and no one actually knows why.   It was sanitation , medication and healthcare access as well as nutrition that helped curbed TB down. In USA , they have a problem with MDR TB but it cannot be assumed that the vaccine is ineffective against TB.  It is medication non compliance , poor healthcare access ( they use HMOs there and poor don't get much healthcare) as well as HIV ( due to poor immune system of an individual - bacterial growth heaven is there) . It can be due to other strains but they won't be new and resistant - it is a varying genome in the bacteria in parts of the world. Check the CDC site if you don't believe it.<br><br>There should be a disclaimer about them not being responsible should people take them seriously and to actually see a qualified doctor if they feel something is really wrong .

There should be a disclaimer posted here after every medical advise given by the moderators to protect and imdemnify themselves. I know that the moderator's intentions are good, but there are certain things which may be beyond their control.</div>
