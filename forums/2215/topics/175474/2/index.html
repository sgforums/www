As much as I may like explaining to patients when I was working in Singapore - I just don't have the time to do so . Other patients have needs too and they all need to be prioritised . Most of the time , paying patients want to hear from the doctors instead of the nurses so we just let the doctors talk to them .  The ratio in Singapore is considered high and unsafe in australia . one registered nurse and one enrolled nurse ( who cannot do much at all) to 12 patients and even sometimes 18 and once 24 patients if the colleague calls in sick. I have taken 18 patients myself back then and the enrolled nurse could only help out as much but just not with dressings, medications , paperwork or even just cleaning an iv site which looks extremely bloody.  Even had a patient who can walk around call the callbell for me to flush her toilet because she "paid for the service" in Singapore.<br><br>Yes there may be some who cannot be bothered to explain but most are really swamped over by work .<br><br>We have a lower ratio here so we can actually explain things. 6 patients at most to one registered nurse here .

I am a registered nurse in the state of VIC and NSW ,Australia - training done in Singapore and was originally registered in SIngapore but cannot be arsed to pay registration fees for a place I don't work in  . Why do these countries even bother to register us nurses if any tom/dick/harry can do the job? So surely we must know something , right? So state your depth of medical knowledge and please don't tell me you took things word for word from Harrison's Book of Internal Medicine  .<br><br>In the first place , asking mommy is not a good idea even if she is a doctor . Your mother is qualified so she can speak for herself and bear the responsibility on her own registration if something goes wrong. You can't .<br><br>If you are a medical student or even a nursing/allied health student , you should know that refereed MEDICAL articles are available on Medline database and OVID, Web of Knowledge ISI  database . Those are researched publications and you must also know how to judge the data to deem it accurate.

But General RULE when we all started off as students in medicine/nursing/allied health - if unsure, don't do it . If you are busy , don't answer then if you are going to make a big boohoo of an answer. No one is going to blame you if you don't say a thing. Right?<br><br>There was an intern aka houseman who was so busy that he told my mom the wrong thing in a very rude way  - of course I made a complaint because my mom was crying for the whole day thinking she has cancer when she has gastritis only .<br><br>I would not have complained if he actually told my mom that he was busy and would check when he is free .  I could have made things worse for the intern since the hospital can actually be sued  for misinformation  ( learn vicarious liability) and make him get a mark on his employment but I didn't . I guessed he was busy when he made such a stupid comment . That was in Singapore when this happened. In Australia , the families actually sue hospitals plus the staff . Not as bad as USA but bad enough .<br><br>If you want to do things , do it right for the first time.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I will tell the others mods to tell everyone to visit a doc anyway as you said that some of the patients don't go to a doc and rely on the internet and also tell them to think of some disclaimer.

I answer on my own right and as a member of the public.  Sometimes he can be blunt but I can accept it .<br><br>Maybe you should read what I said about how my patient told me about the internet - how he delayed treatment and how he died on us  a few days later. This is kind of thing you don't forget . None of my colleagues ever forgot the look on his face and how he bled to death  - via vomiting  while we were trying to stop him from bleeding out by running Hartmann's and blood as fast as possible via 3 Intravenous lines plus NG tube him for decompression which inturn clotted up quickly and had to be pulled out .  That was a man who thought he had gastritis only via researching some quack website and had instead a few perforated gastric ulcers which never gave him much of a sign except a gnawing pain ,except for the increasing burning pain when they preforated...he was in the hospital when he was admitted because the gastroenterologist got a strong suspicion about his gastric ulcers before the perforation started. One is bad enough but this guy had  4 of them inside . Small ones plus a big one at the body of the stomach.<br><br>Can you imagine how his family felt?<br><br>That is why I think for the sake of the moderators and others - to put up a clear disclaimer .</div>

Though I wasn't allowed to study medicine and was forced to study something else, I took some courses like anatomy or forensic medicine and finished them with exams. Due to my multiple interests I took courses also in some other fields beside my main major and had also exams (also in psychology, though your friend may laugh when you tell him). Currently still studying, being busy due to overload of study.<br><br>As I said, I am an assistant to the 2 docs here, they supervise what I post, but currently non of them is able to log in, I don't know for how long.<br>As for the legal point of view of what we are doing here - I am also in the legal field, I know what we can do and what we can't do.<br><br>I will tell the other mods about the disclaimer, but I have to wait till they are back.</div></blockquote>Don't give me the anything you do I can do better than you answer.  It sounds rather defensive . Anyone in the legal or medical field would know oncology is not spelt as onkology. However if you want to put it out this way , I can do so too<br><br>I dare to put out my background because I got the gumptions to do so .  7 years of the nursing profession my dear not including nursing training which makes it 10  . Neurosurgical HIGH DEPENDENCY ( ever called a neurosurgeon in the middle of the night before because the intern can't deal with his patient and the reg is busy in theatre ?) , general surgical , surgical scrub , medical nursing , gastroenterology , trauma . Rotated all around in my training years as well when I became a registered nurse.  but then SO WHAT?<br><br>My father is a lawyer , his friends are lawyers and I also did some work for them . DOES THAT MAKE ME A LAWYER? Or qualified to be answering any legal questions?<br><br>His best friend is a doctor - his best friend's wife used to baby sit me and yes I also like you , read medical books when I was young. My mom wanted to be a nurse but got married so she has alot of medical books as well as  nursing .<br>His old classmates from RI are still his friends and are consultants as well as HODs in various hospitals.  BUT SO WHAT?  Does that make me a doctor? Nope<br><br>My GAMSAT score was 72 raw - 86th percentile . I got into Graduate Medical School in Australia after finishing my nursing degree ( hey I was like you - couldn't get into Medicine in Singapore because I chose the polytechnic route) but dad said I have to choose between housing or medicine and I pay for my own accomodation etc because my mom was upset with me trying to leave nursing - I chose my apartment which he helped to pay half of - the other I am paying  the banks "rent" . The only smartest financial decision I ever made. SO WHAT? Still doesn't make me a doctor.<br><br>Anna , my ex colleague in australia  , was a third year medical student who decided to switch to  nursing because she liked what nurses did . Even she won't talk like you do . None of the interns in hospital has the arrogance like you have and they have their registration. I have mine to boot .Even the registrars whom I knew when they were interns , don't even have YOUR DEMEANOR.<br><br>What you MEAN you didn't know? Nurses also study pharmacology , biochemistry , pathophysiology, anatomy ( we did have parts of cadavers to look at) , sociology , psychology , research methods , nursing skills. I just happen to do my postgrad in Master of Public Health - any of your friendly doctors will tell you what it entails because if they want to be registered in australia in the royal college of public health physicians , they need that . BUT that doesn't make me more a ""doctor" than you . I am a nurse.  Yes I have written research protocols . Yes I was encouraged to publish .<br><br>Hippo what? Those ancient greek therapy things? That is alternative medicine . Writing about alternative medicine like homeopathy and hippo therapy - any person can fake it . You need clinical trials - RCTs ...go read up what it is since you are so great , to prove a treatment work and so far , not many RCTS are done  in alternative medicine . Chinese medicine is a different story - it has been proven for centuries so they are doing research on the effectiveness of acupuncture. If I wasn't wrong - at one stage they were researching the effectiveness of acupuncture on bell palsy in SGH .<br><br>Moral of the story : you can talk how great you are about passing exams ( i can perfectly memorise the whole damn book of law and pass it and call myself a lawyer but that doesn't MAKE ME ONE)  - That's theory  but you have no practical and therefore you cannot say anything more than to direct people to websites where QUALIFIED PRACTITIONERS ARE.  YOU ARE NOT REGISTERED TO PRACTICE IN ANY MEDICAL /HEALTHCARE FIELD. END OF STORY .<br><br></div>

All I care is the sincerity in the replies, the sincerity that one wants to help.<br><br>It is just like repairing computers. Does one need credentials to do so? As long as you can do it, who cares? Probably you care. I don't. All I want is the symptoms to be lessened and hopefully cured.<br><br>I don't have any credentials of being an IT expert, and neither does any of the moderators over at the IT Helpdesk that we set up has one. If forumers don't trust us, would they come to us? Talking about qualifications, do we need to show one? I have transferred course, no longer doing a diploma in IT. Does that mean I can't repair computers because I don't have a diploma in IT? I've got experience in dealing with computers. Obviously not those high levels one like network problems. But simple ones like viruses, spyware, computer crashing, etc... if people can't solve them by the conventional methods, we can help. And no credentials needed and problem is solved. Computers may not be humans, but like diagnosing illnesses, we need the full description of problems before we can solve. And I admit that I can't solve everything.<br><br>The same goes for this medical forum. If I don't trust them, I wouldn't have come. Their medical knowledge, as far as I know, don't contradict with what I read and what doctors have been telling me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was doing clinical trials for hippotherapy and other needed things which a research requires for 3 years before I wrote the research work.<br>Anyway, I don't  want to argue anymore, I am really tired of it. ndmmxiaomayi is right. We will put some disclaimer when the other mods are back and I can discuss it with them and if it makes you feel happy and able to sleep peacefully again, I suggest the mods my resignation. As for the oncology - onkology - there is a simple explanation why I wrote k instead of c (one reason is me being exhausted and not concentrated) but that belongs to the things I don't want to reveal. I don't want to argue anymore therefore I lock this thread.<br><br>ndmmxiaomayi you seem to be the only reasonable person in this thread.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
