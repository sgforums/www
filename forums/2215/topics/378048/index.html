              In my last column ("<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2229523/">Give Us Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Big Fat Asses …</a>"),
                              I argued that obesity can also make us poor individually, since fat
                              people face rampant discrimination on the job and marriage markets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A <a href="http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v17/n5/full/oby2008636a.html">recent paper</a> from Yale's Rudd Center for Food Policy &amp; Obesity hints at the
                              scope of this anti-fat prejudice. We know, for example, that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2002-09-04-overweight-pay-bias_x.htm">if you're fat, you make less money</a>.
                              Lots of studies have shown how body size plays out in the working
                              world: According to one, women who are two standard deviations (or 64
                              pounds) overweight suffer a wage penalty of <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/efan04004/efan04004f.pdf">9 percent</a> (PDF); another found that severely obese white women lose out on <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/w81nh7q7n2455314/">one-quarter of their potential income</a>.
                              There's also evidence that obese women are less likely to attend
                              college or maintain romantic relationships, even controlling for
                              socioeconomic background.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Heavy
                              people may face discrimination in medical settings, too. The authors of
                              the review, Rebecca Puhl and Chelsea Heuer, cite numerous surveys of
                              anti-fat attitudes among health care workers, who tend to see obese
                              patients as <a href="http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v11/n10/full/oby2003161a.html">ugly, lazy, weak-willed, and lacking in motivation</a> to improve their health. Doctors describe treating fatties as <a href="http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v25/n8/fig_tab/0801681t2.html">a waste of time</a>, and the staff at teaching hospitals appear to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16639201">single them out for derogatory jokes</a>. Unsurprisingly, many obese people avoid seeing their primary care providers altogether, and those who do are <a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/132/9/697-a">less likely to be screened</a> for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. (That's true even among those with health insurance and college degrees.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These
                              data points suggest a rather simple approach to America's obesity
                              problem: Stop hating. If we weren't such unrepentant body bigots, fat
                              people might earn more money, stay in school, and receive better
                              medical care in hospitals and doctor's offices. All that would go a
                              long way toward mitigating the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html">health effects</a> of excess weight—and its <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/short/hlthaff.28.5.w822">putative costs</a>.
                              But there's an even better reason to think that America's glutton
                              intolerance is a threat to public health and the federal budget. Recent
                              epidemiological research implies that the shame of being obese poses
                              its own medical risk. Mental anguish harms the body; weight stigma can
                              break your heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The victims of chronic stress or depression,
                              whatever their size, tend to maintain higher levels of certain
                              inflammatory chemicals in their bloodstream. Under normal
                              circumstances—and over the short term—these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine">cytokines</a> help to control the body's response to dangerous situations like injury
                              or illness. The chemicals create their own problems, though, when they
                              stick around too long. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allostatic_load">sustained or elevated stress response</a> seems to increase your risk of heart disease, hypertension, and
                              diabetes. That may explain some of the relationships between health and
                              wealth: Blood tests show unusual cytokine activity among those of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12480506">low socioeconomic status</a> as well as patients with <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19319993">post-traumatic stress and panic disorders</a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It
                              turns out that obese people have unusual cytokine readings, too, and
                              these are often taken as the cause of weight-related illness. According
                              to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome#Pathophysiology">one theory</a>,
                              the presence of visceral fat cells can set off a biochemical chain
                              reaction that leads to the inflammatory response. (Fat cells may even
                              secrete the cytokines themselves.) As a result, someone who's fat and
                              someone who's chronically stressed will be at risk for many of the same
                              diseases.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It may be that obesity and stress are independent risk
                              factors that happen to affect the body in similar ways. Or maybe
                              chronic stress <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12119665">leads to weight gain</a>,
                              which in turn causes inflammation. According to epidemiologist Peter
                              Muennig, there's another pathway from excess weight to disease. In his
                              2008 paper "<a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2386473">The Body Politic: The Relationship Between Stigma and Obesity-Associated Disease</a>,"
                              Muennig argues that the stress and shame of being fat causes those
                              cytokine abnormalities. In other words, obesity makes you sick by
                              stressing you out.
              
              </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to Muennig's theory, the health effects of obesity should vary with the
                              intensity of anti-fat bias—the more abuse you take, the worse the
                              disease. Women are more likely than men to <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/67269/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0">have eating disorders</a>, and they face <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/w81nh7q7n2455314/">greater weight-based discrimination</a> in the overweight range. (According to Puhl, men get harsher treatment when they're really obese.) And, sure enough, women are <a href="http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/full/96/9/1662/T2">seven times more likely</a> to experience <a href="http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/full/96/9/1662">significant illness or death</a> as a result of being overweight. (Obese women are <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080111203750.htm">especially vulnerable</a> to clinical depression, which is itself a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.)</p>
