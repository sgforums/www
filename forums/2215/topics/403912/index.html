              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/scale320240.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-24743" title="scale320240" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/scale320240.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"></a>“If you are fat, how do you teach patients?” asks nurse Rajaletchumi Raja Singam.</p>
              <p>Discriminatory words like hers are not uncommon.  In fact, subtle and invidious discrimination against people who are overweight happens at all levels of society, and they ruin people’s lives.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.lindabacon.org/"><span style="color: #16387c;">Professor Linda Bacon</span></a>, who is a specialist in food and sustainability and an advocate for Health for Every Size movement,  says that research supports that you can be both healthy and overweight.</p>
              <p>In her book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Health-Every-Size-Surprising-Weight/dp/1933771585"><span style="color: #16387c;">Health at Every Size</span></a>”, she says, ”No obesity myth is more potent than the one that says obesity kills. It gives us permission to call our fear of fat a health concern, rather than naming it as the cultural oppression it is. That ‘obesity kills’ has been the backbone of the [U.S] federal public health campaign. Yet that is not supported by evidence examined by federal employees. Their research found that ‘even severe obesity failed to show up as a statistically significant mortality risk’ and suggested that overweight may actually be protective…The most comprehensive review, for instance, pooled data from 26 studies and concluded that overweight individuals were living slightly longer than those of normal weight.”</p>
              <p>Although the etymology of the word ‘obese’ means, “that has eaten itself fat”, that is not the truth; for people who are in the ‘obese’ category very often do not eat any differently from people in the ‘normal’ category.</p>
              <p>In a culture where people are pre-occupied with food and weight and with the constant message going out (even from well meaning healthcare professionals) that you need to be trim to be fit, instead of emphasising on being healthy, there is a lot of bashing going on, right from the schools to the places of work.</p>
              <p>Even the chief executive of Alexandra Health Group (the healthcare group which manages Alexandra Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital) Mr Liak Teng Lit, equated being trim to being healthy.  <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC100619-0000080/Hospital-staff-must-walk-the-talk"><span style="color: #16387c;">He recently said, “[If you are overweight) you are going to fall sick”.</span></a></p>
              <p>He says that he will use ‘weight’ as a key performance indicator (KPI) for the staff in the hospitals managed by him and that overweight staff will not be promoted.</p>
              <p>This KPI adds further stress to the staff in the hospital (many of whom are women) who juggle shift work, family commitments and societal pressures.</p>
              <p>I asked Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) if it had a view on the KPI set by Alexandra Health Group for its staff’s promotion. AWARE responded that in its view, this practice of the health group is clearly discriminatory and unacceptable.</p>
              <p>Ms Corinna Lim, the Executive Director of AWARE says, “If the hospitals wish to implement such an unusual policy, the onus is on them to substantiate and justify this.”</p>
              <p>Ms Lim further asserted that the health-group has to show – as a matter of fact – that weight and body-shape generally affect work performance or pose a health-risk to the individual and their families, if the health group insists on using body weight of staff as a KPI.</p>
              <p>“If so, are the hospitals applying similar considerations to individuals with other types of health risks such as smoking or who suffer from insomnia?” she asks.</p>
              <p>This KPI she feels sets a very bad precedent not just for the health-care industry, but also for the country, for if it is accepted as a precedent, “then one can stretch it to every health care establishment in the country and to any other job where there is greater exposure to germs (e.g. cinemas, shopping centres, toilets).”</p>
              <p>“What are the job specifications of hospital staff?” she asks.  “Is it to promote healthy living or to take care of sick patients when they check in? Surely, what a patient is looking for is caring and competent staff, be they fat, thin or otherwise”, she adds.</p>
              <p>‘Being trim equals being fit’ is a cultural idea that has been repeated so many times and has spread so swiftly that it has become part of our belief system.  We are led to belief so strongly that being fat is killing us that we lose our open-mindedness and we see everything only through this lens.</p>
              <p>The fact is, there are plenty of thin people who are making very bad health choices and don’t gain weight, as their bodies are genetically predisposed another way.</p>
              <p>It is simply not true that everyone who is overweight has poor lifestyle habits.</p>

              <p><strong>Would this type of "wordings" be classified as discrimination in the states?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Is it an offence in US?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If so, what is the penalty like?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>To some, "this" looked more of personal attack!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>From, chearper, better, faster and more productive - it pinpoint at people physical appearance and not ability to perform.</strong></p>

              <p>Its a very interesting topics because there are differences between obesity vs over weight. There are also questions to ask....such as obesity a diease or lifestyle choice?</p>
              <p>Over weight is not necessary an impediment to person knowledge and skill to be in healthcare field.  </p>
              <p>and the ultimate question that lead to this question.......... do you still think our health minister has the credibility to lead?</p>

              <p>In an extensive interview with the Chinese paper Lianhe Zaobao, <strong>PAP Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan </strong>revealed that he has thought of retirement after <strong>his heart bypass surgery to take a life a bit more slowly.</strong></p>
              <p><em>“At that time, I was thinking, perhaps I can retire like that and use my remaining time to enjoy natural scenery. After such a major operation, this notion was definitely very appealing,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>However, he later changed his mind after reading the Chinese prose anthology Gu Wen Guan Zhi and learn about how “men of virtue” had always done their best to serve the people.</p>
              <p><em>“But later, I asked myself, is this way of thinking correct? Heaven gave me a new lease of life – not for enjoyment, but to let me help more people.”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Khaw’s “help” does not come cheap to Singaporeans. He is paid about $2 million dollars a year, more than 4 times the annual salary of U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>Since Mr Khaw is so devoted to serving Singaporeans, perhaps he can consider working for free without expecting anything in return like the sages of ancient China.</p>
              <p>A Malaysian by birth, Mr Khaw sparked a massive outcry last year when he appeared to encourage Singaporeans who cannot afford chronic nursing care in Singapore to send their aged parents to nursing homes in Johor.</p>
              <p>He later backtracked and claimed that he was “misquoted’ by the press.</p>

              <h2><a title="Permanent Link to Khaw Boon Wan to postpone retirement as he wants to &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; more people" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/06/30/khaw-boon-wan-to-postpone-retirement-as-he-wants-to-help-more-people/"><span style="color: #778888;">Khaw Boon Wan to postpone retirement as he wants to “help” more people</span></a></h2>
              <p>In an extensive interview with the Chinese paper Lianhe Zaobao, <strong>PAP Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan</strong> revealed that he has thought of retirement after <strong>his heart bypass surgery to take a life a bit more slowly.</strong></p>
              <p><em>“At that time, I was thinking, perhaps I can retire like that and use my remaining time to enjoy natural scenery. After such a major operation, this notion was definitely very appealing,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>However, he later changed his mind after reading the Chinese prose anthology Gu Wen Guan Zhi and learn about how “men of virtue” had always done their best to serve the people.</p>
              <p><em>“But later, I asked myself, is this way of thinking correct? Heaven gave me a new lease of life – not for enjoyment, but to let me help more people.”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Khaw’s “help” does not come cheap to Singaporeans. He is paid about $2 million dollars a year, more than 4 times the annual salary of U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>Since Mr Khaw is so devoted to serving Singaporeans, perhaps he can consider working for free without expecting anything in return like the sages of ancient China.</p>
              <p>A Malaysian by birth, Mr Khaw sparked a massive outcry last year when he appeared to encourage Singaporeans who cannot afford chronic nursing care in Singapore to send their aged parents to nursing homes in Johor.</p>
              <p>He later backtracked and claimed that he was “misquoted’ by the press.</p>
