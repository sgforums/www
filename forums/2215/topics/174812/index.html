And if you are above 50 and feels like gastritis  ( pain happens in the middle of your tummy) - go see the doctor as well  . Get short of breath and then chest pain on exercise or after - go see the doctor.<br><br>Have you been under stress lately? Any history of gastritis? Sometimes it could be those if you are reasonable young ( below 30) .<br><br>Does the pain hurt more when you breathe in deeply and doesn't hurt when u breath out - that could be just a rub in between the ribs and ur pleura ( lung covering) or just the muscular pain around that region - nothing much you can do about that .

Sometimes we may put a patient on a continuous ECG monitoring device which he can carry around like a pager. We will then be able to detect transient arrhythmia that might have resolved by the time the patient sees the doctor.</div>
