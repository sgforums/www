This medicine supposed to take BEFORE food,at least 1 hour before,not after,you take after it would hardly have any effect at all.No wonder the stitches did not help you'.I was really shocked.<br><br>I came home and went to the net and googled Co-Amoxiclav and came across the website <a href="http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/30003152/" rel="nofollow">http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/30003152/</a>.Imagine my pain now,wound still raw,so much pain i am in.All thanks to SGH.I wonder how it is for other patients with even more serious infections.<br><br>Below is the pic of my medicine lable.It is abit blurred but can be seen.<br><br><a href="http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z173/anfieldroad_2007/as.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z173/anfieldroad_2007/as.jpg</a></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<br><strong>The TS received an antibiotic that combines two drugs, amoxicillin (a type of penicillin) and clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The latter inhibits the breakdown of amoxicillin by some bacteria that are resistant through the production of lactamase, an enzyme that breaks down the antibiotic.<br>This combination is effective against a wide range of bacteria and has been used for more than a decade.<br><br>As for the pharmacokinetics,  amoxicillin has greater oral bioavailability compared to PenV and ampicillin. This is what the FDA says:<br><br>"Approximately 74-92% of a single dose of amoxicillin is absorbed while approximately 60-70% of an oral penicillin V dose and 30-55% of an oral ampicillin dose are absorbed. Peak serum amoxicillin concentrations (Cmax) are reached 1-2 hours after an oral dose of the capsules, film-coated tablets, chewable tablets, or oral suspension [b]in fasting and non-fasting adults</strong>. Non-linearity in absorption of amoxicillin has been reported when increasing doses of 250mg, 500mg, and 1000mg of amoxicillin were administered to fasting adults. A significant reduction in the percentage of the dose absorbed was observed for the 1000mg dose (5)."<br>(<a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/amox-anthrax.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/amox-anthrax.htm</a>)<br><br>The clavulanic acid component is shown not to interfere with the absorption of amoxicillin and vice versa. However, oral absorption of clavulanic acid can be highly variable (<a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14518475" rel="nofollow">http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14518475</a>).<br><br>The bio-availability of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination has been shown to be unaffected by food. Here's an abstract of a study done to address this very question:<br><br>"AugmentinÂ’, the novel antibiotic formulation containing the ÃŸ-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, and the -lactam antibiotic, amoxycillin, has been the subject of two studies reported here on bioavailability and tolerance.<br><br>Eighteen subjects took part in a two-part crossover study to compare the bioavailability when taken fasting and with food. <strong>The bioavailability was shown to be unimpaired when taken with food</strong>.<br><br>Forty-five healthy subjects took part in a series of crossover studies to compare the tolerance of Â‘AugmentinÂ’ taken fasting and with food. Â‘AugmentinÂ’ was also compared with cephalexin under the same conditions. <strong>The gastro-intestinal side effects reported in these volunteer studies, which are rare in clinical practice, were reduced when Â‘AugmentinÂ’ was taken with food.</strong> "<br><br>(Staniforth DH, Lillystone RJ, Jackson D.  Effect of food on the bioavailability and tolerance of clavulanic acid/amoxycillin combination. Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (1982) 10, 131-139)<br><br>In other words, this antibiotic combination can be taken either before or after meals. It does not matter to the bioavailability. However, because some people get tummy upset as a side effect of this antibiotic, the recommendation is to take it with food to reduce that side effect.<br><br>There are many reasons why the antibiotic did not work as well as it did. First, the bacteria may not be sensitive to the antibiotic. Perhaps the wound was infected with a bacteria that is not sensitive to this antibiotic or surgical debridement is needed. The medication the TS received sounds like a generic rather than Augmentin (the original 'branded' drug). Depending on where it was manufactured, the formulation and bioavailability may differ.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha...shows how desperate this lot are. Having been humiliated time and again in debates at Speakers Corner they now launch personal attacks in a totatlly unrelared forum. I can delete their posts but no, I would rather let their antics demonstrate why Singaporeans are not ready for western-style democracy. If the Opposition parties are composed of folks like these, it's no wonder they have lost and will keep losing general elections. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
