              <p>FDA is quick to approve risky drugs with little evidence to show they 
              work but refused to recognize a herbal tea that Native Americans have 
              used to fight cancer.<br> <br> This all-natural cancer fighter has almost 100 years of medical research showing it works.<br> <br> It was first investigated by a Canadian nurse called Rene Caisse back in
               1922. Her aunt had stomach cancer and given six months to live.<br> <br> Caisse started treating her aunt with the tea and lived another 21 years, cancer free.<br> <br> She tested the treatment on her mother after she was diagnosed with 
              cancer. She was given just weeks to live but her mother went on to live a
               cancer-free life for the next 18 years.<br> <br> It was the beginning of 30 years of research.<br> <br> The original formula mixed eight different herbs including:<br> <br> * Blessed thistle<br> * Burdock root<br> * Indian rhubarb root<br> * Kelp<br> * Sheep sorrel<br> * Slippery elm inner bark<br> * Red clover<br> * Watercress<br> <br> After experimentation, she refined her formula to burdock root, Indian 
              rhubarb, sheep sorrel, and slippery elm. And she called her formula 
              Essiac.<br> <br> Government Threatens Imprisonment<br> <br> Caisse opened a cancer clinic and - under the observation of several 
              doctors - went on to treat thousands of cancer patients. All treatments 
              were free and the results were so good that 55,000 people signed a 
              petition in 1938. The petition requested the Ontario legislation 
              recognize Essiac.<br> <br> The bill failed to pass by just three votes. Within a week of filing the
               petition, a new "Cancer Commission" was introduced. This commission had
               the power to control and suppress all future cancer treatments.<br> <br> The Commission suppressed her research. They threatened to imprison her 
              and forced her to close down her Bracebridge Cancer Clinic in the summer
               of 1938.<br> <br> She closed her clinic and partnered with Dr. Charles Brusch. They 
              treated patients with the same eight-herb tea, just as the Native 
              Americans had originally done. Dr. Brusch eventually used Essiac in his 
              own fight against cancer.<br> <br> Two recent studies have shown that Essiac does combat cancer effectively.<br> <br> The first study, in 2004, showed that Essiac inhibits tumor cell growth -
               and enhances immune response. The second study, in 2006, further backed
               this up. It revealed that Essiac increases cytotoxicity towards 
              prostate cancer cells and has huge antioxidant properties.<br> <br> And there are plenty of modern doctors who also support it.<br> <br> "I've seen the effects of Essiac first hand," says Allen Spreen, MD.<br> <br> Dr. Spreen describes how he treated a father with a 13-year-old son. The
               son had cancer so bad that the only option was experimental 
              chemotherapy. Even with treatment, he was likely to lose the leg that 
              had the cancer.<br> <br> Dr. Spreen told him about Essiac and all the studies and research he'd 
              read on it. Desperate for his boy, the father left the US and went to 
              Canada to seek a cure.<br> <br> Three years later, Dr. Spreen was shocked to find a healthy, 16-year-old
               man in his office. It was the boy, returning briefly from Canada where 
              he now lived with his father. He'd returned to say thanks to Dr. Spreen 
              and to tell him that Essiac alone had saved his leg - and likely his 
              life.<br> <br> 4 Herbs Combat Cancer<br> <br> Nurse Caisse's formula used four herbs to fight cancer. These included:<br> <br> Burdock Root: Hungarian researchers showed that Burdock Root had 
              anti-tumor activity due to inulin. The researchers found that it 
              attached to white blood cells and enhanced immune function. They showed 
              it also contains benzaledhyde which has significant anti-cancer effects 
              in humans.<br> <br> Sheep Sorrel: This was used in cancer treatment as early as the 1740s. It contains chlorophyll, which carries oxygen to cells.<br> <br> Slippery Elm: Studies have shown this herb offers anti-tumor activity and is an anti-inflammatory agent.<br> <br> Indian Rhubarb Root: Rich in iron, this herb purges the liver and body 
              of waste. It contains aloe emodin which studies show inhibit tumors.<br> <br> Suppressed Formula Revealed At Last<br> <br> Nurse Caisse and Dr. Brusch spent decades refining the Essiac recipe. 
              They created the formula through years of experimentation on real cancer
               patients. And this is the suppressed formula they came up with.<br> <br> * Six-and-a-half cups of burdock root<br> * One pound of sheep sorrel, powdered<br> * One-quarter pound of slippery elm bark, powdered<br> * One ounce of Turkish rhubarb root, powdered<br> <br> Mix the ingredients and store in a glass jar in a dark cupboard. Use one
               ounce of herb mixture per 32 ounces of water. Boil rapidly for 10 
              minutes (covered). Turn off heat and leave overnight (covered).<br> <br> In the morning, heat until steaming hot and let settle for three 
              minutes. Strain through a fine strainer into hot sterilized bottles and 
              let cool. Store in a dark, cool cupboard.<br> <br> Tea must be refrigerated after opening.</p>
