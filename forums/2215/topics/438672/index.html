              The service standard at Government hospitals and Polyclinics have improved significantly over the past twenty years. I have some pleasant experience and bad experience at Government Hospitals and Polyclinics.
              
              Pleasant Experience
              Most of the staff at the service counter are helpful and friendly. They are courteous and they provide prompt service. The doctors are caring and experienced. They are sincere and they showed respect to their patients. The nurses are also helpful, friendly and experienced.
              
              Bad Experience
              I had a bad experience when I went to T.T.S.H in 2006. I knocked on the door before I entered the consultation room. I greeted the senior consultant and sat at the chair next to him. He gave me a very cold look and asked: "What is your problem?"
              
              Recently, I went to a polyclinic. I had a bad experience with a nursing staff. I was directed by a doctor to do a blood test at a clinical room. I knocked on the door and entered the room. I saw two staff chit chatting. I told them I was there for a blood test test. One of the staff replied: "Wait Outside!"
              
              These are some of my experience at government Hospitals and Polyclinics. Please share your experience.

              <p>Last time when I was not feeling well, I went to the nearest polyclinic early in the morning at 7.30am. The strange thing was... I was the number 50th in the queue because there were so many more people queuing up earlier than 7.30am. I have to wait till 8.30am before the doctor come <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was another time I had a wound infection. I went to the same polyclinic nearest to my house and I was there at 9am. I waited for the doctor for more than 1 hour and the doctor examined my wound the asked "Are you sure these wounds are not caused by fighting?" I of cos replied it's infection because of skin tears. That doctor is import from cheap country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The nearer incident I went to SGH. The staffs and doctors are very friendly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> I notice they hire a lot of old people and many of them do not look stress at all. They all look happy and enjoying their work. The waiting time for my doctor was 30mins.</p>

              <p>It is pretty common for doctors to be that way, hospitals know about it and doctors are told to be more approachable to patients.   </p>
              <p>I have feedback from FT dr that the doctors in the other country he work are actually caring, friendly and approachable.     Not sure if it has got to do with the sg culture.</p>

              Sometime in 2004, I was bitten by a stray dog while I was working in a forested terrain off Punggol Road. I was worried that I might get infected and therefore I went to A.M.K Polyclinic to seek medical attention. The doctor on duty was professional and caring.
              
              Thereafter I was sent to the dressing room. One nursing staff and three nursing trainees were in the room. The nursing staff was courteous. She asked me to take a seat. But instead of attending to me she continued to talk her trainees for about three to five minutes before she attends to me.
              
              I get my medical attention but I left with some disappointment. I asked myself. Is it because it is subsidized? That's why I am getting a "subsidized" service.

              A patient with chronic illness can make appointment at Polyclinc. The waiting time is about 30 to 45 minutes. The waiting time can be as long as 2 hours if the patient is a walk-in customer.
              
              Please do not visit a Polyclinc if you are really uncomfortable. 
              
              But there is problem in seeking medical attention at private clinic. Your medical bill will not be subsidized if you are referred to a government hospital for further medical treatment.
              
              So no choice but to wait and wait.

              <p>It is pretty common for doctors to be that way, hospitals know about it and doctors are told to be more approachable to patients.   </p>
              <p>I have feedback from FT dr that the doctors in the other country he work are actually caring, friendly and approachable.     Not sure if it has got to do with the sg culture.</p>

              <p>yes you are right. foreign doctors are more caring and empathetic than our local doctors. I read this in the ST article on survery on ethics about 1 year plus ago about the state of our local doctor education. the professor said the survey found that foreign doctors are more empathetic than local doctors, cos during their medical school, they were taught ethics and focused more on patient rather than the diseases. the survey found that local medical school did not focus much on ethics and the patient, hence it is recommended compulsory education on ethics and patient centric for medical students.</p>

              <p><br>A patient with chronic illness can make appointment at Polyclinc. The waiting time is about 30 to 45 minutes. The waiting time can be as long as 2 hours if the patient is a walk-in customer. Please do not visit a Polyclinc if you are really uncomfortable. But there is problem in seeking medical attention at private clinic. Your medical bill will not be subsidized if you are referred to a government hospital for further medical treatment. So no choice but to wait and wait. :)</p>

              <p>But it turn out to be queue 40, many old people are already queuing up.</p>

              <p><br>Yes. Those are pre-appointment.</p>
              <p>I think 80% of the patients at 7am have appointments at 8.30am.</p>
              <p>It happened to me before.</p>
