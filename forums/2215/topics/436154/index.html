              <p>In 1978, Dr. Hamer's son Dirk was mortally wounded in a shooting 
              accident and died 4 months later. Six months later Dr. Hamer was 
              diagnosed with testicular cancer. <br> <br> Dr. Hamer wondered if the shock of his son's accident may have triggered
               his cancer. While working in a large cancer clinic, he visited 
              testicular and ovarian cancer patients and noted that, prior to the 
              diagnosis, every patient has had a serious conflict, or loss of a loved 
              one.<br> <br> Dr. Hamer then noted on brain CT scans that every testicular and ovarian
               cancer patient had a dark spot in the same location.  He concluded that
               cancers and all diseases are triggered by unexpected shocks and 
              traumas. They can accumulate over years or even decades to manifest as 
              disease.<br> <br> Dr. Hamer operated a cancer clinic and was having phenomenal success with a 92% cure rate in well over 20,000 cases.  <br> <br> French oncologist Dr. Claude Sabbah then trained Dr Hamer in New German 
              Medicine (NGM). Dr. Sabbah quickly learned NGM and was having the same 
              success as Dr. Hamer.<br> <br> Many Jewish MDs were helping their Jewish clients with NGM. However, 
              they continued to use the dangerous and practically useless modern 
              therapies on their goy clients. Dr. Hamer protested this hypocrisy and 
              the Jewish community labels him as an anti-semite. <br> <br> Dr. Hamer has received official apologies from rabbis for the smear. 
              However the stain remains on the many Illuminati sponsored websites that
               disparage and denigrate Dr. Hamer.<br> <br> Various individuals and groups are plagiarizing  Dr. Hamer's  
              discoveries and failing to give him credit.  There are even some 
              Christian groups that bend and twist his work to fit Biblical scripture.
                <br> <br> <br> <br> "Thanks to Dr. Ryke Geerd Hamer for his extraordinary discoveries. They 
              will change the way we conceive of illness.  If we lived in a just 
              world, Dr Hamer should have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for
               his revolutionary work!" - Gilbert Renaud  Ph. D</p>
