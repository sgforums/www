            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>I just came to know about this forum, initially I've posted in Chit Chat about London Weight Management slimming sessions:<br><br>I felt very uncomfortable due to the burning sensation of the cream used in one session, whereby I was wrapped up in plastic and put under a thermal blanket.  After that, I felt very giddy.  The consultant denied that the treatment was the problem. Instead she told me that my detox diet (the plan recommended by London) was the problem and that I should at least eat some rice before going for the treatment. Fortunately, I declined the additional sessions because when I got home I felt itchiness on some parts of my skin and then rashes appear.<br><br>Would my health be seriously affected in the long run if I completed all 10 sessions (they promised to replace the cream)?<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=248313&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=248313&amp;page=0</a><br><br>Any advice will be appreciated.</div>

I have no idea how 'detox' works.</div>
