              <p>Vegetables and fruits are optional,not really important.Meats are more important and its a Must!!!Nowadays,i see alot of Chinese,especially those small kids n teenagers,and even adults.Skinny until like bamboo stick like that,how to bear children(for women)?How to defend our country if got war(for men)?They look like as if wind passby,they will get blown away.</p>
              <p>Dont listen to our PAP ministers urging Singaporeans to eat more fruits n vegetables,Gosh....just take a good look at them,who are smart-looking?And some ppl actually listen to those idiots n eat more vegetables n fruits and become "Skinny Vegetarians",LOL!!!</p>
              <p>Lou Lee last time look smart,now,he look like those bad guys in old cantonese drama.Keep laughing away,as if he has taken something from heaven.Many Singaporeans n foreigners even called him a senile old man lol.</p>
              <p>And Lou Goh,his appearance seems abit smart,but once he open his mouth n speak,ALAMAK,.....</p>
              <p>And Mah Boh Tan,he always look sleepy like that.As for the rest of Chinese PAP ministers,none are smart looking.No wonder they always get bully by the foreigners lol.</p>
              <p>I must say,this generation of Chinese are the worst i have ever seen(except opposition party members n myself).I dont know why,i have a Warrior figure,Tall and Smart-looking.And yet,i look around,only few Chinese are as good as me.I really dont know why.Perhaps,i am a democrats n a real talents in Singapore,thats why i dont get easily brainwashed by those Losers PAP Chinese ministers.</p>
              <p>Listen to my advice,Eat more Meats than Vegetables,its good for You!!!</p>
              <p>P.S.A sincere advice from a real talent Chinese Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Sorry for bumping such a thread from last year. I'd just like to enlighten you, since you seem to be a bit delirious when typing this.</p>
              <p><em>Vegetables and fruits are optional,not really important.Meats
                                      are more important and its a Must!!!</em></p>
              <p>While meat plays an important role in our diet, vegetables and fruits are <strong>not</strong> optional. Unless you want a nice case of constipation, coronary heart disease or certain types of cancers.</p>
              <p><em>Skinny until like bamboo stick like that,how to bear
                                      children(for women)?How to defend our country if got war(for
                                      men)?They look like as if wind passby,they will get blown away.</em></p>
              <p>Do look at some vegetarians around. If they know how to balance their diet, they wouldn't be too skinny, because if you haven't noticed, there are vegetarian alternatives for proteins and fats that are actually as effective as the meat you're urging everyone to consume.</p>
              <p><em>Dont listen to our PAP ministers urging Singaporeans to eat more
                                      fruits n vegetables,Gosh....just take a good look at
                                      them,who are smart-looking?And some ppl actually listen
                                      to those idiots n eat more vegetables n fruits and become "Skinny
                                      Vegetarians",LOL!!!</em></p>
              <p>Oh, please do listen to the advice given, as they are invaluable. They are smart-looking because they are smart too, and do realize that the people who actually listen to these ministers are healthier and look better than you, if you're practising what you advocate about meat. ;)</p>
              <p><em>only few Chinese are as good as me.I really dont know
                                      why.Perhaps,i am a democrats n a real talents in Singapore,thats

                                      ministers.</em></p>
              <p><em>Listen to my advice,Eat more Meats than Vegetables,its good for
                                      You!!!</em></p>
              <p><em>P.S.A sincere advice from a real talent Chinese
                                      Singaporeans.</em></p>
              <p>If you were a real talent, you would know what you're advocating is actually veering towards a lifestyle of pain and diseases. While you think you don't get brainwashed by ministers and such, you actually think you're smart enough to come up with your own dieting habits and preach to others the same. It's great to know that some Singaporeans are confident, but it's even greater to see how some make a complete fool out of themselves by advocating completely wrong and easily refutive content. If you'd like to know why vegetarians can have a balanced diet and not look skinny, yet look healthier and better than yourself, do notify me and I'd be glad to enlighten your clouded judgement.</p>
              <p>P.S. I'm not siding any political parties or whatsoever. I am just relating my reply to the nutritional aspect of this content. (:</p>
