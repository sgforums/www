              <p>Hi, I m concerned about whether people with epilepsy should be barred from taking uni courses (NTU, NUS etc) such as engineering and sciences. </p>
              <p>I would like to know if there are people out there with mild epilepsy still being able to pursue education in engineering and sciences? Are there exceptional cases whereby the uni allows students with mild epilepsy to study in engineering and sciences? How's your case like?</p>
              <p>I have a place in materials science engineering NTU and yet I have just been rejected. This is so after my medical examination at the NTU medical centre, where I declared to the doctor that I had 2 times fits b4. The gp at NTu just wrote a memo addressing to Office of Admission stating i be DROPPed out of the material engineering course. I felt so unjustified and upset even when i told him my condition was still not fully diagnosed (as i was awaiting EEG test results from my specialist at that time), he still chose to dropp me. How I felt i din declare at all! I wonder how the others feel about your medical conditions be labelled as sth that is bad about u. </p>
              <p> I have mild epilepsy and my specialist from the hospital actually wrote a memo for me thereafter, addressing to the school stating that my condition is mild and that i am stable to study engineering and sciences. I m also on medication of epilim chrono as to control my condition. So far no relapse and it's been fine for me. But NTU has been slow and inefficient to respond regarding my rejection and they never disclosed my reason.</p>
              <p>Sch is starting soon in late aug after YOG and this kind of things happen and not resolved. I wonder what i can do to settle this problem??</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the rule to bar people with certain conditions to take certain courses is fair...provided its not a blanket rule....enough medical assessment has been done and expert opinion has been sought....offhand I dont think the NTU Medical Centre is qualified for that...but I could be wrong.</p>

              <p>Imagine a EEE engineer being color-blind or having an epilepsy attack while working with an 66KV installation...its different from having an epilepsy attack while working as an accountant...so to me not allowing someone with epilepsy taking EEE is fair but barring that someone from taking business courses dont make sense...</p>

              <p>There are plenty of dangerous equipment even for the first-year labs, like for thermal experiments, laser usage and electrical circuits. Some people already start mini-fires in their second year. Suffering a fit in the lab would be extremely dangerous IMHO, to your friends also.</p>
              <p>Then again, my uncle is a pretty successful construction engineer I think, and he suffers from fits now and then.</p>

              <p>Yes. They are barred from taking engineering and science.</p>
              <p>This is due to the safety regulation that is implemented after the SAR NUS incident for laboratory practices. Personnel who are unfit such as epilepsy patient, mentally unwell... are not allowed to enter the laboratory in general. </p>
              <p>Of course, no one will doubt your ability to study in classroom and lectures. But if your epileptic relapse is too often and cannot survive without drugs. I am sorry that you are out in this game. Basically you cannot work in the lab which is useless for you after you grad. </p>

              <p>My case has since been accepted already. I requested my MP to write in for me and the result was that the NTU has further looked into my request and has finally accept, however, with certain terms and conditions.</p>
              <p>i'll be on a 1-year trial period whereby NTU will take extreme notice and care about my medical well-being. For instance, I can't operate in the lab alone and it is required of me to have someone with me at all times.For fear I have a relapse in lab.</p>
              <p>Also I'll have to meet the prof every few weeks as an update of my medical condition, as well as weekly meet-ups with my prof during tests and exams periods. This is so as these are more stressful periods and they tend to want to monitor me more regularly during this period.</p>
              <p>I'll also be having regular check-ups with the doctor in NTU every half year. </p>
              <p>I'm quite alrite with the terms so these are some adjustments i need to make.</p>
              <p>I feel those with medical conditions should learn how to fight for your rights and not let what the verdict dictates on 1st attempt. Well, this is my case of being true and declare to the school my condition. It's up to you if u choose to declare or hide your medical problems.</p>
