              I realise my gastric attack only comes at night although I have 3 proper meals a day at the right timing.
              
              Recently I'm very stressful about work and had difficulty breathing. Thought everything is over when I could breath like normal again until I have gastric few days ago.
              
              I have no idea how it started (though I have history of gastric 9 yrs ago) because I eat whenever I'm hungry. I never let myself starve. But why is it coming back to me now?
              
              What should I eat when I have gastric at night? Forget about pills because I don't like to depend on chemicals to heal me.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>oh yeah, used to get gastric attacks often before. vitagen works for me. and if the attack gets bad, lie down on your stomach. you also need to switch your mind off when it's time to rest and not get too stressed out. or find some way of relaxing. since you have difficulty breathing, it's a sign of an anxiety attack, so the moment you experience one, you have to take a break. like stop whatever you're doing and tell yourself nothing could be worth stressing out to this extent. if you are not ruling out pills completely, famotidine is a good one. maybe research on that ? (edited: said chemicals are not to heal, it's to provide relief. to really stop the gastric attacks, you probably have to start from your mind and learn to relax)</p></div>

              <p>Yes, I have been having the abdominal pains since last sunday. In the daytime, its mild throbbing pain, I got to stand up to feel better. At night, it's bad. I went to see doctor and he said its irritable bowel syndrome. There's no cure for that and it is caused by stress. I take the famotidine 40mg and don't seem to be better.</p>
              <p>TS, is your pain only in the stomach? That's called gastric pain. My pain is lower left abdominal, centre abdominal and sometimes right side too.</p>
              <p>Does anybody have IBS that can share how to cope with it? Is the pain everywhere? I'm going for endoscopy soon.</p>

              <p>hi ts, your main point is to learn how not to accumulate too much 
              stress. do not overload too much in a single big meal. from your 
              description, it seems like your lunch is extra large. having smaller 
              meals in a more regular frequency will not only prevent gastric, it's 
              helpful for your metabolism and prevent you from getting fat. your extra
               large lunch is definitely not healthy for you. a colourful, healthy and
               balanced nutrition diet can do wonders in helping to manage stress. not forgetting, stress can also lead to digestive issues [burping as you described]</p>
              <p>as
               for your sudden gastric attacks at night, I have a solution that does 
              not depend on chemicals to improve your overall condition. you can visit
