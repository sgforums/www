They can teach you simple techniques like breathing into a plastic bag when you get the attacks etc. There are medication such as beta blockers that may be helpful in some cases but your specific condition needs to be evaluated by a qualified psychiatrist, a treatment plan decided upon and discussed with your GP who can then follow you up from there.</div>
