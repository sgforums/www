Or prevent those foods that produce gases???<br><br>Thanks a lot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>The gas is produced by the baceria living in your colon. Those are harmeless bacteria who help us to digest food. They even provide certain positive health benefits to the body. These bacteria rely on the indigestible food we eat for their own nutrition. Certain foods are more likely to cause certain bacteria to thrive. Gas forming bacteria generally feed on certain carbohydrates and sugars. So if these carbohydrates are reduced or eliminated from the diet, the gas can usually be significantly reduced. Individual response to certain foods is also a factor in producing gas. For example, two people can eat the same amount of the same carbohydrate. One forms large amounts of gas, while the other only little or none.<br><br>Try to reduce food which is rich on carbohydrates and sugars. Like beans (soya, peas and so on), cabbage, radishes, onions, broccoli, cucumbers and similar, milk and cheese, foods that contain wheat and wheat products.<br><br>Don't eliminate them from your died, they are healthy and important for a balanced diet, just try to reduce them.<br><br>Avoid fried food and fatty food, though fatty foods are not carbohydrates, they too can contribute to gas production.<br></div>

Small children are more sensitive towards the direct sun and heat. They can get heatstroke, sunburn and dehydratation.<br>Your daughter should wear a cap, it protects her against the sun stroke and she also should use a sun blocker to protect her skin. It's important that she drinks enough water before and during the training to prevent dehydratation. It should be mineral water as the body loses the electrolytes in the heat.<br><br>When your daughter complains about headaches or she feels not well after the training, then it's a real reason to be worried.<br><br>I too would suggest that the training for children is timed before 10 - 11 am or after 3pm when the temperatures are over 33 C.<br><br>I tried to search for some sites for you.

An isotonic drink contains those minerals which are sweat out during the training. I think it's ok if a kid drinks it once in a while after a hard sport training in heat, but the concentration of minerals should be only as high as it is needed to supply the minerals which were sweat out during the training, if the concentration is too high, it can over burden the kidneys.<br><br>Proteine drinks are meant for body builders, not suitable for your daughter.<br>And beware of energy drinks, they contain caffeine and taurine which may cause strong and fast heart beat and arrhythmia (irregular heart beat) in kids and taurine causes also hypoglicemia (low sugar level in blood). These effects are dangerous for children.<br><br>I think the teacher should atleast respect the wish of a worried mother to protect her daughter with a cap when changing the timing of the training is not possible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Maybe it's because I'm interested in neurology that I think of a neurological problem, but I don't want to scare you so I won't tell you what is on my mind.

I too have this hunger feeling after it. Caffeine supports the metabolism, your body probably burns more energy after it and you feel hungry. It makes the BP higher, the nausea feeling could be from it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Caffeine does stimulate gastrin secretion, which in turns increases gastric acid production. However, your symptoms may not necessarily be related to caffeine. H.pylori infection, gastritis, gallstones and peptic ulcer disease all can give rise to similar symptoms. Stop the coffee and see if it helps. Otherwise, see your GP and he can arrange for a breath test for H.pylori and further investigations if necessary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's an NSAID, so side effects are similar to most NSAIDS, mainly gastrointestinal (stomach erosions etc)...here's something off the web:<br><br>"The most common side effects from ibuprofen are rash, ringing in the ears, headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation and heartburn. Ibuprofen may cause ulceration of the stomach or intestine, and the ulcers may bleed. Sometimes, ulceration and bleeding can occur without abdominal pain, and black tarry stools, weakness, and dizziness upon standing (orthostatic hypotension) may be the only signs of a problem. NSAIDs reduce the flow of blood to the kidneys and impair function of the kidneys. The impairment is most likely to occur in patients with preexisting impairment of kidney function or congestive heart failure, and use of NSAIDs in these patients should be done cautiously. People who are allergic to other NSAIDs, including aspirin, should not use ibuprofen. Individuals with asthma are more likely to experience allergic reactions to ibuprofen and other NSAIDs.."<br><br>There are recent reports of cardiovascular incidents with the use of COXII inhibitor class of NSAIDS like Vioox but ibuprofen is not one of them.<br></div>
