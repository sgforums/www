            <div class='col-md body'>A psychologist deals with the problems of the patients from the point of their character and searches for the reasons of their problems in their lives, relationship to other people and to themselves. He tries to advice them how to solve their problems or he tries to make them realize what is wrong. He tries to open a new view on the life and self esteem of the patients. He helps the patients to have a healthy attitude to their lives and to themselves. A psychologist is like an uncle or auntie to who you can talk about your sorrows and fears and he/she tries to help you. If he discoveres that a patient is mentally sick, he sends him to a psychiatrist.<br>Alfagal could answer the question about what a psychologist has to study.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>A psychiatrist deals with patients who are mentally ill.
