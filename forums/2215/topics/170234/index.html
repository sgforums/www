            <div class='col-md body'>Okay actually I didn't know bethamethasone is a steroid? I only can remember it been an immunosuppresive drug. Anyway that doctor anyhow say maybe a fever struck me some time back and strangely the viral attacked my skin? I also didn't remember I was very sick before the strange rashes came about.

But I made a thin blood flim myself too but it didn't really look that bad.

Thanks, again.</div></blockquote>Yeap! They are very expensive as they can get... New blister formation during the course is possible, it's just the course of the problem and the aggressiveness of the virus.<br><br>Boosting immunity, well there are many ways, and the most common method is to get sufficient vitamins and minerals as recommended by the RDA (recommended daily allowance from WHO). You can get this chart very simply by viewing in any nutritionist websites. I can't recall all the figures. Vitamins A, C and E are thought to have antioxidant properties whereby they fight off radical formation from foreign microbes (which attaches themselves in the body and starts their own metabolism through their own pathways releasing a lot of such materials that will harm the human cell).<br><br>Other than their antioxidant properties, vitamins A and C are also well known for their skin regeneration and maintaining skin integrity's purposes, which by itself is the primary body defense against any insult towards it. Vitamins B aid in neural transmission of the body and all the millions little processes that happens in the body too. It ensures or keep in check that the body functions are well within it's normal range.<br><br>Vitamin K aids in blood coagulation purposes, while getting enough macro and micronutrients such as calcium, phosphates, sodium, potassium, zinc and iron (you can find such minerals in almost all health food - Gardenia bread for example), and all of these aids naturally in the smooth functioning of the cellular transports of chemicals. Certain minerals mentioned above aids as catalyst whereas the others acts as co-enzymes. You can find out more about these again in a nutritionist webpage.<br><br>All the best!</div>

Most skin rashes are caused by viruses yes, but most skin disorders are caused by fungal infections (which is rather or nearly almost impossible in a person who has a strong immune system). Those who contracts fungal infection more easily are patients who are on steroids medication for a prolonged period of time, having diabetes, tuberculosis infection, cancer, on chemotherapeutics medication, or some other endocrinal related problems.<br><br>As for the ESR, you can find out more on this site but suffice to speak that certain blood manifestations such as anemia or having excessive blood counts may affect the levels of your ESR. A raised viscosity and stickiness for the plasma proteins will tend to increase the count.<br><br><a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/991001ap/1443.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aafp.org/afp/991001ap/1443.html</a><br><br>There are plenty of causes to a raised ESR, and it is rather debatable as it is not a really specific tests that can pinpoint to one particular problem. The other more specific test done is known as CRP (C Reactive Proteins) and reveals a true nature of inflammation at that particular time as this liver related protein will be released in such an insult.<br><br>Stick to your doctor in charge of you, preferably your GP or a specialist. Since they will have a record of you from the time you presented your problem to them more detailed, they will far better understand your condition as I don't really comprehend the problem that you had previously.<br><br>Medical histories are important no matter how long they may have been, even from the time you were born. Hence, they will somehow connect and reveal the true nature of why you are feeling so fatigue especially these particular time.<br><br>All the best!<br></div>

Excessive worrying and anxiety over minor symptoms and excessive contemplation over minor details may reveal the true nature of your bodily complains through your mind. Since the mind can't speak for itself, it will relate to you through psychosomatic symptoms (mind - body symptoms).<br><br>Thousands of dollars are spent to rule out organic causes in which they are never there in the first place. This is the disadvantage of leaving psychiatric causes to the very last and as a diagnosis of exclusion. However, if you are still worried and if it is in your nature to best be comfortable with a normal result, you may try again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Do you happen to know what can cause RBCs to stack together in a way they form something call a rouleax formation? Out of curiosity I went to a local chinese medical clinic to learn about their "live cell technology" whereby they uses a microscope and a slide of thin blood flim and a dried blood flim to study the RBCs for illness. I find their technology interesting. But their diagnosis kinda very general. And the physician said my RBCs are seriously stacked together, like they sticked together and said quite impossible given my age.. kinda worrying.. and said that itself can quite explain my fatigue. But I made a thin blood flim myself too but it didn't really look that bad. So the chinese physician advised me to excercise more to disperse the RBCs..oh dear if only I can find the energy and motivation to do excercise I won't be there in the first place </blockquote>Don't be worried for nothing. Rouleax formation in your case is probably an artefact. If you take blood and allow it to stand for a while before making the smear or if the technique is poor, you can can create rouleaux. True rouleaux formation may indicate increased plasma proteins such as in myeloma but it is hardly likely in such a young age. If your ESR is normal and they do not find a paraprotein, threre is nothing to worry about.<br><br>Exercise will not disperse the RBCs, although it is good in itself.</div>
