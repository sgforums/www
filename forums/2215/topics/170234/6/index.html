If you get a normal period the following month (with effective barrier contraceptive), then you can set your mind at ease...you are not pregnant.<br><br>However, if your menses the following month is late or abnormal in some way, it will be worthwhile to do a pregnancy test. Postinor has a 85% effective rate, which means that it can fail in a significant number of cases nonetheless. What I would be more concerned about is the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy....vaginal bleeding may not necessarily mean there is no pregnancy.<br><br>So I suggest you watch your next menses and do a pregnancy test to set your mind at ease..</div>
