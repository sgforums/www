              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: 
              Healthcare initiatives raised during the recent Budget debate were 
              mostly well-received by the public but some lingering concerns remained 
              over rising costs and manpower capacity.<br><br>Over 100 participants 
              took part in a dialogue session on Sunday, chaired by Health Minister 
              Gan Kim Yong and Minister of State Amy Khor.<br><br>Better health insurance coverage and more subsides are the focus of the Healthcare 2020 Masterplan.<br><br>But
               while the government makes efforts to provide relief to those who need 
              it, there are concerns this may lead to higher costs in the long-term.<br><br>"You
               are giving benefits on one side but it might come back and haunt 
              citizens again through the insurance companies in terms of higher 
              premiums," said one participant.<br><br>Another participant said: "The 
              government might feel a little bit of a pinch giving out more and more. 
              But how far can you go by giving out more and more and more?"<br><br>Mr 
              Gan responded: "Firstly, we change the way we do things to make sure the
               cost maybe will still go up, but slower than what it would have been 
              had we not done it. Secondly, we want to make sure that we encourage 
              people to use the right level of medical care so that you don't consume 
              medical services that are unnecessary."<br><br>Mr Gan added there are measures in place to help off-set premium increases on MediShield, such as GST vouchers for the elderly.<br><br>Manpower capacity was another concern raised by participants, made up mainly of healthcare workers and grassroots volunteers.<br><br>"If
               the government wants to lower the number of foreigners who come in, how
               do we then manage and calibrate it so we have good nurses and other 
              healthcare professionals who want to come in and boost our healthcare 
              system," asked one participant.<br><br>Dr Khor replied: "We will 
              increase the local intake here but we will also try and get more of our 
              Singaporeans who are studying overseas to come back. That itself may 
              still not be sufficient, especially in the short to medium term. We will
               still have to continue to attract some of the foreigners who are 
              trained in recognised universities to come to Singapore to provide 
              services."<br><br>In conjunction with this feedback exercise, REACH also
               conducted a telephone poll to assess Singaporeans' reactions to Budget 
              2012. And when it came to healthcare, the policy that was most 
              well-received was increasing subsidies in the Intermediate and Long-Term
               care sector.<br><br>Other issues raised at Sunday's dialogue session 
              included more public education on healthy eating habits, better 
              communication between hospitals and patients and making inter-hospital 
              transport wheel-chair friendly.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
