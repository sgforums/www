              <p>Our  heart  is  an  organ  that  works  tirelessly every day  and  night  so  that  our  body  can  get  oxygenated blood. We  should  try  to  protect  it  so  that  it  can  continue  beat  at  a  regular  rate  at  all  times. However,  many  people  unknowingly may  be  harming  this  precious organ  on  a  daily  basis  causing  rapid  heartbeat.
                                              
                                              Causes  of Rapid  heartbeat:
                                              
                                              1. Stress  from  work, exams, gambling, not being liked by peers/social media /colleagues, taking care  of  relative with chronic, terminal  or  autoimmune diseases, toxic  relationship like  abusive  spouse, parents, children, boss, colleagues
                                              
                                              2. Coffee  contains  caffeine. It  can  cause  the  heart  to  beat  faster
                                              
                                              3. Medicines  can  cause  rapid  heartbeat e. g. Asthma  medicine, deconge smoking during medicines, cocaine, some  blood  pressure medicine, depression/anxiety  medicines, Thyroid  medicines, etc.
                                              
                                              3. Toxic Pollutants From:
                                              
                                              A) Cigarette Smoking: A chain smoker is not only a first hand smoker, he is also the second and third hand smoker of other smokers.  He puffs multiple times every day so do other chain smokers.  Therefore, he is exposed to first, second and third hand smoking multiple times a day.  Multiply by the number of smokers,  multiply by the of times each smoker smoke per day multiply the number of days smoked to date.  This is how much cigarette toxin each person is exposed to. This is just one type of toxin. 
                                              
                                              Third hand smoking is when the smoking has stopped,  the cigarette particles that settle on the sofa,  curtains, tables or even the inhalation of smoker's breath. The effects of third hand smoking is the same as second hand smoking.  Hence,  it is wrong to think so long as the smokers smoke outside the building, the family members or the colleagues are not in danger of getting the diseases caused by smokers. The greatest victims are the non smokers including vulnerable foetuses, children, healthy people.  Hence,  every year there are many non smokers diagnosed with lung  or nose cancer . This  also  explains  why  some  children  at  a  very  young  age, without any  family history can  get  cancer  due  to  the  pregnant mother's exposure  to  second  and  third  hand  smoking during gestation. The  pregnant mother  has  the  immunity system to protect herself  from grievous  damage unlike the foetus whose  immunity system is  not yet  fully  developed. Please bear in mind the toxins are cumulative. 
                                              
                                              B)  Gas used for cooking.  Each cook is exposed whenever a meal is cooked .Multiply by the number of times cooked multiply the number of days todate. Celebrity chef , Sam Leong is diagnosed with stage 4 nose cancer.  I have seen quite a number of his programmes where gas was used in his cooking. Gas is toxic. Some people commit suicide using gas.  It is advisable to use electric device to cook like zero BPA Philips  steamer or Visions glassware using hot plate to cook. By the way, during an interview he mentioned he did excercise frequently.
                                              
                                              C) Severe  Allergic reactions  from  various  allergens  like  peanuts, bee  sting, pollens, dust  mites. A  little known  allergen  is  the  incense. It  is  often  misdiagnosed  as  insect  bite. The  severe  allergic  incense  sufferers  can  actually  die  due to lack  of  oxygen  supply  to  the  heart  or  brain because the normal blood pressure can plummet to dangerously low levels. Alternatively, the incense sufferers can  get  stroke  or  heart  attack due  to  the  spike  in  the  blood  pressure as  a  result  of  the  severe  allergic reactions. The  incense  particles  are  very  minute  and  can  penetrate the  glass  windows or tiny gaps of the doors and windows.
                                              
                                              D) Exercise  can  cause  rapid  heartbeat. Enough  people  have  died  while  exercising  to  convince me  that  it  cannot  be  the  answer  to  good  health. The  Biggest  Loser  trainer, Bob Harper   suffered  from  a  severe  heart  attack  while  exercising. Famous  marathoner, Jim Fixx dropped  dead  and died of  heart  attack  while  running. Other  runners who died of heart attack while running include Micah True,  30 year old Claire Squires,  Brain Maxwell just to name a few.  Dr. Missy  Woodward, a  pediatric physician  died  while  working  out  at  the  gym. 
                                              
                                              I  do  not  exercise because I  want "my heart to go on" like the Titanic song. Yet  I have  zero  health  problem. I used to be obese, suffering from high cholesterol,  joint pain, pigmentation, arthritis due to medicines taken when I was a sickly child.  In the past,  I did exercise diligently but none of my conditions improved.  In the end,  I was able to resolve all my health problems  using appropriate food to heal.  If you don't harm your body with the toxic food, drink, exercise or air pollutants basically your organs will do a great job and they won't shut down suddenly like the heart.  
                                              
                                              Think about it, if exercise  is  good for the body why  does it cause rapid heartbeat rate and  end up killing the victims who want to maintain good health? If  we  don't  want  our  heart  to  stop  beating  don't  stress  it  by  making  it  beat  faster through  exercise, toxic food/drink and carcinogenic air pollutants .
                                              
                                              If  you  think  you  are  doing  the  right  thing, turn  out  you  are  wrong, the  price  paid  could  be  irreversible and  tragic. Learn  from  the mistakes  made  by  the  dead  and  the  survivors. Not  every one is  given  a  second  chance  like  Bob  Harper.
