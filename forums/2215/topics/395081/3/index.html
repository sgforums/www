              <p><strong>FAQs on medically-proven treatments for hair loss </strong></p>
              <p><strong>By Dr Vanessa Phua</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Q: There are various types of hair rejuvenation methods such as pills, lasers, transplants, etc. Can you briefly explain what these treatments are supposed to do?<br><br>Dr Phua:</strong> Hair rejuvenation is divided into medical and surgical.</p>
              <p>Medical hair rejuvenation includes tonics and oral medication for hair restoration. All these are evidence-based medicine and have been approved by the dermatological associations from around the world.</p>
              <p>After excluding any medical causes of hair loss, the commonest cause of hair loss is actually male pattern baldness or androgenetic hair loss, which has a genetic preponderance, but affects men and women.</p>
              <p>Men manifest hair loss via a grading system called the <a href="http://www.rednano.sg/sfe/lwi.action?partnerid=asiaone&amp;ss=y&amp;view=lwi&amp;querystring=Norwood%20scale%20of%20hair%20loss"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Norwood scale</span></span></a>. This grading system outlines the different stages and extent of hair loss in men. In women, the Lockwood scale is used.</p>
              <p>The standard treatment of hair loss for men with androgenetic hair loss is oral <strong>Propecia</strong> tablets - 1 mg once a day. This acts to suppress the male hormone, testosterone. Testosterone is usually converted to Di-Hydrotestosterone, which is the culprit hormone for attacking the hair follicles on the head, causing a shrinking of the hair follicle, regression, and a cessation of hair growth, eventually leading to hair loss in genetically susceptible individuals.</p>
              <p>The tablet suppresses the production of the hormones, and hair loss is suppressed. Propecia can only be taken by men, not by women.</p>
              <p>A topical application of hair growth/hair loss suppression is <strong>Minoxidil 5% hair tonic</strong>, which is medically-proven to halt hair loss by opening up ion channels in the scalp and encouraging hair growth. It is a twice-a-day application, and is a lifelong treatment.</p>
              <p><strong>Laser hair rejuvenation</strong> uses diode laser - a medium wavelength laser - as an adjunct with other methods of hair rejuvenation. It works poorly on its own. Its results are extremely variable and inconsistent.</p>
              <p>Oral supplements for hair growth are available freely over the counter and in clinics. These include <strong>Pantogar</strong>, which contain potent anti-oxidants, vitamin B complex, biotin, etc to encourage hair and nail keratin development.</p>
              <p><strong>Q:</strong> I understand that there are some machines for hair transplant. Can you tell us a bit more about them and who can operate them?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr Phua:</strong> Surgical hair transplant is the foolproof way of hair restoration. Its success rate is 95-97%.</p>
              <p>It uses a donor graft from the patient's scalp, which is usually the area at the back of the head. This area is surgically excised, and hairs from this strip graft are planted into the area of hair thinning or hair deficiency. These areas are genetically programmed to lose hair but when they receive the hairs from the back of the scalp, the hairs there will retain their characteristics and continue to grow on the transplanted recipient sites.</p>
              <p>This is known as the <strong>strip graft method</strong> and is my preferred method.</p>
              <p>Another way is the <strong>Follicular Unit Extraction</strong> method, which uses a machine to extract hairs from the scalp and plant them to other areas. This is done without removing a strip of skin of the scalp.</p>
              <p>This has a disadvantage of causing multiple pitted scars - salt and pepper or a moth-eaten appearance - of the donor area, and hence may be unsightly and uneven in appearance. This method is suitable only for small areas such as eyebrow transplant, but is not my preferred choice.</p>
              <p>High transection rates are prevalent with the machine - hairs are broken and divided during extraction - and only trained aesthetic physicians/dermatologists/plastic surgeons can use the machine. No nursing staff or beauticians or the like can operate the machine.</p>
              <p><strong>Q: I understand that demand for hair transplant surgery is on the rise. Has there been an increase in the number of people seeking treatment at your centre?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Dr Vanessa Phua:</strong> The demand for hair transplant surgery is rising, as people are more aware of its presence in the aesthetics industry. Moreover, hair loss is a prevalent problem which is on the rise.</p>
              <p>Since we started our hair restoration centre here, we have seen a three-fold increase in the number of cases, and our success rates have remained consistently high at 95-97%. We have a trained team comprising two doctors and six nurses, and have a specialised centre set aside for this at our clinic.</p>
              <p><strong>Q: There have been reports about doctors making the news for the wrong reasons. What kind of advice would you give to someone who is seeking a reputable doctor for hair loss treatments? Are there any tell tale signs that a patient should leave as soon as possible if he/she sees/feels or senses something amiss?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Dr Vanessa Phua:</strong> My advice to them would be:</p>
              <p>- Avoid anything that sounds like a hard sell.<br>- Avoid any centre that does not underscore the premise of evidence-based medicine<br>- Avoid any centre that does not have trained staff<br>- Avoid any centre which subscribes to alternative theories of thought that are manned by non-medical personnel</p>
              <p>Do seek professional help for hairloss from a qualified and reputable medical practitioner.</p>

              <p><strong>Painless laser hair therapy for those on the go</strong></p>
              <p>The demand for hair restoration treatment in Singapore has grown so much that it justified NeuGlow opening a centre just for hair care late last year.</p>
              <p>One of the treatments available at the NeuGlow Medical Hair Centre, located in Mandarin Gallery, is the Laser Hair Therapy.</p>

              The Laser Hair Rejuvenation treatment is clinically and scientifically proven for its remarkable results - with no incidence of adverse side effects - according to NeuGlow.</p>
              <p>I tried out one session to find out how it feels.</p>
              <p>The session took about 20 minutes.</p>
              <p>It was basically like sitting at a hair salon getting your hair done, except there was no cutting or washing.</p>
              <p>All you have to do is sit on a chair and not move your head too much. A hair-salon-type contraption goes over your head.</p>
              <p>This is sensor activated with a "knocking" sound to tell you if your head is in the "correct" position or not. The sound will stop if your head goes out of place.</p>
              <p>I didn't really feel a thing during the session.</p>
              <p>I could play with my phone during that time, as phone operations did not interfere with the equipment.</p>

              <p>It was a good time to catch up on my e-mails, but you could also read a magazine if you prefer.</p>
              <p>The room also had space for more than one, so if you have a friend or two, you could chat away till the time is up.</p>
              <p>The treatment is suitable for both men and women, though I noticed that there were more male clients during my visit.</p>

              <p>In men and women, the male hormone dihydrotestosterone causes certain hair follicles on the scalp to shrink. This leads to short and fine hairs growing instead of long, thick hair. In severe cases, this thinning of the hair can leave the crown and front of the head bald.</p>
              <p>Dr Joyce Lee, consultant dermatologist and consultant-in-charge of the Hair and Nail Clinic at the National Skin Centre, said: 'Common pattern hair loss will become permanent if left untreated. So the earlier one starts treatment, the more hair one is likely to maintain.'</p>
              <p>In men with male pattern hair loss, two treatments are available, namely a form of oral medication known as finasteride and a topical therapy known as minoxidil lotion. Both halt or slow the progression of male pattern hair loss.</p>
              <p>However, for women with female pattern hair loss, the only treatment approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration is minoxidil lotion. Wigs, hair weaving and hair transplants are also treatment options in severe cases.</p>
              <p>Besides common pattern hair loss, other common hair loss conditions are alopecia areata, acute telogen effluvium and chronic illness.</p>
              <p>While the latter two are reactive hair loss conditions caused by underlying health problems like anaemia or thyroid problems, the former is characterised by coin-shaped or patchy hair loss and is an auto-immune condition triggered by stress.</p>
              <p>If those bald truths about the stresses your tresses face have got you scratching your head, you should stop. Keeping your scalp clean and healthy can help prevent hair loss.</p>
              <p>Dr Eileen Tan, consultant dermatologist at Eileen Tan Skin, Laser and Hair Transplant Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said: 'It's important to maintain good hygiene for your scalp. A diseased scalp or improper care may lead to hair loss.'</p>
              <p>Mr Lim added: 'Like good soil that begets a strong healthy plant, a healthy scalp means less chance of scalp problems and infections and contributes to healthy hair growth.'</p>
              <p>Common scalp problems include seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff) and psoriasis, which is characterised by an itchy and sensitive scalp with thick scales.</p>
              <p>Both conditions can be treated with medicated shampoo containing coal tar, zinc pyrithione or selenium sulphide.</p>
              <p>Although hair fibres are essentially dead, each follicle - from which hair grows - has its own blood, nerve and muscle supply. The blood capillaries around the follicle carry the nourishment needed for hair cell reproduction and growth.</p>
              <p>In recent years, haircare and beauty companies have focused on scalp care as a means of cultivating healthy, shiny hair.</p>
              <p>Haircare lines like System Professional have a slew of products targeted at treating scalp problems while professional haircare range Kerastase is introducing scalp-care treatments which incorporate a micro-organism called bioflorine that is said to strengthen the scalp's natural defences.</p>
              <p>Of course it takes more than pampering one's scalp and hair to achieve a full head of lustrous locks. Good nutrition and a healthy lifestyle are important for supplying the scalp with the necessary nutrients and protecting hair against external stress like pollution.</p>
              <p>Mrs Marina Tan, 38, a marketing manager who suffered from hair loss after giving birth to her third child, said: 'It's not just about hair treatment. I've also changed my lifestyle as I think healthy living helps my hair to a certain extent.</p>
              <p>'I now exercise two to three times a week and am more conscious of what I eat.'</p>

              <p><strong>DANDRUFF</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What:</strong> A chronic scalp disorder marked by itchiness and excessive flaking. Seborrheic dermatitis, caused by the fungus pityrosporum ovale, is the most common cause.</p>
              <p><strong>Looks like:</strong> Red, greasy skin blanketed with flaky white or yellow scales. Affects not only the scalp but also other areas rich in oil glands, like the eyebrows.</p>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Use a medicated shampoo containing coal tar, zinc pyrithione or selenium sulphide and a scalp lotion with corticosteroid to stem the inflammation. Coal tar and selenium sulphide shampoos help stem and prevent cell turnover while zinc pyrithione is an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent which reduces the fungus that causes dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.</p>
              <p><strong>PSORIASIS</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What:</strong> A skin disorder which tends to run in families.</p>
              <p><strong>Looks like:</strong> Thick scales on the scalp and the scalp can be itchy and sensitive</p>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Use a medicated shampoo containing coal tar, zinc pyrithione or selenium sulphide and a scalp lotion with corticosteroid to stem the inflammation. Use regularly even after the condition improves.</p>
              <p><strong>ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What:</strong> Common pattern hair loss, a permanent condition which can start any time after puberty.</p>
              <p><strong>Looks like:</strong> In men, it is characterised by a receding hairline and balding at the top of the head. In women, thinning of the hair is usually limited to the front, sides or crown.</p>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Oral medication called finasteride for male patients or topical medication called minoxidil lotion for male and female patients. Treatment should be continued indefinitely to maintain results. Wigs and hair weaving or transplants are also options for patients with advanced hair loss.</p>
              <p><strong>ALOPECIA AREATA</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What:</strong> An autoimmune condition where certain white blood cells of the body fight the hair roots, leading to hair being shed.</p>
              <p><strong>Looks like:</strong> Hair loss usually occurs in small, round patches.</p>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> A range of options (depending on the extent and severity of hair loss) including topical applications, injections of corticosteroids and oral medication.</p>
              <p><strong>TELOGEN EFFLUVIUM</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What:</strong> Reactive hair loss due to underlying medical reasons like thyroid diseases. It can also be caused by a sudden stressful event that happened two to four months prior to the hair loss, like crash dieting or giving birth. Hair roots are pushed prematurely into the resting state of the hair cycle by a shock in the system and the affected hairs fall out.</p>
              <p><strong>Looks like:</strong> Sudden and diffuse hair loss over the whole scalp.</p>
              <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> If the condition is triggered by stress, the hair loss is temporary and scalp hairs will grow back. If not, the patient should see a dermatologist who will then assess and diagnose the problem.</p>
