              Published: 06/12/2005 at 1:10 AM<p></p>
              <div id="post-actions-top" class="post-actions top"></div>
              <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics is warning of the worst outbreak 
              of whooping cough in 40 years, while those concerned about border 
              control see it as more evidence that vanquished diseases are spreading 
              due to widespread illegal immigration.</p>

              <p>Whooping Cough, or pertussis, is particularly dangerous for children and can be fatal in infants, warns the doctors group.</p>
              <p>“This illness is called pertussis because it is caused by 
              bacteria called Bordetella pertussis, which attacks the lining of the 
              breathing passages, producing severe inflammation and narrowing of the 
              airways,” says the caution from the AAP. “Severe coughing is a prominent
               symptom. Because the child is short of breath, she inhales deeply and 
              quickly between coughs. These breaths frequently make a “whooping” 
              sound, which is how this illness got its common name. Older children 
              might not have the whoop sound. The intense coughing scatters the 
              pertussis bacteria into the air, spreading the disease to other 
              susceptible persons.”</p>
              <p>The group says whooping cough often acts like a common cold 
              for a week or two. Then the cough gets worse, and the child may start to
               have the characteristic “whoops.” During this phase (which can last two
               weeks or more), the child often is short of breath and can look bluish 
              around the mouth.  Infants with pertussis become exhausted and develop 
              complications, such as susceptibility to other infections, pneumonia and
               seizures. The cough may not disappear for months and may return with 
              subsequent respiratory infections.</p>
              <p>Hospitals, doctors and other health professionals are worried 
              about the resurgence of some serious infectious diseases, and some 
              believe illegal immigrants are the cause.</p>
              <p>A rise in diseases such as whooping cough, tuberculosis, 
              malaria, measles and even leprosy are creating public health concerns 
              and have hit hospitals and health care systems already financially 
              burdened by indigent illegals flooding emergency rooms and urgent care 
              centers.</p>
              <p>Madeleine Pelner Cosman, author of <a href="http://www.jpands.org/vol10no1/cosman.pdf">a report in the spring issue of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons</a>, is one of those professionals who has linked the increase in diseases with illegal immigration.</p>
              <p>“Certain diseases that we thought we had vanquished years ago 
              are coming back, and other diseases that we’ve never seen or rarely seen
               in America, because they’ve always been the diseases of poverty and the
               third world, are coming in now,” she said.</p>
              <p>As <a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=44394">WorldNetDaily reported</a> last month, even leprosy is suddenly on the radar of health officials.</p>
              <p>Cosman recommends closing the border to all illegal traffic, 
              rescinding the citizenship of “anchor babies,” those born in the U.S. to
               parents of illegals, and making the aiding and abetting of illegals a 
              crime and an end to all future amnesty programs.</p>
              <p>“We have a terrible, absolutely vicious, law called EMTALA: 
              the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which is really 
              the culprit that requires every emergency room, and every physician of 
              an emergency room, to treat illegal aliens for free,” she said.</p>
              <p>Cosman said 84 hospitals in California have been forced to 
              close because of the high cost of treating illegal aliens with only 50 
              percent of all treatments reimbursed by government.</p>
              <p>“Even physicians in those emergency rooms, don’t fully get the
               point that by being compassionate, and generous, and gracious, they 
              are, in essence, destroying their own livelihoods as well as their own 
              hospitals,” she said.</p>
              <p>While politicians often mention there are 43 million without 
              health insurance in this country, the Cosman’s report estimates that at 
              least 25 percent of those are illegal immigrants. The figure could be as
               high as 50 percent.</p>

              <p>the point is this:</p>
              <p>We have merely pushed those diseases back to under developed nations. Diseases once thought vanquished---This is an assumption</p>
              <p>The illegals are at most carriers and they are not to be blamed totally for such incidents</p>
              <p>Closing borders won't help much, either--your local store might need the manpower over the border</p>
              <p>Treating them is still a better option as total eradication in practical terms is financially impossible</p>
              <p>there will still be reservoirs of the diseases out there somewhere</p>
