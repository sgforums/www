              <div class="articleTitle">
              <div class="articleAuthorName">by  F. William   Engdahl</div>
              </div>
              <div class="articleTitle"><br></div>
              <div class="articleTitle">The Council of Europe member states will launch an inquiry in January 2010 on the influence of the pharmaceutical companies on the global swine flu campaign, focusing especially on extent of the pharma‘s industry’s influence on WHO. The Health Committee of the EU Parliament has unanimously passed a resolution calling for the inquiry. The step is a long-overdue move to public transparency of a “Golden Triangle” of drug corruption between WHO, the pharma industry and academic scientists that has permanently damaged the lives of millions and even caused death.</div>
              <div class="articleTitle"><br></div>
              <div class="articleTitle">The parliament motion was introduced by Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, former SPD Member of the German Bundestag and now Chairman of the European Parliament Health Committee. Wodarg is a medical doctor and epidemiologist, a specialist in lung disease and environmental medicine, who considers the current “pandemic” Swine Flu campaign of the WHO to be “one of the greatest medicine scandals of the Century.”[1]<br><br>The text of the resolution just passed by a sufficient number in the Council of Europe Parliament says among other things, “In order to promote their patented drugs and vaccines against flu, pharmaceutical companies influenced scientists and official agencies, responsible for public health standards to alarm governments worldwide and make them squander tight health resources for inefficient vaccine strategies and needlessly expose millions of healthy people to the risk of an unknown amount of side-effects of insufficiently tested vaccines. The "bird-flu"-campaign (2005/06) combined with the "swine-flu"-campaign seem to have caused a great deal of damage not only to some vaccinated patients and to public health-budgets, but to the credibility and accountability of important international health-agencies.”[2]<br><br>The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Parliamentary inquiry will look into the issue of "falsified pandemic“ that was declared by WHO in June 2009 </strong></span>on the advice of its group of academic experts, SAGE, many of whose members have been documented to have intense financial ties to the same pharmaceutical giants such as GlaxoSmithKline, Roche, Novartis, who benefit from the production of drugs and untested H1N1 vaccines. They will investigate <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the influence of the pharma industry in creation of a worldwide campaign against the so-called H5N1 “Avian Flu”  and H1N1 Swine Flu. </strong></span>The inquiry will be given “urgent” priority in the general assembly of the parliament.<br><br>In his official statement to the Committee, Wodarg criticized the influence of the pharma industry on scientists and officials of WHO, stating that it has led to the situation where “unnecessarily millions of healthy people are exposed to the risk of poorly tested vaccines,” and that, for a flu strain that is “vastly less harmful” than all previous flu epidemics.<br><br>Wodarg says the role of the WHO and its the pandemic emergency declaration in June needs to be the special focus of the European Parliamentary inquiry. For the first time, the WHO criteria for a pandemic was changed in April 2009 as the first Mexico cases were reported, to make not the actual risk of a disease but the number of cases of the disease basis to declare “Pandemic.”</div>
              <div class="articleTitle"><br></div>
              <div class="articleTitle">By classifying the swine flu as pandemic, nations were compelled to implement pandemic plans and also the purchase swine flu vaccines. Because WHO is not subject to any parliamentary control, Wodarg argues it is necessary for governments to insist on accountability. The inquiry will also to look at the role of the two critical agencies in Germany issuing guidelines on the pandemic, the Paul-Ehrlich and the Robert-Koch Institute.<br><br>Bravo!</div>

              <h1>H1N1 jab: Cases of serious reactions</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 30, 2009</span></p>
              <p><strong>By Jessica Jaganathan from Straits Times</strong></p>
              <p>A DOZEN people here have reported serious reactions to the Influenza A (H1N1) vaccinations, ranging from allergic reactions and persistent vomiting to breathing difficulties.</p>
              <p>The health authorities say, however, that these side effects are similar to those experieced by patients who have been given the vaccine for the seasonal flu.</p>
              <p>The 12 patients, aged between 24 and 58, were flagged by doctors as either needing hospitalisation or having reactions considered life threatening. They have all since recovered or are recovering.</p>
              <p>They were among 108 people who suffered adverse effects in one form or another, suspected to have resulted from the H1N1 vaccine, said a Health Sciences Authority (HSA) spokesman.</p>
              <p>The rest had milder reactions – itchiness, swollen eyelids, sore throat, fever, diarrhoea and dizziness, which usually surfaced on the day of the jab and cleared up in a couple of days.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry says more than 240,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine have been administered here, compared to the usual demand of 400,000 doses of the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
              <p>Only one case of serious reaction to the seasonal flu vaccine was reported last year and three the year before, but the HSA said a lack of awareness could have led to under-reporting by doctors; with the H1N1 vaccine, doctors have been asked to report all cases of reactions to the jab.</p>
              <p>The HSA spokesman added that the adverse effects from the H1N1 jabs are consistent with findings by the World Health Organisation – that the pandemic vaccine triggers reactions similar to those of vaccines for the seasonal flu.</p>
              <p>The dozen patients with reactions assessed by their doctors to be serious had symptoms including puffy eyes, flushing, breathing difficulties from a drop in blood pressure and hypersensitive reactions involving skin and joints.</p>
              <p>One patient had dystonia, an involuntary jerking of the limbs; another was wracked by persistent vomiting.</p>
              <p>Five others, including a patient with an upper respiratory tract infection and difficulty in breathing, are still being monitored, said the HSA spokesman.</p>
              <p>Four of the 12 patients had pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma or allergies to certain medications.</p>
              <p>The HSA spokesman pointed out that, other than for the five patients with allergic reactions, it cannot be concluded that the vaccines caused the serious effects for the others; the symptoms they had could have arisen coincidentally, or from an underlying disease.</p>
              <p>Agreeing, Associate Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah, who heads the National University Hospital’s infectious diseases division, said the reactions could be due to medical reasons or might have coincided with the vaccination date.</p>
              <p>In the Northern hemisphere, the number of H1N1 virus infections appears to have peaked and is starting to dip.</p>
              <p>Two major mutations to the virus have been reported worldwide so far, even as doctors here look for signs of more: One is resistant to the anti-viral drug Tamiflu, and the other is associated with a more severe form of the H1N1 flu.</p>
              <p>Prof Tambyah said both mutations should be covered by the vaccine.</p>
              <p>Overall, hospital admissions here are now low – about 10 to 15 cases, down from 74 at the peak of the H1N1 outbreak in August. Polyclinics have treated about 13,000 patients with upper respiratory tract infections each week, down from 24,477 a week in August.</p>
              <p>But with people returning from holidays abroad and schools re-opening soon, the numbers could go up again.</p>
              <p>With up to a third of Singaporeans estimated to have been infected with the virus in the first wave, the second wave could be the same or smaller, said Prof Tambyah. This is because once half the people are hit, the virus, finding fewer people to infect, will naturally die out.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry yesterday repeated its call for good hygiene habits. It also urged parents to get H1N1 shots for their children and to keep them at home if they are unwell when schools re-open next week. – Straits Times</p>
