              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TTSH excuses itself for care lapse, says patient fell off the bed for his own good.</span></strong><br> Me thinks that if TTSH is sued, it should be liable <strong>mostly if not totally</strong> for damages sustained as a result of the fall by Mr Teo in its ward in the night of 24Oct2011.<br> References (Published ST forum: 08Feb2012):<br> <strong><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/Story/STIStory_764139.html">Patient falls after wife's request goes unheeded</a><br> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/Story/STIStory_764146.html">Patient reminded to use call bell if he needed help</a></strong><br> <img src="http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00ACBTajnECLop/Electric-Hospital-Bed.jpg" border="0" alt="">[<a href="http://dongzheexport.en.made-in-china.com/product/ZbomJBCEbLWp/China-Electric-Hospital-Bed.html">img source</a>]<br> Reasons:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>BOTH Family and hospital had noted the fall risk of the patient to be high.<br><br></li>
              <li>The family, by their judgement had explicitly asked the nurse to 
                          raise all 4 cot sides of the bed to prevent against the patient falling.<br><br></li>
              <li>The hospital refused/ ignored their request thinking that they knew better and insisted upon keeping the 4th cot side lowered.<br><br></li>
              <li>The fact that TTSH was aware of Ms Teo's father's <em>"history of multiple strokes"</em> meant that there would be a level of fragility and uncertainty 
                          regarding his behavior. The hospital was thus presumptuous to assume 
                          that since <em>"Mr Teo had consistently demonstrated the ability to call for nurses' assistance via the call bell at his bedside"</em> that there would be little chance of Mr Teo attempting to get up 
                          without sounding the call button- a repeat stroke/ delirium being of 
                          increased probability in Mr Teo's case.<br><br></li>
              <li>Whilst <em>"raising only three of the four cot sides of the bed as 
                          this has been shown to help them feel less anxious or 'trapped', and 
                          also reduces  the chance of a serious injury should they attempt to get 
                          down from the  bed unassisted"</em>, another key feature of falls 
                          prevention should be the  direct supervision of patients at all times of
                           the day; and it was this important feature that  the TTSH high 
                          fall-risk ward lacked.<br><br></li>
              <li>That said, it remains to be elucidate whether Prof Lew's quoted 
                          study was performed in the day or night or both. It would however be 
                          questionable what true impact the raising of the 4th cot side would have
                           had on a sound-minded patient's psyche if the patient were bed-bound or
                           aware that he had to call the nurse for assistance should he want to 
                          move- the nurse would be the one to lower the cot side in this case. 
                          Patients who"<em>feel anxious or 'trapped'</em>" by the mere presence of 
                          cot sides being up however cannot be defined as ordinary/ sound-minded 
                          patients and as such, greater care should be placed on their supervision
                           and care. That falls from a bed with 4 cot sides up might be more 
                          serious that a bed with 3 cot sides up CANNOT be a valid excuse for the 
                          fall Mr Teo sustained in the said hospital as a result of 
                          short-handedness of nurses on duty that night.<br><br></li>
              <li>It might also be argued that but for the lowering of the 4th cot 
                          side, Mr Teo  would not have fallen since the time taken for a patient 
                          to leave a  bed with all sides up would obviously have been longer and 
                          more visible than the same scenario but from a bed with one cot side  
                          down. Given the described short duration during which Mr Teo sustained 
                          his fall, the nurse  would have easily heard/ noticed Mr Teo's actions 
                          and taken immediate  remedial action to prevent such a fall/ assist him 
                          as necessary. Keeping  in mind that most of the ward patients would have
                           been stroke patients  of poor eyesight and senior age and possibly 
                          disorientated due to the night,  more hospital staff should have been in
                           attendance so that someone would  always have a constant eye on all the
                           patients, most of whom would have had  1 cot side down by inflexible 
                          hospital policy, and especially so in a 'high fall risk' cubical/ ward; 
                          an adequate staffing system should have been in place so that when one  
                          nurse attends to a patient, an assistant is present to watch over the 
                          patients, especially in a 'high fall  risk' cubical/ ward.<br><br></li>
              <li>Notwithstanding the fact that the 4th cot side was down due to 
                          hospital policy, Mr Teo sustained his fall whilst in a  'high fall-risk'
                           cubicle at TTSH. It would be the duty of the hospital as part of its 
                          care of the patient to ensure the safety and treatment of patients 
                          within its care. Mr Teo fell due to a lapse in the provision of care by 
                          the hospital and as a result of this lapse in care compounded by 
                          inflexible hospital policy and blatant disregard for the concerns/ 
                          suggestions of immediate relatives; other accessory comfort/ fall 
                          prevention measures notwithstanding.<br><br></li>
              <li>As a direct consequence of his fall that night, Mr Teo <em>"sustained a cervical injury, which led to further weakness in his limbs"</em> (Prof Lew)<em> "and could no longer sit up or stand. He also could not eat or relieve 
                          himself unaided. He had to be fed blended food and had a catheter 
                          inserted.<br> For days after the incident, he was stressed and often delirious. A few days later, he had another stroke." </em>(Ms teo)</li>
              </ol> 
              <ul>
              </ul>
              <p>Given the sequence of events, I feel that TTSH should compensate Mr
                           Teo for the damages sustained as a result of the fall in TTSH's 'high 
                          fall risk' cubical/ ward which no doubt was due to TTSH's lapse in it's 
                          fall prevention precautions as a result of staff shortage in respect of 
                          the attendance of patients, over-reliance on vague quasi-scientific 
                          studies and the consequent blatant disregard of the concerns of 
                          patient's relatives, most of whom would have known the patient's nature,
                           character for the most part of their lives.<br> <br> PS: As a side note, the Medical Board Chairman (TTSH) said <em>"raising 
                          only three of the four cot sides of the bed as this has been shown to 
                          help them (patients) feel less anxious or 'trapped'"</em>: if the mindset
                           of patients is so compromised such that they even feel 'trapped' in 
                          such a bed, then wouldn't more, rather than less nursing staff be needed
                           deployed to care for these patients rather than excuses and lofty ideas
                           about patient welfare be bandied around by professors? The 
                          implementation of fancy patient safety practices is no excuse for the 
                          lack of nursing staff on duty to care for patients at night.<br> <br> <br> The fact remains: the patient fell, hurt his spine and became paralyzed.
                           Stressed by his condition, he suffered another stroke and is now 
                          totally disabled and bed-bound.<br> <em>"An old man falling while in the care of a hospital shows lack of care."</em> ~ how true is this statement.<br> Sometimes, the high GDP of Singapore has made it just economically not possible to say, yes we screw up and indeed we're sorry.</p>

                                          suffering an acute stroke last October. While he needed help to walk to 
                                          the toilet, he could sit and eat by himself. However, he was placed in a
                                           'high fall-risk' cubicle.<br> Subsequently, the ward doctor informed me that my father was in a stable
                                           condition and the hospital was planning to transfer him to Ren Ci 
                                          Hospital for rehabilitation.<br> My mother visited him in the evening, and before leaving, she saw that 
                                          one cot side was down. She reminded the nurse about it as she was afraid
                                           my father might attempt to leave the bed unassisted.<br> That night, my father fell from the cot. Apparently, the nurse on duty 
                                          found him lying on the floor. The fall injured his spine. He suffered 
                                          further weakness to his limbs and could no longer sit up or stand. He 
                                          also could not eat or relieve himself unaided. He had to be fed blended 
                                          food and had a catheter inserted.<br> For days after the incident, he was stressed and often delirious. A few days later, he had another stroke.<br> My father was in a high fall-risk ward. That meant the nurses on duty 
                                          had to keep a close watch on all the patients there. Why was it that my 
                                          father could attempt to leave the bed without anyone noticing it?<br> My mother reminded the nurse to raise the cot side before she left. But 
                                          that was not done. If the staff had done as instructed, the accident 
                                          would not have happened.<br> My father stayed in the hospital for 70 days. Today, he is totally 
                                          disabled and bedridden as a result of the fall and consequent stroke. 
                                          The fall should not have happened.<br> I am disheartened by the entire incident.

He was admitted to a ward 
                                          with a designated 'high fall-risk' cubicle following an acute stroke.<br> There, our nurses keep vigil and provide frequent assistance to patients
                                           when they wish to move around, and render aid promptly whenever alarm 
                                          devices such as the call bell are activated.<br> During his stay, Mr Teo had consistently demonstrated the ability to 
                                          call for nurses' assistance via the call bell at his bedside.<br> On Oct 24, our nurses had, during their ward rounds, reminded Mr Teo to 
                                          use the call bell if he needed assistance. Unfortunately, when our nurse
                                           was attending to an adjacent patient and had her back to him, Mr Teo 
                                          fell. He was seen to immediately but sustained a cervical injury, which 
                                          led to further weakness in his limbs. We understand Ms Teo's mother had 
                                          earlier requested that the fourth cot side of the patient's bed be 
                                          raised.<br> However, for the comfort and safety of patients who are able to call for
                                           assistance, our hospital practises raising only three of the four cot 
                                          sides of the bed as this has been shown to help them feel less anxious 
                                          or 'trapped', and also reduces the chance of a serious injury should 
                                          they attempt to get down from the bed unassisted.<br> We apologise that our staff may not have conveyed the practice clearly to Mrs Teo.<br> Mr Teo's subsequent development of another stroke during his hospitalisation was clinically unrelated to his fall.<br> The family's distress over the sudden turn of events is understandable. 
                                          We deeply regret Mr Teo's fall while in our care, despite our best 
                                          efforts to watch over him.<br> Clinical Associate Professor Thomas Lew<br> Chairman, Medical Board<br> Tan Tock Seng Hospital<br> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/Story/STIStory_764146.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/...ry_764146.html</a> </blockquote></div>
