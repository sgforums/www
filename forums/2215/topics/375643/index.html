              <p><strong><strong>Botox Injections As Cosmetic Enhancements - Comments</strong><br><br><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong>As a matter of fact, Botox injections are actually composed mainly of <strong>Botulinum toxin</strong> that are in fact medical derivatives from <strong>Clostridium botulinum bacterium</strong> (which causes <strong>botulism</strong>) that have been intentionally abused before for the purpose of<strong> chemical warfare</strong> owing to its<strong> intense toxicity</strong>. <br><br><br><br>Hence, please consider the excerpts below : <br><br><br><br>"<strong>Botulinum toxin is among the most poisonous substances known</strong>. The toxin, which can be ingested or inhaled, and which disrupts transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, is naturally produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Certain strains of C. baratii and C. butyricum can also be capable of producing the toxin. <br><br>Botulinum toxin has become well known in recent years for two reasons. <strong>First, the toxin has become a weapon in the arsenal of terrorists</strong>. Contamination of food is one route for infection with the toxin. The toxin can also be released into the air, which was attempted on at least three occasions between 1990 and 1995 by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo. The government of Iraq admitted to United Nations inspectors following the 1991 Persian Gulf War that tens of thousands of liters of botulism toxin had been produced and loaded into weapons. The toxin was the most numerous of all the biological weapons then developed by Iraq. <br><br><strong>Paradoxically, the other reason for the toxin's fame is the use of the toxin as a cosmetic enhancement (i.e., "botox")</strong>. "<br><br><br><br><br>quoted from : <br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/botox"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>http://www.answers.com/topic/botox</strong></span></a><br><br><br><br>In such a connection, out of so many, if not, almost all of the people, including my friends and relatives receiving <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/redirect.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.makemeheal.com%2Fmmh%2Fproduct%2Fbotox%2Findex.vm%3Fprocid%3D20"><span style="color: #006699;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Botox</span></span></a> injections to remove their <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/redirect.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.makemeheal.com%2Fmmh%2Fproduct%2Fbeauty%2Findex.vm%3Fprocid%3D13"><span style="color: #006699;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrinkle</span></span></a>s and to preserve their beauty and juvenility temporarily, they all have just merely been told by the respective <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/redirect.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.makemeheal.com%2Fdirectory%2Findex.php"><span style="color: #006699;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">doctor</span></span></a>s of such meritorious remark that " Botox injections are simply the most state-of-the-art breakthrough of the modern science that you are simply lucky enough to get them". <br><br><br><br>In such connection, the underlying truths about the actual 100 % deadly poisonous contents about such cosmetic enhancements are simply always concealed intentionally from their poorly-informed paying customers who get the particular injections. <br><br><br><br>In short, many, if not all the people are just simply misled into getting such injections by the fancy talks of those Botox doctors and other related advertisers. <br><br><br><br>Therefore, would that actually be fair and square to those customers getting misled into receiving the botulism-causing Botox injections ? <br><br><br><br>Anyway, why endangering one's life with such dangerous toxins for the mere purpose of preserving one's beauty and juvenility temporarily ?</p>

When the lungs are unable to remove a substance, fluid builds up in the lungs and an infection results.

Although the link has yet to be definitively proven in a full laboratory study, it’s alleged by some that when the Botox injection leaks into such areas as the esophagus, it can lead to partial paralysis, and this partial paralysis is as of now of indefinite duration.<br><br><br>^ Back To Top <br><br>Botox Death Reported:<br><br><br>Of the 180 reports tracked by Public Citizen, 16 people died, and four were under the age of 18.

              <p>Well, human beings surely need to breathe in order to stay alive. So, you can just imagine what is it like for a person to get suffocated to a slow and highly probable death (In the case whereby medical attentions are sought immediately in time, or else, that will be certain).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, in terms of such other non-toxin drugs like Tylenol, antihistamines, Ibuprofen (at least not 100 %) etc, their fatality / death cases would mostly occur under very rare and abnormal circumstances. Well, that's simply because they are not poisonous by nature. Furthermore, they are only used to serve purely the therapeutical purposes of treating fever, pain, inflammation etc, and they have never ever been used for other non-therapeutical purposes, especially as cosmetic enhancements like Botox which are mostly and quite often used as wrinkle-removing products. <br><br><br><br>As a matter of fact, each time I talk to the Botox users (several hundreds of them so far anywhere), both online over the internet and in my real life, invariably such cosmetic enhancements are known to them as merely wrinkle-removing products and nothing else. <br><br><br><br>Whilst the underlying 100 % poisonous chemical contents of Botox, well, they simply don't have any idea about what are they are really about. At the same time, the doctors giving them the Botox injections would simply try their best never reveal such profit-damaging information to them.<br><br><br><br>As a result, such an unfair practice of key information concealments of the fatal side effects of Botox injections coupled with all those fanciful commerical promotions just make it a fast-emerging multinational multi-billion-dollar industry now.<br><br><br><br>So, I believe that it is time for all the truths to be revealed and come to light for the sakes of healthcares and well-beings of the Botox users who fully deserve to know all the truths about everything they receive from their doctors and medical practitioners for the medical fees they pay.</p>
