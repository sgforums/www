              <p>Although it is not clearly spell out by our Authorities but I sense that they are planning to give it to our beloved Muslim Brothers first.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry expects the first batches of H1N1 vaccines to arrive in Singapore within three weeks. And its focus is on getting people immunised as soon as the vaccine arrives.</p>
              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said: "<strong>We will get our supply in batches, and we will try to get the first few batches...especially in time for Muslims who will be going on the Haj. There are usually about 4,000 a year, so I am quite confident we will have enough vaccines to vaccinate the Muslims, for those who want it before they go on the Haj</strong>."</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw said that "tens of thousands" of doses are expected to arrive in the initial batches. And these will be made available to the public through GP clinics.</p>
              <p>The Health Minister added there is little to worry about if the H1N1 virus does not mutate. But if it does, authorities will reinstate temperature checks and other measures carried out earlier during the first wave of the H1N1 flu. </p>
              <p>Yes! Our constitution requires Government to give Malays special position...</p>

              <p>Sigh.... what's wrong with you people....</p>
              <p>You try to innoculate those people who are at the greatest risk first. The Haj consists of something like 3-4 million people from all over the world all converging upon Mecca at the same time.... it will be a really crowded place with lots of people in close proximity...</p>
              <p>If the virus mutates at some place on earth, there's always a chance that there will be an infected pilgrim from another part of the world who may end up spreading the illness to other pilgrims while in Mecca and risk spreading it all over the globe.</p>
              <p>For all you know, the infected pilgrim may well be Singaporean. You really want Patient Zero for a worldwide pandemic for the new mutated strain to be a Singaporean Muslim pilgrim who went for the Haj?</p>
              <p>In the first place, the minister said <em>Muslims</em> and not <em>Malays</em>. So how? By your logic, since Malays only get special rights, Indian Muslim pilgrims will not get the vaccine?</p>
              <p>Before you guys criticize with your mouth, please think with your brain first! Sheesh!</p>

              <p>There are many crowded places in the world.... and even in singapore.</p>
              <p>First of all, priority should be given to those most at risk.... not just bec you r a muslim goin to haj. Most at risk are the Old, young, those with existing illness, and health workers.</p>
              <p>So dont give as some garbage govern answer and try to white wash it by saying not all muslims are malay.</p>
              <p>SARS patient zero was holidaying in HK. SO all those who buy a plane ticket for holiday should be given the vaccine according to you sympatheic and pathetic reasoning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the first batch is 10k and 4k go to mecca,,, we are left with just over half of the first doses. You yourself should use your brain before speaking out in defence offer a statement you hardly understand</p>

              <p>Simi 10k? I quote the article:</p>
              <p><em>Mr Khaw said that "<strong>tens of thousands</strong>" of doses are expected to
                                          arrive in the initial batches. And these will be made available to
                                          the public through GP clinics.</em></p>
              <p>Wah lau. Tens of thousands == 10k?</p>
              <p>And also.... if say we don't give the Singaporean Haj pilgrims (who are mainly old people, by the way) vaccinations, then let me just say this: if the next wave of H1N1 really gets brought back by one of those pilgrims, I hope to hear you guys laud the gahmen for not innoculating the pilgrims.</p>
              <p>And by the way, you guys were the ones who linked the distribution of vaccines to this whole shebang about Malays being in a special position. Crap lah. I tell you guys that not all Muslim Singaporeans are Malay, and I get accused of confusing the issue...</p>
              <p>Sigh..... coming in Speaker's Corner makes me despair for the collective intelligence of mankind.... I wonder why this thread got shifted to the health forum for the nonsense to be spread...</p>
