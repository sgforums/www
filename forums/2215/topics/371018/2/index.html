              <p>Hello all..just want to rant out my feelings..I just came back
              from the doctor, had a fever running @ 38.4, a little uneasy
              feeling @ my throat and my body is aching. But he insisted that I
              can take nornal panadol and thus didn't give any medications.
              :s</p>
              <p>Even the triage nurse @ the counter was taken aback with the 'no
              medication' needed. Being a kind soul, she dispensed some
              paracetomol 500mg (Panamol) to me. Haha..this is the first time
              ever, I visited the doctor and he did not prescribe any form of
              meds to me..lol</p>

              <p>Fair words for the doctor.</p>
              <p>1. Do you know that each panadol tablet only cost less than 0.00015 cents. And doctor are charging you $2 for the medication (10 tablets)? Do you think doctor would not want to prescribe you medication to increase their earning?</p>
              <p>2. It is a fact that eating panadol to bring down the fever is harmful. As the body immune system is not able to response well to virus infection. And the body actually corresponds by rising the body temperature even higher to counter the effect of panadol. Which is more harm than good. Plus many side effect of panadol.</p>
              <p>3. The doctor consultation is to check your lungs and heart to make sure that there is no lung infection.</p>
              <p>4. And for throat infection, lozenges found in the supermarket is sufficient. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your doctor is morally ethically good, as he does not want to cheat you by prescribing you those super expensive/unnecessary medication. The reason why you need to visit a doctor is  actually to get a professional assessment of you health, to make sure it is just a usual cold.</p>
