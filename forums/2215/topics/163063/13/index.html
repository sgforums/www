The toxins starts off by damaging the gut wall if the condition is left long enough for it to happen.<br><br>If I can remember correctly, the term is metaplasia which is the term used when specialized cells formation are changed to simple cells formation since the reproduction rates have to match that of damaging rates. Forming specialized cells take a rather longer time than simple cells formation. Once this is prolonged, dysplasia steps in whereby the cells that are formed are abnormal (certain characteristic seen are dyskariosis, enlarged nucleus, hyperchromatin and increased mitochondrial activities). When this is not intervened, it becomes neoplastic (cancerous)...<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>oxford mushroom</strong></span> may want to elaborate more on this, on the pathogenesis of cancer.</div>
