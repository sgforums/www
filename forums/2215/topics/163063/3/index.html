But of course, one has to apply a lot or excessively to reach this side effect, so far it has been quite okay.<br><br>When applied, it gets absorbed into the local of injury into the blood circulation and clears away all the inflammatory chemicals and this will reduce the pain and swelling.<br><br></div>
