Since you got say about TIA and CVA, might as well ask. </div></blockquote>A CT scan is mandatory rather than necessary according to the practice here. There is no confirm yes or no of isolated risks that can lead to TIA or CVA, as both event can occur. A TIA is partial obstruction while a CVA is total occlusion of the blood vessel. How that happens, partial or total is beyond a positive confirmation and prediction. Our best bet is through multiple papers of research and this will never also give a 100% effectiveness of what cause what, aside from being impractical.<br><br>Stroke as I have explained earlier is progressive and changes occur slowly and over time in hours or days, which splits them up into categorization of TIA and CVA.<br><br>Recovering faster or not depends on the right treatment, though I may have to agree that 90% of the time you will be right if you treat the patient with an anticoagulant as you can be 90% sure that it is thrombotic in origin. However such issues lead to improper management and care of the patient.<br><br>You need to be in the situation to recognize and understand what actually happens during that time... a neurologist will tell you different things from what I tell you, and approach of practice of managing stroke patients vary widely.<br><br>During the first 30 minutes (some time can be as less than 15 minutes taking out the time of preparing the patient and setting up the equipment) the patient is actually being scanned rather than being left alone.<br><br>To sum up, a hemorrhagic stroke is usually more deadly and progress much more rapidly than a thrombotic stroke, but note that it is only usually, there are exceptions.

I have messed up with my metabolism, studying stress, exhaustion.<br><br>So here it comes.<br><br>A stroke isn't really a progressive even't, but depends on its type. When the blood vessels in brain are blocked - ischemia (due to spasm, trombosis or embole) certain parts of the brain don't get oxygen and get damaged. The longer this blocade takes, the bigger parts of the brain get damaged and the<br>damage gets more severe. Hence the faster the doctors "deblocade" the blood vessels, the bigger chance to recover for the patients and the less damage of the brain. You know, brain is sensitive on oxygen, you know what can lack of oxygen cause to the brain.<br><br>According to my mom CT is necessary to see where what happened, so that the doctors know what to do, and ofcourse fast medication to free the blood vessels, neurologist should be by the patient.The faster is the patient treated, the bigger the chance for him.<br>The CT scan should be repeated after 4 hours to see the changes in the brain.<br><br></div>

There is no confirm yes or no of isolated risks that can lead to TIA or CVA, as both event can occur. A TIA is partial obstruction while a CVA is total occlusion of the blood vessel. How that happens, partial or total is beyond a positive confirmation and prediction. Our best bet is through multiple papers of research and this will never also give a 100% effectiveness of what cause what, aside from being impractical.<br><br>Stroke as I have explained earlier is progressive and changes occur slowly and over time in hours or days, which splits them up into categorization of TIA and CVA.<br><br>Recovering faster or not depends on the right treatment, though I may have to agree that 90% of the time you will be right if you treat the patient with an anticoagulant as you can be 90% sure that it is thrombotic in origin. However such issues lead to improper management and care of the patient.<br><br>You need to be in the situation to recognize and understand what actually happens during that time... a neurologist will tell you different things from what I tell you, and approach of practice of managing stroke patients vary widely.<br><br>During the first 30 minutes (some time can be as less than 15 minutes taking out the time of preparing the patient and setting up the equipment) the patient is actually being scanned rather than being left alone.<br><br>To sum up, a hemorrhagic stroke is usually more deadly and progress much more rapidly than a thrombotic stroke, but note that it is only usually, there are exceptions.

I know that you said that it is better to be safe than sorry, but as with everything, there are differences.

The rapidity of the decline of the patient's status and condition with the Glasgow Coma Scale may be one way out if the patient's condition is very very bad.<br><br>Experiences are experiences, as far as I know, the higher one's rank is, the more cautious the doctor can be rather than to be blind. Neurology is a rather in-depth subject and not to even mention it's sister's subject, Neurosurgery, Psychiatry and Psychology, since most of the human brain's are left to be explained in terms of hypothesis. The documentations are never sufficient to predict that this will happen, and that will happen, because the way it takes its course or route is very varied.<br><br>The symptoms can be very similar, only the progression is the way of seeing it. Hence with these group of patients, I as a house officer would have no say, but to immediately notify my superiors whom their decisions are best to say left it to them to make. However, if I were to be the consultant, I will pull out all investigations, verify them and get them assessed and check, and in the meantime, supporting the patient as much as the team can. It has been known that certain thrombus can be as bad as hemorrhage, not to even mention that in hemorrhagic stroke, there are plenty more differential diagnosis you have to rule out before you can say that this is a stroke.<br><br>You have to know, that our pledge before becoming doctors are to practice as safe doctors, and not gung-ho doctors based on our experience, no matter how long that can be.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by thinkdifferent:<br><br>A stroke isn't really a progressive even't, but depends on its type. When the blood vessels in brain are blocked - ischemia (due to spasm, trombosis or embole) certain parts of the brain don't get oxygen and get damaged. <strong>The longer this blocade takes, the bigger parts of the brain get damaged and the<br>damage gets more severe</strong>. Hence the faster the doctors "deblocade" the blood vessels, the bigger chance to recover for the patients and the less damage of the brain. You know, brain is sensitive on oxygen, you know what can lack of oxygen cause to the brain.<br><br>According to my mom <strong>CT is necessary to see where &amp; what happened</strong>, so that the doctors know what to do, and ofcourse fast medication to free the blood vessels, neurologist should be by the patient.The faster is the patient treated, the bigger the chance for him.<br>The CT scan should be repeated after 4 hours to see the changes in the brain.<br><br></blockquote>Progressive as in the damaging areas, hence you can see the pattern of damage peripherally.
