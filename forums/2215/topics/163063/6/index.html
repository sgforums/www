            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: Circumcision Procedure Summarized...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tut4nkh4m3n:<br></div><div class="quote_body">it's not just to stay withdrawn innit? i thought it was physically taking the whole piece of front skin out? yeah anyway... *ouch*</div></blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by dragg:<br><br><strong>i am not exactly sure what is done. maybe check with doctor reno later.<br><br>i heard girls have part of their clitoris removed.</strong> </blockquote>Explanation provided for adults - retraction (no retraction done during surgery if the patient is an infant or a child, since there is a connective tissue that attaches the foreskin to the penis. much like a nail to the nail bed).<br><br>Under normal condition prior to circumcision, your penile head would be covered by the foreskin. The purpose of circumcision is the removal of the foreskin itself to reveal the head. It has been proven that it can prevent a potential niche for colonization of bacteria as most males previously (I guess even now) do not care for their perineal hygiene and with the foreskin intact, one has to actually retract and clean it everyday. The warmth and dampness allows such place to be housed by all sorts of microbes.<br><br>Prior to removing the foreskin, an incision is make (imagine a toilet roll without it's tissue) in the upper part (there are of course many procedures done to stop excessive flow of bleeding, but this is too complex and serves no purpose to its description here)...<br><br>Once the incision is done, it is retracted and the penis. is protected with a certain device to prevent injuries... The foreskin is then rolled back over the device and a string is tied around the penile region to cease blood supply to the area temporarily. It is then cut off and the attached devices removed carefully.<br><br>I hope you can imagine   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I feel that at this age, you should consider about your growth rather than your risk factors, for example having a postive family history of diabetes. However, having said that, you should not totally neglect the amount and types of food that you eat. It is not only important for your growth by taking proper nutrition, but over-eating them can lead to obesity.<br><br>Participate in activities and play sports... if you don't have one, pick up one or if you feel that you can take it, go for more. At your age, you should be active and maximize your potential in every aspects of your life.<br><br>Watch what you eat and you should be alright. Reduce all or stop the junk foods, soda cans, titbits, chocolates or sweets that are not important for your nutrition, yet it can bring complications such as dental caries per se.<br><br>Btw, I am a Malaysian staying in Malaysia...<br><br></div>

Under normal conditions, this offense is countered by the bicarbonate-mucus barrier (an unstirred layer) which lines the gastric epithelium. This barrier prevents any further damage that might have been caused to the vital and functional cells in the stomach.<br><br>The remaining defensive mechanism is the availability of the tight junctions in the cells that prevent both the acid and H. pylori from entering into the cell and causing a breach in the lining (ulcer formation). The blood vessels in the stomach also channels protective prostaglandins into the gastric epithelium helping in regeneration of damaged cells.<br><br>Some other offending agents include chronic NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and diclofenac) intake, alcohol, duodenal reflux of bile juice, helicobacter pylori infections, smoking and steroidal medications.<br><br>The sole method of relieving an ulcer is to first diagnose it through an endoscope (OGDS - oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) inserted from the mouth and into the esophagus to view it in the stomach. Once diagnosed, a sample of the ulcer tissue is taken to culture for the presence of H. pylori (the sole and common infective cause for peptic ulcer disease).<br><br>Treatment relies on 2 antibiotics and 1 protective agent for the ulcer. The common practice is to treat with Flagyl (metronidazole) + Amoxycillin + Omeprazole or any of the H2RANTs medications mentioned in the previous post.<br><br></div>

Although, the acid do get released, but the amount is not as much as after a meal. These residual acid stays around in the stomach and comes face to face with the defensive mechanism, the mucus-bicarbonate layer and get neutralized.<br><br>Under normal condition, the acid and alkaline layers stay in constant equilibria and does not become excessive unless the above offending agents are used.</div>
