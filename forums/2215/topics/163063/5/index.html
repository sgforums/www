Type 1 and Type 2<br><br>Type 1 - causes are more towards autoimmunity, infection and genetic<br><br>Type 2 - causes are more towards hereditary, environment and obesity<br><br>The more commoner ones in our Eastern countries is Type 2 which the onset starts after 40 years of age (there may be variants)...<br><br>With the causes listed, the modes of prevention is based on avoiding the causes...<br><br>It has been proven through many research papers that in potential Type 2 diabetics, prior to them developing symptoms, they carry a potential gene for insulin resistance (insulin helps in absorbing glucose into muscles or fat cells, with resistance, glucose is not absorbed and left in the circulation for a long time till it gets excreted in the urine, normally, the urine should NOT have any glucose in it giving rise to a urine dipstick test for glycosuria)...<br><br>If you have a strong family history of diabetes, it is vital that you start caring for your body now by taking less sugary foods or carbohydrates, start taking up exercises - the best being 3 sessions per week with 1 session lasting for 30-45 minutes, the best is still running or jogging). Reduce your weight at all cost if you are overweight or obese.<br><br>Do not start smoking or drink alcohol as these are compounding factors. Remember that diabetes coexist with a lot of other diseases such as high blood pressure, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and peripheral vascular disorders.<br><br>Get your blood checked once every 2 years or 3 years for evidence of glucose if you do not have any evidence of diabetes. If you do, you may want to get it checked more regularly.<br><br>I will not be talking on Type 1, as it is not as common here, but suffice to say that diabetes in Type 1 is part of a group of autoimmune disorders. The person afflicted with these genes may present otherwise with thyroid problems and other endocrinal problems (adrenal glands).</div>
