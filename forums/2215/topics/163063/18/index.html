This is done for a potential cure for the leukemic patient. Bone marrow donation is different from blood donation.<br><br>Prior to carrying out a bone marrow donation, the patient and the donater need to be screened for HLA-match, if it doesn't match, the body will reject it and the transplant will then be useless.

However, after I cool down, it will go back to normal body temperature. The real challenge: My friend says that by just concentration, you can make your body's temperature goes higher. She stared at her left hand continuously for a few minutes and touched me, her left hand is as hot as when I am practising qigong. Why is it so?</div>
