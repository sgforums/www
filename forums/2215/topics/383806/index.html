              <p>Luckily the error was in the particulars and not in the medication.....</p>
              <p>But certainly, I'd have heads rolling over this.... I always thought that it is SOP to double-check the patient's particulars prior to dispensing medication....</p>
              <p>Back when I was in the army, I worked the dispensary counter at the medical center every now and then.... I remember that the SOP was to ask the patient to sound off his rank, name, IC number, and any known drug allergies...</p>

              <p>You will certainly get the idea that it is just a matter of mis-labelling? That is their aim.</p>

              <p>dateSat, Dec 5, 2009 at 9:50 AM<br>subjectLetter titled 'Feedback on medication received' Worthless<br>mailed-bygmail.com</p>
              <p>hide details 9:50 AM (1 hour ago)</p>
              <p><br>Regarding the letter titled 'Feedback on medication received'<br> <br>I simply loved the way your establishment was trying to cover everything with a lot of words.<br>By a simple 'My team and i have taken steps to meet with my colleagues from Pharmacy and Nursing to review the process with a view to prevent recurrence of such incidents.' You think that NUH can get off scot-free? Look at what i have posted.<br> <br>1. Hospital kept me waiting for a long time during the investigation.</p>
              <p> <br>2. While waiting for the investigation, it was not known if due to the wrongly prescribed medication, he was missing any needed medication.</p>
              <p><br>3. Barely a week before 31st Aug, Dad was admitted to hospital for continuous brain seizures. Shortly he passed away.</p>
              <p><br>4. After he passed away, hospital came back saying, the medication was correct and 'JUST' had the wrong person name printed on it.</p>
              <p><br>5. Funny thing? They said the medication was for seizures.</p>
              <p><br>So now I replied back, so during those months of investigation, because of it, my dad missed out on taking the seizure medication daily and he was last admitted to hospital due to continuous brain seizures.</p>
              <p><br>End story, ya, the medication was correct but because YOU wrongly printed the patient name, YOU caused my dad to miss out on this important medication, speeding his early death, With just a ' sorry' and we will 'remind' our staff to be more careful, do 'YOU' really think this is where 'YOU' can escape all the blame?</p>
              <p><br>I can't imagine all the pain my dad gone through during those time he was having seizures. When he was hospitalised for having brain seizures, his attending physician told us that he had been having these seizure for a long time.</p>
              <p><br>This letter is useless as that was what William told me over the phone and at that point of time, i already refused to accept it and i still don't.</p>
