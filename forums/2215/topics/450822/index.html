              <p>That is why mediacorp local drama rating is always dropping because obviously the "Pillow Talk" scriptwriter is an 10 year old "<em>virgin</em>" kid who didn't know there is such thing call contraception. Beside this garbage show, the other local variety shows are always traveling, cuisine and cuisine until even chiefs who fly around must be filmed !!! <img id="yui_3_2_0_22_133465779953350" src="http://mail.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo13.gif" alt="X( angry"><img id="yui_3_2_0_22_133465779953353" src="http://mail.yimg.com/ok/u/assets/img/emoticons/emo41.gif" alt="L-) loser"></p>
              <p>I think if "mediacorpse" is running out of ideas, they should import more overseas shows with knowledge and entertaining from US, Korea and Taiwan like "The Apprentice", "Screening Humanity", "å��ä¸‡ä¸ªä¸ºä»€ä¹ˆ" or maybe "<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-CN"><span>çˆ±</span></span>" etc. The only thing that mediacorp should be aware is if they didn't produce good quality local show like "IQ <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-CN"><span>è¶…äºº</span></span>", definitely they are going to be<em> abortion</em> soon like Rediffusion radio and who know what name will mediacorp change.
