Its been four months since i tore my ACL while sparring. Have no idea how it tore but it just did. :(</span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: #f5f5ff;">( The fight wasn't even mildly aggressive!! Had a MRI scan to confirm the tear. My doctor actually recommended surgery. But i won't be able to speak to the surgeon at Alexandra Hospital until this coming friday. Like WHAT??!! Read alot of post-op horror stories and was wondering if i should delay the surgery. I'm having an important exam in mid may (will have to delay my graduation for a year if i were to fail the exam) Won't be going back to muay thai or any form of sports meanwhile. I can't... I'm a female and i don't have strong quad and hamstring muscles. However it is strong enough for me to be misdiagnosed and for me to carry out most of my activities without much trouble. Still i'm not comfortable with weight bearing on my left knee after it gave out on me just recently. And now knowing that i've a torn acl and is risking damage to other parts of my knee i don't even want to put any weight on it. This is causing much strain to my right leg. Any idea if i should delay my surgery until after exam? I'm really afraid my right leg will take a toll on me if i do so, especially when i still have to continue relying on it after my surgery. Plus i haven't been able to focus on my studies after knowing that my ACL is torn and might not be able to do sports ever again if my reconstruction were to fail. ( At the rate i'm going i might fail my exam even without the operation.) Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Feeling so lost now :S</span></p></div>

              <p>Do you have problems balancing while taking public transport? Eg when the bus jerks and need to regain balance.</p>
              <p>Talk
               to the preop assesment doctor this friday, and ask if you will have any
               difficulties right after the operation, or can they fix a date after 
              your exams.</p>
              <p>Heard from my friend's friend had ACL tear but seems 
              to have not much problems in simple daily activities. My friend who had 
              sprained ACL or some ligament goes jogging with me sometimes, he has no 
              problem with jogging, but has problems with long periods of standing.</p>
              <p>Most
               importantly is to reduce intensity when you have an injury, I have a 
              stress fracture right under my knee(part where the two bones join), i do
               not feel the pain when jogging, but will feel the pain after driving.</p>

              <p>Nope, no problems balancing. But i think it because i've been relying on the right leg alot. Not too sure. I'll choose to limp whenever possible. I know its largely psychological because i've walked normally before after my injury until i found out that i've a torn acl. Now i'm just constantly worried that it'll slip out of place. I know its bad for my uninjured leg but i'll sub conciously limp.  how's your fracture going? </p>

              <p>Hi Chan i'd suggest you go for it. I tore mine last year, had it repaired 3 months later. Rehab intensity you can choose- doesn't have to be hard. Its been 6 months now, still not back to normal yet but definitely better than having knee repeatedly giving way.</p>
