In this post-modernist society, where people constantly reject the idea that an absolute truth exist. To be certain of truth is equal to arrogance and even intolerance.<br><br>However, before i leave this forum. I want to reaffirm my stand on the truth found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. That there is absolutely no salvation apart of Christ Jesus. The thinking that all religions are true cannot be propagated further because when everything is true, nothing is true at all.

But i want to say that all i did so far is like 'a beggar telling another beggar where can the bread be found.' I am not God, I am a sinner at best...wretched sinner at worst.<br><br>With that, I will leave this place. All the best wishes and blessings to everyone here and may you find better purposes and meaning in life. Real life. Not virtual reality nor even hyper-reality. Truth is absolute, not defined by the person who wants it to be nor by social norms.<br><br>ESS will then be offically closed.
