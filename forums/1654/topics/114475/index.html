I just grabbed the seat but at last I fell down because my leg was painful. But most fell down. Even the seats came out on top of the people. It is terrible. I hear them shouting and crying," an Indian woman passenger said of the latest accident.<br><br>"My mother, she injured her leg, now having x-ray done, just hope she's okay," said Jeanna Seow who rushed to the Changi General Hospital after the accident.<br><br>Also at the hospital were many anxious and worried relatives.<br><br>With a swollen knee, 47-year-old Lachime was more worried for the safety of her friends, one of whom she fondly referred to as Poh Chye.<br><br>Her 25-year-old friend was sitting in front of her when the accident occurred.<br><br>He fractured a left ankle and was the first to be warded.<br><br>Lachime said: "He was lying down and the seat was on top of his leg. He can't move the leg. He was asking for help to carry him, one of the Indian guys helped him. There were many people coming to help us, mostly Indian labourers who were on their way to work. They stopped their lorries, all came out to pull the people."<br><br>Zaleha Ibrahim was stealing some sleep when she was flung to her knees.<br><br>She had a swollen arm, bruises and scratches on her chest and back.<br><br>Foreign worker Mani Vannan and his three friends felt that it was their unlucky day!<br><br>They had missed their company bus by just two minutes, leaving them with no choice but to take the private bus to work.<br><br>Most of the passengers Channel NewsAsia spoke to were visibly shaken and traumatised by the accident.<br><br>However, they were grateful to be safe.</div>
