            <div class='col-md body'>By David Dolan<br>Tue Jan 23, 12:14 PM ET<br><br>TOKYO (Reuters) - Faced with a declining birth rate and a rapidly aging population, Japan's toy makers have had to learn life's most sobering lesson: everyone must grow up. ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>The industry that put "Transformer" robots into toy chests around the world and made "Tamagotchi" virtual pets the scourge of teachers is now hoping for growing demand from adults.<br><br>"The declining birth rate is a serious problem for us," said Keita Sato, executive vice-president and chief marketing officer of toy maker Tomy Co. Ltd. (7867.T) at an industry forum in Tokyo on Tuesday.<br><br>While there were plenty of traditional toys on display at the event, much of the emphasis was on products aimed at older consumers.<br><br>Tomy is hoping that gadget-loving young men -- known here as "otaku," or "nerds" -- will embrace its new robot, the i-SOBOT.<br><br>Small enough to fit in a lunchbox, the 165-mm (6.5 inch) tall robot weighs in just 350 grams (12.3 ounce) and is, according to Tomy, the world's smallest two-legged walking robot.<br><br>An updated version of the bulky "Omnibot" robots the company sold in the 1980s, the 2007 version can play drums, dance along with music, do press-ups and pick itself up when it falls.<br><br>With a price tag of about $260 here, Tomy is hoping to sell 50,000 i-SOBOTs in Japan and 250,000 more overseas.<br><br>DEFINING TOY<br><br>The robots are the flagship product among a line of goods the company is marketing toward adults.<br><br>"We plan to strengthen our line-up of both basic toys for children and hobby items for adults," said Tomy's Sato.<br><br>Others include tiny radio-controlled airplanes that can land in small spaces, and a gadget that uses a laser to project a moving space landscape on a ceiling.<br><br>"In terms of pure toys, I think the outlook is pretty grim. But the definition of a toy is likely to gradually change. So the market will not necessarily shrink," said Yuta Sakurai, a research analyst who covers several gaming companies for Nomura Securities in Toyko.<br><br>Still, data from the Japan Toy Association shows that for now, the market here is slowly shrinking.<br><br>The market for toys, which does not include wildly popular video-game systems and software, was estimated at $5.7 billion in the year to March 2006, down nearly 5 percent from four years earlier.<br><br>Konami Corp. (9766.T) is hoping to avert the trend by focusing on lifestyle products for single women in their 20s and 30s.<br><br>"In that sense, we are building a new market beyond toys," said Yoshiaki Komatsu, a director at Konami's toy and hobby division.<br><br>The company is using a line of colorful characters to sell everything from slippers and toothbrushes to CD holders and toilet-lid covers.<br><br>Konami hopes young Japanese women will continue to use the goods even after getting married, eventually introducing their children to the characters.<br><br>It is also pushing a line of decidedly odd party goods. One is a fuzzy hat that sports a roll of toilet paper at the crown. The wearer can offer friends toilet paper by simply bowing, Konami's Komatsu said.<br><br>"From here on, people in their 30s and 40s will be looking for goods to help them communicate."<br><br><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070123/tc_nm/japan_toys_dc_1" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070123/tc_nm/japan_toys_dc_1</a></div>
