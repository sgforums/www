            <div class='col-md body'>from animesuki<br><br><span style="color: white;">Shinn is shocked when he learns that Meyrin is with Athrun. Talia is also shocked about this and goes "Gicho!!!" when Dull orders Rey and Shinn to shoot down Athrun and Meyrin. Meer is freaked listening to everything outside of the room.<br><br>The gouf was never a match for Destiny and Legend. Both units have great shields and stuff. Athrun kept on evading and defending. Shinn was hesitant while Rey kept shooting. In the end Shinn went seed after having several flashbacks and shoots down Athrun little by little (it seemed like he wanted to dismantle the Gouf?) Anyway, he goes on the Gouf as he did with Freedom. Gouf falls to the water and explodes. We see Kisaka watching the scene with binoculars. BTW, during the battle Athrun tried to talk to Shinn, but Rey always interfered with his brainwashing skills.<br><br>No one congratulates Rey and Shinn except for Gicho. Shinn is still confused, but seems to decide on following Gicho. Talia is not happy even when Gicho tries some brainwashing on her. Luna learns about Meyrin and when Shinn crosses her he says "Gomen." Luna starts crying and Shinn hugs her and cries with her. Rey stares.<br><br>There is a search for remnants of Athrun and Meyrin, but nothing found. Then we see Meyrin and Athrun in beds in an infirmary with drips. Kisaka is in that ship or whatever of course. AA arrives in Orb and we see the woman from GS, I don't remember her name. The one with the red jacket. At the end of the ep. we see Shinn entering his room and Rey watches Shinn drop himself on the bed and go into angst mode with the pink cell phone. Then we get Athrun seemingly trying to wake up in the infirmary.<br><br>The last half<br><br>Gurandal been told by ZAFT officer that Ashlan and Meyrin have been shoot down. Thalia<br><br>seem angry. Gurandal ask one officer to talk with Luna maria. He also ask to thalia that<br><br>every crew room in Minerva must be check. thalia permit it and ask of chance to talk with<br><br>gurandal. gurandal have same intention to thalia, he tell that he schock that Ashlan betray<br><br>him and tell thalia to make time to talk with him. Legend and Destiny arrive at hanggar.<br><br>Shin little bit stress. Rey ask shin what happen and Shin reply nothing. Luna maria told<br><br>ZAFT officer that Meyrin cant do such thing. Shin show little bit stress and rey stare at him<br><br>The spot of crash GOUF have been searched by ZAFT army.<br><br>in the morning Rey and Shin meet Gurandal. Shin ask gurandal why Ashlan do such thing.<br><br>Gurandal said that they not find the cockpit yet but he said that heaven base already have<br><br>Legend and destiny data so he wonder how the data can fall to heaven base. Rey then<br><br>said "must be Meyrin". he told SHin the cronology of Ashlan escape when Ashlan tried to<br><br>take Lacus( Meer) but she refuse, and Ashlan escape by himself. he wonder<br><br>where Ashlan will go and why he do it?<br><br>Gurandal remember that Ashlan seem disturbed with the order shooting AA.<br><br>Rey said that he will go to Logos because there a data breach. Gurandal tell<br><br>the reason he pointing ashlan as FAITH but he wonder why Ashlan don't want to<br><br>shoot logos and stop the war.<br><br>Rey tell that people who are worried have no meaning again. Rey told that<br><br>Gurandal have him and Shin and tell something about the war<br><br>( i dont know what Rey speak) . he waiting for next order from Gurandal.<br><br>next scene show ZAFT prepare to war in space. legend and destiny have been<br><br>transport to hangar. Shin friends(mechanic) told not to speak about meyrin in<br><br>Shin face. Shin see them and been carried by Rey to other place<br><br>Athur and thalia speak about the accident that just occur.<br><br>Luna maria shown out from interoggation room and meet shin and rey in hallway.<br><br>Both stop a while. Shin than grip his hand and walk toward to Luna maria.<br><br>When he in Luna maria side he told gomen=sorry and Luna maria cry in Shin<br>back.<br><br>Shin then hug Luna maria, Rey leave. ZAFT show prepare to attack heaven base.<br><br>Gurandal want to make ultimatium to heaven base. at the same moment, Kisaka is fly with small carrier ship with Ashlan and Meyrin in sick bay<br><br>and in same time AA is shown back in ORB (secret base) with elrica see the AA from outside.<br><br>Then AA crew know about the ZAFT ultimatium to heaven base.
