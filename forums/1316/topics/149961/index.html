            <div class='col-md body'>Summary:<br>While ZAFT attacks the first relay cylinder of the Requiem weapon, the Minerva is sent on a bombing run of Djibril’s moon base. Before they set off, Shinn is quite worried about Lunamaria’s well being, but she says that she’ll be fine, asking Shinn to believe in her. The two share several moments together before setting out. As usual, the battle is intense, especially since the Minerva is the only ship assaulting the base. However, with ample use of the Tannhauser and good piloting by each of the gundam aces, they quickly bring down everything that’s thrown at them including several mobile armors and Destroy Gundams. Djibril gets desperate and wants to fire the Requiem prematurely, but that never happens. Instead, Rey destroys the ship he’s tries to escape on. Sitting on his throne, Gilbert thanks Djibril and then says goodbye. On Earth, Kira and Athrun get ready to launch the next day. They talk about everyone’s dreams and desires while looking at the peaceful sky. When the ArchAngel is about to launch, Cagalli delivers a speech to the crew. Athrun notices that she’s no longer wearing the ring that he gave her, but he never gets the opportunity to speak with her. When Kira and Lacus approach him concerned, he replies that it’s ok because their dreams are the same. Walking out, Cagalli runs into Meyrin and requests that she watch out for Athrun’s safety. Cagalli leaves with tears in her eyes, but salutes the ArchAngel off as it once again heads for space.<br><br>I enjoyed this battle episode even if it felt rather one-sided at times. There is a lot less Yzak and Dearka and a lot more Shinn/Rey/Lunamaria than I would have guessed. But since the fight is more about the Minerva’s moon assault, that makes sense. I’m just happy that the battle didn’t seem too much of a redux of past fights.<br>The ring is gone! I didn’t expect that to happen, but it makes sense. Cagalli probably wants to concentrate on her state duties, and realizes that when this is all over, she and Athrun will have all the time in the world (assuming he survives). But it still seems very painful for her not to be able to go with them. I have a firm belief that Athrun and Cagalli will still end up together, but for now they will pursue their dream in different ways.<br>Neo/Mwu is now officially the pilot of the Akatsuki. They even changed the OP sequence to reflect this. It’s about time the man who makes the impossible possible gets a powerful mobile suit again. I’m rooting for the fact that he doesn’t die again, and hopefully the suit will serve him well in that respect.<br>Rey’s quick reflexes catch Djibril trying to escape, resulting in a quick death. I thought the thank you, and then goodbye line from Gilbert was a nice touch. With Djibril’s purpose served, whatever that may be, Gilbert is now ready to move forth with his plans. He’s already sent Meer to the moon city Copernicus, and that also looks to be where the ArchAngel is headed. The preview shows Athrun, Meyrin, Kira, Lacus, and Meer under small arms fire (maybe from the bodyguard Gilbert gave her?). Maybe Meer will join the ArchAngel (oh dear, I can see the Meer and Lacus encounter now…<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. I’m very curious to see what her eventual role in all this will be.<br>Closing Thought: Seems like we’re shifting girls around in Athrun’s harem again. (I say this in all jest)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In depth episode summary<br>The pre-OP starts with chaos in PLANT, with the civilians evacuating. Gilbert helps calm down some people organising that. Meanwhile, the ZAFT armada is heading for Requiem's first relay point. In the control center, they order Requiem's recharging to be hurried up. They want to fire the "second movement" ASAP, carrying on this reference for Requiem being a song. Djbriel is burning to hit Aprillus.<br><br>Gilbert is still talking to people at PLANT (from the safety of Messiah's command center), and says that there's no way they can stall another strike since EA/LOGOS is a terrorist organisation bent on their destruction, not a country/federation. The EA forces launch all their fleets into space to protect Requiem's relay points. Yzak's group head to that battle too.<br><br>OP: One change and it's not trivial - Mwu/Neo shows up in the poses instead of Cagalli for Akatsuki moving around in space. This is surprising since Akatsuki is Cagalli's father's "will" and ORB-01. I guess Cagalli put sentiment aside and decided the Archangel would need all the help it can get (more on this later).<br><br>Phase-45 "Prelude to a Revolution" begins.<br><br>In Orb, in the Archangel's hanger, Akatsuki is being moved in, and Athrun and Meyrin are helping at computer terminals. Kira comes over to help, since he's finished his work already - and is worried about Athrun overdoing it since he's still injured. Kira asks Athrun how far he had gotten and starts typing away at high speed, and Meyrin gives a small gasp. Athrun is worried about PLANT, and Kira thinks ZAFT will never allow a second strike, but it's annoying for them not to be able to do anything.<br><br>The Minerva is curving around the Moon and gets an order from HQ, and Abby is surprised at the contents. As the orders are explained, Gilbert is shown in some kind of situation room, with many large projections and a number of personell working at computer terminals. The Minerva is ordered to strike Requiem itself and the command center directly while the rest of the fleet attacks the first relay point. Minerva has to do this alone as a surprise attack.<br><br>Talia explains this to the pilots, and Shinn is surprised they have to do it by themselves. Rey seems to agree with the plans, since they're closer to Requiem than the relay point. Talia says the problem is how long until Requiem can fire again. With the main fight elsewhere, the Minerva might be able to slip in. Shinn seems a bit down at the "surprise attack" strategy and Talia says she knows it will be a hard fight but they have to do it.<br><br>Talia has a brief flashback with a younger version of herself and a small boy - when she left Gilbert so she could have a child, perhaps her son and husband were killed (perhaps on J7), which lead to her joining the military, but this is simply a guess.<br><br>The pilots agree to the plan and the Minerva then heads closer to the Moon's surface (to avoid radar detection presumably).<br><br>A brief scene is shown of the Copernicus city on the Moon (actually a neutral city), and a depressed looking Meer is shown in a swimsuit near a pool. Her bodyguard looks on.<br><br>Meanwhile, Requiem is about half-way to re-charging. At the first relay point an intense battle is going on between large numbers of ZAFT and EA ships. However, the EA have some new ships with beam shields at the front, and the shields are huge, enough to cover the ex-colony relay point. Yzak's team arrive and they immediately head out in the MS to join the attack.<br><br>The Minerva flies close to the Moon's surface and Rey starts to explain the plan (did he discuss this with Talia?). Rey thinks that if Requiem can be fired again, Djbriel will do it even if it means crushing his own troops. However, if the first relay point is destroyed then Requiem is useless. Shinn agrees that LOGOS and Djbriel are the types to do that sort of thing, with various flashbacks of Destroy.<br><br>Lunamaria regrets not being able to shoot down Djbriel's shuttle in Orb. Shinn says it's not her fault - it's Orb's for sheltering him. Rey rather coldly says that the event is already in the past so no need to think about it.<br><br>Meanwhile, Yzak and Deaka show nice teamwork to take out some large MAs with beam shields pretty easily.<br><br>Djbriel is keen to fire Requiem again and thinks when that happens, it'll be all over the Coordinators - finally he'll be able to do what nobody was able to and put the history of humanity back on the right path. Just a few hours to go.<br><br>The Minerva is getting close to the Requiem base, and Talia orders condition red. In the pilot's room, Rey seems to have finished discussing the plan, and Lunamaria has a key role, and Rey says she better not get the timing wrong. Shinn seems a bit nervous about her part. Rey says he and Shinn will be busy providing a diversion for Lunamaria to slip through. Lunamaria says she understands and for them not to worry. Rey says any mistakes won't be tolerated, and leaves.<br><br>Lunamaria wants to talk to Shinn privately, and Rey tells them to be quick as he leaves them. She hugs Shinn telling him to be careful and he hugs her back. Shinn still has reservations about Lunamaria having to attack the cannon's controls by herself - it's too dangerous. He wants to alter the plan, but she stops him saying Shinn will be in just as much danger. She says she'll be okay and asks him to trust her. Shinn then suddenly hugs her and they go spinning through the air.<br><br>As the Minerva continues over the Moon, Lunamaria and Shinn head down in the elevator. Shinn says he'll protect her, the ship and PLANT, and she smiles. Lunamaria launches first in Blast Impulse.<br><br>In the Requiem base, they detect the Minerva arriving and Djbriel is shocked.<br><br>Eye-catch. Second half begins.<br><br>Various EA MS and MA take off. But they don't seem to have that many (already commited most of them to first relay battle I guess). The Minerva prepares for battle. Talia orders Destiny and Legend to take off, and you can see the Moon's surface in the background as they move down the catapult.<br><br>Shinn starts owning grunts and Rey uses's Legend's DRAGOONs to take out a large MA - side note, two of the DRAGOONs have a sort of beam saber tip, except somewhat wider and more like a firecracker. They fly right through the MA from underneath, bypassing the MA's beam shields.<br><br>Meanwhile, Lunamaria is skimming over the moon's surface. Gilbert gets a message saying the Minerva has reached the EA moon base, and he seems quite happy. Rey is mowing down grunts, and so is Shinn, just not so fast. Minerva is shooting down missles and firing cannons, some of which hit part of the EA base defences. Talia orders the Tannhauser to prepare to fire. Meanwhile, Gilbert orders the battle to be displayed in PLANT.<br><br>And a brief scene of Meer is shown sitting part-way into a pool, sadly looking at her red Haro. Murrue and Mwu/Neo look on from the Archangel's bridge. Cornelia looks up at the moon, sitting out in the open with her dog.<br><br>Some Destroys prepare to launch - seems to be three. Minerva fires its bow cannon but it is blocked by a MA with beam shield. The force from the blast rocks the Requiem base. Shinn punches through a Destroy cockpit with the palm cannon. Rey uses the fire-tipped DRAGOONs to drill through another Destroy's beam shield, and through the cockpit. Meanwhile, Lunamaria heads in from the side, taking out some grunts on the way and Shinn spots her.<br><br>Requiem is 61% recharged, and things are looking a bit bad for the EA and Djbriel orders the cannon to fire - even if it's not full power. The aim is to mow down the ZAFT forces. Yzak's group continue to attack and the first relay point takes some damage. Djbriel orders Requiem to fire regardless, but the base commander doesn't like it. Djbriel says he'll escape at the same time - "As long as I at least am alive, there are many possibilities". Djbriel creaps out the base commander a bit.<br><br>Lunamaria is facing many grunts and a MA, and Shinn helps out a bit. Shinn tells her to carry on, and he'll make sure she isn't shot. She thanks him. The Minerva fires Tannhauser again, blowing up part of the base in general, and Rey finishes off the last Destroy. Shinn blows up a MA that was going for Impulse and she dives down into a large shaft in the base. Rey calls Shinn and says they'll attack the base command center.<br><br>Requiem prepares to fire at 2/3rds power. Shinn notices this and gets angry (but still isn't in SEED mode). Meanwhile, Djbriel moves on to the Girty Lue (or similar class ship). Lunamaria reaches the base of Requiem's cannon, and blows up the command center before the cannon can fire. Rey watches from above. Shinn has gone inside the base proper and starts blowing things up. Rey notices the Girty Lue take off and moves in to attack the bridge. Djbriel gets melted down - and Gilbert is immediately shown smiling. Legend finishes off the Girty Lue.<br><br>On his "throne", Gilbert says "Thank you, Djbriel, and, sayonara". ZAFT has won.<br><br>On the Archangel's deck, Athrun is looking out onto the sea. He has an updated uniform, that of colonel. Kira walks over to him. Kira is worried about Athrun opening his wounds again since they'll be taking off tomorrow - Athrun seems to have taken his bandages off. Lacus watches from a doorway and then leaves.<br><br>Athrun looks up at the moon and says it's so quiet down here. Kira has a unfiorm upgrade too - it's almost the same as Cagalli's (for the ranking indications at least), making Kira a general! Athrun wonders why the world can't always be like this. Kira asks Athrun if he has a dream, desire or even ambition about that. Meanwhile, scenes of Cagalli working at her desk are shown, and also the Minerva pilots returning to applause and to Shinn running over to hug Lunamaria. Kira thinks everyone has a similar desire for peace.<br><br>Athrun says that in Gilbert's world, such things wouldn't exist. Kira says that since such things won't exist, war won't either, but neither Kira or Athrun like such a trade-off. Kira wonders if they're being selfish and Athrun says they might, but adds that's how humans have survived for so long. Athrun says it's difficult - maybe they shouldn't fight, or maybe they have to fight but isn't entirely sure which. Kira says it would be nice if everyone had the same dream. Athrun has some flashbacks of Shinn and thinks that probably everyone has the same dream, but they just don't realise it.<br><br>The next day, the Archangel is still in its dry dock. In the hanger, Akatsuki is next to SF and IJ and its gold colouring really stands out. Cagalli is speaking. She is lined up with Murrue, Neo/Mwu, Kira, Lacus, with Kisaka behind her with some underlings. In front of her in the rest of the Archangel crew, including Athrun.<br><br>She says that it is not clear what happened on the moon and so things are uncertain, but the Archangel is now officially part of Orb's military (as the 2nd space "fleet" I think). Cagalli says she will give them as much support as she can. Athrun notices that Cagalli has taken off her ring. Cagalli says that PLANT has taken a lot of damage, and that right now, Gilbert is the strongest leader in the world, and most people view him as being right. Cagalli says that Orb still has a lot of power and above all wants peace, but that has to be with freedom as well. Cagalli asks them all to help achieve that, and they all salute (including Lacus).<br><br>Murrue then announces they'll be heading to the Copernicus city on the moon in 30 minutes, and the group disperse. Cagalli turns to Mwu/Neo and says "Colonel Leonork, please take care of Akatsuki" and he says "Leave it to me", and then Cagalli leaves with Kisaka.<br><br>Kira and Lacus go to Athrun, effectively asking why he won't go talk to Cagalli. Athrun says it's okay like this, surprising Kira and Lacus. He adds that they don't need to rush their relationship, and that their dream is the same. Kira and Lacus smile.<br><br>As Cagalli walks away, she sees Meyrin (in her ZAFT uniform with her hair up), and Meyrin seems a bit nervous. Cagalli turns to her smiling and says that it seems Meyrin will be going with them. Meyrin somewhat nervously says yes. Cagalli asks Meyrin to take care of "him" (ie Athrun) since she (Cagalli) can't go with them, surprising Meyrin. Cagalli says she'll pray for their safety and turns away, with Meyrin looking at her. However, despite being calm and collected the whole time, Cagalli has tears in her eyes as she walks away.<br><br>The Archangel's dock pulls back and the Archangel goes through the pre-launch sequence. In the bridge, Lacus says to Murrue "let's be on our way then", and Murrue gives the order to launch. The ship takes off from the sea with Cagalli looking on, saluting.<br><br>Next episode is "Song of Truth".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Episode summary courtesy of Shouki at Animesuki<br><br>Phase-46, "Song of Truth" - long summary<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Pre-OP: Gilbert is getting a report of the Requiem relay points being taken over by ZAFT and some surrendering EA officers are shown. It seems in total there were only 5, which surprises Gilbert and co. Gilbert tells the officers over the communications channel to gather near the moon. Seems Yzak's team is at the Requiem cannon itself, or near - certainly several ZAFT ships are taking an interest, and the burnt-out control room (shot by Lunamaria) is shown. Shinn is seen sleeping in his room, still in his uniform, while Rey is working at his computer terminal. Gilbert orders the Minerva and everyone near the moon to take a break, and Talia is shown sleeping on her chair.<br><br>Some people next to Gilbert in Messiah praise the Minerva a lot, as well as ZAFT and Gilbert's response in general. Gilbert says that things may be over at last - particularly since he got a report saying that it looks like Djbriel got killed while trying to escape and his death and Rey's actions are re-shown. Gilbert adds that the Atlantic Federation president and the EA moon base of Arzachel still remain though (that base is where Djbriel was trying to go to), but it seems neither is willing to start an attack.<br><br>Gilbert then blames himself/ZAFT for allowing PLANT to take such damage - ie with what had gone on before, they should have been more careful to avoid another crisis. Meanwhile, the Archangel is heading around the moon and Mwu and Murrue are showing talking in a corridor, and Athrun and Kira talking in a room, with Torii on Kira's shoulder. The ZAFT guys are a bit depressed at Gilbert's words but then Gilbert adds that he's not blaming them and basically talks about trying to make sure such things don't happen again.<br><br>In Rey/Shinn's room, Shinn wakes up. Next Rey and Shinn are shown doing target practice in the shooting range. Rey is much better than Shinn. Lunamaria comes across them and seems a bit surprised. Shinn notices her and goes out to talk to her. Lunamaria tells Shinn she's surprised they're doing target practice when they're supposed to be resting. Shinn says he's already slept, and then Rey told him to do the practice. Lunamaria isn't impressed with that answer and walks off with Shinn following - he catches up in the corridor and grabs her arm, wanting to know what's bothering her since she seems angry.<br><br>Lunamaria tries to walk off again after saying she's not angry. She eventually says that there was something she wanted to talk to Shinn about. She says that "since then, it's been one thing after another", with "then" refering to "Athrun, and Meyrin". Shinn seems a bit nervous and behind them, Rey walks out from the practice room, and spends the rest of the scene watching them. Lunamaria says to Shinn that all she wanted to say was "Don't worry about it too much", with regards to Athrun and Meyrin. She adds that she feels unsettled knowing that Meyrin may still be alive, but says that Shinn did nothing wrong. She adds that it was orders as well, and they (Athrun and Meyrin) still seem suspicious. She finishes by saying "That's it - sorry" and runs off.<br><br>OP.<br><br>Phase-46, "Song of Truth" starts.<br><br>The Archangel docks at the Moon town of Copernicus, and is next to what looks to be an Izumo-class Orb ship - either the Kusanagi or the same type.<br><br>In a room, Kira says "Then, that was also the work of the Impulse pilot who got me - Shinn?", and a flashback of ep 34 is shown. Athrun says "That's right - he's now piloting Destiny", and Kira seems a bit surprised at the name. Athrun adds that he was really surprised since he never expected Kira to be beaten by Shinn. Lacus and Meyrin are shown talking in a corridor, getting along well. Kira says that at the time, he wasn't sure about attacking ZAFT so was hesitating, and since Cagalli was there too, he wanted her to be able to get away.<br><br>Athrun says he was also surprised when the Archangel was hit, but that also enabled him to understand that something really was wrong - and he started doubting Gilbert and Rey then. Meanwhile, Murrue and some of the bridge crew are shown meeting up with some Orb officer and beaurocrats - looks like Orb has a small base in the city. Athrun says that what Gilbert and Rey had been saying had sounded right until then, and Kira says he understands since they're not basically wrong. Athrun says that it seems Shinn can't get out from that - from believing in Gilbert and Rey's words, and Shinn is shown flopping down on his bed. Athrun says that since Shinn has a dream, he's working hard to achieve it. Kira says, "I see". I guess Kira understands why Athrun is trying to persaude Shinn.<br><br>Part of Copernicus city is shown, and in a large house (?) with a pool, Meer is slowing walking around singing one of Lacus's songs quietly. Inside, the female bodyguard from ep 44 (her name is Sara) is looking at a computer termnal, which shows pics of the Archangel landing. Meer seems sad and depressed. She has a flashback of Lacus's broadcast, and shakes her head to try to forget about it. Meer also has a flashback of Gilbert when he sent her off, and also of all the things she did as Lacus and tries to comfort herself by saying that she's the one who did all that. She then has a flashback of when Athrun tried to get her to escape in ep 36, and him saying she'll be killed eventually. Meer tries to persaude herself that that won't happen. Then Sara walks over, calling her "Lacus-sama", saying she's prepared some tea.<br><br>Meer is now sitting down, with Sara pouring some tea. Meer asks if there's been any contact from Gilbert yet. Sara says nothing yet and adds that things are very complicated in PLANT right now. Meer says she knows that, but is frustrated - probably because Gilbert isn't relying on her anymore, meaning that she is of little use...<br><br>While making some comments about the city they are in, Sara casually brings up the fact that the Archangel has docked here too, which surprises Meer. A brief scene of Murrue, Kira, Athrun and Lacus talking to a grey-haired Orb officer is shown, though we don't hear what they are discussing. Sara then suggests that maybe "she" is with the Archangel - "the one who in Orb said she was with the Archangel", and a brief flashback of Lacus's broadcast is shown. (during this whole scene, Sara never refers to Lacus directly, which makes Meer uneasy). Sara smirks a bit to herself, and then starts complaining about how "she" (Lacus) has ruined all the things "the chairman" (Gilbert) was working towards, and that the real Lacus wouldn't do such a thing. Sara then starts laying it on thick saying that Meer (who she seemingly refers to as "Lacus-sama" but sort-of makes it a question) is really a gentle person who wants peace but won't hesistate to take action.<br><br>In a round-about way, Sara says that Meer has to take action (ie use Sara and the rest of them), otherwise she wouldn't be "Lacus-sama" and if that's the case then everything Meer has done will become a lie. Sara implies that she believes Meer is the real Lacus, which is why she (Sara) has been working to hard to help the chairman. However, it seems pretty clear that Sara is simply blackmailing Meer - who is becoming increasingly worried and nervous. Meer is pretty much on the verge of a breakdown, while Sara calmly suggests they talk some more.<br><br>Ad break eye-catch.<br><br>Athrun picks up two clips of bullets, puts one in a gun and prepares it, then puts the gun in a holster, and walks out of his room to where Kira is, in his casual clothes. Athrun is also in "casual" clothes. Meanwhile, Lacus is talking to Meyrin saying she's happy to be able to go out since she's been stuck inside for many months. Meyrin is a bit surprised, and Lacus says that until the other day she was in space, and before that was stuck inside the ship - she understood it had to be like that, but it was a bit tough. Lacus has Pink-chan with her, and Kira walks over with Torii on his shoulder, next to Athrun.<br><br>Athrun asks Kira if he's sure about this, and Kira's pretty relaxed. Kira calls the bridge to tell Murrue they're off, and Kira is driving the car. Mwu is with Murrue and asks if she's okay with it, but Murrue thinks it'll be okay since it's just for a bit and Lacus will be well guarded. Mwu then says that what he really meant is if Murrue doesn't want to go outside too, and adds that he'll be happy to accompany her. Murrue says she'll be okay and will stay on the Archangel. Mwu then puts an arm around her waist and suggests she show him around the ship.... or maybe take a bath - together. Murrue is rather flustered and says it seems he is actually different, and Mwu just says "Really?"<br><br>The car Kira is driving is heading through some busy streets and some goon in shades spots them from a lookout. Meer is shown staring out a window. Gilbert is shown moving some pieces on his chess board.<br><br>In a shopping center, Lacus says it's the first time she's been here (Copernicus) and asks Meyrin if she's been before - Meyrin hasn't either. (Kira and Athrun went to school here, before Kira moved to Heliopolis and Athrun moved to PLANT, but for some reason this isn't referenced in this ep - the scene with Athrun giving Torii was in this place...). Lacus has a large hood over her head, but is happily chatting with Meyrin while checking out things. Athrun and Kira both look on pretty calmly (not much of a double-date...).<br><br>Kira asks Athrun not to be so angry (about them all going out) and Athrun says he's not angry - just dumbfounded that they'd do it. Kira says "isn't that the same?" and Athrun gets annoyed, and seems surprised Kira isn't more worried about Lacus. (Kira is very casual the whole time - I guess he believes in personal freedom, ie let Lacus do what she wants to). Lacus turns to them when she hears her name spoken. Kira tells Athrun not to worry so much - he and Lacus are both okay with this and suggests Athrun doesn't have to do everything himself. Athrun's still unhappy though.<br><br>Meanwhile, Lacus tries on a few outfits and asks Kira what he thinks. To the first, Kira says "Yeah, that's good", and "Yeah, I think it's nice" to the second, and Lacus sulks a bit saying it's like Kira is happy with anything. Kira tries to explain a bit nervously that he didn't mean it like that, and Meyrin giggles. Athrun happens to glance to the side and spots a goon with shades seemingly looking at the group.<br><br>Suddenly Meer's red Haro turns up - it has a note attached to it. Lacus's Pink-chan seems excited to have a friend. Athrun runs over after Lacus catches the red Haro and says its Meer's, and then immediately starts scanning the area. The note on the Haro says "To Ms. Lacus" on the front and "Help!! I'm going to be killed Ms. Lacus!" and signed with "Meer" on the back.<br><br>Meyrin turns to Kira and says "Seems like... this has got to be a trap", and Kira nods in agreement. Athrun also agrees but says they can't ignore it. Athrun explains that "Meer" is Meer Campbell, "the Chairman's Lacus". Athrun tells Kira to protect Lacus and return to the ship, and then decides to call in some assistance himself since he doesn't know when they'll be attacked.<br><br>Lacus says she'll go too and Athrun thinks that's crazy, and she says that Meer is calling for her, and that this is something that has to be settled sometime anyway, and asks Kira to agree. Kira doesn't really seem to like it but doesn't object. Lacus says she wants to meet Meer, surprising both Athrun and Meyrin. Kira then says he understands, and asks Athrun to talk to the ship about it. Athrun is really frustrated, and Kira's casual words ("It'll be okay, we know it's a trap after all, and we'll be with her") don't help. Athrun's head's going to explode before Yzak's at this rate Lacus thanks Kira, and he says they'll have to be careful though.<br><br>The scene shifts to an open ampitheatre, which seems abandoned. Meer is waiting there and a car is heard approaching. Athrun looks around a corner and Meer's Haro bounces around happily. Meer looks up and spots Athrun - and is really surprised to see him alive. From her spot in the wide open, she runs towards where Athrun is in a corridor. From a hiding spot, Sara says "Damn! That idiot - she was supposed to draw them into the open".<br><br>As Meer approaches Athrun he points a gun at her and tells her to stop. Athrun says he got her message, and that he also understands that this is a trap. He says, "this will be your last chance", which is why he came. Meer is surprised. Then the other three appear behind Athrun and Meer sees "Lacus-sama". Lacus smiles and says, "hello Meer-san, how do you do" and walks towards her. Athrun, Meyrin and Kira all have guns out and are covering the area.<br><br>Meer seems to be freaking out a bit while Lacus calmly says "I received your letter, saying you may be killed - so then, let's go". Meer backs away while having a few flashbacks and then says "That's me!" (meaning that she's Lacus). Meer remembers what Sara and Gilbert said before and feels she has to go along. Athrun tells Meer to calm down and that it'll be okay.<br><br>Meer says she has to be Lacus - her face, voice etc is the same. She says "what did I do wrong!?" and then pulls out a gun. Athrun immediately shoots the gun out of her hand, and tells her to stop this. Lacus moves over to where Athrun is and says it's okay even if they have the same figure - they're still different people, and no matter what that won't change. This gets through to Meer and she falls to her knees.<br><br>Through a rifle scope, Sara looks at Meer then shifts to Lacus, but Athrun is right in front of her. Sara was forced to shift position to a long distance away.<br><br>Lacus continues talking, saying that nobody can become anyone other than who they are already. That's why the two of them can be here and can meet. She adds that Meer's dreams are her own, so please sing them, for her own sake. While she is saying this, Lacus moves forwards a little, and Sara gets a better view. While Meer is crying, Lacus says that dreams mustn't be made by other people, and Meer bows her head.<br><br>Sara seems to have decided to shoot but at the moment, Torii flies into the area, Sara hesitates, and Athrun happens to glance over and spots Sara. Athrun jumps with Lacus out of the way. Meer looks in shock at this - like she didn't know it'd happen. Athrun takes Meer back to where Kira is in the corridor, and then takes Meer too. Athrun and Meer run down the corridor to where Kira, Lacus and Meyrin are, while Sara and at least 3 goons fire at them. Athrun asks Meer how many attackers they are and Meer tearfully says she doesn't know.<br><br>Athrun decides to jump out into the open, then runs towards a ridge and shoots two goons. Meer is sobbing, and Lacus crawls over to where she is, and says "It'll be alright... okay?". Meyrin looks on and so does Kira after firing some shots. Athrun shoots Sara in the shoulder, but a goon gets a bit closer.<br><br>Kira tells everyone to run and the goon throws a grenade. Meer, Lacus, Meyrin and Kira run around a corner to escape the grenade. With cool moves, Athrun then takes out the goon. With one arm useless, Sara runs in closer and throws a grenade. Either Kira or Meyrin shoot the grenade and it bounces back to where Sara is, and the explosion throws her to the side.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mwu is flying over in Akatsuki (still with the sky pack), and wonders what's going on. Meanwhile, Athrun shoots the final goon. Meer then looks at Lacus, noticing how calm Lacus seems. Akatsuki lands and Mwu asks if they're okay. Kira says "You're late, Mwu-san!" and Mwu looks a bit annoyed. Kira then asks Mwu to take Lacus (and Meer).<br><br>Athrun comes over and asks Kira if he's okay, and Kira says "somehow". Athrun then apologies to Meyrin for causing her problems again. Mwu puts down Akatsuki's hand for the "princess" (Lacus), and Kira holds Lacus's hand while she gets on. Meanwhile, Sara is still in one piece and has a gun in her hand, and slowly raises it, but a bit unsteadily. Kira then holds out a hand to Meer to get on Akatsuki too. After a bit of hesitation, Meer moves to take Kira's hand, but then notices Sara in the distance - everyone else's back is to Sara.<br><br>Meer jumps forwards saying "look out" and Sara fires with her shaking hand. Athrun, Meyrin and Kira all look shocked and Meer is shown in front of Lacus with blood coming from her back. Meer spins around once and falls. Kira and Athrun immediately jump in front of Lacus and Athrun shoots Sara in the chest, as Lacus runs to where Meer has fallen.<br><br>Lacus holds Meer, who weakly says "Please don't forget the life I had when singing" and pulls out a photo from her bag - it's a pic of Meer before she had surgery and dyed her hair. Lacus comments, "that is a bright, kind smile - is this you?" and Meer nods. Athrun runs over and Meer weakly says "I wanted to meet you properly" and then apologies to Lacus and falls unconscious. Kira tells Mwu to get Meer to the Archangel quickly.<br><br>Athrun angrily punches the ground and the ending song starts playing. Lacus is crying, as is Meyrin. Kira looks on sadly, as does Mwu. Athrun cries in frustration. Lacus looks at Meer's picture, crying, and then looks off into the distance.<br><br>ED.</div>
