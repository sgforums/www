            <div class='col-md body'>from <a href="http://www.seed-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=16743" rel="nofollow">here</a><br><br>First, the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam was the first Mobile Suit introduced in the Cosmic Era to be able to use a Triple Pack System, that being more variable then X102 Duel Gundam. But the good resettpoint about X102 Gundam is that it has the Shield, Rifle and Saber ped onto the Gundam itself. But...<br><br>Strike Gundam (No Pack):<br>Pros:<br>-No extra weight.<br>-Highly manuverble.<br><br>Cons: -<br>Weapons does small to no damage to PS armored GAT-X units. CIWS can run out. And leaves Armor Schiender. Although powerful, but will not be able to hold off huge number of Mobile Suits and Armors.<br>-Phase Armor runs out and the color will reveal weakness.<br><br>The Aile Pack-The Aile Pack is a balanced pack, while packing far-range weapon (Beam Rifle), and Close Range weapon (Beam Sabers). It's basically The Strike with something the Duel have without the Assualt Shroud.<br><br>Aile Strike Gundam:<br>Pros:<br>-High Speed in flying.<br>-More manuverble then No pack.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Has more weight. (Aile Pack)<br>-Basically a Strike that's faster, and has everything (Take the Grenade Launcher out) Of Duel<br>-No espicially strong points in terms of attack, overly balanced.<br><br>The Sword pack is the Strong version of the Aile's Beam Saber, including weaponary such as "Schwert Gewehr" An-Ti ship sword. "Midas Messer" Beam Boomerang, and "Panzer Eisen" Rocket Anchor. Which is the practical copy of the X207 Blitz Gundam's "Gleipnir" anchor.<br><br>Sword Strike Gundam:<br>Pros:<br>-Close Range Attack raised to maximum.<br>-Has Far Range attack.<br>-Can trap enemy with Anchor, useful.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Weapons have limited range (Boomerang, will fly back. Anchor, wire controlled...)<br>-No Far Range Attacks (Such as Cannons or Rifles aren't included)<br><br>The Launcher, is the better version of the Rifle on Aile Strike, and a more "general" version of X103 Buster Gundam. The Hyper Impulse Cannon "Agni" is incoperated from the same technology of X303 Aegis Gundam's "Scylla" Cannon. While the Missiles and Bullets on the Right Shoulder are generally missiles of Buster and a faster CIWS. Launcher is one of the packs that has improved the most by C.E. 73's Blast Impulse, in C.E. 71, Launcher is generally not suited for one-on-one combat. As it has many weaknesses.<br><br>Launcher Strike Gundam:<br>Pros:<br>-Range is very far.<br>-Cannon has the most firepower of all weapons of Striker. Also the farest range.<br><br>Cons:<br>-No close range weapon-at all, Armor Schiender doesn't count.<br>-Runs out of Ammo+Power in LONG battles. (This should count as a cons that totals as FOUR weaknesses.)<br><br>The three MSV packs, Lightning, Gunbarrel, and IWSP:<br><br>The IWSP, "Integrated Weapons Striker Pack" Is an overall powerful pack, having weapons of both Close and Far. Intergrating the speed of Aile, Power of Launcher, and combat force of sword. Very well balanced suit, more then Aile...<br><br>Strike Gundam I.W.S.P.:<br>Pros:<br>-Well balanced to a maximum.<br>-Has decent Firepower<br><br>Cons:<br>-Uses a helload of power.<br>-Requires extremme skill to manuver all weapons (explaining why Cagalli chose the Aile.)<br><br>The Lightning, as sourced from MAHQ, the Lightning can increase the Strike's battery power (and lasting time in long battles) by 150%.<br><br>Lightning Strike Gundam:<br>Pros:<br>-LONG battle time.<br>-Electromagnetic cannon packs decent power.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Lack of weaponary other then the cannons.<br><br>The last one, Gunbarrel, which was instead installed on the Mass-produced GAT-01A1 Dagger. Is compatable with the Strike also, that's why it's included.<br><br>Gunbarrel Strike Gundam/Dagger:<br>Pros:<br>-Can surround enemies in extreme speed<br>-Upgraded from Moebius ZERO, this time it backs Beam weapons.<br>-Can use other weapons on hands while Gunbarrels are deployed.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Unlike DRAGOON, it's Wired, and may tangle up the Dagger/Strike instead.<br>-Only the Chavier bloodline (Morgan Chavier. "Moonlight Mad Dog"), the Fllaga Family (Mwu La Fllaga. "Hawk of Endymion", Prayer Reverie. "Dreadnought Gundam's pilot" and Raww Le Kleuze "CE Char"), and lastly, Courtney (ZAKU MPTT, Chaos Test pilot) can control with their born ability. (Sting was specially trained, so was Stellar, to control Gunbarrels, they were SPECIALLY TRAINED KILLING MACHINES, SO STUFF IT, because the lab they were in should've had a lesson on this.)<br><br>In Later stages, the GAT-01A1 Dagger may be weaker then the original Strike, but has Beam Sabers pre-installed, and an An-Ti infantry Machine gun. It also has a more decent shield then (scrap heap) Strike Daggers.<br><br>Skygraper, The fighter planes upgraded from Spearheads. Packs a load of firepower on Non-PS units. It's also avilable with all Striker packs other then IWSP and Gunbarrel. The transport unit of packs.<br><br>Skygraper:<br>Pros:<br>-High Mobility.<br>-Transport pack.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Atmosphere only (Later, the newer model Cosmograper corrected the problem)<br><br>===============================<br><br>Now, X56S Impulse. with 7 packs (4 MSV, 3 story).<br><br>The Impulse was developped after the first war ended, it generally improves. First of all. The 3-in-1 Combining system of Legs, Body and the<br>YFX-M56 Core Splender. And the silouette system. The VP armor changes colors as pack changes. Can recharge when near ship by Minerva's power loaders.<br><br>Impulse Gundam (No pack/Not combined with Impulse Pack yet):<br>Pros:<br>-Highly Manuverble.<br>-balanced in general. Balanced BELOW AVERAGELY in general.<br>-Has Beam Rifle+Shield avilable.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Weaponary limited.<br>-No VP armor...(Without pack at start, if pack was ejected, VP armor stays (Ep.2icon_cool.gif)<br><br>The Force pack, the improved version of Aile that imputs "Bigger, faster, better." Is basically same as Aile. but a tad bit faster, also, it's the only system the shield will open up on. Color is the classic Main Character color of White+Blue+Red+Yellow.<br><br>Force Impulse Gundam:<br>Pros:<br>-Balanced firepower.<br>-Shield can push into the enemy with special damage (unlike Strike, whom shield doesn't damage PS units very well.)<br><br>Cons:<br>-Lack of places that are stronger then others.<br><br>The Sword is obviously based off Sword Strike, but believably to my opinion the Sword Calamity of either "Ed the Ripper", Rena and her unit 01, and one of the Socius brothers. From the Striker, it now removed the anchor, but instead, has Two boomerangs, and two An-Ti ship swords that can combine. Color of choice is Red, White and Black.<br><br>Sword Impulse Gundam:<br>Pros:<br>-Two instead of one of every weapon.<br>-Has Mini-shield+Beam Rifle when needed<br><br>Cons:<br>-Lacks powerful far range weapons<br>-Weak on mass unit battles. (Surrounded by Strike Daggers...can Shinn hold up without SEED?)<br><br>The Blast, a powerful improvement from the original launcher strike. Holds a load of power and has Javelins for close-range combat. With two instead of one cannon, mnore missiles, and a pair of railguns. And power thrusters. Color is Dark Green, Black, Green.<br><br>Blast Impulse Gundam:<br>Pros:<br>-Power weaponary, two high-impulse cannons instead of one.<br>-Railguns added.<br>-Missile pods added.<br>-Beam Javelin. Close Range weapon finally!<br><br>Cons:<br>-Realatively heavy.<br>-Slower.<br><br>Destiny Impulse, the MSV model introduced is a test model, featuring two An-Ti Ship swords, and two High-Impulse Cannons, and of course, Beam Shields and the wings. Color suit is Red, and White, bearing resemblence to Sword Impulse.<br><br>Destiny Impulse:<br>Pros:<br>-Incredible Power.<br>-Beam Shield.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Won't last more then 15 minutes with Battery.<br>-Heavy with all those weapons.<br><br>Chaos Impulse, Gaia Impulse, and Abyss Impulse. The Three Gundams stolen were also made into Impulse packs for Impulse, each having the ability the respective gundam has.<br><br>Gaia Impulse:<br>Pros:<br>-Quad form still has Impulse's upper body, can attack through many directions.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Slightly inmanuverble due to Upper body still in human shape.<br><br>Abyss Impulse:<br>Pros:<br>-Six Beam Cannons.<br>-Positron Cannon.<br>-High Firepower. MA form attainable.<br>-Mass Taking out is excellent.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Designed for Aqua combat.<br>-Isn't as good with Close Range as Far range.<br><br>Chaos Impulse:<br>Pros:<br>-Firepower high.<br>-Gunbarrels have 12 missiles+Beam cannon per Gunbarrel.<br>-Similar to what the Force Impulse was for, in a way.<br><br>Cons:<br>-Only some can control. (Courtney, Morgan, Mwu, Neo, Sting, Stellar, Raww, Rey.)</div>
