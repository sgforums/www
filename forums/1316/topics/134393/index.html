            <div class='col-md body'>Basic Plot - Heirs to the Stars covers the first 14 episodes of the TV series.<br><br><span style="color: white;">Gryps 2 &amp; Green Noah 1 - Char infiltrates Gryps 2 and encounters the Mk-II. Meanwhile Kamille is already under arrest at Green Noah 1. Jerid crashes the 3rd Mk-II unit. All 3 Rick Diases (Char, Apolly, and Roberto) infiltrate Green Noah 1 to steal the Mk-IIs. Kamille helps out.<br><br>Near Gryps 2 - Emma (in a Mk-II) along with Franklin Bidan (in a Hizack) bring the personal letter from Bask. Kamille finds out his mom is held hostage and takes off. Jerid shoots the capsule killing Kamille's mom. There's a duel between Kamille and Jerid. Meanwhile, Franklin steals Char's Rick Dias. A fight involving Kamille, Franklin, and Lila takes place with Franklin dying. After the Titans retreat, Emma defects to AEUG.<br><br>Around Earth orbit - Char, Reccoa, and Emma try to comfort Kamille after losing both of his parents. Emma asks Kamille if he knows about Char Aznable (*note* different from TV series where Char himself asks if Camille knows about him). Later, Reccoa shows Emma what happened during the Colony 30 Incident and its aftermath. Reccoa goes to Jaburo.<br><br>AEUG's fleet is receiving supplies from the Moon to prepare for the Jaburo attack. Here, they receive the Flying Armor, Hyaku Shiki, and the Mega Bazooka Launcher. Haro somehow was in this resupply as well. During this, the Argama receives an SOS signal from the Temptation, which is under attack by Scirocco's Messala. Kamille and Char rescue the Temptation and its crew/passengers. Bright officially joins AEUG and commands the Argama. Blex and Henken go back to the Moon. Kamille is reunited with Fa.<br><br>Above Jaburo &amp; Re-entry - AEUG launches their MS force and the Titans launch theirs (Lila, Jerid, and Kackricon). Scirocco attacks AEUG's rear. Emma/Kamille fight Scirocco with Emma's Rick Dias losing its arm. Kamille engages Lila with Lila KIA. Kacricon dies during re-entry. Jerid reaches Jaburo without knowing whether Lila died or not.<br><br>Jaburo - AEUG notices Jaburo is empty. The Titans moved their headquarters to space and placed nukes deep below Jaburo as a trap. Kai and Reccoa are held prisoner but rescued by Kamille. AEUG escapes Jaburo with the Audhumla and Sudori. During this, Amuro meets Fraw, Katz, Letz, and Kikka at his mansion.<br><br>To Hickory - Hayato meets with Char and informs him that splitting the force up would be a good idea after the Titans annexed the Augusta NT lab. Before going to the Sudori, Kai talks with Hayato telling him Quattro is Char, asking him if he is going to fight alongside Char. Kamille overhears their conversation and starts to wonder if Quattro is Char. The Sudori heads to New Kennedy to take the remaining pilots back to space (Roberto, Apolly, and Reccoa). The Audhumla heads to Hickory where Amuro and Katz are suppose to meet them after they hijack a shuttle. Nonstop action with Kamille/Char vs Rosamia (Gaplant) followed by Kamille/Char vs Buran (Asshimar) until Amuro rams the shuttle into the Asshimar. The movie ends as Amuro and Char see each other with Kamille saying "He's not Quattro Bajeena! And that person is...Amuro Ray! Rival of Char Aznable during the One Year War!"<br><br>Animation - Telling apart what was new and old was easy. The old animation came from 12 different TV episodes. In some of the sequences, they went back and forth where you can obviously tell the difference. At times, those scenes felt weird as characters looked different. The new mecha animation sequences were superb, especially the last part of the movie (last 10+ min) where 95+% was new. As for the new character animation, it was better than what I expected. If the movie was 100% new animation, then we might not be talking about if Onda's styling fits Kitazume's at all.<br><br>Seiyuu (VA) - Most of the original seiyuu from the TV series reprised their same role in the movie. Several characters like Fa, Hayato, Lila, Rosamia, and Robert got new voices. For the most part, the new voices did not bother as they sounded familiar to the original. However, the new voice of Hayato by Nobuyuki Hiyama (Shiro Amada from 08th Team and Muruta Azuraeru from SEED) bothered me. Images of Shiro or Azuraeru would come up every time he spoke a dialog.</span><br><br>Music/SFX/BGM - The movie uses the same BGM from the TV series. As for the SFX, it uses updated traditional anime sounds (not like the MSG Trilogy DVD version), which was a big plus. Both of Gackt's songs (played at OP and ED credits) were ok.  Â¶ 10:57 PM</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>uesday, May 31, 2005<br>Zeta movie 1 hits it big<br>Various box office sites in Japan (Eiga.com, Kogyo Tsushinsha, Goo Movies) are stating that Heirs To The Stars ranked #3 this weekend. This kind of ranking is respectable enough for an anime theatrical release in Japan but what makes the case of Zeta truly exceptional is that it managed to do it showing on only 83 screens nationwide. Typically, Japanese films will screen in anywhere from 150-300 theaters. In the case of big Hollywood films, 500+ theaters. Zeta raked in just under 161 million yen, nearly as much money as the #2 film, Million Dollar Baby, which had the benefits of publicity from its success at this year's Oscars, local visits from its stars promoting the movie, and being shown in 264 theaters. Eiga.com estimates that it has the momentum to exceed 1 billion yen by the end of its run, a figure approaching the box office gross of Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters In Space (a hit anime film in its day).<br><br>Apparently, the unexpected turnout for the Zeta movie is breaking records in theaters nationwide. Goo Movies reports that audiences were made up of the "core Gundam fan", males in the 20-34 demographic, as well as ages 35-49. Females in their teens and in the 20-34 demographic also turned up though the gender ratio is being given as 70% male, 30% female.<br><br>While no Miyazaki-sized hit, this can certainly be seen as some kind of vindication for director Yoshiyuki Tomino, whose last few works haven't been known for their commercial success. Heirs To The Stars made more money in its first weekend than some other high-profile anime films from the past year did in theirs, including Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence (141 million yen, 278 theaters, #5 for the weekend), Appleseed (65 million yen, 112 theaters, #6), and Steamboy (158 million yen, 261 theaters, #4). And, indeed, the official Zeta movies site now carries a thank-you message from Tomino.<br><br>In retrospect, the smartest move may have been associating the film with J-rock star Gackt as his tireless publicity efforts over the last few weeks seem to have garnered the most attention from the mainstream press there.<br><br>The Top 10 in Japan for the weekend of May 28-29:<br>1) Negotiator Masayoshi Mashita<br>2) Million Dollar Baby<br>3) Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam -Heirs To The Stars-<br>4) Kingdom Of Heaven<br>5) Memorial Of Flame (aka Ladder 49)<br>6) The Interpreter<br>7) Shall We Dance?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Closer<br>9) Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events<br>10) The Mask 2 (aka Son Of The Mask)  Â¶ 1:17 PM<br><br>Clear HGUC Gundam Mk II sold out<br>Sunrise stuck up a notice on their site saying that the limited edition, clear version of the HGUC Gundam MK II available at theaters showing the Zeta movie is sold out.
