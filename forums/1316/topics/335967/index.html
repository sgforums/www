              <p>Moved here a month or so ago and luckily I found out about some local hobby shops through this site.  So I bought some paint and got to work!  Unfortunately, I screwed up on the blue (= blue + white + transparent neon pink).  The trans.neon pink started floating to the top when mark softer was applied and also when the clear coat was being sprayed.  ah well... didn't want to spend money on another set of decals...</p>
              <p>Enjoy!</p>

              <p>Thanks so much!  I'm waiting for the 1/100 too.  But maybe I'll wait till the season's over and see if they release the Seven Swords variant. </p>

              <p>I ordered the decals from mr. devil off the hong kong model league page (http://www.hkml.net - the page is in Chinese - but you could also find him via http://www.samueldecals.com).  His decals are quite nice, but not precut.</p>

              <p>I think that the seven sword variant is too good <em>not</em> to be made... chances are it would be featured in the season as well...</p>
              <p>Is shipping the decals expensive? Oh and what did you use to do the panel lines?</p>

              <p>I understand that airbrushing is not feasible for a lot of people.  In fact, many people I know who have kids or complaining neighbours have difficulties finding the right place to airbrush.  It was a big hassle to paint when I used to live with my parents too.  But luckily most kits nowadays look great with just some basic sanding/ gluing (to eliminate the seams) + decals and maybe if possible, a coat of matte/flat clear. </p>
              <p>For example, this member only used gundam markers + decals + flat clear!  Still, the kit looks just as good as if it had been completely finished.</p>

              <p>Decals could be purchased through Samueldecals.com. Shipping for the decals depends on postal service you want - I bought two sets of decals for a total of US$6.  By regular mail from HK to Singapore, the total would be US$7.60 (so US$1.60).  If you prefer registered mail, it would be $9.60 --&gt; US$3.60 for shipping.</p>
              <p>For the wash, i used black enamel thinned with lighter fluid on major ducts and black + german gray for the panels.</p>

              <p>The trick to not staining the surfaces is to have a smooth surface.  I usually spend quite a bit of time making sure each piece is sanded down properly and I spray quite "wet" so my surfaces remain smooth.  If you spray dry (e.g. lower paint:thinner ratio or if you spray with high pressure), it's probably better to first spray a coat of gloss clear coat before doing the wash. </p>
              <p>if you don't paint, then you don't have to worry about the surface.  just make sure you have lots of cotton swabs/q-tips handy, a bottle of lighter fluid (i don't like tamiya x-20 thinner - that stuff weakens the plastic a lot and causes cracking), and lots of tissue paper.  i usually just take a few drips of paint, thin it out with lighter fluid (which evaporates really fast, so you have to keep adding) and do the wash.  once it's semi-dry, i dip the cotton swabs into clean lighter fluid and wipe away the excess.  it works really well on and makes unpainted kits look quite good actually.</p>
              <p>Pigment pens are great too - especially alcohol based ones.  I sometimes use those (gray though, black is too strong) and before it's completely dry, i dip a cotton swab in some rubbing alcohol, dry it up slightly, then lightly brush perpendicular to the panel line to get a milder effect.  But it's just hard getting to certain spots with a pen/marker.</p>

              <p>Wow... it's easier than what i've saw in a couple of those hobby
              mags... i think i'll give it a try real soon... but do you wipe the
              lighter fluid over unpainted parts, like as finishing?</p>
              <p>Oooo.... must try, think i'll also borrow my friend's
              airbrush... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>What you do is you put the black/grey paint into a mixing dish (or
              paper/styrofoam cup) and drench it with lighter fluid, mixing it until
              it's runny/watery, but still colors the cup (it'll be obvious when you
              swish it around). then, take a small brush, dip it in until you have a
              water bead on the brush, slightly touch the panel line and the paint
              will run into the line. the place where you touched the brush will of
              course smear a bit, but just have another dish of clean lighter fluid
              and q-tips/cotton swabs, dip it in, and wipe off the excess - voila!
              done! </p>
              <p>2nd method (only if you're confident your pieces are
              smooth and no seams): take a large brush, wipe the whole piece with
              that same paint/lighter fluid mixture, then clean off with clean
              lighter fluid.  both ways work, one's more messy but takes less time</p>
              <p>There should be some Gunpra Tsukurou videos on Youtube which show the whole process too!  (search Pramo/Plamo Tsukurou or ãƒ—ãƒ©ãƒ¢ä½œã‚�ã�†)</p>

              <p>the only way is to use clear colors to paint transparent parts.  Those are available in both spray cans and bottle form. If you are painting by brush, make sure you thin it out sufficiently since most transparent colours are quite thick and take a long time to dry.</p>
