            <div class='col-md body'>after watching the last episode, i am convinced that the akatsuki gundam is a very powerful gundam, possibly one of the top five in the series.i mean, it has two packs with which it can dock with, the oowashi and the shiranui pack.witht the oowashi, it becomes like a justice gundam, except that its pack can tranform into a fighter and with the shiranui pack, it becomes like a legend gundam wannabe with a dragoon system of 7 pods which can bothe attack well and defend well by creating a beam shield.it was after watching the last episode that i found it to be truly amazing.imean not even the providence or the legend can form a shield with its dragoons.this plus the fact that it has some sort of anti beam coating makes it a very good gundam.it is a pity that we did not see more of it in action and it is a shame that neo used it in the last few episodes.cagalli really made the gundam look bad.i believe that had athrun piloted the gundam, the destiny gundam would have been long defeated.</div>

Many mysteries explained!<br><a href="http://blog.yam.com/ekliptiko/archives/655916.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.yam.com/ekliptiko/archives/655916.html</a><br><br>Another Chinese Traditional translation from the nice guy at that website, this time for "GSD 20 questions" on 2005 Nov Animage magazine.<br><br>Don't have time to translate due to my exams, but we did get confirmation that each PLANT colony housed 500000 people, with about 100 Plants. This makes 50 million in total.<br><br>Human characters are named by Fukuda's wife.<br><br>The MS weapon naming rules are thus:<br>ZAFT uses Latin and Italian.<br>EA uses English and German<br>European/Asian department of EA uses French.<br><br>The fact that ZAFT forces have no clear ranks was an idea borrowed from the old Israel army...<br><br>Messiah was built from a hollowed former mining asteroid.<br><br>The Red Haro was imitated from the other Haros left at Lacus' old home. Lacus only took the Pink-chan with her.<br><br>The armour of Akatsuki was too expensive to build more than one, and no, that's NOT gold foil.<br><br>Rey is another clone of Al Da Fllaga, but his fetus was not "woken up" until much later. Rey has no genetic differences to Rau. (which means he wasn't an improved model, and likely have the same genetic illnesses that plagued Rau.)<br><br>Neo had false memories implanted, though how the Mu memory went is unknown.<br><br>The "Angel Bath" had the mineral salts of the bath water imported from ORB.<br><br>SEED is mostly activated by extreme stress. Like sudden bursts of strength people get in emergencies. The script made it impossible for anyone but the younger soldiers to go SEED. So there is an age component as well symbolising "bright future".<br><br>Confirmed importrant: Coordinators partners had genetic clashes with each other in their fetus/fertilised egg, lowering chances of a sucessful pregnancy. Genetic compatability has now become a requirement for marrying legally in PLANT, which means there is no such thing as true love in PLANT legal society anymore. Ironically, Patrick Zala was one of those people who believed that science will solve everything, and don't believe interbreeding with Naturals is a good solution. Gilbert was actually one of the Geneticists hired by Patrick Zala to help solve the genetic birth issues.<br><br>What is Destiny Plan?<br>A world where everyone had their life determined genetically. There will be no conflicts because there won't need to be arguments on how things should be done. Gilbert had in mind Destiny Plan working with the people following ir by choice. He didn't plan to force his plans on people.<br>(My notes: THAT's the problem. Gilbert had wanted everyone to choice his plan, yet still free to choice what they wished. That doesn't make sense... It's like saying everyone can freely vote for the ruler, as long as they all vote for ME.)<br><br>What happens to the PLANT government now?<br>No offical agreement, but the production crew believe Yzak had a good chance to take over. Regadless of his personality, Yzak is respected in PLANT high society.<br><br>(I don't translate everything, because some of it... Like info on Terminal... is common knowlege by now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from gunota<br><br>Originally Posted by Gunota Headlines<br>Destiny Special Editions, SEED OVA confirmed UPDATED<br>Bandai Visual's site put up a listing for Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Special Edition: The Broken World, which goes on sale May 26th.<br><br>And returning once again to the rumor mill, a post on 2ch contained what appears to be a copy &amp; paste of a sales solicitation for the Destiny Special Edition stating that the Destiny SE's will be 4-parts rather than the traditional 3 for Gundam compilations. Also mentioned is that the Special Edition will be broadcast on TV sometime this Spring. But the bigger potential news is the following detail: "The SEED boom heats up! OVA 'Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73 Stargazer (tentative title)' currently being planned!"<br><br>Edit: The listing for the SE at Aishin Mail Order's Rakuten site confirms all the above information.<br><br><a href="http://aeug.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://aeug.blogspot.com/</a></div>
