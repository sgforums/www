              <p>but I'm not sure I would recommend something that small.  It does goto 50psi, but it's a bit noisy and does not have auto-cut.  Pressure is controlled through an external regulator valve which is essentially just this ghetto screw/valve mechanism that controls how much air goes into the tube (no water filter).  However, if you are interested, it's definitely under $100... but I'll have to bring it over from HK after I go there for a business trip around the end of November.</p>

              <p>Yep it does get quite hot.  It does the job though.</p>
              <p>one thing i found very surprising about SG - the mark-up on airbrushes is crazy.. it's probably because of the shipping/taxes.  but some of these chinese made/taiwanese made airbrushes do not cost that much (e.g. retail $1xx~$2xx HKD = $30~50 SG ).  I wonder how much shops here would've charged for an olympos brush back when those were still available...</p>

              <p>wow. sounds just like an air can. haha! and air can's wad im using now. hmm. by how u said it, i think it's after all better investing in a better one right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh. i got an olympos airbrush for 40 bucks off ebay recently. heard its better than an iwata right? i cant really feel how good it is with an air can. haha!</p>

              <p>olympos and iwata are pretty much on par with each other - some users prefer olympos (which i think has better balance and a smoother trigger) but some people live by iwata.  No choice now anyway... olympos just folded.  But they're definitely good brushes!  $40 is a great deal!  They're usually US$100+ new. </p>
              <p>As for the compressor, it is kind of like an air can, except with noise.  The only reason I suggested this one is b/c of your budget concern - i think in the long run, this is slightly cheaper than air cans (?).  The ones they sell here in singapore for $150+ (w/o autocut, $200 with) only go to around 25psi and don't come with an airtank - which means, it's practically doing the same thing but weaker.  For gundams, 25psi is ample (except for maybe say... the 1/144 dendrobium or similar large kits).  Ideally, you want one that can goto around 50psi /w an adjustment valve if you need to spray large areas, autocut, airtank, filter etc... but that seems to cost a lot here in SG.</p>

              <p>the only thing im not satisfied with my olympos is it's paint capacity (1ml?!) but ya cant really judge anything cos that's my first and only airbrush.</p>
              <p>yeah. if this is the case i guess im better off investing in a better one. since im going for ns next year i guess the painting can wait. the cheapest compressor i saw looked like the one u have and is sold at $180. anything better jumps immediately to $300+ .</p>
              <p>but isit necessary to have a filter? i know autocuts and air tanks are good features that i should look out for. there are also others who suggest renting a carbon dioxide tank from soft drink distributors but i definitely dont want such a big thing occupying my room. haha!</p>

              <p>yes, definitely go for a better one if you can wait.  filters are required b/c as i understand it, people here usually spray with their windows open.  the humidity here is quite high and you don't want water droplets mixing with your paint (since you're compressing air, you will have some condensation). </p>
              <p>the other option - turn up the air conditioner (and also turn it on 15 mins before you paint).</p>
