            <div class='col-md body'>from animesuki forum<br><br>Phase-49, "Rey", episode summary<br>Phew! What a frantic episode! This ep should have been called "Mwu" not "Rey" though<br><br><span style="color: white;">Things get going VERY quickly. The AA and Eternal link up, and Lacus and Meyrin have moved over to Eternal. The whole lot are heading towards where Requiem is - the AA and Eternal will attack the first relay point while the Orb ships go for the Requiem cannon itself. Meanwhile, Rey and Shinn transfer over to Messiah. Kira and Athrun launch in SF and IJ (from Eternal), and dock with METEOR.<br><br>OP: nothing new<br><br>The group are approaching the relay point (with easy visual distance) and many ZAFT ships go out to intercept. Lacus gives a broadcast that telling them to make way - WMD are basically for mass killing not for protection and shouldn't exist. The situation is basically a speed battle - Kira and Athrun go out with the METEORs first (they're faster) and are actually going through the ZAFT forces (without firing), until the commander of the group says that (Orb/Eternal) are part of LOGOS. So, battle starts.<br><br>Kira and Athrun fire away with METEOR - mostly going for disables, though they chop bits of ships too (eg engines, or just the bridge). Apart from making mincemeat of everything, SF and IJ don't do anything special this ep.<br><br>Meanwhile, Shinn and Rey are on Messiah and go to talk with Gilbert - and find out the battle is in high gear already. Gilbert doesn't say too much - he starts off by asking Shinn if he's okay since he doesn't look too well. Rey talks a bit about trying to end the war - that Orb/Clyne-faction are LOGOS-wannabes and won't listen to reason (  ) so have to be destroyed to create a world without war. Shinn still seems uncertain and has a bit of a flashback from the previous ep, when Rey told him he was a clone. However, the flashback continues, and we see Rey say that he wasn't created because someone wanted him, but was more for Kira's sake - basically, Rey was a test baby for the artificial wombs (made by Kira's biological father), and nothing more. Rey has no father or mother and feels like he is more of a lab rat to be discarded (would be my guess). I don't think Rey mentions the ultimate Coordinator project directly though.<br><br>Anyway, Shinn reflects a bit more on things and then says clearly that he is certain about fighting for Gilbert / Destiny Plan.<br><br>Meanwhile, Yzak and Deaka are near the relay point and Yzak is getting increasingly worked up about what Athrun is doing (and wants to hit him) but Deaka is much more relaxed and seems to understand. Yzak launches with Deaka (and tells the captain of the Nazca-class ship they're on not to move in to attack else he'll die).<br><br>The DOM Troopers launch from Eternal and quickly stomp on the ZAFT forces. Mwu also launches in Akatsuki with the DRAGOON pack and takes out ZAFT MS rapidly.<br><br>Kira and Athrun have reached the relay point but before they can attack it, a large number of shots come their way - from Minerva and some other ships. The Archangel (and Eternal) moves to attack Minerva. Talia doesn't really want to attack the AA (or rather, feels she understands Murrue), but decides they must for what she believes in, and for ZAFT's pride.<br><br>Lunamaria in Impulse launches and goes to attack Eternal, but Meyrin guesses her sister is in that MS and calls her and asks why is she fighting - the real Lacus-sama is here etc. Lunamaria is shocked and doesn't attack. Then the DOM pilots do a Jet Stream Attack on her - but Lunamaria survives and isn't too damaged.<br><br>The Minerva gets in a good position and prepares to fire the main cannon. The AA and Eternal try to get out of the way but it's no good... when Mwu/Akatsuki jumps in the way to protect the AA. Mwu suddenly has a lot of flashbacks of Mwu from SEED (and a few as Neo from GSD), and has one scene showing him covered in bandages with Djbriel looking over him. Looks like all/most of Mwu's memories come back. Though Akatsuki didn't reflect the shot from the Minerva, it is disserpated completely and Mwu then takes out the cannon with a rifle shot (somewhat like Kira did in phase-22). Mwu then uses ALL of the DRAGOONs (he only used 3 the first time). He also calls the AA bridge to say he's not going anywhere "Murrue" (calls her by her first name). Ahh, sweet. Mwu then uses Akatsuki's DRAGOONs to form a barrier around the AA to protect it. Damn, Akatsuki sure is strong!<br><br>Yzak and Deaka reach Athrun and though Yzak is really annoyed, he agrees that the relay point is something that should be destroyed. Kira and Athrun then use the super huge beam sabers on METEOR to slice up the relay point. However, it seems like there might be another relay point in a useful position (I think that's where the other ships with the Eternal went to), and Requiem cannon itself is still okay.<br><br>On Messiah (which has been slowly approaching the Moon during the ep), Shinn and Rey are close to launching, when Rey informs Shinn about the latest developments. He also says Lunamaria is okay and that Shinn doesn't have to worry so much since she's strong. He also says that the AA and co have destroyed the first relay point and will likely come here (to Messiah).<br><br>Meanwhile, the Orb ships do an attack run on Requiem cannon itself, using their positron cannons... but it has a beam shield (looks like the ones the EA forces have - was it there before or did ZAFT setup a new one?).<br><br>Messiah then comes into view with the sun behind it. It is also equpied with a "Neo GENESIS" cannon (Gilbert has quite a collection of WMDs now), which is fired to take out the Orb ships attacking Requiem (not sure if all of them, or just some). Looks like the fire power is smaller than the original GENESIS though - hard to say for sure.<br><br>Shinn and Rey launch in Destiny and Legend and go to attack. Kira and Athrun leave the METEORs behind (too clunky for one-on-one I guess). Rey gets the last scene and says (to himself) that he can't forgive Kira's existance, and is suddenly a picture of Rau is shown. (incidentally, Rey did mention earlier in the ep that his "original" tried to kill everyone, and Rey didn't seem to approve of that but seems to understand why Rau might have done that).<br><br>Final ep is "The Final Power" (though might be better way to translate it depend on what actually happens). Freedom gets the special mention.<br><br>Hmm, the extended preview doesn't have any new scenes it seems (just trying to not give away too much of the plot perhaps?).</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: white;">Pre-OP: Heavy fighting is already going on around Messiah, which has a large shield around it. The Eternal and AA are there, and many MS are being launched. The Minerva is near the AA, attacking. We never see this shield put up or what - it's like 5 mins have been dropped since the end of the last ep.<br><br>Anyway, Athrun (non-SEED mode) is worried about the Requiem being fired at Orb, with the backup relay stations - he says this while dodging Rey's DRAGOONs. Kira tells Athrun (since Justice should be able to get past the shield) and the AA to go to Requiem itself and take it out - he'll handle the fortress (Messiah). Kira says this while launching his DRAGOONs and roughing up Destiny a bit - Kira is non-SEED mode too. The Eternal stays - and Lacus says that Orb is more important than the Eternal. Mwu's Akatsuki uses the DRAGOON shield to protect Eternal while this is going on. Yzak decides to help protect the Eternal since it's a ZAFT ship. The 3 DOM Troopers do another Jet Stream Attack.<br><br>As Justice and the AA leave, Rey goes after them, and Kira launches SF's DRAGOONs on him, and Rey dodges after having a NewType reaction (sound effect and visual effect). Shinn comes charging in to help Rey, and Kira goes SEED mode, and fires SF's chest cannon to neutralise Destiny's cannon. Rey tells Shinn to go after Athrun and the AA - he'll take care of Freedom. As Kira watches Shinn leave, he has a NT reaction (same as Rey) and dodges Rey's DRAGOONs. As Kira continues to fight Rey, he looks rather shocked as he has a lot of brief flashbacks about Rau - doesn't get what's going on. (seems to me that Kira going SEED mode helps his NT strength - notice in earlier eps he senses Mwu *only* when in SEED mode). SF and Legend clash beam sabers and Rey says it's time to end it all.<br><br>OP: No changes.<br><br>Phase-50 "The Final Power" begins.<br><br>Kira and Rey are having an intense DRAGOON battle, and Kira gets one of Legend's DRAGOONs, but wonders how this can be (that he's fighting "Rau" again).<br><br>Justice and Akatsuki are fighting together, taking out ZAFT grunts - particularly Mwu who is now using all the DRAGOONs to attack (he was only using 3 before regaining his memory) and comments that the situation is difficult, but all ZAFT have are superior numbers.<br><br>AA takes out a Nazca ship. Murrue tells the Orb ships to recover their formation and says they're going to take out the shield on Requiem. Meanwhile, Minerva fires a load of missiles at the AA, and the AA retaliates. Meanwhile, Lunamaria takes out a Murasame and some grunt, and Justice is right behind them. Lunmaria looks nervous about facing Athrun and has a bunch of flashbacks about Athrun. She also remembers what Meyrin said in the previous ep - she then decides to attack a reluctant Athrun, and is angry about what he did to Meyrin. Athrun easily takes out one of Impulse's arms and legs and then Shinn comes in, shouting at the "traitorous" Athrun.<br><br>Lunamaria is happy to see Shinn, who angrily attacks Athrun. They both clash a bit and Shinn goes SEED mode. Shinn fires Destiny's thrusters on full power and pushes Athrun down towards the Moon's surface.<br><br>Back to Kira and Rey clashing. Kira says "who are you?" to Rey, while having a brief flashback of fighting Rau. Rey comments "I figured you could tell - I am Rau le Cluset" and Kira is (unsurprisingly) shocked, but still dodges all of Rey's DRAGOON spam. Rey is getting rather intense, and continues to press Kira, who is still shocked. Rey says that Kira is the "wonderful" result of people's dreams and future - which is why Kira must die, along with "us" (Rey and Rau?), so that the world can change. Meanwhile, on the Eternal, Lacus suddenly looks up shocked, in SEED mode (!!) and says "Kira!".<br><br>Rey has a flashback to 2 years ago, when Gilbert says that Rau is no longer around (ie, is dead), but says "You are also Rau" and hands Rey that bottle of blue/white pills, and Gilbert says "That is your destiny".<br><br>Meanwhile, Lunamaria is looking on worried as Athrun and Shinn are having a high speed battle. Athrun (non SEED mode) breaks Destiny's sword - and clearly has the edge against SEED mode Shinn.<br><br>Kira and Rey are briefly shown in battle and Kira is still shocked and confused, wondering why Rau is back. There is some talk from Gilbert and Rau (I think) about how they are cursed and the past can't come back - it's like all this is mixed in with what Kira and Rey are thinking. A brief cut shows Athrun handling Destiny's beam boomerangs easily. Kira says "That's wrong!" and takes out some more of Legend's DRAGOONs. Kira continues "Each life is separate/individual. So, that's why you are not him!" - Kira says this with a lot of intensity. Rey is shown looking rather shocked. Kira goes full beam spam and heavily damages Legend, and in the cockpit Rey takes damage.<br><br>Ad break.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Minerva has gotten behind the AA, and Murrue asks where Athrun is - he's stuck fighting Shinn. Mwu says he'll go and asks the remaining Murasame squad to come with him.<br><br>Meanwhile an angry Shinn fires Destiny's cannon at Justice, who safely blocks. Athrun yells at Shinn to stop fighting while being trapped in the past, which surprises both Shinn and Lunamaria. Athrun continues - even if you do that, nothing will come back (and has flashbacks of his mother and Nicole). Shinn shouts back angrily but Lunamaria looks a bit subdued. Athrun says "Are you going to go so far as to kill the future!?" (ie with the Destiny Plan), and Shinn goes wide-eyed. Athrun continues "Is THAT the power you wanted!?". Requiem (with beam shield around the cannon) is briefly shown being aligned with another relay point.<br><br>Shinn is getting really stressed, and has brief flashbacks of things he, Rey and Athrun said. He then charges forward very angrily preparing to use Destiny's palm cannon. Lunamaria suddenly puts herself in-between, telling both of them to stop fighting. Shinn continues to attack screaming incoherantly, and looks set to crush Impulse. Athrun then goes SEED mode.<br><br>Justice blocks the attack and Athrun screams at Shinn "You damn fool!!". Athrun goes full melee attack on Destiny and damages it very heavily. Destiny goes crashing down onto the Moon's surface. Lunamaria goes down to where Shinn is, and Athrun decides to leave.<br><br>Mwu is having trouble fighting against so many MS enemies. He yells at them why are they fighting to protect such a thing.<br><br>Minerva damages the AA a bit and the fight between them is getting intense. The AA does a "barrel roll" effectively (easy in space) and uses the Valiants to strike Minerva, damaging it heavily. Athrun turns up and uses Justice's launcher pack to take out all/most of Minerva's engines (cool move!). The Minerva goes crashing onto the Moon's surface.<br><br>The scene switches to Gilbert in Messiah. Station-2 (for Requiem) is almost in position. Gilbert orders the Neo GENESIS to target the Orb ships, and asks what's happened to Legend and Destiny. In Legend's cockpit, Rey is shown with blood on his face and a large hole in his helmet. Gilbert is told they've lost the signal to both MS. Freedom is approaching Messiah. Gilbert is surprised Rey was gotten too. In Legend's cockpit, Rey wakes up.<br><br>Gilbert comments that they really are a troublesome existance - Lacus Clyne and Kira Yamato, but that they'll have to leave finishing them off for later. Meanwhile, Kira takes a METEOR from Eternal (where they'd been since undocking in the previous ep). Rey slowly moves Legend towards Messiah.<br><br>Gilbert orders Neo GENESIS to fire at the Orb fleet, and a evacuate order is given to the ZAFT ships... but not really in time. Yzak tells the Eternal to get out of the way (since he still gets ZAFT communications) - Lacus is still in SEED mode btw. The AA, Justice and Akatsuki are okay from the blast, but some Nazca-class and others are hit - from the Orb fleet I think. However, some proper ZAFT ships are hit too and Talia is really shocked at this, as is Yzak and Deaka. Rey smiles.<br><br>A countdown to Requiem firing is given. Cagalli is shown in Orb, looking composed but tense.<br><br>The top of the Requiem cannon moves down to prepare to fire. Justice and Akatsuki charge forwards and both MS are able to pass through the barrier around it, with a bit of difficulty (I guess Justice's beam shield and Akatsuki's beam reflector stuff help neutralise Requiem's shield). Athrun uses Justice's lifter pack and Akatsuki uses the DRAGOONs to blow up the cannon, and then they escape from the explosion.<br><br>Meanwhile, Shinn is floating naked in space with his eyes closed. Stellar's voice is heard, and her ghost appears (like Fllay from SEED phase-50). Shinn says she shouldn't come to a place like this, and Stellar says she just wanted to see Shinn for a bit - for now. Shinn is surprised at the "for now", and Stellar says "see you again tomorrow", and Shinn says "tomorrow?" I can't quite figure out what Stellar says, but it's something like "I already have today, so I'm happy, so see you again tomorrow". Stellar leaves saying "see you tomorrow".<br><br>Impulse is shown next to Destiny on the Moon's surface as in the distance Requiem's cannon is blown up. Gilbert is shocked at this. The AA, Justice and Akatsuki are all okay. Lunamaria has taken Shinn out from Legend and he's sort of lying in her lap, asleep. Lunamaria is shocked at Requiem being blown up. Shinn wakes up saying "Stellar...?". Shinn opens his eyes to see Lunamaria and she hugs him happily. Shinn then notices the blown up Requiem blast. Lunamaria says that Orb wasn't hit, and Shinn wakes up a bit more at this.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kira uses METEOR's super beam saber to cut into Messiah a bit (how did he get past the shield?). SF and Eternal both start pounding on Messiah big time, now that the shield is gone. SF goes inside and goes full beam spam (with METEOR) from in there. The room in which Gilbert is in it hit. Shinn sees this and starts crying and hugs Lunamaria. He cries heavily and Lunamaria hugs him.<br><br>On the Minerva, Talia looks on. Talia orders the ship to be abandoned. On the AA, Murrue salutes the Minerva/Talia. Talia orders Athur to take care of everyone else - she has to go somewhere.<br><br>In Messiah, Kira walks into the room where Gilbert was. It's heavily damaged. As Kira walks towards the center, Gilbert swings he chair around and stands up. He says he never expected Kira to come here / to come this far. Kira points a gun at Gilbert, who says "I see, but are you sure about that?" and points a gun at Kira. Rey is running through Messiah. A shuttle carrying Talia heads into Messiah.<br><br>Gilbert tells Kira not to try, since the world will simply go to what it was like before (ie full of wars). Kira says "That may be so, but people can choose a different path". Gilbert says that won't happen, since people forget the mistakes of the past and repeat them. Gilbert says how could Kira possibly believe such a thing would actually happen - and says he (Kira) and Lacus couldn't say such a thing WILL happen, because they don't understand anything.<br><br>Rey appears behind a wall, behind Kira and Gilbert notices. Kira says he knows that too, but that's why they want a tomorrow - that a world without change would be horrible. This seems to affect Rey. Gilbert says Kira sure is concieted - just what he'd expect from the Ultimate Coordinator. Kira says that it's Gilbert who is concieted - he (Kira) is simply a single human, and everyone is the same, but that is why he (Kira) has to shoot Gilbert. As he's saying this, Talia walks into the room, carrying a gun, and notices Kira pointing a gun at Gilbert.<br><br>Gilbert then asks Kira which would people prefer - the world Gilbert wants or the current world. Kira says "I am prepared for that" and is about to shoot and Rey looks set to shoot too. Kira says "I will fight!" and a shot is heard.<br><br>Kira is shown looking shocked and surprised, as is Talia. Gilbert falls over with a large wound in his chest. It was Rey who shot Gilbert! He looks rather stressed and shocked that he did it. Rey starts crying. Talia walks over to where Gilbert is... while Messiah continues to fall apart.<br><br>In her lap, Gilbert looks up and says "Hi... Talia - were you the one who shot?" Talia says no - it was Rey. Rey is still crying and says "Sorry, but tomorrow is..." Kira seems uncertain about what to do and Talia points a gun at him and tells him to go - she'll take care of Gilbert's soul. Talia tells Kira to tell Murrue that - and that she has a child, a boy, and she hopes they meet someday. Kira says he understands and leaves. Gilbert looks up at Talia and apologies, but says that he's happy. Talia calls him hopeless (in a fond way), and says it couldn't be helped - since it's their destiny. Gilbert says to stop that (^-^).<br><br>Talia then calls Rey over. Meanwhile, Kira runs back and gets into SF. As everyone else (outside Messiah) looks on at the fortress falling apart, Talia hugs Rey and says "You did well... so it's okay." and Rey says "mother...".<br><br>Messiah starts collapsing in a major way and falls onto the moon's surface. Kira looks on from SF. Lunamaria and Shinn look on from near their MS. The end-song starts playing. Various scenes of beaten up MS and ship are shown. As the ED plays various clips from the series are shown in B&amp;W. At the end, SF is seen launching and posing, and that's it.<br><br>The last frame shown is Impulse and Destiny beaten up with the text "Thank you".<br><br>So... instead of a "kill 'em all" ending, only Gilbert, Talia and Rey die. Everyone else (including the DOM pilots) are okay. The MS vs MS battles were nice and intense. Not quite sure what the title of this ep is refering to - maybe hope about tomorrow?</span></div>
