            <div class='col-md body'>I just finished my first gundam model kit MG Strike Freedom. Took 2 days and 10 hours in total  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> . Encountered quite alot of problems so will like to seek help from the pros here by asking a list of questions. Please put up with my noob questions and thanks for helping  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .<br><br>1. What equipments do you use when fixing a gundam model kit?<br>Cutting parts from runner -&gt; Pliers(or is there better alternative?)<br>Trimming the nubs -&gt; Penknife not very effective when trimming hard nubs and left some unsightly marks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>Holding small parts -&gt; Twizzers but can't seem to hold on to small parts properly<br><br>2. Do you put stickers on the model?<br>Saw quite alot of websites that discourage putting stickers so for now I haven paste anything on my model yet. (I'm planning to put decals)<br><br>3. Do you file or sand the nubs?What grit do you use?<br>I bought 1000grit sandpaper but haven use yet<br><br>4. Are the fingers strong enough to hold the weapons?<br>I tried putting the rifles and swords on the model hands but it's very loose.<br><br>5. What brand and model marker do you recommend for panelling?<br><br>6. Do you fill up the seams with putty?<br><br>7. Do you protect your model with spray finishing?<br><br>That's all I can think of for now. Will post more questions if I thought of it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> . Below is a picture of my model that is just completed.

            <div class='col-md body'>wouldn't consider myself a pro, but for equipment, i just use the cutter for the runners then cut off most of the excess and then use knife to trim a bit..<br>stickers wise, its up to u actually, if u r gd in painting stuff like eyes then dun need to use, stickers main purpose is for those who dun want to paint thier model and use a gundam marker for paneling..thats all<br>for MG Strike Freedom, i notice that there is a slot for the hands to hold the weapons. dun tighten the fingers too much on the weapon and shld stay ok.<br>hope this helps...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, likely to see that stickers dun really work well for models. They leave marks and plus, if ya want to shoot good photos, the stickers will reflect the light and make a rather weird/bad lighting.<br>So its best to use decals.<br>Gundam markers, depend on ya likes, some ppl dun like to use Gundam markers and use permanent OHP markers instead. Depends really on style. I use Gundam markers.<br>Otherwise the strike Freedom is really fun to make and pose around, if got time can buy some decals from model stores that has the ZAFT and ORB Union logos, I have both on my SF and looks pretty cool...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. What equipments do you use when fixing a gundam model kit?<br>Cutting parts from runner -&gt; Pliers(or is there better alternative?)<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Ans: i use plier. it's the best choice for all modelers.</strong></span><br><br>Trimming the nubs -&gt; Penknife not very effective when trimming hard nubs and left some unsightly marks<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ans: i use penknife and i am very satistified with the result. </span></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Holding small parts -&gt; Twizzers but can't seem to hold on to small parts properly<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ans: i use my hands. just be extra careful.</span></strong><br><br>2. Do you put stickers on the model?<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ans: i only put on decals and i try to aviod putting sticker cos as time past, dust will collect inside the sticker and make the model looks dirty and sticky.<br><br>i always believe simple is beautiful. a few decals will do. over putting too much also not nice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></strong><br><br>3. Do you file or sand the nubs?What grit do you use?<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ans: i don't do sanding. no time.</span></strong><br><br>4. Are the fingers strong enough to hold the weapons?<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ans: Good question. MG hands are indeed not strong enough to hold the weapons, especially rifles. that's why i use double sided tape to take the weapons to the hands.</span></strong><br><br>5. What brand and model marker do you recommend for panelling?<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ans: oil based extra fine Gundam marker from japan. $3.90. easy to use and erasable.  </span></strong><br><br>6. Do you fill up the seams with putty?<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ans: No. that's require lots of skills.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  </span></strong><br><br>7. Do you protect your model with spray finishing?<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ans: No. </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway killtuna judging from the pic and the fact that this is your first model, it's considered very well done. i don't see any stubs around (or maybe because the pic is a bit blur).<br><br>good work anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to the hand holding weapons problem, I think some of the newer models have been designed with small holes in the weapon grips and plugs in the hands so that you can fit them together securely. That's the case for my Mk II ver 2.0. Sorry no pics though.<br><br>By the way, I use Gundam marker for panelling and I hardly ever put stickers (except for the eyes) or decals. I feel that the models look nicer without these things.</div>
