She reported back that Dick was likely suffering from swim bladder disease and prescribed a diet of cooked peas to be hand fed to Dick three times a day, Sherman said.<br><br>To remedy Dick's swimming problem, several customers devised a sling made up of fishing bobbers, drinking straws, gauze and string. When the 8-inch-long fish is placed in the sling, he's able to swim like normal.<br><br>Sherman said customers find it relaxing to sit at the counter and watch Dick in his tank.<br><br>"Everybody's rooting for him," she said Tuesday. "He's the topic of conversation at the Sky Port."<br><br></div>

He wanted to live. He saved himself," Sgt. Mitch Vetere of the Emery County Sheriff's Office in Green River, Utah, told Reuters.<br><br>Aron Ralston, 27, of Aspen, Colorado, used a pocketknife to cut off his arm below the elbow, then rappelled down a rock wall and hiked until he ran into some hikers who flagged down a rescue helicopter 60 miles south of Green River on Thursday. He had applied a tourniquet to his arm.<br><br>Vetere said Ralston would never have been spotted in the remote area where he was pinned by the boulder, which rescuers estimated at between 800 and 1,000 pounds.<br><br>Ralston was hiking into a canyon on Saturday when the boulder fell on him. He ran out of water on Tuesday and by Thursday realized he had to take the drastic action.<br><br>He was in serious condition on Friday at St. Mary's Hospital in western Colorado, spokeswoman Kim Williams said.<br><br>A rescuer who went back to see if he could retrieve the arm said the boulder was too heavy to move, according to Vetere.<br><br></div>
