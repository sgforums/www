This IWSP (or possibly the same one for the Strike Rouge) is later mounted on Waid Rabby Nadaga's Slaughter Dagger.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striker_Pack" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striker_Pack</a><br><br>AQM/E-X09S Noir Striker: Designed for the GAT-X105E Strike Noir. The Noir Striker is conceptually similar to the IWSP in that it combines the primary capabilities of the Aile, Sword and Launcher strikers. It is a flight pack mounting two anti-ship beam swords, two railguns, and a rocket anchor.<br><br>Orb Union (CE 71)<br>P202-QX IWSP Integrated Weapons Striker Pack: The IWSP was a PMP (Propulsion and Machinery Progess) design to combine the primary characteristics of the Aile, Sword and Launcher Striker Packs into a single unit. As such it was very heavy, very powerful and very, very expensive. It included two 9.1m anti-ship swords, similar to (and possibly inspired by) the "Gerbera Straight" katana used by the MBF-P02 Astray Red Frame, two 115mm rail guns, two 105mm cannons, one Midas Messer beam boomerang and a shield mounting a 30mm six-barrel Gatling cannon. It was never used because Cagalli Yula Athha was unable to master the complicated weapon controls in the short time between its completion and the war's end. After the war, the still incomplete IWSP was installed on the Strike Rouge for show - however, this led to some confusion and even resulted in some believing that the IWSP was actually used at Jachin Due. In CE 72, a second IWSP was built as a collaboration between PMP and Actaeon Industries, which was handed over to Phantom Pain and designated AQM/E-M1. This version included minor alterations, but the armament was unchanged. This second IWSP was installed on a GAT-01A2R Slaughter Dagger in CE 73 for use by an joint Phantom Pain/Orb force intended to hunt down the Martian crew of the Acidalium.</div>

If you watched Seed, when Archangel landed in the desert and Andrew Waltfield attacked them in the night, the Strike with Kira also encountered problems with balancing on the sand. All s not so well even in anime.<br>Stealth, the GAT-X207 Blitz (not my favourite though), but it still got destroyed when the Strike attempted to slice it as it tried to stop Athrun and Kira fighting, killing Nicol Amalfi in the worst way...<br>Agile, well, Strike was very agile when it first rollout (watch it fight the ZGMF-1017 Ginn with only Armor Schneiders). That was the best battle yet. And with the Aile Striker, its possibilities are very unlimited.<br>However, as time passes, the most agile Gundam had moved to Destiny, which also have 'Wings of Light' technology.<br>So, its really a great world of Gundam out there!</div>

The basic weight is 64.8 tons. If the compact reactor plus aile strike pack would mean around 40 tons of additional weight, totalling 104.8 tons.<br>Something like the Duel Assault Shrould, which is a heavy 103.47 tons.<br>I would not want a heavy Strike with more agility than a lighter one with less range. If the Strike is used in conjuction with the -X10A Freedom and -X09A Justice, then it would be more attacking capabilities.</div>
