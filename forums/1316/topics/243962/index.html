"Hyaku Shiki" is Japanese Kanji character "Â•SÂŽÂ®". In English means "Type 100".) is a mobile suit built by Anaheim Electronics as part of the "Project ÂƒÂ¤". It was originally designed as one of the prototypes for the MSZ-006 ÂƒÂ¤ Gundam by incorporating the "movable frame" technology found in the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II and back-pack wing binders for additional mobility, though defects in the frame design rendered it incapable of transforming to mobile armor mode. As a result, its design was revised to eliminate the failed transformation mechanisms. The Hyaku Shiki sported a gold-colored frame - a result of a beam resistant coating, and probably as a gesture of insult that such a mobile suit can be developed in secret despite the Titans, being also a customer of Anaheim, closely monitoring them.<br><br>This mobile suit was initially assigned to Quattro Bagina of the AEUG and remained in service until its abandonment during the end of the Gryps War, following a confrontation between Quattro Bagina and Haman Karn of the Axis camp. The AEUG space warship Argama later recovered the abandoned mobile suit but was never assigned to a permanent pilot.<br><br>A beam large cannon called the mega bazooka launcher was also designed by Anaheim for use by the Hyaku Shiki. While this weapon's power was sufficient to easily destroy a battleship with one shot, its power requirements were so high that a second mobile suit (usually the MSA-005 Methuss) had to attach power cables directly from its reactor to the mega bazooka launcher. A single shot from the launcher was sufficient to completely drain the reactor, requiring the Hyaku Shiki to carry the other mobile suit back to the hangar for refueling.<br><br>Hyaku Shiki first appear in episode 9 of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam A New Bond, design by Mamoru Nagano.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trivia<br>The in-series explanation for the Hyaku-Shiki is also true to life. Early in the design process, designer Nagano Mamoru submitted his idea for the Zeta Gundam, but it was rejected. The Transformation system seems to be defective for this unit, thus, he removed the transformation abilities and reworked the mobile suit, turning it into a high performance mobile suit.<br>Hyaku Shiki stands for 'Type 100' in Japanese; this is explained in-series as the designer hoping to create a mobile suit design that would endure for a hundred years.<br>In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny series, a suit belonging to the Orb Union, the Akatsuki, bears a striking resemblance to the Hyaku Shiki. This is probably a homage to the original Hyaku Shiki from Zeta Gundam.<br>In one of Doraemon movie, Nobita and the Platoon of Iron Men (Â‚ÃŒÂ‚Ã‘Â‘Â¾Â‚Ã†Â“SÂ�lÂ•ÂºÂ’c), feature giant robot called Zandacros which has very similar appearance to the Hyaku Shiki.<br></div>
