            <div class='col-md body'>UPDATED C.E.73 Stargazer updated its mechanic page with GSX-401 Stargazer and character page with Mudie Holcroft and Shams Couza.<br><br>GSX-401FW Stargazer<br>"The GSX-401FW Stargazer is a mobile suit developed independently by DSSD. Holding a neutral status with regards to both the Earth Alliance &amp; PLANT, DSSD created the unit as a non-combat mobile suit with the objective of exploring space beyond Mars. It's most notable features are the interplanetary propulsion system known as the Voiture Lumiere and its ability to be used largely unmanned thanks to its high degree of autonomy. The machine itself as well as its operation support system are collectively designated as 'Guider UNmanned Deployment Autonomic Manipulation'. The abbreviation for this is 'GUNDAM'."<br><br>Mudie Holcroft<br>"18-year-old female. Natural. Phantom Pain mobile suit pilot. Rank: 2nd Lieutenant. Belongs to the same MS platoon as Sven. Orphaned when she was very young and underwent complete training as a soldier for anti-Coordinator warfare at an institution for children. Her make-up is as eccentric as her personality. Always tense and even though she appears frank with others, that's only on the surface. She's missing an essential human sentiment and that mentality prevents her from understanding everyone else and, perhaps, herself as well. When in combat, she exterminates her enemies completely without mercy. Piloting the GAT-X1022 Blu Duel, she excels in close-combat."<br><br>Shams Couza<br>"19-year-old male. Natural. Phantom Pain mobile suit pilot. Rank: Lieutenant Junior Grade. Belongs to the same MS platoon as Sven. As with his comrades, orphaned when he was very young and underwent training as a soldier for anti-Coordinator warfare at an institution for children. A cynic who consistently views everything from a defiant standpoint. Flies the long-range artillery mobile suit GAT-X103AP Verde Buster but is an all-rounder who can also skillfully handle close combat. Wears glasses but these are just plano lenses for show as his eyesight seems to be fine."<br><br>Minor note: Bandai Channel's Stargazer page gives different dates for when the episodes will be made available than the ones announced last month.<br>Stage 1 - July 14 to August 18<br>Stage 2 - August 18 to September 22<br>Stage 3 - September 22 to October 10<br>Â¶ 3:32 AM<br><br>Frm Gunota</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>frm gunota<br><br>Stargazer site update<br>Profiles were updated on the mechanics and characters pages:<br><br>GAT-01A2R 105 Slaughter Dagger<br>"The GAT-01A2R 105 Slaughter Dagger is the primary mobile suit of Phantom Pain, the Earth Alliance forces' informal 81st Independent Mobile Battalion. The prototype was the Alliance's mass-production model 105 Dagger. Phantom Pain, being under Logos' direct control within the Earth Alliance and not the regular military's, has its own distinct criteria regarding choice of weaponry. As a result, they employ both the standard military's GAT-04 Windam as well as the 105 Slaughter Dagger. The unit has Phantom Pain's own minor changes from the original 105 Dagger, such as the use of the AQM/E-X01 Aile Striker as a standard armament. Developed for mid-range combat mobility, the Aile Striker equipment was battle-proven by the exploits of the Alliance's first mobile suit ace pilot, Kira Yamato. With the combination of the 105 Dagger base unit and the Aile Striker, the resulting versatility &amp; reliability can be said to be a highly aggressive system configuration."<br><br>Sol Ryuune L'ange<br>"16-years-old. Male. 1st generation Coordinator. GSX-401FW Stargazer test pilot. 2 years ago, he became orphaned when he lost his DSSD staff member parents in an accident in space. Afterwards, he came to live with his uncle, Edmund du Clos. Has a brother-sister kind of connection with Selene, who had also lost her parents in the same incident. When he was 15, he aimed to work for DSSD as his parents did so he endeavored to be the mobile suit GSX-401FW Stargazer's test pilot for the sake of space exploration &amp; development. Brought up since birth with DSSD, he lived in an environment unlike that of PLANT and the Earth, free from discrimination. Sol is compelled by the war to think deeper about the relationship between Naturals &amp; Coordinators and to know the reason why he is a Coordinator while his parents were Naturals. Now with his parents gone, he walks the same path his father &amp; mother did to try and find the answer."</div>

Sven and company make quick work of the enemy mobile suits, leaving a fiery battlefield. Back at their base, their commander is on the phone talking with someone about the situation with rebel forces, the three Phantom Pain pilots and a bunch of soldiers are in a bar watching the TV, which is airing three children talking about how Naturals killed their Coordinator parents and calling for the death of Naturals and Blue Cosmos. As the news continues talking about Coordinators and terrorism, Mudie comments that her teacher told her that the only good Coordinator is a dead one. Sven remembers how interested he was in the stars when he was a child and how he wanted to be an astronomer. His father had even gotten him a telescope as a birthday present. Sven had watched programs about landing on the moon, read up on his Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein, and went to the space museums. However, an explosion had killed his parents and he was put in a special program.<br>The present Sven wakes up to his alarm and reports to his commander. SvenÂ�fs target is a Coordinator refugee camp training terrorists and his mission is to destroy the facilities and eliminate the terrorists. Sven asks if there is a limit to targeting only terrorists and his commander asked him back if he made a distinction between terrorists and those who were not. While flying along to the refugee camp, Sven remembers how he had been taken as a child to a facility where he was brainwashed with anti-Coordinator slogans and violent material. After he and his fellow pilots land their mobile suits, Sven gives the order to fire. As he watches the slaughter, Sven then remembers his teenage combat training and how he had gotten a certain injection. With the camp destroyed and the fires burning out, Sven is the solitary figure standing on top of the rubble.<br>Meanwhile, at the DSSD Troia Station in space, Selene is surrounded by scientists. She shows one of them the 401Â�fs AI Unit and explains that the 401 will eventually be able to make judgments on its own, which opens up the possibility of unmanned planetary exploration. There is a cockpit because in the beginning there can be a pilot that the AI learns behavior from. Back on Earth, a fierce battle has erupted between an EA ship - carrying a Destroy Gundam - and a ZAFT force. Mudie in the Blu Duel destroys a pair of BuCUEs with her Stilettos, but then gets her sword arm cut off by another BuCUE. The Blu Duel also gets its left leg cut off, meaning that Mudie is now a sitting duck. A trio of Kerberos BuCUE Hounds then gang up and stab her Gundam repeatedly until sheÂ�fs dead and the Blu Duel has been destroyed. Sven turns his attention to the Hounds and easily defeats all three, but itÂ�fs too late for Mudie. Although Shams is in shock and disbelief at MudieÂ�fs death, Sven barely shows any emotion.<br>Afterwards, Sven passes by Sting and an unconscious Stellar inside the hallways of the ship. Shams tells him that their orders have come and this time theyÂ�fre going after the DSSD space station. In contrast to SvenÂ�fs uncaring attitude, Shams wants to beat them all to death. During this time, Selene and Sol are in space testing out the 401Â�fs Voiture Lumiere system. Sol suggests that calling it the Â�g401Â�Â� is impolite to the AI and recalls what Edmond said about looking up. Edmond had used the word Stargazer, so Selene adopts the name and enters it into the computer. With the test underway, the station radios with a confirmation that the Voiture Lumiere is accelerating the mobile suit. The man in the transmission congratulates the 401, but then corrects himself and calls it the Stargazer.<br><br>-One word: Awesome.<br>-The fight scenes were really good. Blu Duel/Mudie destroyed/dead in a scene that resembled wild animals eating their prey.<br>-StargazerÂ�fs appearance was really pretty (eye-candy).<br>-Cameos by Azreal, Sting, and Stellar this episode<br>-I donÂ�ft know how theyÂ�fre going to conclude this though. It still feels like things havenÂ�ft even really gotten started.<br>-Love the ending song more and more. Single is due out next week.<br><br>Â‚Ã‚Â‚ÃƒÂ‚Â­<br><br></div>
