The Calamity Gundam also uses a handheld "Todesblock" plasma bazooka, and its shield is equipped with a "Kaefer Zwei" ram cannon. Since the Calamity Gundam was designed for long range combat, it does not come equipped with any close range melee weapons. However, the Alliance does develop a close combat variant, the GAT-X133 Sword Calamity. The Calamity Gundam is first deployed in combat during the Earth Alliance's attack on the Orb Union. Following the defeat of Orb, the Calamity Gundam is taken to space and transferred to the Archangel class battleship Dominion under the supervision of Blue Cosmos leader Muruta Azrael.

For close combat, the Raider Gundam is also equipped with a "Mjolnir" hammer. While in flight mode, the Raider Gundam can utilize the "Ahura Mazda" cannons located on the claws, as well as several machine guns mounted on the nose and shoulders. Several different weapons are featured in the variant suit GAT-333 Raider Full Spec. The Raider Gundam is first deployed in combat during the Earth Alliance's attack on the Orb Union.
