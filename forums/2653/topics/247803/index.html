            <div class='col-md body'>Essential oils are the pure fragrant essences from plants, i.e. flowers, leaves, stems, bark, roots and berries etc, extracted by various methods. The most popular method of extraction is by distillation. This means the plant parts, are loaded into a large pressure container. Steam is passed under pressure through the plant material and the globules of essential oil burst open with the heat, evaporating the oil. The steam and essential oil vapour then pass out of the top of the container along a pipe which is water-cooled. This condenses the vapours back into liquids. As the water and oil do not mix, the essence sits on top of the water and is easily separated from it.<br><br>Essential oils must be pure, good quality oils for use in aromatherapy treatments. This is important, in view of many cheaper oils which are now on the market and are of inferior quality. In some cases they may contain solvents which could be very harmful, in other cases they may contain chemical substances of the same smell to make up the quantity.<br><br>Essential oils are highly volatile (this means they can evaporate quickly if left exposed to the air. They should always be kept in dark coloured bottles. They have a consistency more like water than oil. Essential oils are not greasy. Carrier oils which are used to blend the essential oils for massage are usually vegetable or nut oils and these are greasy as necessary to massage the skin<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>Aroma Oils </strong></span><br><br>~ Basil - Stimulating.
