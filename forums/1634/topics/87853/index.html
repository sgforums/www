            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm Toyota Celsior UCF10 aka LEXUS LS400...<br>I have been looking for the parts list for this car... since there is not any, i decided to create my own mini parts list... This topic is created specially for people who likes LEXUS car and also for those who are curious with the parts you be getting when you get this car...<br><br>Since all car gets the same parts for power upgrades, so there is no point for me to name those parts... but for handling, cars like UCF10 do makes a difference compare to other cars...<br><br>10 slots for basic handling...<br><br>1st - Brake Pad Exchanged   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>2nd - Clear Tail/Clear Indicator ( Used to fake your opponent and etc )   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>3rd - Wheel Change   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>4th - Air Suspension Controller   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>5th - Gold Emblem ( Eh makes your car looks more class and etc... )   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>6th - Airhorn/Sheep Skin Interior ( for feeling and comfort and etc... )   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>7th - Full Colour Aero Parts ( Change your car colour from green to purple and etc... )   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>8th - Glass Full Snoke ( Use to radiate sunlight and etc... )   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>9th - Large Brake   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>10th - Neon Tube ( AWESOME! you can see lights under your car chassis )   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>This car is definitely not for hardcore battle or something, unless playing handicap/boost on might gives you chances of winning...<br>Lastly, this car is not fast. But for me, it gives me the comfort and luxury feeling when i am using this car. Smooth, quiet and comfortable in all driving conditions with effortless, silent acceleration and with its HIGH CLASS looks, it is great and fun to drive it...  haha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

By the way, unless you have a Celsior which is also full tuned... or else you won't be able to see its true power and ability...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>anyway, thanks for your recommendation...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay...<br><br>Then what's the shift points for Celsior?<br><br>And I said auto tranny because the real Celsior only have auto, and it's supposed to be a luxury car... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have played the Celsior till 640Hp and here are my thoughts.<br><br>a)  4 gears Manual gear shifting.<br>- Because its only 4 gears, in order to maintain top speed, you really have to try to stay in 4th. If you need to slow down, perhaps tapping the brake lightly would be better than shifting down to 3rd. Not totally mastered it yet though.<br><br>b)  Battles<br>- Quite hard. You can be playing flawlessly but to overtake opponents is still quite hard regardless boost is on or off. Not sure if everthing changes at 800hp but it is quite hard to accelerate fast. perhaps because of its body weight.<br><br>c)  Opponents crashing or nudging you<br>- This is where the celsior excels. Opponents cant nudge you out of the way as easy as it would other cars. maybe becuase this car is heavier and nudging your opponents is  easier.<br><br>d)  Handling<br>- Handling is good and very stable.<br><br>Overall, its a lovely car to drive as its very beautiful with the metallic purple, 4 exhauste pipes, neon blue lights at the bottom of the car. Can only post a proper battle feedback after i hit 800hp. People say  at 800hp, its a totally  different car.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>so how you guys feel when you realise that you might have to increase POWER slots instead of handling slots... yah i know for other cars, you got to increase handling slots more than power slots... but now it is different...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>you guys should remember that the last slots for normal cars are lightweight body kit or something... so after getting that upgrade for your car, your car is light but might be uncontrollable as if you increase HP too high, your car might be unstable... so increase handling more than power is a must in my opinion to make your car run better... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>for celsior, last upgrade is Neon light... oh geez... no light weight body...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>so this car is believe to be somehow overweight or something as there are too many luxury equipment inside this car... but come to think of it, because it is heavy, so celsior might be able to block your opponent from overtaking or push your car to the wall,but as long as your HP is high, all this are possible...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>same applies to anyone who wishes to overtake your opponent cars...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>so it seems like heavy is =&gt; grip,stable and good handling, so i recommend people to increase HP more than handling...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  eh you have to push this sucker to run faster... hmm oh geez...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>eh i am half done with my opinion/faqs... maybe i will update again soon... but anyway, i am just writing out my opinion/faqs for celsior... as what i have written are the important stuff to add on in my opinion... there are some other stuff to add on  but i feel maybe no point somehow... unless i can discover more about celsior, or else this might be my last and only faqs i am writting... anyway, hope this helps for you guys out there...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>hmm lastly, i just got myself R32... also i am searching high and low for anyone who is kind enough to create/post a R32 faqs... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>hmm it seems like other cars instead of celsior is easier to control and run better... i have tried from 4 - 6 speed cars and it seems like 5 to 6 speed cars are easier to use or to clear the story...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>eh it is somehow the speed that gives you the advantage... haha... see ya guys again...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
