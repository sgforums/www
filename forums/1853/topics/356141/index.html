              <p>Health books are big sellers in China these days, and a newly-translated Japanese health book might appeal outside the wellness marketplace with its cutesy illustrations.</p>
              <p><em>Uncocoro: for Natural Unco Life</em> (å¤§ä¾¿ä¹¦) is a book about intestinal health. It's written by Fujita Koichiro (è—¤ç”°çº®ä¸€éƒŽ), a Manchukou-born health writer known as "Dr. Parasite" for his unorthodox theory that many health problems of the modern age could be solved if people would host parasitic worms in their bodies. This new book focuses on educating readers about what comes out of their bodies: the production, color, consistency, frequency, and uses of their stools.</p>
              <p>The illustrations are by Yorifuji Bunpei (å¯„è—¤æ–‡å¹³), a well-known graphic designer.</p>
              <p><em>Uncocoro</em> first came out in Chinese translation on Taiwan, like so many cool books (<a href="http://epochtext.com/10SC/sc12.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #006699;">Snow Crash</span></span></a> is the most recent example). The new mainland edition is being promoted with endorsements from the heads of various Taiwan health organizations.</p>
              <p>Wu Jun-ming, head of Taiwan's Bureau of Health Promotion when the Taiwan edition was published in 2005, describes the dismal state of affairs that this book seeks to remedy:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>The Chinese title of the book is straightforward: <span class="pinyin" title="dàbiàn shÅ«">å¤§ä¾¿ä¹¦</span>, "the book of feces." As for what "uncocoro" means, Tsai Ying-jie, head of the Taiwan Association for Lactic Acid Bacteria, offers two interpretations spanning three languages:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This especially peculiar book is most close to my own mind. I hope that all children and parents, everyone who cares about nature and health, will give it a careful read and fully understand the mind of the author.</p>
              <p>The English title of this book is <em>Uncocoro: for Natural Unco Life</em>. "Unco" means poo. The subtitle is clear: for a natural poo life. But the title, "Uncocoro," requires an explanation.</p>
              <p>"Unco" is poo, "coro" is <span class="pinyin" title="[jp] koro">é ƒ</span>, which means "time," so together it means "poo time," still not really clear. If it meant "coro-coro," meaning "roll," or "poo that rolls," that would be essentially unhealthy.</p>
              <p>So I like to explain uncocoro as "poo heart" (<span class="pinyin" title="biànbiàn xÄ«n">ä¾¿ä¾¿å¿ƒ</span>): "unco" is poo, "cocoro" is heart (<span class="pinyin" title="[jp] kokoro">å¿ƒ</span>). Together they'd be "unco-cocoro," but if you remove one "co," you get "uncocoro," an innovative new word.</p>
              <p>Increasingly, medical evidence tells us that "aging begins in the gut," "serious adult diseases like colon cancer, breast cancer, heart disease, high blood preasure, and senility are closely connected to the intestines," but people today tend to ignore intestinal health and turn up their noses at their poo.</p>
