              </div>
              <p>Today’s (21 January 2011) Straits Times headlines “Will PAP last?”. This is how MM Lee sees it:</p>
              <p><em>” If the decline in standards happens gradually, an opposition of quality will be launched. The public can sense it.” – MM Lee</em></p>
              <p>He does not see a problem for the PAP in the next 10 or 20 years. The
               issue for voters, as he frames it, is the quality and talent of men the
               PAP is able to recruit. …so PAP will stay in power as long as it has 
              top talents and does not split up. I don’t believe this is true and I’ll
               tell you why.</p>
              <p>Warren Buffett once said that if people are not doing what you want 
              them to do, you do not want them to be motivated or highly talented, you
               rather have them lazy, incompetent and unmotivated. Do you want leaders
               who are highly talented at making you cheaper, better and faster? 
              …highly talented and motivated at increasing the influx of 
              foreigners…highly talented at finding ways like increasing the GST to 
              increase the govt surplus. What is more important to voters is whether 
              their interests will be served by the men they vote into parliament. The
               video clip in the previous posting, shows RP’s Tony Tan explaining the 
              issue is not whether the PAP can design and implement policies as they 
              have the competence to do that. The real issue is the <em>intent</em> behind the policies. Even if the PAP remains as competent and qualified 
              as it has been, once people believe they are not acting in their best 
              interests, the PAP will be voted out.</p>
              <p>In past few years, much of the trust people have for the PAP has been
               eroded….I’ll take you through a number of examples and after that 
              reveal another reason why the PAP is in a more precarious position that 
              most people think in the coming elections.</p>
              <p>Just after the last elections, the PAP govt raised the GST from 5% to
               7%. GST is a regressive tax that hurts the poor much more that the 
              rich. The poor have to spend a greater portion of their income on living
               expenses than the richer folks. In order to get the people to accept 
              the GST hike, the govt told ordinary citizens that the primary intent 
              behind the hikes was to help the old and poor[<a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2007/gst.html#Q1">Read the budget FAQ here</a>].
               Many would accept the hikes if the poor people were helped. However, 
              most Singaporeans know from the past that GST hikes were usually done to
               make up for shortfall in the corporate tax cuts. For example in the 
              2003 budget when GST was hiked:</p>
              <p><em>“4.3 From YA 2003, I have decided to cut the corporate income tax
               rate from 24.5% to 22%. This 10% reduction will save businesses $700 
              million a year.</em><em><br> </em><em>4.4 Also with effect from YA 2003, the top marginal personal 
              income tax rate will be cut from 26% to 22%, with corresponding cuts in 
              all income bands. This will reduce the tax payable by most taxpayers by 
              13% to 16%, saving them $620 million every year.</em><br> <em>4.5 I have decided to raise the GST rate from 3% to 5% from 1 Jan 
              2003. The increase in GST is expected to raise an additional $1.3 
              billion of tax revenue per year. ” – Lee Hsien Loong,  Singapore Budget 
              Speech 2003</em>[<a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2002/gst.html">Link</a>]</p>
              <p>In 2007, the corporate tax which was among the lowest in the world was cut from 20% to 18% [<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/8733071">Link</a>]and
               most Singaporeans who understood the real intent of the GST hike were 
              outraged because it was done at a time when Singapore had the biggest 
              income gap among developed countries and corporate profits as a % of GDP
               was at record levels. Knowing that the GST hike for the purpose of 
              corporate tax cuts would be unpopular, the PAP tried to get the people 
              accept it by saying it was done to help the poor i.e. they tried to hide
               the true intent of the policy. They used to be able to do this in the 
              past when they controlled the media fully but today with the Internet, 
              it is no longer possible for them to deceive ordinary citizens. I’ll 
              give you another example before I tell you how the PAP will lose its 
              power.</p>
              <p>In 2009, the PAP govt push ahead to implement CPF Life by amending 
              the CPF Act. The rationale given was that Singaporeans are living longer
               and so on – I’m sure you’re familiar with those arguments. CPF as a 
              retirement fund is a already very strained after all the liberalisation 
              for investment, children’s education and the purchase of HDB flats[<a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=3030910">51% of Singaporeans cannot meet minimum sum</a>].
               During the CPF Life debate, MP Low Thia Khiang came out with a 
              suggestion which many if not most Singaporeans would find reasonable. 
              His suggestion was that since Singaporeans already take most, if not 
              all, the responsibility of retirement, the govt should create a fund to 
              take care of tail end ‘extra longevity’ the govt project Singaporeans 
              will have and do away with more complexity, confusion and further 
              straining of the CPF scheme. It is a policy alternative the PAP will 
              never consider because they will not create a fund for the old using 
              taxes when they use the money to lower taxes for the rich and corporate 
              tax cuts. They would rather pass the burden to ordinary Singaporeans 
              because that is ideologically attractive to them. However, the idea from
               Worker’s Party hardly leans to the left of the political spectrum. Most
               countries take care of some, half or all of the citizens’ retirement 
              needs – and most, if not all, do not have the vast resources in the form
               of sovereign wealth funds and govt surpluses. Yet at a time when many 
              Singaporeans’ ability to retire properly is affected by the severe 
              income gap and rising cost of living, the PAP increased their burden and
               responsibility when so many other workable policy alternatives exist. 
              The PAP cannot implement minimum wage when all other deveolop countries 
              can. We don’t have universal healthcare (some Singaporeans have to go to
               Malaysia for healthcare[<a href="http://singaporemind.blogspot.com/2011/01/singer-has-passed-away.html">Link</a>])
               when it exists in all developed countries. We have the biggest wage gap
               and a 3rd world wage structure. For this system that gives them little 
              in the way of safety nets, Singaporeans are asked for huge sacrifices 
              e.g. longest conscription in the form of NS after Israel and reservist 
              duties.</p>
              <p>To answer the question of “how long will the PAP last”, the question 
              we have to ask ourselves how did the PAP last so long given the 
              harshness of its policies and system.</p>

              <p>People when given a free choice anywhere else in the world will 
              rarely choose a govt like the PAP.- it is so far right on the political 
              spectrum as reflected in its policies. Nowhere else among developed 
              countries do people choose this type of govt and keep them in power when
               they have a choice. Occasionally they do vote them in for short periods
               when there is a treat of war or when the economic conditions are 
              extreme but vote them out when conditions improve. The PAP lasted for 
              several reasons. In the earlier years 1960s-1980s, the PAP was actually 
              very popular due to the one-off rapid economic transformation.</p>
              <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-34999" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/01/25/the-truth-about-how-long-the-pap-will-last/votes/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34999" title="votes" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/votes.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="245"></a><br> Once the rapid economic transformation was over, people naturally wanted
               an alternative and the PAP’s votes started declining. However, to 
              maintain power, the PAP 1. controlled the media and limited the freedom 
              of people to speak up 2. repressed of the opposition 3. modified the one
               man one vote system with GRCs and linking votes to upgrading. The 
              control of the media is necessary to hide the intent of policies, make 
              alternative approahces look unattractive and spread its propaganda. 
              Control of the media alone is insufficient and so they repress the 
              opposition to generate a climate of fear to make it hard for a strong 
              alternatives to emerge. Even with these in place, the PAP is unable to 
              halt the decline in support. For increasingly large number of 
              Singaporeans, their support goes to”anyone but the PAP”….they don’t need
               the opposition to have higher paper qualification or successful 
              corporate careers but are willing to accept someone who will look out 
              for their interests…… something Singaporeans cannot trust the PAP MPs to
               do anymore – their goal is the development of Singapore Inc not 
              improving the lives of ordinary Singaporeans and in many areas this goal
               is divergent from the interests and needs of ordinary Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>How long the PAP lasts depends on how fast they can change and move 
              away from their ideology relative to the erosion of their ability to 
              control information &amp; spread propaganda and repress the opposition. 
              The last 4 years has actually been a lost opportunity for the PAP govt. 
              When Lee Hsien Loong took over from SM Goh, a carrot of change was 
              dangled in front of Singaporeans. In 2004-2006 PM Lee spoke often about 
              change &amp; “remaking of Singapore” raising hope and expectations just 
              as Badawi did in Malaysia when he took over from Dr. M – in 2004, 
              Badawi’s National Front actually collected 64% of the nation-wide vote 
              comparable Lee Hsien Loong’s 66%. 4 years after the elections, 
              Singaporeans discover not much has change – change, if any, was in the 
              direction they did not want – hike in GST, hike in Minister’s pay, means
               testing for the sick, CPF Life, increase foreign influx, rising cost of
               living etc. Not only did the PAP fail to remake itself when it needed 
              to, MM Lee came out to remind us how unchangeable the PAP is with his 
              book on “<em>hard</em> truths”.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><em>“You have to die for each other” – MM Lee.[<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_626850.html">Link</a>]</em></p>
              <p><em>.</em></p>
              <p>A blogger on the Internet pointed out that it is rather melodramatic 
              and ridiculous for the MM to ask ordinary Singaporeans to sacrifice 
              their lives for each other when he can’t even get his ministers to 
              accept anything lower than the highest pay for leaders in the world.<br> <em>“We are a nation in the making. Will we make it? Am I certain we’ll 
              get there? No, I cannot say that….I do not deceive myself for one moment
               that our differences of race, culture and religion will disappear” – MM
               Lee.</em></p>
              <p>The MM Lee talks about the importance of nationhood and how hard it 
              is to make Singapore into a nation from diverse groups of people…yet is 
              it not the goal of the PAP to import people to grow the population? It 
              is hard for locally born Singaporeans to bond with each other because of
               cultural differences but integrating hundreds of thousands of 
              immigrants whose numbers will soon surpass that of locally born 
              Singaporeans in a few years is okay?</p>
              <p><em>“…successful transformation from a tiny fishing village to one of Asia’s — if not the world’s — most modern cities…” – [</em><a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2011/01/22/singapore-still-a-nation-in-progress-mm-lee/"><em>Link]</em></a><em> </em></p>
              <p>Don’t you find it strange and insulting that Straits Times reporters 
              write about Singapore being a tiny fishing village before the PAP was in
               charge of the place? Our forefathers came all the way from China and 
              India braving the dangerous voyage to look for opportunities in a “tiny 
              fishing village”? There are no tiny fishing villages in China and India?
               Our forefathers had no brains? Just one example of the “truth” they are
               trying to spread with this new book…the real truth about Singapore in 
              the 1950s before the PAP is found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw7toyYrqjs&amp;feature=channel">here</a>.</p>
              <p>The book is 450 pages thick…..based on the extracts I’ve read, it 
              will impress only those who have lost the ability to think. Along with 
              the myths about the PAP leadership that they want to perpetuate and the 
              justification (more like excuses) for every wrong that the man has been 
              done…(bankrupting and jailing opponents simply because he felt they were
               ‘duds’) is this distorted view that Singapore’s success is due 
              primarily to the PAP. Today economic miracles are not so rare among East
               Asian countries e.g. Taiwan, S. Korea, Japan. Taiwan &amp; S. Korea 
              succeeded under authoritarian govts and continued to thrive after they 
              became full blown democracies debunking the myth they could succeed only
               under strong dominant one party leadership. The book Hard Truths tries 
              to pay up the myth that Singapore has succeeded because of a small group
               of elites and ideas of one man. In doing so, they tried to washed away 
              the contributions of millions of ordinary citizens who formed the number
               1 workforce in the world for many decades – a hardworking workforce 
              that never went on strike, a workforce that accepted low pay, little 
              benefits and long hours. This collection of myths released just before 
              elections are held is a feeble attempt to persuade Singaporeans to 
              continue supporting the man and his ideas….. the longer the PAP cling on
               to these so-called ‘hard-truths’, the faster it will be voted 
              out….because a growing number of Singaporeans can see through the 
              propaganda and know what needs to be done to have a better future for 
              themselves and their families.</p>

They write from memory, from reminiscence, or even directly from other people's books. This class is the most numerous. Secondly, there are those who think while writing.
