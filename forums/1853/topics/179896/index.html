            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be fooled by this book's title. It is not for the hackers out there, but for average users.<br><br>The first chapter shows you more about search engines, some of them never seen before (maybe it's me only). It also teaches you how to use the search engine to find more accurate results. More or less we have learnt it. And there's also some specialized search engines. One example is AvatarSearch, where you can find occult information. Only thing is that this site has been closed. No more witchcraft for those of you who wants to try funny things. Another interesting one would be Black Web Portal. As the name suggests, it lets you search more about the Blacks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The second to fifth chapters talks about news. From daily news to weird news, you have them. In between these chapters, they talk about activists, how they use news to tell the world more about them. One of the ways is by sending out harmless computer viruses. There is also the censorship topic. They teach you how to bypass them, what are the advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>The sixth to the thirteen chapters talks about threats on the Net and how to protect yourself. The same old warning again, but this time in more details. Each threat is grouped into the different chapters, starting with the hackers. The hacker chapter is worth reading, as it offers you an insight on what they do. This chapter doesn't teach you to be a hacker though, so don't think too far.<br><br>For Chapter fourteen, it gives you tips on how to save when buying a computer. You will also learn how to recycle them to protect the environment. They also recommend you some freewares as well as some trial softwares that you can download off the web.<br><br>From Chapter fifteen to twenty, it gives more instructions on protecting yourself, as well as softwares to use. How to use these softwares correctly as well as tweaking it so that it suits you are taught in these chapters. Chapter nineteen can be very difficult for average users, as it covers computer forensics and some weird codes that users don't see. You can miss that, but it is interesting. It also gives you an insight on how the different security policies work, how are they defeated and how you can guard against them.<br><br>The appendixes at the end of the book more or less summarize everything about IT that you have to know about.</div>
