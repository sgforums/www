            <div class='col-md body'>Thoughts on Childrens Books<br>"Many often ask Silverstein: Why did you start to create children's books? I never planned to write or draw for kids. It was Tomi Ungerer, a friend of mine who insisted.....practically dragged me, kicking and screaming, into Ursula Nordstrom's office. And she convinced me that Tomi was right; I could do children's books. " (Jean F. Mercier, "Shel Silverstein," Publishers Weekly, February 24, 1975 ).<br>Nordstrom was Silverstein's editor, and the relationship between them is mutually rewarding. He considers her to be a great editor who knows when to leave an author-illustrator alone. When asked if he would change something simply because an editor told him to do so, his answer was a simple no. However, he does mention that "...he will take a suggestion for a revision. I do eliminate certain things when I'm writing for children if I think that only an adult will get the idea. Then I'll drop it, or save it. But editors messing with the content? No." (Publishers Weekly).<br><br>What did Silverstein think of his own writing?<br>"I would hope that people, no matter what age, would find something to identify with in my books, pick up one and experience a personal sense of discovery. That's great. But for them, not for me. I think that if you're a creative person, you should just go about your business, do your work and not care about how its received. I never read reviews, because if you believe the good ones you have to believe the bad ones too. Not that I don't care about success. I do, but only because it lets me do what I want. I was always prepared for success but that means that I have to be prepared for failure too."<br><br>"I have an ego, I have ideas, I want to be articulate, to communicate but in my own way. People who say they create only for themselves and don't care if they are published... I hate to hear talk like that. If it's good, it's too good not to share. That's the way I feel about my work."<br><br>"So I'll keep on communicating, but only my way. Lots of things I won't do. I won't go on television because who am I talking to? Johnny Carson? The camera? Twenty million people I can't see? Uh-uh. And I won't give any more interviews."<br><br></div>

In 1981, Silverstein received the Michigan Young Readers Award for this book. The book is filled with poems that not only children can identify with but people of all ages. The poems (and song lyrics) are humorous, lively and sometimes have hidden meanings it seems. The simple style in which they are written and the child like world of ideas incorporated makes for accessible children's reading material. The viewpoint of a child in the poems can clearly be recognised and does not in anyway take away from the pleasure "grown-ups" can read in the same poems. Lessons and wisdom's are entwined throughout the poems. Where the Sidewalk Ends was banned in some school libraries (N.Dakota) because it was believed to undermine parental, school and religious authority (Biblio Bytes)<br><br></div>

For every new possiblity ("if") all the possiblities that have gone before are repeated and the poem reaches a sort of climax.

It's a story about a relationship of give and take between a boy and a tree through out both the tree's and the boy's life span. As a child the boy plays in the tree, eats the apples and sits in the shade. As an adolescent the boy rests here with his girlfriend. As a man he takes and uses the tree's freely given wood to build a house, later chopping down the tree to build a boat. When the man is old all the tree can give is a stump for the old man to rest upon. (Sely Friday)<br><br>Originally when The Giving Tree was presented to a publisher, it was rejected by editor William Cole who later commented: "I was working at Simon &amp; Schuster in the early 1960's when he came in and showed me The Giving Tree. I told him that it was a nice book, but since it fell between two stools, children and adult, it would never sell." (Edwin McDowell, "Shel Silverstein." New York Times Book Review, November 8,1981 ). However, since that time, it has been published and has achieved much acclaim. The Giving Tree is a difficult book to categorise, it equally appeals to the sophisticated and the simple, the reverent and the irreverent.<br>Even though, The Giving Tree, is one of Silverstein's most successful books, it is not one of his favourites. He commented that "its just a relationship between two people; one gives, the other takes" (Richard R. Lingeman, "The Third Mr. Silverstein," New York Times Book Review, April 30, 197<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. However, some suggest that the popularity of the book might just be because of this, the fact that it presents just one idea. Naturally, Silverstein is happy with the book's success, but he does not agree with this reason. He feels that children are able to deal with many ideas at one time: "A story could deal with more, even 50, and so can the reader, if the ideas are all laid out". (Jean F. Mercier. "Shel Silverstein," Publishers Weekly, February 24, 1975).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shel Silverstein<br><br>Shel Silverstein was a composer, an artist, and the author of numerous books of prose and poetry for younger readers. His prose works include such modern classics as The Giving Tree (1963), Lafcadio: The Lion Who Shot Back (1963), and The Missing Piece (1976), while among his immensely popular poetry collections are Where the Sidewalk Ends (Michigan Young Readers Award, 1974), A Light in the Attic (School Library Journal Best Books Award, 1982), and, most recently, Falling Up (HarperCollins, 1996). Silverstein's work, which he illustrated himself, is characterized by a deft mixing of the sly and the serious, the macabre and the just plain silly. Silverstein was born on September 25, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois, where he was writing from the time he was a young boy. His wicked, giddy humor is beloved by countless adults as well as by children. He died in May 1999.<br><br><img src="http://pic16.picturetrail.com/VOL701/2898363/5850058/80741297.jpg"></div>
