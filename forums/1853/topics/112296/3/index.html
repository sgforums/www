In a world in which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence, we feel "the unbearable lightness of being" not only as the consequence of our private actions, but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just read Kafka On The Shore, by Haruki Murakami.<br><br><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400043662.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"><br><br>As usual, he delves deeply into the subconscious of the human mind, telling his stories through seemingly unrelated subplots until the reader reads much deeper. and he will find that there are similar themes in the undercurrent.Murakami writes in a fashion where the reader will experience a sense of disconnection and separation from the real world, from the protagonist's point of view.I like his novels, and you should read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, it's his best work IMHO.Though Sputnik Sweetheart comes close in terms of emotional triggers.<br><br>This is an excerpt from The Daily Telegraph's Christopher Taylor, a reviewer..<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"In the first of the book's two storylines, a 15-year-old boy Â– who calls himself Kafka Tamura Â– runs away from his sinister father and unwittingly embarks on an Oedipal quest. In the second, Nakata Â– an elderly man with learning difficulties caused by a mysterious childhood accident Â– becomes embroiled in an occult conspiracy. This being a Murakami novel, we also meet a kooky young girl and a mysterious older woman, both of whom are given to offering sex at unexpected moments. There's a terrific scene involving a cat-catcher dressed as Johnnie Walker (of whisky fame) and, later, a walk-on part for a spirit in the guise of Colonel "KFC" Sanders.<br><br>As the storylines begin to converge, it becomes clear that the novel's fantastic events are dramatisations of the characters' inner lives. This is usually the case in Murakami's fiction, but in the new novel he is uncharacteristically keen to explain what he's up to: there are frequent mini-lectures on Japanese folklore, Greek tragedy and so on. This turn to Borges-style bookishness Â– complete with references to Burton's translation of the Arabian Nights Â– is accompanied by a more whimsical, fairytale-like at-mosphere than usual, with less of the hypnotic domestic detail that Murakami's readers have come to expect.<br><br>Philip Gabriel's English-language text is also pretty clunky in places, and it's unfortunate that one strand of the novel hinges on the claim that Kafka means "crow", since, according to Kafka's most recent biographer, the name comes from a word meaning "jackdaw". Kafka on the Shore is still highly readable, and fans will enjoy tracing the echoes and symmetries between it and Murakami's earlier novels (particularly Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World); <strong>but the uninitiated would probably do better to start with South of the Border, West of the Sun or the mighty Wind-Up Bird Chronicle itself.</strong>"</span><br></div>
