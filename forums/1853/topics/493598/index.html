              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>But don't be so quick to judge a book by its cover. Like many of us, Mr Leck does not get to read as much as he would like to.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>"I don't get enough time to read at all," said the founder of local bookstore BooksActually.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>"Most of my reading is done in the hours before I sleep, because when I am working here, I don't get much time to read."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>Mr Leck, 39, works nearly every day at the bookstore, which is currently located in the quaint Yong Siak Street in Tiong Bahru.</p>
              <div class="mid-article-ad-block" style='box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'></div>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>In its 12 years, BooksActually has moved three times. It has been in its current premises for the past six years.</p>
              <div class="body-copy" style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">But the relocation has not taken away the bookstore's character.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">BooksActually has carved out a distinct feel, with various knick-knacks and vintage items - collected by Mr Leck - on display and for sale alongside paperbacks and hardcovers.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">"People tell me that the interior is nice, but I don't actually put much effort into it," said Mr Leck. "It's more like, I put the items wherever I see there is space."</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Mr Leck's passion has always been books.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Before starting BooksActually, he worked at Tower Books and Borders - experiences he said were invaluable in helping him start his bookstore.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Mr Leck started out selling books at various book fairs, but his vision was to open a bookstore of his own.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">He said: "It had to lead to having my own space. It just makes sense to have a bookstore."</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">It took him just seven months to accumulate enough money to rent his first space, the second storey of a shophouse in Telok Ayer Street in Chinatown.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">The best part of having a physical store?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Laughing, Mr Leck said: "I get to have all the books I want. Naturally, I can't read everything, but still, nothing beats seeing so much stock and being able to run my hands all over it."</p>
              <h2 style='box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "Roboto Condensed", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.1; color: #f58a1f; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 30px; text-transform: uppercase;'>CHALLENGES</h2>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Running a bookstore has its challenges, obviously.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">He constantly worries about rent - it has motivated him to save for a property for BooksActually.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">The day-to-day operations can also wear him down, as the bookstore is open nearly every day.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Mr Leck cut a humble figure when talking about his staff - he has three full-timers and six part-timers - saying how important they are to him.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">"I need to put in place a good team to support me to ensure that, as we move ahead, the bookstore achieves things that it wants to achieve," he said.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Mr Leck offered many reasons why he founded BooksActually: He grew up with a love of reading, readers here need a place to get less "commercialised" titles and - practically - he wants to make money.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">But what seems to be the strongest reason is his desire to ensure the longevity of local literature.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">"There are not enough access points for local books.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">"We should try to carry as much Singlit (Singapore Literature) as possible, because it is our narrative at the end of the day," said Mr Leck.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">"If we don't carry our stories, who will?"</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Other than ensuring that his bookstore is well stocked, Mr Leck and his team manage publishing company Math Paper Press, which regularly releases works by local authors.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">BooksActually was also part of the committee for the recent #BuySingLit campaign - an industry-led movement to celebrate local stories - which took place over the last weekend of February.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">With so much going on, it is no surprise that Mr Leck hardly has time to read.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">"The most I have ever read was when I was bedridden for a week and a half with an injury," he said.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">"I was in a lot of pain, but it was also the best time of my life - I got to read a lot."</p>

              <ul style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 12.5px;">
              <li style="box-sizing: border-box;">A bookstore is still a shop. Your doors have to be open as much as possible so customers can come.</li>
              <li style="box-sizing: border-box;">Openness extends to ideas as well. The hunger to reinvent and take on new challenges is important.</li>
              <li style="box-sizing: border-box;">Having a variety of titles is crucial, you never know what people might pick up.</li>
