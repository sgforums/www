Just bought it and have been having fun with it...if you dont know what its about, heres a short intro......<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Created by a famous Japanese psychologist, kokology is the study of kokoro( mind or spirit in Japanese). Based on sound psychological princiles, kokology asks you to answer guestions about seemingly innocent topics - such as the colour of an imaginary bird that has flown to you window - and then reveals what your answers say about you. </span><br><br>Anyone intrested to try? ....Read on then....<br>this one is quite a basic one...will post more complex ones when I have more time.....<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blue coat, Yellow coat</strong></span> as taken from the book....<br><br>Gathering in the town square for the lighting of the Christmas Tree gives people a chance to come together as a community and celebrate the end of another year. Its a time of nostalgia and a chance for new memories to be born.People are in the holiday spirit,strangers act like friends, and a sense of peace is all around.<br>The night is cold,and you have come with a group of friends and acquaintances to watch the lighting of the tree. In the group of people with you,one person is wearing a yellow coat and another person is in blue.Who are the people wearing the blue and yellow coats? (give the names of people you know)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heres another one for you all to try.........<br><br>In The Bag<br><br>All of us lose things.Sometimes we dont realize they're lost.Think about the last time you lost something:that feelingof frustration as you retraced your steps,scanning the ground, looking under furniture, and sifting through the trash. Remember the feelingof desperation as you checked your pockets for the 5th time just to make sure you didnt miss it? Lost objects have a way of staying lost, only to turn up months after you've given up looking and forgotten all about them. Finding things lost by other people works the same way.YOu dont find dropped wallets in the street or lost purses on the train by conciously going out to look for them.If you find one,its usually just by stumbling across it while you were doing something else.<br>You're walking down the street when you come across a closed black briefcase.Theres no one else around, and when you open it to check for the owners name, out spills a bundle of cash.What is your first reactionto this sudden windfall?<br><br>1. Hey, this must be my lucky day!!<br>2. Oh no,what am I going to do now?<br>3.I'd better take a night to think this over.<br>4.God must have wanted me to have this.<br><br>Key to In the Bag<br><br>YOur reaction on finding the bag of money reveals how you would react if an attractive person suddenly asked you out on a date.<br><br>1. Hey, this must be my lucky day!!<br>You have a childlike capacity for joy at your own good fortune. If more people could express their happiness like you, the world would be a better place.<br><br>2. Oh no,what am I going to do now?<br>It's normal to feel a little uncertain at times like these.But in the end the decision is all up to you. Take your time and think it over,but dont spend too long wringing your hands or someone else might just come along and snathc your good fortune out from under your nose.<br><br>3. I'd better take a night to think this over.<br>Big decisions should be made with a clear head after a good night's sleep.There's a lot to be said for your policy of looking before you leap, but wouldn't it feel good every once in a while to cross the street without looking both ways? Sometimes you need to go with your instincts, even if it means taking some unacceptable risks. Love and danger go hand in hand.<br><br>4. God must have wanted me to have this.<br>Either you dont take divine intervention very seriously or you think of dating as a religious experience.<br></div>
