His latest work, The Castle in the Forest, was published this year.<br><br>Last month he had surgery to remove scar tissue from around his lung.<br><br>Born in 1923 in New Jersey, Mailer wrote dozens of books as well as plays, poems, screenplays and essays.<br><br>His strident views on US political life, and the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, provoked and enraged readers.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Author feuds</span></strong><br><br>Mailer's first major success, the 1948 novel The Naked and the Dead, was a fictionalised account based on his experiences in the Army in World War II.<br><br>"A man who went to a famous prep school in the early 1920s said afterward, 'It was the worst experience of my life and the most valuable.' I can say the same about my time in the US Army," he reflected in 2005.<br><br>Mailer's works were often filled with violence, sexual obsession and views that angered feminists.<br><br>Married six times and the father of nine children, Mailer once said in an NBC television interview that he was worried "women are going to take over the world".<br><br>Detractors considered him an intellectual bully and he feuded with fellow authors including Truman Capote, William Styron, Tom Wolfe and Norman Podhoretz.<br><br>In later life he reconsidered many of his old positions but never surrendered his right to speak his mind.<br><br>Mailer was also co-founder of The Village Voice alternative newspaper in New York.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7088648.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC News</a>)</div>
