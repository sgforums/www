            <div class='col-md body'>a bit old news........but anyway.......<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">(PRLEAP.COM) Contrary to popular belief, not all teenagers are lazy, at least if you go by the example of one Scottish fourteen-year-old. R Fergus McGhee, from Central Scotland, has just published his first novel, Beyond the Mist, through the publishing sensation that is Lulu.com. It is described as a 50,000-word childrenÂ’s fantasy/adventure/mystery novel which would appeal to adults as well as children. The result of two yearsÂ’ work, however, which has been widely acclaimed, is still relatively unknown. On sale at a range of online outlets and for order through local bookstores, the book is soon set to make the news.<br><br>The tender age of its author is what has caused most interest: Fergus began writing the book at the age of twelve, adding to his work continuously and with determination. Fergus is the latest in a relatively little-known string of young authors who have entered the market recently, impressing readers with their creations.<br><br>"I began to write as a hobby during holidays, and gradually Beyond the Mist grew and grew into what it is today. IÂ’m immensely proud of it and thrilled with the final result. I know what a privilege it is to have your name in print, especially at such a young age, and now I just want to share the story with the world, however clichÃ©d that sounds!" says Fergus, evidently more than pleased with the result of his perseverance.<br><br>Book I is the first part of a two-volume novel which may develop into a series of chronicles centered around the amazing new world the principal character, Sharon, discovers. While on holiday in Iceland, the teenage girl loses her tourist party in the icy wilderness, forced to fall asleep amidst a roaring storm; but when she wakes, she finds she has been transported to an entirely different realm.<br><br>Trapped in a wonderful and enthralling world, Sharon begins her quest to return to Earth. Her gripping journey home takes her to the furthest frontiers of this other world, but the task of escaping home turns out to be much greater than Sharon could ever have anticipated.<br><br>A host of intriguing characters and wonderfully descriptive language fill the pages of this engrossing read, ensuring this latest crop of talented young writers make their mark upon the book world.<br><br>Fergus says he is Â‘very excitedÂ’ about the whole process and is Â‘dying to knowÂ’ what people think of his first work. No doubt this new arrival will have much to contribute to the literary world in years to come, while his books fill the shelves of bookshops and libraries around the world.<br><br>Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—Â—-<br><br>Beyond the Mist - Book I by R Fergus McGhee is available for $12.09 (approx. Â£6.80) at a range of online booksellers, including Amazon Marketplace, EBookAd.com, and (of course) Lulu.com, or for order through local bookstores.<br><br>The author is available for contact at:<br>beyondthemistbook1@yahoo.com<br><br>See the bookÂ’s homepage at:<br>www.lulu.com/content/147612<br></span></div>
