              <p>Have just finished reading Sun Zi Art of War which my friend lend to me and I must say that it is the most overated book in history.</p>
              <p>Much of it is common sense and there is nothing much about that book.</p>
              <p>I will rate it on the same level as the book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" which most people who have read it have said that its just common sense and a waste of money to buy it.</p>
              <p>In fact, I have never heard of any Generals who have used Sun Zi Art of War and applied it to defeat his enemies neither have I heard of any military forces in the world who teaches Sun Zi Art of War to their military leaders.</p>
              <p>Its probably just some people who wanted to make use of the book and exagerate it in order to publise the book and make big money from it which apparently their plot have succeded</p>

              <p>the greatness of a book or idea lies in how much it becomes part of our lives till we see it as nothing much than common sense which people of their time did not see it so visibly until it is realized....</p>
              <p>another "nothing much in it idea" that has revolutionized the world is the idea of radio...a modern joke before our iphones and great wireless mobile technologies such as GPS...but it was Marconi, the father of radio that has invented that commonsense into what we have in iphones and GPS..</p>
              <p>overrated? no...its just becuase it becomes too much into us that we cannot see its power in the past</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It is simple to read and just say - it is simple logic, when the time cames can you apply it correctly and at the right time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saying you never heard of any military force in the world teaches sun zi already show that you are a toad in a well. For your information - Sun Tzu Art of War is a primary text at the Army War College and West Point</p>
