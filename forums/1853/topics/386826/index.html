              <p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- When Dan Brown's blockbuster novel "The Lost Symbol"
              hit stores in September, it may have offered a peek at the future of
              bookselling.</p>
              <p>On Amazon.com, the book sold more digital copies
              for the Kindle e-reader in its first few days than hardback editions.
              This was seen as something of a paradigm shift in the publishing
              industry, but it also may have come at a cost.</p>
              <p>Less than 24
              hours after its release, pirated digital copies of the novel were found
              on file-sharing sites such as Rapidshare and BitTorrent. Within days,
              it had been downloaded for free more than 100,000 times.</p>
              <p>Digital piracy, long confined to music and movies, is spreading to books. And as <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Electronic_Book_Readers">electronic reading devices</a> such as Amazon's Kindle, the Sony Reader, Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook,
              smartphones and Apple's much-anticipated "tablet" boost demand for
              e-books, experts say the problem may only get worse.</p>
              <p>"It's fair
              to say that piracy of e-books is exploding," said Albert Greco, an
              industry expert and professor of marketing at Fordham University.</p>
              <p>Sales
              for digital books in the second quarter of 2009 totaled almost $37
              million. That's more than three times the total for the same three
              months in 2008, according to the Association of American Publishers
              (AAP).</p>
              <p>Statistics are hard to come by, and many publishers are
              reluctant to discuss the subject for fear of encouraging more illegal
              downloads. But digital theft may pose a big headache in 2010 for the
              slumping publishing industry, which relies increasingly on electronic
              reading devices and e-books to stimulate sales.</p>
              <p>"Piracy is a
              serious issue for publishers," said Hachette Book Group in a statement.
              The company that publishes Stephenie Meyer's wildly popular "Twilight"
              teen-vampire series says it "considers <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Issues">copyright protection</a> to be of paramount importance."</p>
              <p>Authors are concerned as well.</p>
              <p>"I'd
              be really worried if I were Stephen King or James Patterson or a really
              big bestseller that when their books become completely digitized, how
              easy it's going to be to pirate them," said novelist and poet Sherman
              Alexie on Stephen Colbert's show last month.</p>
              <p>"With the
              open-source culture on the Internet, the idea of ownership -- of
              artistic ownership -- goes away," Alexie added. "It terrifies me."</p>
              <p>And it's not just bestsellers that are targeted by thieves.</p>
              <p>"Textbooks
              are frequently pirated, but so are many other categories," said Ed
              McCoyd, director of digital policy at AAP. "We see piracy of
              professional content, such as medical books and technical guides; we
              see a lot of general fiction and non-fiction. So it really runs the
              gamut."</p>
              <p>Piracy of digital music, thanks to Napster and other
              file-sharing sites, has been a threat to recording companies for more
              than a decade. Over the years, the record companies tried different
              approaches to combat illegal downloading, from shutting down Web sites
              to encrypting songs with digital-rights management software to suing
              individual file-sharers.</p>
              <p>Although illegal file-sharing of music persists, Apple's online iTunes store is now the world's biggest seller of music.</p>
              <p>To some industry observers, this may be where the future of the book
              industry is heading as well. But talk to publishers and authors about
              what can be done to combat <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Electronic_Books">e-book</a> piracy, and you'll get a wide range of opinions.</p>
              <p>Some
              publishers may try to minimize theft by delaying releases of e-books
              for several weeks after physical copies go on sale. Simon &amp;
              Schuster recently did just that with Stephen King's novel, "Under the
              Dome," although the publisher says the decision was made to prevent
              cheaper e-versions from cannibalizing hardcover sales.</p>
              <p>Some
              authors have even gone as far as to shrug off e-book technology
              altogether. J.K Rowling has thus far refused to make any of her Harry
              Potter books available digitally because of piracy fears and a desire
              to see readers experience her books in print.</p>
              <p>However, some evidence suggests that authors' and publishers' claims of damage from illegal piracy may be overstated.</p>
              <p>Recent statistics have shown that consumers who purchase an e-reader
              buy more books than those who stick with traditional bound volumes.
              Amazon reports that <a class="cnnInlineTopic" href="http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Amazon_Kindle">Kindle</a> owners buy, on average, 3.1 times as many books on the site as other customers.</p>
              <p>Ana
              Maria Allessi, publisher for Harper Media at HarperCollins, told CNN,
              "we have to be vigilant in our punishment ... but much more attractive
              is to simply make the technology better, legally."</p>
              <p>E-book
              technology offers so many positives for both the author and the
              consumer that any revenue lost to piracy may just be a necessary evil,
              she said.</p>
              "Consumers who invest in one of
              these dedicated e-book readers tend to load it up and read more," said
              Allessi. "And what's wrong with that?"</div>
