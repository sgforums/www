            <div class='col-md body'>Hunters of Dune is the 7th in the Dune series (not counting the 6 prequels).<br><br><img src="http://www.wordfire.com/art/HuntersCover.jpg"><br><br>A book a couple of decades in the writing after the passing of Frank Herbert.  He passed on shortly after finishing the 6th book, Chapterhouse: Dune.<br><br>The book picks off from where the 6th ended, a rag-tag lot of people who steals a no-ship and escapes the Bene Gesserit home planet of Chapterhouse just before the forced merger with the hated Honored Matres.<br><br>As the group of people make their escape, battles for the control of the Old Empire rage on while out there, unknown to many or perhaps mentally blocked out by the vicious and cruel Honored Matres, the Enemy awaits.<br><br>Not in the scale of the original author, his son has big shoes to fill and attempts admirably from his father's notes of this book.<br><br>Still, a good read for those who have followed the epic series. 3 1/2 out of 5.<br><br>The next instalment, Sandworms of Dune, will be released in August 2007.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finished the book about a week ago. Apparently, Herbert's son is an accomplished fiction writer on his own before he started continuing on his father's legacy. "Hunters of Dune" made an old enemy become frightening clear and increased the intrigue level a little more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I found the books by the original author quite disgusting.  It gave the impression Leto is a king that sleeps around with women here and there and he's a giant worm or centipede literally.  Then there's crude jokes about how monstrous his centipede *ahem* is.  Although he is supposed to be the good guy, Leto is way more vicious and hypocritical then his enemies the Harkonnen?  Only the computer game dune 2 was interesting...the Harkonnen nuke cannon and the devastor were my favourite units lol.<br><br>Some of the other english books ive read:<br><br>Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan - Quite draggy and boring.  The only interesting characters are the forsaken and the peddler padain fain.  The heros are crap.  It is interesting to note that Robert Jordan fantasies himself as being Rand Al'Thor the protoganist of the story who also sleep around with lots of women.  When asked by an interviewer he(Robert) admits that he once had 3 girlfriends at the same time.<br><br>Wars of Light and Shadow by Janny Wurts - Supposedly to be even more lengthly than RJ's Wheel of Time series of twelve books (Arc 1-3 already 8 books with Arc4-5 forcasted by the author to come), this is IMHO thus far the better read.  The use of english is verbose or even bombastic at times and might be difficult for a beginner to understand.  The premise of the story has many similarities to RJ's Wheel of Time...<br><br>Comparison and similarities:<br><br>Wheel of Time:<br>The world reached an advanced stage in technology known as the "Golden Age".  Also super beings were created genetically known as Aes Sedai with strange and mystical powers.  But alas a war broke out and the world was descended into the stone age.  The evil that was unleash during the war still exist in the world and our happy hero Rand Al'Thor is going to try to defeat over the next twelve books in the story...<br><br>Wars of Light and Shadow:<br>The world reached an advanced stage in technology known as the "Golden Age".  Seven super beings were created genetically known as the fellowship of seven.  But alas a war broke out and the world was destroyed.  The super beings then bring the survivors to another world to settle down.  But this another world was already occupied by some animals.  The super beings made a deal with the animals to allows the humans to settle down.  Over time the evil humans begun to destroy nature again causing the animals to flee.  One of the super human even created a evil know as the mist.  By some strange ruling, the remaining six super humans do not want to solve the evil problem directly by themselves and instead rely on other lesser humans to do the dirty work for them.  Over the next 8-12+ books of the story our sad anti-hero Arithon is going to try to defeat this evil...<br><br>Erm ok so both are boring...<br><br></div>

After Frank Herbert killed off his most interesting characters the Harkonnen and Corrino the story went down the drain.  When Leto II became a worm/centipede the story started to follow the likes of David Eddings(where the main character is a God and all the villians are shallow incompetent clowns that are killed left and right like a bunch of insects without any effort or strategy)...   I stopped reading.<br><br></div>
