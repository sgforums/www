              <p>This 2010 WC, have produced 4 players tied as top goal scorer, but I must say S-pools handling of Top Scorer payout is an embaressment.</p>
              <p>This is my case, I have bought a betting slip that D.Villa will be top scorer at World Cup, at odds 2.35. But Singaporepools paid out of 0.785 which means I had lost 21.5% of my bet. I feel I got scammed with a winning ticket and yet losing money.</p>
              <p>Have read other forums and 1 guy had placed bets on any other player and D.Villa, despite getting 2 correct he lost 45% of his money. Unbelievable the more u bet the more u lose, even if u are right!</p>
              <p>When I asked the counter why so little payout they just said it's divided by 3 just like in toto, but when did a winning ticket became a lost? Here is my take on this issue, how can Singapore pools take my base amount and divide it?? Should it have been 2.35-1 = 1.35 then 1.35/3 = 0.45...so my payout would be 1+0.45 = 1.45?</p>
              <p>By doing what S-pools did, what they have done is they take your money when your wrong and take your money even when u are right. If they had a bookmaker margin of 20% it would have been increased to 60%. So for every 10m of bets placed in this class they would have profitted 6m.</p>
              <p>Being Singapore's only bookmaker (monopoly), instead of setting an example of fairness and integrity, what they have done is purposefully to absorb the locals winnings by setting non competitive and fluctuating odds, and now they have stooped to taking money from winners. Looks like the fight against illegal betting will be a long one.</p>
              <p>Plz post if you find that the payout by "S"-pool is unfair, and support that the amount should be settled by the above said pattern.</p>

              <p>nope, don't think so.</p>
              <p>You keep thinking that you are a winner, when you only get the answer 33% correct, that's why hard for you to accept. 33% is actually a failing mark in most exams in the world, so you should think from the point of view that you are a 66% loser, and lucky to get away with some consolidation prize.</p>
              <p>by the way, the guy who brought the ticket (<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">sneijder, villa and muller as joint top scorer</span>) probably made millions.</p>

              <p>Well Yeah I won 33% I didnt lose the 66% tho...its a draw on the other 66%. They didn't beat me either... Can you say they beat me or i had lost 66% in this case? Can you?</p>
              <p>If u take an exam which is set by a kindergarten kid, and the other 66% of the answer is disputable with no right or wrong answer, did u pass or fail?</p>
              <p>If someone had placed a bet on Villa winning at 2.35 $100 and other players (Sneider and Mueller) $100 at 2.5, total he will get back from scam pools is $78.5 and $83.</p>
              <p>Total Bet placed is $200, return $161.50. Lost $38.50, that's 3/4 of the answers right so now exams have passing marks above 75%?</p>

              <p>I'm up for you in this case as the S-pool might plays a little mind trick. S-Pool didn't state what is the implication of multiple top-scorers on the list, but at the same time, according to my understanding, are they limiting your choice of top-scorer up to one player only? There may be people who have bet on more than 1 top-scorer out there and he's celebrating.</p>
              <p>It's getting complicated I know, What say you? Maybe it'll be a relief if you check the rules and condition of big betting site like bwin has before deciding what to do next. I'm not sure myself either.</p>

              <p>Thanks Star for your support,</p>
              <p>I got how International Bookmarkers Payout, like Paddy Power and William Hill, for top scorer, say bet on Villa is 1/8 theirs which is fractional odds. which means if u had bet $10 you would get back $90.</p>
              <p>As there are joint 4 top scorers odds were slashed from 1/8 to 1/2, which means every $10 bet placed will get a return of $30. They divide the expected profit margin by number of winners and not meddling with the base amount.</p>
              <p>That way wining bets will be winning bets, division of the base amount would be scandalous.</p>
