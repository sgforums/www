              <p>STOMPer <strong>KSCHAN </strong>never thought that 
              winning his bet on the World Cup top scorers would actually lose him 
              money.<br><br>The STOMPer had bet $5 on Spanish striker David Villa, who
               turned out to be one of the four top scorers in the recent World Cup. 
              Unfortunately, the STOMPer only got $3.10 back because the payout was 
              split four ways.<br><br>He emailed STOMP in disbelief:<br><br>"Since 
              there is more than one striker who scored 5 goals in this World Cup, 
              Singapore Pools announced that the winnings for the Top Scorer will be 
              shared. <br><br>"I placed a $5 bet on David Villa to be the top scorer, 
              with the odds of 1.85.<br><br>"Under normal circumstances, I should have
               received $9.25 in return, earning me $4.25 in winnings. <br><br>"To my 
              disappointment, I received $3.10.<br><br>"This is one third of the total
               amount, including my capital!<br><br>"My friend bet on 'Players not 
              stated in the starting list', whose odds are 3.<br><br>"If there was one
               top scorer, he would get $15 (winnings of $10 plus $5 capital).<br><br>"But
               according to the way Singapore Pools computes, he will only get back 
              one third of the whole amount, which in his case is $5 - that's his 
              capital!<br><br>"Can Singapore Pools please comment on this?"<br><br><img src="http://static.stomp.com.sg/site/servlet/linkableblob/stomp/412414/data/20100714_ss_singpoolsticketcopy-data.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>That's the BIG problem, their our only LEGAL Bookie, they have taken this position for granted. Squeezing out horrible odds, with such high commission margins even with a market pool of 2 billion worth of bets every month. Even 4 D payout rate of 67%, which means they comission 33%, is way above most national average of 20/80.</p>
              <p>In an environment where there is no competition, it is amazing that their profit and loss statement has never been publicly available. Although it has been estimated that their profit per annum is at least 5 billion a year. One can't help wondering where have all the money gone?</p>
              <p>I have always avoided illegal bookies, knowingly and accepting the S-pools lower odds, going for reliability instead. Never have I expected to be scammed by this reliable Bookie. I guess I have to explore the avenue of online betting and illegal bookies after this incident.</p>
              <p>Scam Pools have always been trying to force out Illegal bookmakers, through use of scare tactics, but what have they done themselves to justify that they are S'pore's NO.1 Bookie? Fairness, Equality, Competitive rates, customer service? (till now I have not got a call from S-pools with regards to my query on pay out but they did call me to top up my WC account 3 days after it started)</p>
              <p>I guess maybe it is time to explore including another bookmaker, to have a fair market, even for the leisure punter. Being competitive in providing odds is the only way, Scam Pools can force out illegal bookie and not by swindling their punters or waving the baton. Afterall we have 2 casinos, why can't we have 2 bookies?</p>
