              comes to dealing with problem gambling here, said Acting Minister for 
              Community Development, Youth and Sports Chan Chun Sing.<br><br>"You have
               Internet gambling ... It's not just about casinos. If you want to 
              tackle the gambling issue, you have to look holistically across all the 
              factors that are driving this," Mr Chan said.<br><br>A more "focused" 
              approach would be taken to pre-empt the problem and prevent the 
              vulnerable from turning into pathological gamblers, he added<br><br>Mr 
              Chan singled out the elderly and low income as groups of people closest 
              to his heart when it comes to dealing with gambling issues.<br><br>As of June, 47,178 people have been excluded by the National Council of Problem Gambling from entering the local casinos.<br><br>Of this figure, 613 of them are family exclusion orders while 18,049 are self-exclusion orders. <br><br>The rest are third-party exclusion orders.<br><br>According
               to a Singapore Medical Journal article in June, people who sought 
              treatment for pathological gambling at the National Addictions 
              Management Service in recent years were younger, more educated and 
              involved more non-Chinese patients.<br><br>More than 60 per cent of the recent cohort of patients had reported football betting as their main gambling problem.<br><br>Less than one-third of the pathological gamblers in the study had reported casino gambling as their most problematic activity. <br><br>Researchers,
               however, warned that their numbers might increase in the future, "now 
              that it is no longer necessary to travel outside of Singapore to engage 
              in this form of gambling".<br><br>- </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/wk</span> </span></p>

              It is difficult to get participants to discuss on problem gambling because we will never able to understand why a gambling addict continues to gamble till he ends his life.
              
              A compulsive gambler will get into financial difficulty. He may commits criminal acts to get money to finance his gambling activities.

              <p>Just to share. I was once a heavy gambler. Mainly gambled in casino ship(LW and online), online poker, soccer betting and speculating stocks. Other smaller bets are 4D, Big Sweep, ToTo, mahjong. Being gambling addict  does`t really realize that the money is slowly slipping away. I estimated that my entire losses is nearly $100k in a span of 6 - 7 years. Each adventure cost about $3k - $5k, and when the adventure ends, I will ponder what went wrong and then conjure up another winning strategy, and the new adventure begins. Not only lost in money, I also lost so much time and youth, and the chance to get to know girls and get married. There was a time when I realized that I have less than $50 in my bank account. This puts a big dent in my self confidence and it will last a long time. I lost friends because I feel I did not achieve as much as they did.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, I did not borrow money to recoup, unlike some others. I started to regain control of myself by limiting to a small amount to gamble per month. This is extremely difficult, because there is always a voice inside to try to break this rule. At first, I relented and lost control a few times, but now I am ok. I still love gambling and the thoughts of gambling comes every single day, but I am determined to limit it to $300 per month, and it is working out ok. I hope those people who are out of control can stop and  think clear what they are losing in life, and do some self correction. I also applaud those who can entire threw the bad habit out of their lives, because I still cannot do it.</p>

              <p>Is gambling the problem, or the lack of money the problem.</p>
              <p>Would there be a problem if there was sufficient money. A multi millionaire gambles but cannot stop, but can return time and time again because he has sufficient funds. Does he not have a problem also. Do we say he is rich, so we don't give a damn about him. We don't give a damn about him because he do not go to the loan sharks and get additional problems. He do not cause trouble.</p>

              <p>The problem is irresponsibility from this group  that is attributed to gambling. It is the same as greed that give rise to irresponsible acts. It is when you have not enough money, and you make a decision about what to do about it. Budget, get more money honestly, or steal, borrow and borrow. Does it affect the family adversely. If it does not is gambling still a problem.</p>
              <p>So is gambling the problem, or the consequences of the lack of money.</p>

              Gambling is never the root cause of the problem. But addiction is. 
              
              A person cannot thinks rationally once he is addicted to gambling. He may resort to illegal means to get fund to finance his gambling habit.
              
              A gambling addict needs professional treatment from psychiatrist. 
              
              It will be good to have anti gambling sessions in primary school.

              Being an addict myself, I can explain why it's a problem.
              
              During a period, I cannot think of anything except gambling. It comes to a point it almost ruin my life. I can't focus on work, I make excuses to skip meetings and go home to gamble online. I went MBS and Sentosa a few times until I lost alot and then I went for self exclusion.
              
              But the emotional highs of gambling is like taking drugs. I took drugs before so I also know how taking drugs feel like. It makes you very happy during the period, but once you lost all the money, then the sunken feeling sinks in. During the period itself, you won't feel sad or anything, you feel energized and hyper, very happy moment.
              
              When you are bored, then there can never be anything like such moments to perk you up.
              
              The problem comes in when you don't have any discipline. And that's my problem. I make $100, I will gamble $50 for example. The loss I made can buy another house already but it's lost away.
              
              And addicted gamblers cant think properly... only after they lost everything, and borrow and go into debts, then the full weight of the problem hits them. They feel they are loseless and no way out. (but if they win then they feel super obviously)... when they lose everything in a moment when it took so long to save all those money, then they feel they let everyone down and therefore ending their lives some of them.

              <p>Agree. Being indulged in gambling, the person will also put the games at 1st priority. Not only career suffers, family is also neglected. I remembered my parents just wanna have a converstation with me, but I was in the middle of a poker online tournament, so cannot stop. So I always give a yes no answer and glued my eyes on the screen, or give impatient replies to show hat I am busy! Looking back, they must be hurt by my unwillingness to commute. By the way, I feel my parents are the best in the world. I will definitely be filial to them and take good care of them now that they are old. :)</p>

              So true... even me also, once i am gambling, i cannot listen or talk or i feel very aggitated because money is involved... but what you said is so true, i probably neglected their feelings.

              <p>Which is the most addictive game for you? For me, its confirm online poker. The urge still quite strong, haha. I even self exclude myself in several poker rooms (Titan, PartyPoker, Ladbrokes).</p>
              <p>The others are no problem in controlling and in descending order are soccer betting, ToTo, mahjong, live dealer casino (blackjack). Totally no interest in landed casino, horse racing and slots.</p>
