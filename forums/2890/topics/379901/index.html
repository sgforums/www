              <p>hi guys,</p>
              <p> I encounter this case: I throw 1 wan but my down people eat the card but he took wrong card 4 wan. In the end he zi mo.</p>
              <p> I told him he mistake liao the card I hit is 1 wan and not 4 wan ( he claim that I should have told him straight away when he took the wrong card ). </p>
              <p>to my own view I still think he è©�èƒ¡. ( cos he took the wrong card ).</p>
              <p> do share your view. Our stake is rather high and house rule stated we not allow to say out other people mistake during the game.</p>

              <p>this is a case of è©�èƒ¡, no questions about it.</p>
              <p>in the 1st place, we are not obliged to say out if someone make a mistake. sometimes ppl tend to forget to take their cards that they eat or pong, or they take the wrong card.</p>
              <p>the house rules is already set that u all are not supposed to say out if there's a mistake, then he should follow the rules, and pay up the penalty for è©�èƒ¡.</p>
              <p>@ ItchyArmpit, i think what he meant was that, he didnt voice out that mistake when his friend took the wrong card. he only told him that he took the wrong card after he zi mo. and his friend said he should have told him straight away that he made a mistake, which by right shouldnt be the case. :D</p>
