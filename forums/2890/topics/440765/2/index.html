              <p>I don't think there is anything they can do to you also mah if

              The online casino will never let you owe money in 99% of the cases (because unlike real casino, if you default, very hard to chase after people all around the world, imagine someone from Nigeria, how you chase?), so you always have to pay up first (transfer money to their account)...
              
              However, there are times when people really went crazy. They used their credit cards and gamble, max out all their cards limit, knowingly without the ability to pay, and that's when they will default on the debts and facing bankruptcy. This is what I know happened to some people and they got very stressed and depressed and suicide is on their mind. So in a way, I'm glad (consoling myself) I haven't reached that stage. but i am deeply disappointed in my own self.
              
              however, for real casino, they can loan you money assuming you're part of the vip and they know you have a high probability of not defaulting, based on their credit/asset check on you. They have a system to do that. so it's alot more dangerous in real casino. i believe some people commited suicide after they lost a fortune and go into debts. imagine you're a multi millionaire, go casino over 2 days lost all everything, wah lao, if me i also wan go die.

              <p>How do you increase the betting limits in the online casino? I used to request higher limits but the reply from them says its up to them to decide after reviewing/monitor my account. So far, its only $500 per bet for blackjack.</p>
              <p>I am wondering if they increased your limit because you deposited $100k? I think my lost of a few thousands is nothing to them, I am small fish only. hehe.</p>

              I bet with them for a long time already, similar to other gambling sites like william hill for example, they have a points system based on how much you bet/lose (i dunno how they calculate)... but once you accumulate enough points, your vip status increase and your bet limits increase and ur benefits also increase... i think mine got more than 3 years... like i said, every few months to a year i will hand itchy play once have money... thats why i hoping someone have a permanent solution.
