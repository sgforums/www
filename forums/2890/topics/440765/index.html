              <p>That is a big bomb. Which casino you played? Which game? Bacarrat, Blackjack, Roulette? How much did you bet per game? When I played last time, there was a table limit of up to $500 only, how come you can lose so much?</p>
              <p>If you really wish to play, you should try the live dealer type. I find it less of a scam cos we get to see the dealer handling those extra large cards... ...</p>

              i gambled at betfair... it has a history of paying... i used to play with williamhill but i sense their live poker was a scam because they seems to have more small cards (which creates a bigger house advantage)
              
              i bet soccer also lah. i have a bad history of addicted to gambling... previously quit and for about a year ok then yesterday came up again, dunno what to do...
              
              i can't go mbs or sentosa coz i self banned, but hand itchy go online to gamble...
              
              rather than looking at the past, i just want to know how to stop ruining the future... no matter what i read or learn online and then i can stop for 1 year or few months and then i went back to losing...
              
              the gambling addiction creates a high... especially when nothing to do, then hand itchy... aiyah, very sian, today is a very sian day for me...

              <p>Was in the same boat as you (see my other post). I used to play poker, soccer and casino. Lost about the same as you, but in a span of about 7-8 years...not 1 day.</p>
              <p>I had stopped for about 6 months plus already and the urge is still there. But I practised self control. I set aside $300 per month for such entertainment, and made myself stick to this one rule no matter how bored or itchy hands.</p>
              <p>You can also try this method of mine. But once you reach the limit, cannot continue until the 1st of next month.Tell yourself to wait for that day, which is at most 30 days only (if you lost your set limit on day 1). When urge is there, go do other stuffs like swimming, or watch drama shows or movies to divert your attention.</p>

              Thanks... feel very depressed when i woke up today... but it's already past and i can't change it so just hope others can learn from my lesson...
              
              as for what games i played, everything lah... roulette, blackjack, soccer, baccarat, jackpot, etc... i did play the live games because you know it's less likely to cheat... but i played the wrong strategy, when you bet big amounts, you start to shake and cannot concentrate...
              
              i used the double down technique so my last 3 bets was on blackjack 10k, 30k, 60k. before i even bet the 10k i said to myself after this win i go sleep, but fate has it i lost all 3 in a row, i thought not so unlucky but also because i cannot think well when playing big amounts.
              
              first game i got 13, the banker card was a value 10. I scared bust (wrong strategy) so i never hit. the banker shows card he got 17.
              
              second game, i got 15, banker card shows 7. so i never hit. the banker shows card, he got 17 again.
              
              third game, i can't remember because i dun dare to see... i just hear because at the end it will say "dealer wins" or "you win"... my heart tanked when i hear dealer wins...
              
              i dun think i will set aside money for gambling like you did. i am disgusted about gambling.
              
              i wish there was a pill to cure gambling, maybe turn that part of the gene off. i think it's a greed gene. coz i won and i didn't just leave but kept playing whole day till i lost.
              
              very depressed but i think i will get over it within a few weeks, usually like that and then after making money a few months or 1 year later the habit comes back, hand itchy... 
              
              i went online read all kinds of advice and even try to read other people's similar stories but can't help.
              
              i dun even dare tell my gf she sure scold me. so pretty much can't share with anyone and i dun dare tell my friends too ashamed to do so.

              <p>Bro, I totally can understand how you felt. So far, my largest bet was a S$5k bet on a blackjack live dealer game. I also followed the double down method, which has a name call Martengale System. I started at $100, then $200, $400....I remembered I doubled down or split (cannot remember), so there was a quadruble bet, thats why I reach a $5k final showdown. I had a 14, and the dealer showed a 10. I followed the basic strategy and hit. That feeling of anticipating that card and the fear... ...I busted. That stretch costed me about $8k over.</p>
              <p>Martengale System cannot be used in casino because there is a table limit. Ok, imagine if you have unlimited funds and you use this system, its virtually impossible to lose cos there will be one time you will hit a win. I know of a game without limits and I am now pooling abit of $ to try it next year. Frankly, if I have your $100k, it will be nearly impossible for me to lose, although returns will not be big. Maybe about $3k - $4k per month profit, but with many interrupted sleep at nights... ...</p>
              <p>Last thing, never touch jackpot. Its a game for the stupids...</p>

I also concocted a simple program to calculate the true count of the deck in blackjack. It does not guarantee wins, but at least will improve the chances against the dealer and help me decide the amount to bet. I even thought of selling this program, just not sure whether anyone wants to buy or not. ;)</p>
              <p>DailyFreeGames, I am impressed that you have so much money at 30. You inherit from ancestors? Or hit ToTo jackpot? Or really have that high a salary? If got lobang, help me abit leh... ...</p>
              <p>I also dun think I can and intend to quit gambling. Its fun and exciting!</p>
              <p>But I am managing the self control, and seems that it is working ok. Only follow my one rule: Stick to the limit per month.</p>

              basically i no life just work and work... if you do the same thing then sure you can save money lah... and also i run a small company so money can go up fast and down fast, depending on the clients and sales... when i was down in my times, i lost $60k in 1 year (imagine you work and work and never get salary and instead lose 60k) but was very fortunate to be able to clear off the debts within the next year... but what goes down will go up also...
              
              if you're those type no life can work and work, then most likely will do well eventually in business... to me, it's a life and death situation... if i dun work i will die...

              <p>erm I never try online gambling before.</p>
              <p>I want to ask.</p>
              <p>If you like dailyfreegames lost 100k a day and you got no money or don't want to pay up, what can they do?</p>
              <p>I don't think there is anything they can do to you also mah if you don't pay.</p>
              <p>Even if they engage a lawyer to sue you, at most you declare bankrupt and they still can't get back the money mah</p>
