              <p>Going to casino is to gamble, with the odds clearly against gamblers. House odds ranges between 1% to 5% on average, so to speak, there is chances to win but there is a slightly higher chance to lose money.</p>
              <p>People go to casino hoping to win obviously, with most thinking they will have the luck to overcome the disadvantageous odds.</p>
              <p>The other reason gamblers are addicted is because of something called emotions. When you gamble, there is some chemistry going on in your body that makes you hook, just like smoking... You get the moments of highs and lows and if you stop gambling, you keep thinking about it. Actually, it's the same with sports sometimes, when you love soccer and one month you need to stop playing, you keep thinking about wanting to play soccer, same applies to gambling except the highs of winning money is higher.</p>

              1) Mr X is working in a profession whereby income is hard to be regulated i.e. hawker etc...He tries to under-declare his income to avoid taxes...So he goes to casino with his takings from his business and convert them to chips; tries a few round on the blackjack table. Either convert them back to cash or remain as chips. Then he declares his business is not making money. His excuse that his bank account is still well-fed if kena checked by IRAS is because of his gambling winnings. So he can avoid paying tax or pay lesser than he should. 
                                  
              2) Mr Y wants to give his potential customer some coffee money so that his customer will consider his company's proposal instead of others. Mr Y brings his customer to the casino, give him chips instead of cash. The customer then converts the chips and cash out. If kena investigated, says he win on the table...nothing wrong mah. 
                                  
              3) Mr Z is a bookie. All his money as you know is unclean...he has to open a few accounts so as not to arouse suspicions from authorities during match days when there are many suspicious 'transactions'. Now with casino, he just have to bring his takings there and convert them to chips and then back to cash. Now his money is clean liao.

              paying tax or pay lesser than he should.</p>
              <p>2) Mr Y wants to give his potential customer some coffee money
              so that his customer will consider his company’s proposal instead
              of others. Mr Y brings his customer to he casino, give him chips
              instead of cash. The customer converts the chips and cash out. If
              kena investigated, says he win on the table…nothing wrong mah.</p>
              <p>3) Mr Z is a bookie. All his money as you know is unclean…he has
              to open a few accounts so as not to arouse suspicions from
              authorities during match days when there are many suspicious
              ‘transactions’. Now with casino, he just have to bring his takings
              there and convert them to chips and then back to cash. Now his
              money is clean liao.</p>
