              <p>Anyway, there aren't as many locals at MBS these few days as before.  Perhaps it is because they lost too much on Hari Rayah day.   MBS tends to double the minimum bet during public holidays (at least on Blackjack tables).</p>

              <p>Thanks for the reference to the movie... there are a few other such local productions on Youtube.</p>
              <p>I know there are other ways of growing wealth including the risk-free interest earning saving accounts at Big 3 in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The point I was trying to make is not to encourage gambling but indicate that poorer Singaporeans on the average spend only at most 1-2 percent of their annual income ($364 per year) to pursue their millionaire dreams and to keep their hopes alive.  Obviously these people also have a regular job and can afford to lose this amount of small money.   They are not in industry such as property agent industry where one could be a millionaire overnight if one nails a big deal nor have a chance of becoming CEO of a big company.</p>
              <p>I personally believe in the 4D, Toto and Singapore Sweep method because I am still up on my total investment on them.   Even if I am down, they still keep my becoming rich dreams alive and everyone has an equal chance including foreign maids with no office politics, schools you graduated from, middleman cuts, sexual favours and bribery factors to skew the opportunities.</p>
              <p>However I would not say the same for regular Casino gambling as people who go there go there to enjoy, pass time, get exitment and occasionally win.</p>
