These hot new eateries are giving quintessential local fares in the East a run for their money. By Terry Ong</p>
              <p style="color: #000000 !important; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 13px !important; line-height: 15pt !important; margin: 0px;">If there is one thing that Singaporean foodies can agree upon regarding local fare like bah kut teh, laksa, beef kway teow and frog porridge; it is that some of our best can be found in the East. Things are heating up this side of town with more international eateries and restaurants opening up along Joo Chiat and East Coast roads, giving residents around the area more options than ever before (not that they’re not already spoilt for choice to begin with). Family types and tweens have been flocking to Western restaurants like Astons at East Coast Road for its veritable and affordable selection of steaks and other favorites like grilled chicken and fish &amp; chips for the last couple of years, and it’s one of the most successful restaurants in the area. Add four hot new joints like Indian restaurant Kashmir and cool café Everything with Fries into the mix, and the culinary scene in the East is looking more exciting than ever. I-S recommends these new kids on the eastern block for your next food fix.</p>

Open daily 11am-10pm. </strong><br>There are over 100 food items here (we kid you not) to choose from, making two-month-old Don &amp; Grill Bistro one of the most ambitious restaurants in the East. Boasting two separate Western and Japanese menus, proprietor Michael Tham decided to set up this 70-seater restaurant in the East because “of lower rents compared to more central areas,” he says. “We are also the only restaurant that carries two extensive Western and Japanese food menus … although we don’t do anything that’s fusion.” Having had six years of experience running two food stalls in Toa Payoh and Shenton Way serving, you guessed it, Western and Japanese food respectively, Tham decided to merge the two kitchens at this cozy joint, which reminds one of old-school cafes from yesteryears with its simple setting—and therein lies its charm. “Our unique selling point is also that we offer quality food at food court prices,” Tham adds, “which is important for an area filled with mainly families and teenagers … and I’ve had repeat customers who claim that our food is comparable to that of more established restaurants.”<br><strong>Come here if</strong>: You’re with a large group of friends so that you can order a wide range of dishes and enjoy sharing portions.<br><strong>Must try</strong>: Don’s signature dishes like masala fish and chips ($10.50), spicy whole spring chicken ($15) and spicy seafood spaghetti goreng ($11.50) pack quite a punch, while the tori teriyaki bento is another popular favorite among Don’s regulars.</p>

Open Tue-Sun noon-10pm.</strong><br>The name says it all. Every main course at this chic white-walled café from the people who brought us Awfully Chocolate comes with a large serving of fries (choose from either straight-cut or shoe-string sized ones). While variety is key at Don’s Bar &amp; Grill, the menu here is decisively small—with only nine main courses and five starters to choose from. “Everything that we serve here is made from scratch to ensure freshness—from the lamb patties to the bread to the flame-grilled pork chop,” says service captain Darius Lim. Indeed, keeping things small and fresh is what keeps the crowd coming back for its popular mains of lamb burger ($9.90) and breaded salmon ($13.90), which are sold out on weekends as quantity is very limited. There’s even a mini library here that makes this a perfect spot to hang out on a balmy weekend afternoon as you dig into desserts like the Nutella tart ($4.90) and Mille crepe ($5.90) that will satiate those with a sweet tooth, or a hearty butterscotch strawberry shake ($5.90) for those who are a little hungrier. <br><strong>Come here if</strong>: You’re looking for an alternative cool café that you can tell all your friends about later. <br><strong>Must tr</strong><strong>y</strong>: The mains are a treat, but if you want something more unique, go for the starter One Egg Soup ($3.90), which is made from chicken broth thickened with egg yolk, topped with soufflé—nice.</p>

Open daily 12:30-2:30pm, 6-10:30pm.</strong><br>Following its success at Race Course Road, Kashmir’s husband-and-wife team Rohit and Shweta Razdan decided to bring their exquisite North Indian, Kashmiri and Moghul dishes to the folks in the East five months ago—the East Coast outlet is also bigger, seating up to 100, compared to Race Course’s 60. “We’ve had many Indian families who come from the East … and moving here is also part of our gradual plan to expand to other areas like Bukit Timah in the near future,” the couple shares. All of Rohit’s wonderfully considered dishes like the tandoori prawns ($20), the juicy and addictive kabargah (ribs of lamb boiled in milk and fried, $15) and the beautiful palak paneer (cottage cheese cooked with spinach, $12) are still present, on top of specially-created Chinese dishes like lemon chicken ($14) and crispy Peking lamb ($16) just for the folks in the East. And on weekdays, for just $10 nett, foodies can get their fix on all-you-can-eat fish, chicken, vegetables, starters, naan, soups and rice during lunch hour—now that’s a steal!<br><strong>Come here if</strong>: You love gourmet Indian dishes, which Kashmir has plenty to offer.<br><strong>Must try</strong>: Everything in the menu is fantastic, but special mention must go to the gushtaba (minced lamb that takes 90 minutes to pound, and cooked in yummy yoghurt curry, $15)—one of Kashmir’s signatures.</p>

Open Tue-Sun 11:30am-2:30pm, 6pm-10pm. </strong><br>If you’re craving modern European cuisine, intimate 40-seater Private Affairs will do the trick. The vibe here is chic and posh, with plush sofas and down tempo music piping from the speakers, while chef Paul Ng and his team dish out modern European cuisine with a touch of Asian flavors. There are only two menus which change every month—“The Private Affair” is a four-course menu at $98++ and “A Luscious Affair” is a seven-course menu at $168++—where guests can choose from a selection of Chef’s Signature Dishes to create their own courses. There is also a popular Sunday semi ala carte buffet brunch where diners can indulge in main courses such as Wagyu beef burger, poached chicken, Kurobuta pork belly, barramundi fish and seafood pasta for $68++. For an additional $50++ per head, you have the option of having free flow Louis Roederer Champagne if you’re looking to indulge yourself. <br><strong>Come here if</strong>: You’re looking for a quick getaway from the hustle and bustle of the East and in a mood to chill out. <br><strong>Must try</strong>: Signatures dishes like white lobster bisque with salmon and lobster cannelloni, capsicum and lemongrass crumbs.</p>
