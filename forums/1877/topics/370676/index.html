              <p>Myth 1: <span style="line-height: normal; white-space: pre;"><strong>Singaporeans are not native speakers of English</strong></span></p>
              <p><em>Adam Brown</em></p>
              <p>This claim is often made by some Singaporeans as apology for the nature of their variety of English and their general proficiency. The implication is that Singaporeans do not speak English well because they do not have the advantage of being native speakers of the language.<br>        In order to examine this claim, it is necessary to explore the term <em>native speaker</em>. It is a term which many people use in everyday discourse, but which few people, when pressed, would be able to give a rigorous definition for. But even linguists find this a difficult term to define. The definitions used in this chapter come from Richard et al's (1985) <em>Longman Dictionary of Applied Linguistics</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>Native language, first language and mother tongue</strong></p>
              <p>A native speaker is defined as 'a person considered as a speaker of his or her native language' (p 188). This begs the question, considered by whom?: by the person him- or herself, or by others? Leaving this issue aside (but it is not a trivial question), we need to define <em>native language</em>.<br>        A native language is '(usually) the language which a person acquires in early childhood because it is spoken in the family and/or it is the language of the country where he or she is living' (p 188). By these criteria, many Singaporeans are native speakers of English. Increasingly, Singaporeans are acquiring English in early childhood. The national census of 2000 shows that 23% of the population report that English is the most frequently spoken language in the home. It is certainly a language of the country - one of the four official languages alongside Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.<br>        'Sometimes, this term [<em>native language</em>] is used synonymously with <em>first language</em>' (p 188). We therefore need to define <em>first language</em>. A first language is '(generally) a person's mother tongue or the language acquired first' (p 106). And now we have another term that needs definition: <em>mother tongue</em>. In fact, Richards et al equate the three (<em>native language, first language </em>and<em> mother tongue</em>), but with some hedging (<em>usually, sometimes, generally, often</em>). The abbreviation L1 is often used for first language, although, if this is taken to be synonymous with native language and mother tongue, it ought to be usable as an abbreviation of these too.<br>        Further complications arise:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The native language is often the first language a child acquires but there are exceptions. Children may, for instance, first acquire some knowledge of another language from a nurse or an older relative and only later on acquire a second one which they consider their native language. (p 188)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>A similar caveat is contained in the definition of <em>first language:</em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In multilingual communities, however, where a child may gradually shift from the main use of one language to the main use of another (eg because of the influence of a school language), <em>first language</em> may refer to the language the child feels most comfortable using. (p 106)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That is, the word <em>first</em> in the phrase <em>first language</em> may refer to first in chronological order of acquisition, or first in terms of proficiency and importance.<br>        By now, it should be obvious to the reader that these terms are not a clear-cut as they may appear at first glance. For this reason, writers have proposed differing terms for the status of a language in a particular situation.</p>
              <p><strong>English as a native, second and foreign language</strong></p>
              <p>A traditional division in the applied linguistics circle is between English as a native, second or foreign language (ENL, ESL, EFL). Unfortunately, there is a distinction between the use of these terms in Britain and America. In America, both <em>foreign language</em> and <em>second language</em> are often used to refer to a language which 'is usually studied either for communication with foreigner who speak the language, or for reading printed materials in the language' (p 108). In Britain, however, a distinction is maintained.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A foreign language is a language which is taught as a school subject but which is not used as a medium of instruction in schools nor as a language of communication within a country (eg in government, business, or industry). ...A second language is a language which is widely used as a medium of communication (eg in education and government) and which is usually used alongside another language or languages. (p 108)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>France, Japan and China are cited as EFL countries, while Fiji, Singapore and Nigeria are called ESL countries.<br>        You may have noticed a subtle shift in the entity being describe as ENL/ESL/EFL. This was clear in the definition for the term <em>native speaker</em> which cited both 'the language of the country'. That is, do these terms refer to the languages spoken by people, or rather in contexts (countries)? It is the second criterion (the use of a language in a country) that is included in the definition of ESL. However, in the case of ENL, it is not clear. There are, for example, many speakers in ENL countries (the USA, UK, Australia, etc) who do not speak English natively (eg Hispanics in the USA).</p>
              <p><strong>The three circles</strong></p>
              <p>A similar model, proposed by Kachru (1992; see McArthur 1998), uses three circles to group countries as shown in Figure 1.1. The inner circle comprises the world's primary native-speaking communities (the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand), sometimes also called <em>Old Englishes</em>. The outer circle contains post-colonial English-speaking communities (also called <em>New Englishes</em>), and includes Singapore. Finally the outer circle, which is the largest of the three, comprises the rest of the world.</p>
              <p><strong>Further considerations</strong></p>
              <p>Two other terms are often encountered: <em>nativised</em> and <em>indigenised</em>. These are used to refer to outer circle situations where English is not the historical language of the country, but where it is widely used in official contexts, and where a local variety of the language has become established and has gained recognition. There are people who are 'native' speakers of this historically 'non-native' variety.<br>        A further complication arises from the fact that, in Singaporean educational circles, <em>mother tongue</em> is often used synonymously with <em>second language</em> to refer to Mandarin, Malay or Tamil. That is, the medium of school education is English, and therefore all school students receive instruction in English and need to be proficient in it for their other subjects. However, the bilingual policy means that all students must also take another language, known as the mother tongue, but also often called the second language (English being the first). The mother tongue is taken to follow from the student's paternal ethnicity, ie Chinese students take Mandarin, Malay students take Malay, and Indian students take Tamil. In other words, the mother tongue is in fact the father's native language. Any departure from this scheme requires permission from the authorities.<br>        Richards et al mention another feature which might be taken as a criterion for native speaker status: 'In generative transformational grammar, the intuition of a native speaker about the structure of his or her language is one basis for establishing or confirming the rules of the grammar' (p 188). Nowadays, many linguists would argue with this point of view. The advent of large computer corpora for linguistic analysis, especially for the compiling of dictionaries, has in fact shown that many of the intuitions that native speakers hold about their language are not borne out by observed facts. That is, we think we behave in a certain way in our native language but in fact our intuitions may be biased by stereotypes and we actually behave in rather different ways.<br>        If we accept that intuitions can be taken as a mark of native speaker status, then it has to be said that few Singaporeans seem to have strong intuitions about English. Beliefs about English seem to be influenced heavily by the kind of myths that this book attempts to investigate and dispel. And, as we say in several places in this book, those beliefs are often perpetuated by teachers, and are often wide of the mark.</p>
              <p><strong>Learners</strong></p>
              <p>A final term which might be discussed before we close this chapter is <em>learner</em>. This word may be somewhat ambiguous. Learners might be though of as people who learn things because they are taught them. In this sense, Singaporeans are certainly learners, since English is a school subject for everyone. However, many Singaporeans feel unhappy acknowledging that they are learners of English. The second sense is that people learn things because they did not know them before. In this sense, I am as much a learner of English as anyone else. I regularly consult dictionaries such as the <em>Collins Cobuild English Dictionary for Advanced Learners</em> and <em>Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</em>, and find out things that I was not aware of or not sure of before. It seems incongruous that many Singaporeans are unwilling to call themselves learners of English, while I am.<br>        Singapore is a unique linguistic situation. Several interesting questions about the definition of terms follow from all the above discussion.</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>Can people have no language as their native language?</li>
              <li>Can people be native speakers of more than one language?</li>
              <li>If people speak only one language, can anyone claim that they are not native speakers of that language?</li>
              <li>Is a person's first language the one they acquired first in childhood, or the one they are currently most confident in, or the one they use most frequently, etc?</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>There are no easy answers to these questions (also see Foley 2001).</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p>There are many Singaporeans who only speak English (20% of Chinese, 3% of Malays and 22% of Indians, according to the 2000 census), or who speak English fluently but no other language with the same fluency. English is widespread in Singapore throughout the whole population. It should be clear from the preceding discussion that my personal attitude is that such monolingual people in Singapore can be called native speakers. Otherwise, we have the incongruous situation of monolingual speakers without any native language.<br>        Readers may object that such people are monolingual in <em>Singapore</em> English, not in standard international English. However, this is not a valid argument, as there are many native speakers in the USA, UK, etc who do not command a standard internation variety of English. A Singapore English speaker is, in this respect, no different from a speaker from, say, Newcastle - fluent and monolingual in one (albeit non-standard) variety of English. In short, native.</p>
