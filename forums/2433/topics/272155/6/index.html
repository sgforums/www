            <div class='col-md body'>the aero package differs from race to race so can't fault them for seeming to have the wrong details unless it is for that specific race. For mclaren's case this year, mid season the wings appeared on top of the aigo words just like the sharp edges on the ferraris which also appeared mid season.<br>Notice the "devil's horns" (winglets behind the head of a MP4/2X a classic design from 2005 (that has been copied by BMW) are missing later season.<br>Nose obviously changing from race to race but the general design has been the one with the sub wing going over the nose.<br>So I guess the hot wheel's car is from a mclaren just back from the flyaway races and before the canadian round. I go around looking for the exact race which the model is based on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its the weekend or close to that. Time for this week's pictures.<br><br>The year is 2002. Schumacher makes history by making sure that he was on the podium for the whole season, often on the top 2 step. Ferrari's F2002 is the fastest f1 car in history because it is the last year they had the 1 hour qualifying. (before all the new regs on the one shot qualifying with race fuel occured next season).  Williams had the 1-2 in Malaysia. Vodafone joins in as sponsor and removing tictacs from Ferrari's sponsorship. Alain Prost's Prost team goes bankrupt. Arrows goes bankrupt. Kimi at his first year at Mclaren almost won his first race in France but was denied the victory because of some toyota's oil spill. Thus Schumacher won the WDC at the French GP.<br><br>The car, launch edition F2001 painted in F2002 colours raced at the first GP of the year at Australia.

I have even sent some of the non ferraris to my working place. And the problem is that there are more models coming in....<br><br>taka used to sell and *may* sell from time to time.

And that is my 2nd king of desert.<br><br>The other story is that I once saw the renault's 100 win stocked in taka itself. Rushed to the counter to pay for it... but it was not for sale..... duh...they stocked it incorrectly. So I wonder where those 2 landed up. One thing for sure is that they never landed up in the shops mentioned in the thread.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The 2003 collection would be a bit late as I have been busy lately. I'll get the missing photo done by Saturday Afternoon. Next week, I'll have to skip the 2004 collection as I'm missing one or 2 cars so I can't show it. So only the 2005 collection on the final gp weekend then the 2006 collection which recently just completed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The year is 2003. Like this year (2007) there were a few hopefuls for the crown. MS started the year with the old car and did not win until imola, the 4th race of the season. A few won their first races, kimi, fisi and alonso all of them whom HW made specials for them. fisi won in a terrible race of attrition in the brazillian gp of 2003 which is a must watch for how dumb a race can and will happen in the race especially for that expensive car park which saw no less than 6 cars parked there. The models collected during this period reflect how close the season was and what really happened. The title was more or less secured during the US gp where it could go 3 ways, montoya, ms and kimi but MS won very  narrowly in wet conditions. Only a valiant fight from RB at Japan helped MS to win it from the ever charging Kimi. With this I bring you the 2003 collection.<br><br>To start off. The car which ferrari started the year with, premiere edition of 2003. The famous F2002 which won its first and last races (and many inbetween) in its life. People call this the Australian GP car because it was raced there....<br><a href="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b127/yeekin/F1/2003/DSC08684.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b127/yeekin/F1/2003/th_DSC08684.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b127/yeekin/F1/2003/DSC08683.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b127/yeekin/F1/2003/th_DSC08683.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b127/yeekin/F1/2003/DSC08682.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b127/yeekin/F1/2003/th_DSC08682.jpg"></a><br></div>
