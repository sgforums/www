But certain issue are not interpreted correctly by individually. some may not take it as a joke while some  vent their anger posting in forum, while others take it as a pinch of salt.<br><br>To tell the truth, both parties has its own points and there are a few members in the forum whose have given their points.<br><br>In conclusion, i have to apologise if i have create misunderstanding or flaming due to my pics. I hope everybody can enjoy the models hobby and give constructive advises. Let all be abit more sensative to posts and some may even take it as a pinch of salt.<br><br>There is no pin pointing of who is right and who is wrong cos i dont wish to burn too much brain cell talking abt this issue. To add on, i sincerely thanks those who take time and effort in writting and replying this post<br><br>Can we let bygones be bygones and let enjoy collecting together.<br>Let us receive our year end model pic shoot with enthu and hopes for many good years of model collecting. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
