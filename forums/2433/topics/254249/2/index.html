            <div class='col-md body'>Not really 1st time la... Actually 2nd time.. 1st time was from South Korea through eBay.<br>I'm from Malaysia btw.<br>Actually, this is what happened last year. I'm just a student..<br>My dad wanted to get this set of golf clubs on ebay (after my 1st car from overseas). We lost out on bidding, and someone emailed us saying it's the seller and offered us a '2nd chance offer'. Well, me being an idiot last time and didn't know how to think properly, I showed my dad the email. The scammer said the money was to be sent by wire transfer, after sending the money, we didn't get a reply after 2 weeks... It ended up being a fraud and nothing can be done... How much you ask? US$340... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Well, that's why I'm actually a bit confused now...<br><br>But with you guys giving me confidence with this purchase, I'm really just excited about receiving the model. I'll of course definitely buy again from Jacky. He's got some interesting models at reasonable prices. Hope my F40 is safe now and won't arrive damaged.. My Aston V8 Vantage's box (the 1st purchase online) took quite a beating from the Malaysian custons! *scared*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to exercise due diligence and do your homework to avoid being scammed on Ebay. Take note of the feedbacks given to the seller. Where do those feedbacks come from? Then take a look at feedbacks given to those buyers. Make sure that those aren't just accounts being set up fraudently by the seller to generate his own feedbacks. Of course, the old adage always applies. If its too good to be true, then its probably is. As time goes by, you'll find out who can be trusted and who are those you should stay away from.</div>
