            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, assortment is very disappointing indeed, so can save up some money this month. Nikko is not a very effective distributor in this sense, as we are being deprived of many of the latest models. Their mark-up is ridiculously high, so even after member discount prices are about the same or even slightly higher than in other countries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well its true that they would only bring new stocks in after the sale. however you also have to consider the time it takes to ship these in from china. most of those models you see on ebay are probably from hkor other places close to china and probably not to be found in places like the states. a little wait is to be expected. that said im kinda disappointed that the 911 gt3 road car and the porsche lmp which have already been released in europe are not here yet. all in all, i would say nikko provides a mixed bag, sometimes we are the first to get certain models like the f40 and the pink pig gt3rsr.</div>

Look at Nikko... they can't even clear their old stock... so many old pieces lying around... and sometimes, even the newer ones aren't cleared as fast... I guess thats y nikko is being quite selective in the models they are willing to bring in, as well as the quantity to bring in... Too many, and they will be saddled with stagnant stock... too little, and they might lose customers... And with the recent slight increase in price, it doesn't really work in their favour too... I could have gotten the new stock for much less on ebay.. even after including shipping costs...</div>
