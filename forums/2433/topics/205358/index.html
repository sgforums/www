            <div class='col-md body'>As i've worked in as a 2nd hand car-dealer b4,<br>i would have driven numerous car-types.<br>2 of e car types (01' Sunny &amp; 03' Peoguet206) i've rented &amp; tested.<br>Here're my views of few of em:<br><br>91' Starlet XL 1litre:<br>One of my fav mini-hatchback. Cheap, simple with good ride quality. Although bland interior, it's a petrol saver. After 100kmh, car becomes less stable due to lightweight. A very practical budget car.<br><br>92' Suzuki Swift SF413GL 1.3litre:<br>One of e best hatchback cars i've driven. Good pickup &amp; speed for a small budget car like this. 1/2 tank can last 1 week if driven properly. Short gear-range from 1st-3rd gear. Low resale/ scrap value.<br><br>92' Suzuki Swift GTi 1.3litre:<br>Considered one of e most powerful sports-hatch of its time. Very powerful for a 1.3litre with 3cylinders. Magnificient pickup, but hard to come by one in good condition. Lower resale/ scrap value, considering its status as a performance hatch.<br><br>93' Toyota Corolla XLI 1.3litre:<br>Quite roomy but bland interior, but fuel consumption is slightly more than other 1.3litres. Stiff handling. One of e more common budget COE cars around.<br><br>04-05' Hyundai Getz 5dr 1.3litre:<br>Fuel consumption relatively ok, but noisy engine.Stiff and scary on tight cornering 80kmh &amp; above. Cant get over 120 without a jerky ride. Overall good budget PARF car.<br><br>03' Peoguet 206 1.4litre:<br>Rented this car. Went rounding with it, &amp; was a petrol-saver.$20 95-octane for 1 whole night, &amp; plenty remaining e next morning. Relatively good pickup &amp; stable cornering, probably due to its short gear-ratio. However, car becomes unstable over 100kmh, &amp; around 130 seems to be e limit of this lightweight car. 120 on uneven ground already e car lifted off-ground. Any faster would send tis car flying. Tested its speed in an unintentional race with a 92' Colt on e TPE months back, which i lost.<br><br>03-04' Honda Jazz 1.4litre:<br>Considered e most popular mini-hatch, &amp; best fuel consumption of its category - over 20km/l. Performs as a Honda should. Responsive handling. Relative high resale/ export value. Great value for money.<br><br>03' Mitsubishi Colt 1.5litre:<br>Comparable to Honda Jazz in terms of ride quality. Stylish interior. Petrol consumption not bad. One of e most common min-MPVs around next to e Jazz. Relatively high resale/ export value. A very practical daily car tat delivers performance.<br><br>04-05' Hyundai Accent 1.5litre:<br>Relatively budget car, but cheap interior &amp; noisy engine. Good small-size sedan for short-term ride. Fuel consumption ok. Engine problems might start to kick-in after 2yrs. Low resale/ export value.<br><br>91' Honda Civic GL 1.6litre:<br>Old &amp; "squarish" family car. Can't run fast. Didn't work for me. Water-tank overheats easily. Petrol drinker with no performance. An "uncle" car.<br><br>91-93' Nissan Presea 1.6litre:<br>Very powerful &amp; responsive engine with low-ride. Good pickup, but fuel sucker. Stiff handling. I like its exterior styling. Potential to modd into R32 lookalike.<br><br>01' Nissan Sunny EX 1.6litre:<br>Rented this car. Good pickup &amp; stability over 100kmh. Engine becomes slightly noisy at higher speeds, &amp; is quite a petrol sucker. Did abit of "carpark rally" on my own, &amp; performed not too bad despite its FF layout. "Drifted" quite well. Went rounding with a friend in Orchard, &amp; beat a 360Modena right to its ass in tight cornerings.<br>However, felt its turning radius not as wide as expected. Very pratical for daily use.<br><br>96' Honda Civic SIR 1.6litre:<br>Smooth ride &amp; reliable engine. Fuel consumption not bad. Looks better with bodykits. Stable at relatively high speeds above 100kmh despite its lightweight.<br><br>93' Honda Civic ESI 1.6litre:<br>Alike the SIR, reliable engine &amp; good consumption. Looks nicer in stock.<br><br>93' Honda Civic VTi 1.6litre:<br>Great &amp; responsive VTEC engine. Spacious interior &amp; one of e best Jap sedans of its time. One of e better performance COE sedans around. Responsive handling.<br><br>92' Mitsubishi Colt GLXi 1.6litre:<br>Relatively powerful engine with good soundtrack. Great potential for mods of engine &amp; bodykit. Good-looking 3dr hatchback.Might consider gettin this as my 1st car. Starlet GT &amp; Swift GTi's old rival.<br><br>04-05' Hyundai Getz 3dr 1.6litre:<br>Alike e 1.3 version, noisy engine, petrol sucker too. However, one of e better 3dr hatchbacks in e supermini section with responsive handling. Max speed electronically-limited to around 140kmh, but chasis can take punishment till only around 130.<br><br>03' Subaru Imprezza 1.6litre:<br>One of e most stable rides i've got on a 1.6 sedan. Only AWD performance for its sedan pricetag.  Very strong accl &amp; able to rev. Very responsive ride &amp; stable during tight cornering at high speed 60kmh &amp; above. Money for value. Great potential for modd to STi look-alike. Fuel consumption not too bad.<br><br>02-03' Honda Stream 1.7litre:<br>Great MPV with 1.7 Vtec. Efficient &amp; reliable engine. One of e better MPVs for sub-2litre range. Fuel consumption comparable to other 2.0litre models.<br><br>03' Nissan Praire 2.0litre:<br>Quite a petrol drinker with stiff handling. Stylish sliding side-doors. Roomy interior. One of e more common Nissan MPVs around.<br><br>03' Mazda Premacy 2.0litre:<br>Powerful engine &amp; very comfortable ride. Preferred to other 2.0 MPVs at its pricetag. Not very common on road nowadays, as most hav been exported overseas &amp; replaced by newer models. Fuel consumption abit high, though.<br><br>02-03' Mitsubishi Galant GDI 2.0litre:<br>A powerful sedan with MIVEC engine. Spacious &amp; comfy interior, with well-balanced performance on-road. Great exterior styling. High resale/export value. Fuel consumption not a problem.<br><br>03' Hyundai Tuscani FX 2.0litre:<br>Low ride coupe at relatively cheap price. Slower pickup compared to other 2litre performance coupes &amp; sedans. Petrol sucker, but responsive handling. Ferrari look-alike in Red, so who cares when u're driving an Italian poser at a Korean pricetag? Driven hard, &amp; chasis begin destablise at around 180kmh, which seemingly is also its electronically-limited speed.<br><br>04' Nissan Cefiro 230JDM 2.3litre:<br>Powerful &amp; quiet V6 engine. Innovative keyless entry. Performs as a JDM luxury sedan would, but fuel consumption slightly higher compared to its 2.3 sector. Superior interior built-quality compared to its 2.4 Accord counterpart. High resale/ export value.<br><br>04' Toyota Camry 2.4litre:<br>Powerful &amp; quiet engine. Keyless entry. Ride feels e same as Cefiro, but interior more lusious than e 2.3 luxury sedan. High resale/ export value. BMW 3-series performance at JDM price. Quite worth e bite.<br><br>04-05' Honda Odyssey 2.4litre:<br>The best Jap MPV for its money-for-value. Although a 2.4litre at its pricetag, it has great market resale value/ export value &amp; is a low fuel consumer for its engine displacement. Very quiet engine &amp; comfortable with cruise-control. Very responsive handling. Very high resale/ export value.<br><br>04' Mitsubishi Grandis 2.4litre:<br>One of e longest MPVs i've driven, next to e Odyssey. Powerful and loud 2.4 MIVEC engine. Can be heard from afar-  noisest MPV i've driven, but reliable engine &amp; cosy interior. Petrol drinker, compared to other 2.4 MPVs<br><br>.......Still many others, but no time to type.<br>All are my personal notes &amp; opinions on e diff models &amp; their performances.<br>Next time will share more</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, since we're on e topic of Test-driving,<br>i would like to share wif u guys some general tips on test-driving a car<br>on my experience working as a preowned car dealer.<br><br>Pre-owned/ 2nd hand cars:<br><br>- Check e mileage of e car. A 1-2 yrs old car mileage should be around 5k to 30k. 3-5 yrs should be around 40k to not exceeding 80k. Too much mileage for a new car means an overworked but non-seasoned engine, which may cause future problems like premature wear &amp; tear of engine pistons &amp; parts, etc.<br><br>- Check engine bay interior &amp; boot interior perimeter. A crack/ dent around boot or engine-bay means a possibility of previous accident. Signs of wielding will also means atttempted cover-up of impacted area. So do check thoroughly.<br><br>- Check engine bay for portions of oily/greasy parts. Any sign of grease around engine compartment hints at leakage of either engine oil or transmission oil. Could be potentially dangerous to e engine if not fixed properly.<br><br>- Check for signs of over-abrasion on tyres, &amp; cracks on rims.<br><br>- Insist on an inspection report by either VICOM or STA. Check for e paint-scan. Ensure e index indicates only 1 layer of paint. More than 1 layer on any area could means a cover-up of an accident-impacted area.<br><br>- On road, at speed of around 50kmh, slowly release BOTH hands from e steering, &amp; ensure car is still cruising straight. This is checking of wheels-alignment. If car swerves slightly to either left/right, it means e alignments are off &amp; must be verified.<br><br>- At around 50kmh, jam e pedal-brake to around 20kmh to test e sensitivity of brakes &amp; ABS. Make sure NO car is following behind.<br><br>- During testdrive, listen for abnormal sounds from e engine at different speeds, eg. below 30kmh &amp; above 80kmh. Tyre noise, timing-belt, engine vibration, etc.<br><br>- Make sure all necessary equiptments, eg. spare-tyre, triangle, spanner, tyre-jacks are present beneath e boot.</div>
