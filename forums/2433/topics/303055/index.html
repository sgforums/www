I have purchased over 20 cars from eBay. Some were even from small time sellers with ratings of less then 100! But I have never had any problems at all with regards to missing shipments, cheating of money e.t.c. Also only a single case of damaged shipment, a broken sideview mirror. That was the only damage that had happened and after I stuck it back properly, it is almost impossible to find the fault.<br><br>So yeah, buying from eBay is way better then buying from shops here IMO. Besides, how often do you see a 1/18 McLaren in the shops here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>AA is not value added for almost all its models, except for the few LEs they have released.
