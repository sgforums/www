            <div class='col-md body'>From what I gather......<br><br>Car owners (those not collecting models as a hobby) will usually buy models of the cars that they currently own or has owned before. Given that, it is highly unlikely that you guys or Nikko can benefit from having a stand at car shows. You most likely will only attract eyes of envy instead of genuine buyers. Not many follks will be willing to fork out over $100 for a "souvenir" at car shows. Dealerships like Stuggart and Performance Motor are also selling scaled models to the public. Exhibiting scaled models could become a side show but if you're thinking of getting some financial benefits out of it, its not so rosy. I'm sure Nikkon has thought of this before.</div>

You're asking Nikko to put up the money... Why don't you put up the money for them? Then you can venture to gain something... If you're not willing to put in the money, then don't talk about nothing ventured nothing gained...<br><br>To rent a booth, you just need to have be a legitimate business or an official club... You can go register SGDC club if you want... I'm sure a smart guy like you should know how to do that...<br><br>And again, if you're not willing to put up your own models for display, then don't talk about wanting to display rare models or any other models...<br><br>Yeah lah... I feel like I'm talking to a wall sometimes... Sticks and stones man... You can think I'm Mr Know-it-all, I'd like to think I just know more than you in some areas... We all have our own areas we're good in...<br><br>But of course, no one can beat your own knowledge when it comes to certain areas lah... Like your artistic flair in modding... So cheem the rest of us don't understand it... And you so zhai, can DIY too... other poor souls still have to ask others to help with the mods...<br><br>Don't want to say more lah... wait the main mod get offended sia... Now we wouldn't want that to happen...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
