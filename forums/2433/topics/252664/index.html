            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All, im Martin. New to this SGDC forum. Got to know this forum from PeiChong &amp; YongKiat. Bought some diecast from them. Very happy to know that there is this forum for those interested in diecast!<br>Im 30 this yr &amp; married. Started plastic modelling such as Tamiya, Fujimi, Hasegawa &amp; Revell kits. Bought alot of them but only complete 10-15% of them. The rest are all still in box untouch! Stop building them as i lack of the skill &amp; time to build it and now trying to sell all! Hence switch over to collect diecast!<br>The 1st diecast i had was from my wife as a Vday present as she knows im very interested in Cars be it real 1:1 or diecast! It was a Hotwheel Red Honda Civic Coupe as im driving the Honda Civic SIR during that time follow by the Integra Type R DC2 and now the JDM STI! From then on i started collecting diecast cars since late 2004!<br>The most diecast i got was when im in San Francisco, Los Angele &amp; Las Vegas during my 13days honeymoon! A total of close to 40 diecast consist of 1:18, 1:24 &amp; 1:43! Most models were the 2 Fast 2 Furious cars from Racing Champion. Was broke after the trip! Now collecting some AA, Kyosho &amp; Minichamp. I like JDM cars especially the JGTC &amp; WRC cars and also cars with decals! Will post my collection in another topic!<br>Hope to learn more about diecast from you guys in the forum! Will try to join you guys in meetup(Miss the last showroom visit)! Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all, new to this forum. Currently working as an architect and photographer. I started collecting diecast since 2 years old (according to my mum), Tomicas, Matchbox, Hotwheels, things like that. Then right after graduating from uni, I started collecting Minichamps and AAs (mostly 1/43). That collection grew to about 200+ and I decided to stop. Sold most of them and went into handbuilts(and my 1:1 car) about 2 years ago. Now I concentrate on handbuilts(Ferraris, Lambos, Macs) and occassionally, some diecasts which I really like. Still selling my diecast collection to make space for more handbuilts.</div>

I have over 200 1/18 and a couple of 1/12 in my collection. I also collect planes, motorcycles, tank and bus. I collect almost every brand: Autoart, Kyosho, Minichamps, Exoto, BBR, Maisto, Hotwheels, Franklin Mint, CMC. I don't specialize in any make or model, just buy whatever appeals to me. I saw that one chap here has 10 skylines, I only have 7 (old and new).</div></blockquote>WAH!! 200!! Guess you must have start this hobby very early!! Must have bought some very rare models!!
