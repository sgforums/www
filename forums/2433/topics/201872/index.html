Scrapped? yea.. some models which are too old and the quality is not there.. so i decided to ermm take their parts eg. tyres windscreen etc2 and it can be serve as my spare parts for future projects. How bout the body kit... well as u know, as a modeler, many things can be done.<br><br>So wats my full time?

Yep Tamiya Kits are amazing.<br><br>I have seen some 1/12 Revell kits which I want to try.. Other companies do not offer 1/12 ferrari kits especially at that price (less then 100USD). Hence I asked about the Revell kits. For the price Burago is -ok- lol. I feel that Hotwheels is very bad for its price. The Enzo especially. I tried to compare my BBR Enzo with the HW one. I decided its not a good idea to compare them lol.<br><br>Where do u think I can get spare parts? Its very hard to get them in Singapore. I own a few old Buragos which I want to modify. They don't even show brake calipers in their models!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>My skill level right now is definitely at beginner. lol. So I wanna play around with a few cheap kits before jumping into BBR or Tameo Kits.<br><br>But all this needs a LOT of time.. haha..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You want spareparts? haha simple buddy... u buy the same scale of the model that u desire, if its a burago for instance, like u say theres no brake calipres (as an example) well...<br><br>1) buy other brands which u tink its about the same scale (the cheap ones) but make sure it got the CALIPRES!... then took out the calipres by cut it, dismounted it etc....  and u fix on ur other model that u desire.<br><br>2) Hmm this is where the art and craft are coming. get a hard cardboard, cut it, shape it, color it... anddd there u go....<br><br>Spareparts are hard to get... that y u must havee LOTTTTSSS of models which u don't feel like it and u take their parts. haha... alot can be done... if it isn't the same.. then "put on make-ups" it will look the same... haha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
