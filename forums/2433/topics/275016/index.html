Since the karts have a fixed rear axle, if you brake hard enough, it pretty much works like an E-brake... hard braking will lock the wheels and pretty much throw you into a spin... which is what you'll want to avoid... especially during corners... Same goes for when you suddenly lift off the accelerator, it might cause you to lose control... Basically gradual acceleration is the key..<br><br>=)<br><br></div>
