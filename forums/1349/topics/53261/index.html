            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Turn $6.00 Into $6,000!!! It's Simple And It's Legal !<br><br>I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it A little<br>while back, I was browsing through news groups just like you are right now<br>and came across a article similar to this saying that you could make<br>thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of<br>$6.00!! So I thought yeah right. This must be a scam, but like most of<br>us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway it said that you send one<br>dollar to each of the six names and addresses stated in the article. You<br>then place your own name and address on the bottom of the list at number<br>six and post the article to at least 200 newsgroups. (there are thousands)<br>No catch that was it. So after talking to a few people and thinking it<br>over I decided to give it a try. What have I got to lose except 6 stamps<br>and $6.00 right? Then I invested the measly six dollars. WELL GUESS<br>WHAT!!! Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail!!! I was<br>shocked. I thought it was going to stop but it just kept coming. In my<br>first week I made $25.00. By the end of the second week I had $900.00.<br>In the end of the third week I made $5,000.00!!! It's still growing right<br>now. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over<br>$38,000.00! and it's still coming in rapidly. This is certainly worth<br>$6.00 and 6 stamps. I have spent more than that on the lottery!! Let me<br>tell you how this works and most importantly why it worksÂ…Also make sure<br>that you print a copy of this article NOW so you can get the information<br>off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions<br>exactly, that you will start making more money than you possibly thought<br>just by doing something so easy!! SUGGESTION: READ THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE CAREFULLY<br>(Print it out or down load it) Follow the simple directions and<br>watch the money come in! It's easy. It's legal. And your investment is<br>only $6.00 (plus postage) IMPORTANT: This is not a rip off; it is not<br>indecent; it is not illegal; and it is virtually no risk - it really<br>works!!!!! If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will<br>receive extraordinary dividends. PLEASE NOTE: please follow these<br>directions exactly and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days.<br>This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of<br>the participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to<br>the instructions. You will now become a part of the mail order business.<br>In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's a service.<br>You are in the business of developing a mailing list. Many large<br>corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality list. However, the<br>money made from the mailing list is secondary to the income, which is made<br>from people like you and me asking to be included to that list. Here are<br>the four steps to success: STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper write the<br>following on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now<br>get 6 us 1dollar bills and place ONE inside EACH of the six pieces of paper<br>so the bill will not be seen through the envelope to prevent thievery. Next<br>place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. MAKE SURE THERE<br>ARE ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR ENVELOPES. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes,<br>each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase your name and address<br>and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS<br>ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying<br>for it! Like most of us, I was a little skeptical and a little worried about<br>the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office<br>(1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!!!!! Mail the six<br>envelopes to the following addresses:<br>#1)thomas Evans- 129 Georgia Avenue Ewing, New Jersey 08638<br>#2) Cyntoria Thomas- 3605 Hickorynut St. Jacksonville, Florida 32208<br>#3) R.J. Lloyd P.O. Box 470881, Los Angeles, Ca. 90047<br>#4) Cab Baker 4844 nw. Frontage Rd. Cleveland, Tn. 37312<br>#5) Alexander Enterprises P. O. Box 718 Dillsburg, PA 17019-0718<br>#6) John Francis,5055 Miami,St.Louis,Mo.63139<br>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you<br>see above, move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etcÂ…) and add<br>YOUR name as number 6 on the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to but try<br>to keep this article as original as possible. Now post your amended article to at<br>least 200 news groups. ( I think there are 24,000 groups) All you need is<br>200, but remember, the more you post , the more money you make!**<br>EVERYBODY AROUND THE WORLD CAN DO THIS BUT REMEMBER TO PUT ENOUGH STAMPS<br>ON YOUR ENVELOPES!!!!** This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts,<br>refer to title 18 sec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the postal lottery laws. Keep a<br>copy of these steps for your self and whenever you need money, you can use<br>it again and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful<br>because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by carefully<br>adhering to the directions. Look at it this way, if you are of integrity,<br>the program will continue and the money that so many others have received<br>will come your way. NOTE: Retain every name and address sent to you, either<br>on a computer or a hard copy and keep the notes people sent you.<br>This verifies that you are truly providing a service.<br>(Remember to wrap the $1 bill in the note to prevent mail theft.) So as<br>each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members<br>will be reimbursed for their participation as a list developer with one<br>dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when<br>your name reaches the #1 spot you will be receiving thousands of dollars<br>in CASH!!!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00($1 for each of the six<br>people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and you're<br>in business!---DIRECTIONS---- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS--- STEP 1:<br>You do not need to retype this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply<br>put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the<br>bottom of this document, and select "copy" from the edit menu. This will copy<br>the entire letter into the computer's memory. STEP 2: open a blank notepad<br>file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the edit menu<br>select "paste." This will paste the copy of the letter into notepad so you<br>can add your name to the list. STEP 3: Save your new notepad file as a .txt<br>file. If you want to do your postings in different settings , you'll always<br>have this file to go back to. STEP 4: Use Netscape and Internet Explorer and<br>try searching for various news groups (on-line forums message boards, chat<br>sites, discussions.) Step5: Visit these message boards and post this<br>article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and<br>selecting "paste" from the edit menu. Fill in the subject, this will be<br>the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings<br>in a particular group, click the post message button. You're done with<br>the first one! CongratulationsÂ…THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to<br>different news groups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will<br>take 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU<br>POST IN (MESSAGE BOARDS ETC) THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE<br>TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200. That's it! You will begin receiving money from<br>around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box<br>due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay<br>anonymous, you can invent a name to use as long as the postman will<br>deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE THE ADDRESS IS CORRECT** Let me break it<br>down, say I receive only 5 replies, so then I made $5 with my name at #6<br>on the letter. Now each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1 made the<br>MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 people respond to<br>the original 5 people. That is another $25 for me. Now those 25 people<br>make the MINIMUM 200 post with my name at number 4 and only 5 replies<br>each, I will make $125. Now, those 125 people post the MINIMUM 200<br>postings with my name at #3 and only get 5 replies each, I will make an<br>additional $626! Ok, now here's the fun part each of those 625 people<br>post a MINIMUM 200 with my name at #2 ant they only get 5 replies that<br>just made me $3,125!!! Those 3125 people send a MINIMUM 200 postings and<br>they only get 5 replies each with my name at #1, I will receive $15,625!!!<br>With an original investment of $6!!!! AMAZING!!!! . When your name is no<br>longer on the list, you just take the latest postings in the news groups<br>and send out another $6 to names on the list putting yourself at #6 and<br>start posting again. Thousands of people are joining the internet each<br>day and they are reading articles like these just like you are right now.<br>So this can never get played out just keep it going and you can make tons<br>of money too!!!! Please try it now and make big bucks in a few short<br>weeks!!!!!!<br><br></div>
