            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings everybody,<br><br>I am looking forward to set up a new ID team consisting of only rotary engine cars. ( FD3S Type R, FD3S Spirit R, FC3S, RX-8 ) so I'm actually looking to invite players who drive the above mentioned cars primarily to join the team.<br><br>Team Objectives:<br>1) To provide team members with more exposure to games, especially newbies who will relish chances of playing against opponents who are better and more experienced in the game.<br>2) To provide a network sharing valuable gaming tips amongst members.<br><br>To achieve the above mentioned objectives, I am looking out for 2 particular groups of members.<br>1) The "specialists" - They are the players who will provide the much needed internal competition and of course raising the standard of the team as a whole. They will also help in guiding the less experienced players along.<br>2) The "newbies" - They will get much needed chances to pit and learn against the "specialists" and improve theirgaming skills.<br><br>I, for one am only a newbie standing at Level 2, but I am eager to learn and improve and I hope the setting up of such a team can help like-minded newbies like me improve our game level genuinely.<br><br>I know it's asking a lot for a newbie like me to invite top class players to join this team, but I sincerely hope the more experienced players will not mind this team looking like a low-level team and offer to help make this<br>all possible by messaging me.<br><br>I await your positive replies.</div>

I suppose that is 1 drawback of the Rotaries..</div></blockquote>performance wise, u can't actually call it a 1.3l. Last I remembered the rules set by SMSA states that rotary engined cars have to multiply their engine capacity by a factor of 1.7 i think. The point is that the characteristics of a rotary engine IS that u get high bhp from a seemingly small capacity, so in a sense there is nothing to marvel about. Until they start proucing something like 500bhp from a 1.3l rotary engine without an form of forced induction, getting about 230bhp is nothing miraculous really. Take a look at these NA engines, like the 1.8l from the ITR DC5 putting out 220 bhp, or the BMW's M3 putting out 343bhp with 3.2l. The rotary engine in the RX-8 is equivalent to a normal engine of 2.2l, putting out about 230 is not really very remarkable. The NA 2l engine in the S2000 puts out 240bhp. Anyways, the thing about it is that it is a very highly stressed engine, and hence drinks lots of petrol. FC, unfortunately, can be as low as about 6km/l, and there is a severe lack of torque at low RPMs. having to rev to high RPMs to get torque would equate to using more petrol, hence worsening your FC.</div>
