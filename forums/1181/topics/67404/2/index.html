            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Impreza WRX, what i did if i knock onto a wall at say...the speed at gear 5 is 150km/h at akina downhill. If my speed drops until below 140km/h-145km/h, I will downshift to gear 4 and wait until the speed doesn't drops and I still stay at gear 4 until it increases at least 1km/h and above then I directly upshift to gear 5 once it reaches the shifting points of gear 5.<br><br>Hehehe...I also see alot of people keep downshift then upshift when they knock into the wall. Don't really understand why they are doing it when their speed is not recovering at all despite all that downshift and upshift.<br><br>Oh yah...hehehe...played with a GDB on Akagi uphill and Akina downhill few days ago. I think GDB is much faster than GC8V in pickup and is pretty good in all tracks. Don't know about the weather conditions, but in dry...it is awesome.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The amount which the brake is depressed, how much the wheel is turned, when to step back the accel, is all based on feel and experience on that particular corner. After a while, it comes like second nature. For the pros, they don't even have to think. For the MR cars, braking later than normal is the way to go because of their oversteering properties. I'm not too sure about FF cars as well.</div>

Furthermore it drops engine power too much because if speed too low, it becomes the wheels that drive the engine. For me, I follow computer way of turning. Brake first before corner, turn and accelerate (how much depend on turn). Besides stepping on brakes causes loss in traction (step more, traction loss more). If you're going down a straight road, it doesn't matter. But if you're turning and you accidentally brake too much, you'll swing out into the side.<br><br>No choice lah, I not so skillful to use the brake well. Only know how to step hard. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AT has no problems with the first 4 gears (for 5-gear cars) and 5 gears (for 6 gear cars). The problem comes only when the AT shifts to the highest gear, and that is shifting a bit too early.<br><br>AT is slower than MT because you need to brake from a slightly further distance. Whereas if you use a MT car, you can downshift and brake at the same time, shortening the braking distance.<br>Why not manually shift down the AT and brake since the game allows drivers to hit one gear down? If you do so, the AT has a tendency to go even <strong>one more gear lower</strong> as you corner, resulting in drastic loss of speed. These scenarios can be easily seen and experienced in Irohazaka.</div>
