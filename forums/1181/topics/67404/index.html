If successful, please share it on this forum so that others might benefit from it.<br><br>It is quite easy lor...you play the same type of car in automatic gear and you just take down the shifting points. That way, you can shift your manual gear exactly the same as the way the automatic gear shifts. I have tried this in Ver2 and it works. I have tried it in Ver3 as well but on an RX-8. I think the shifting points are 2&gt;6000rpm, 3&gt;6500rpm, 4&gt;6500rpm, 5&gt;7250rpm, 6&gt;7250rpm.<br><br>Try it for yourselves and share it. And Happy Chinese New Year!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HIRA is right to say that automatic shifting does not use the best shift points. It uses shift points which allows the car to be more efficient is fuel usage. Also the auto transmission shifts in accordance with the speed of your car. Not really ideal for racing as you sometimes need power and therefore need to drag a gear longer. At least this applies to real life, not sure if ID follows this.<br><br>Can try this, for whichever car you're using in ID, go find out the rpm which gives it the max torque and max horsepower. For WRX max torque is at 4000 and max horsepower is at 6000. I believe max torque is for shifting 1st to 2nd gear. Max horsepower is shift points for the rest. Anyone with a different opinion?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes....of course HIRA is definitely correct in terms of real car theory. However, as my subject is regarding ID Cars....I would take it that he would be replying regarding to my posted subject.<br><br>It would be beneficial for everybody if he can share his experience, like how he can win an automatic car in gear shifting. And that would be a useful information.<br><br>I can only share what I think will benefit the readers of this forum. I welcome all criticism if my method is not worth a try and would gladly accept other people opinions. However, if HIRA had mentioned he is referring to real cars rather than ID cars which I have mentioned in my posting, then I wouldn't have spent my time replying his post. If my method is not good enough, I would like somebody to come up with a better and proven method. I could have kept this information for myself and let plenty of players spend tons of credits trying to get the optimum gear shifting points for ID cars. I'm never the fastest driver, but I am a fan of ID and would like to share what I know with the people in this forum.<br><br>I never expect anybody to follow up on my posting, but if there is a few fans out there who doesn't mind sharing information regarding the game for the greater good of the others. It would make my posting meaningful. WInning a race boost your ego, however if you can discover more information about the game, you will find your gameplay much more meaningful and satisfactory than just plain winning. After all, nobody always win. There is much more to the game than just plain winning. The faster driver might not win a race...haven't you heard that before?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>By the way, care to tell the optimum shifting points for bunta's wrx in ver3?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you are copying the automatic shift points, then you are eliminating the purpose of using manual in the first place. You might as well use auto, since you can downshift as well. People use manual because they can have more control over the car AND have the optimum shift points after experimenting or consulting with other players. If you use the auto shift points, then you might as well use auto in the first place since AT will shift exactly at the 'correct' rpms all the time!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...it is unfortunate that you are upset. Like I have I stated in my post subject. I'm sharing what I know. People use MT over AT is because they like to shift gears and MT is probably more cool in ID. It is up to the players to decide if they like MT or AT. I don't think AT shifting points are wrong, because if they are...Sega Rosso will probably create a patch and fix it up. It is wrong to say that the shifting points for Trueno in AT are wrong. Are there no AT Trueno players in ID? I don't think so.<br><br>The shifting points for the 'coldstart' can be obtained using my suggestion. Try it if you don't believe me. And don't ask me why. If you found my suggestion to be correct and you have any queries about the AT and MT stuffs, I suggest you should ask Sega Rosso about it. If you can out-shift a AT car with your MT car....provided both car are same. Then I strongly suggest you to post it here and correct me with your shifting points.<br><br>AT in ID will of course shift correctly at the exact rpms all the time. If not why it is called AT and not WT(Wrong Transmission). I will agree with you if you are telling me about real cars and real race drivers. But this is a game and I have tried it out myself before posting it here. If I am not sure of it, I probably will not have posted it in the first place. If you have doubt, I strongly suggest you to try it out yourself and it will save you the money and trouble on experimenting. Unless you can prove me wrong, I stand correct.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa hold up there. Let's not argue too much.<br><br>As I mentioned before, AT gives optimum shift points for fuel efficiency. Therefore when AT shifts, it is usually pretty gentle. MT can be pretty rough as the shifts are dependent on driver's skill. But since you have control over the shifts, you are able to control the power.<br><br>In the game, I have seen some drivers use AT before and I do notice that when it shifts, it is pretty gentle. Also since you cannot control when it shifts, you do not have the option of dragging the gear. Since you cannot drag the gear, you cannot allow the power to build. MT will definitely allow you to get to the top gear faster than AT which also means you can be faster but that means you need to be able to shift precisely at those points. AT and MT optimum shifts only differ by about 200 - 300 rpm. While the AT can shift precisely at those points, the question is can you? So actually I think ID is trying to copy real life. One example is like when you're nearing a turn. Since you are still accelerating, AT would shift you to the next higher gear. This gives more speed and less power which isn't what we want when we tackle a turn. In MT, you can just drag the gear.<br><br>In short (in the game), AT is good if you really do not know how to shift at all but your footwork (braking and accelerating) is good. MT would be better if you really know how to shift.</div>

That's why people talk about it and use what they know to try and relate to it. I don't think anyone in this forum works for SegaRosso so no one here would know what they did for the game, what sort of rules are implemented. It's just a game but it's fun and some of the players want to try and be better at it. Nothing wrong with it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I post my comments on this topic, I like to say hi to all here, especially HIRA. LOL.<br><br>Anyway, gear shifting of the AT and the MT is different in Initial D, if you look close enough. Sure, some of the shift points are correct, but when it comes to 4th gear or 5th gear shifting, the differences are there. In Ver.2, cars in 4th gear shifting in 5th gear is different in the MT and AT. AT shifts earlier, if you notice. MT shifts in 5th gear at Tuchizaka at 129-132, AT shifts earlier.<br><br>So, a way to get the gear shifting times, is by seeing where the acceleration begins to drop, so that you shift better. This will waste money, but getting a FT AT car to get the right shift times for a FT car is to me even more wasteful. Findings in Ver.3 is that gear shifting will get different as you tune up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets say this....When the auto gear users play, they will normally hit full gas when starting....so maybe we can try half gas when start coz the shifting would be faster...In  Ver.2 it works, dunnoe abt Ver.3....But i have see people doing half gas and start...looks faster....</div>

Though different cars would have different rpm points.<br><br>Just wondering, I see some people, when after knocking into the wall, keep on downshift and upshift quickly. Does it really help to recover the engine power faster?</div>
