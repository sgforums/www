To help them organize an initial-D tournament.<br><br>Here I have a plan of how the GAME will go.<br><br>Rules and Regulations For The Competition<br><br>Â· Each participant must choose up to 4 courses that are compulsory. 4 courses must be of all different course and must consist of 2 downhill courses and 2 uphill courses.<br>Â· For Myogi and Usui left direction will be taken as downhill course while their right direction is taken as uphill course.<br>Â· For Happougahara, the left selection will be taken as downhill while right selection will be taken as uphill course.<br>Â· Only dry weather will be use in this competition. However players are allowed to chose day or night through dice toss before the game starts.<br>Â· All matches will be conducted using BOOST OFF where both participants need to hold on their brakes upon finish selection of track until their cars appear on screen.<br>Â· Race will be using knockout system through few round.<br>Â· However if under circumstances where odd number of participants reach the finals, participant with the best course timing from their previous game will act as a ghost player where he/she will match up with the last winning player for the final champion for that map.<br>Â· Participant’s sitting position will be decided through draw lots method.<br>Â· Participants must report to the organizer 30mins before match start for the lots drawing of that game, other else consider late and will be disqualify without further notice. However disqualification only applies on that particular course.<br>Â· Reporting participants must bring along their NRIC, registration form and their Initial D memory cards for verification purpose.<br>Â· All participants should get themselves ready few minutes before their race. If either side of the player doesn’t show up within 3 calls from the match IC would be consider a lost and the other player will be automatically proceed to the next round. If both participants doesn’t show up on their turn will both be considered disqualify also, but only for that particular map.<br>Â· A carbon copy version of the registration form that includes the players name, NRIC number, contact number, cars name, cars key number, courses they are participating and the organizer approval stamp will be issued to the participant upon registration.<br>Â· If any participant lost the registration form, he/she must report at least 3 day before the match to get a replacement copy from the organizer.<br>Â· Each participant can have up to 2 cars throughout the competition. There is no restriction on how much points does the participant’s car have but it must not be a BUGGED CAR other else participant would be considered cheating and be disqualify from all matches throughout the competition without further negotiation.<br>Â· Participants that are being disqualified from the map or competition will not have any compensation.<br>Â· Registration fees are not refundable.<br><br>time to give u all an answer.!<br>the reagistering forums will be up at all funland branches by this<br>monday(19.05.03) we will stop the registering on 8/6/03.<br>so feel free to go sign up and have fun.<br><br>the competition date is FIXED on the 13,14,15/6/03 (3 days)there will be 12 top prize for this competition of $50 and above.(cash and goodies)there will also be 12 second prize that will be given out.as for the way the com will go please feel free to pm me. or my teammate.<br><br>WE need YOUR help by signing up. as the management may give up this competition due to lack of paticipation. if incase of such happening. the management will refund the $5 registering fee. we need about more than 60 paticipants. well the more the merrier.</div>
