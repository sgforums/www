F355 Challenge is what i call a proper racing video game. u get kids playing ID and then boasting about how good at driving they are, which is what and why i despise. personally the game is a good bit of fun, if u take all that crap from those kids away from the game. and some other players like u need to lighten up too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The fellow with aura already has alot of things in his favour<br><br>1) his car is most of the time, probably more tuned (or FT) than his non-aura oppo<br><br>2) he probably has more battle experience under his belt than the non-aura guy (that's if the aura was earned, not pumped).</div>

I only know a few respectable players who earn their flames. And I respect their abilities too, not only the flame.<br><br>Thrashed a Level 20 Evo4 upside down with a Level 1 Evo6. That Evo4 was full tuned and the Evo6 I was using was only basic tuned.

I love F355! Especially the clutching and shifting! Its so much more realistic compared to IDAS. But too bad its hard for beginners to grasp, hence IDAS being more popular. I'm only learning Suzuka Short now. Haven't progressed to the Full track yet. Hope to have some enlightenment on this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Can't really shift properly, but I fixed the left leg clutching and right leg for braking and accelerating problem already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Thats why I say the aura system in Initial D sucks. Its just SegaRosso's bid to make you spend more money. Good business for them arcades and SegaRosso. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the aura really does something to your car in the battle. If not what is the point for it? Don't think Sega Rosso will just beautify your car with coloured aura when you pia like siao for every battle to earn your aura right?<br><br>Think it does affect your car's pickup lor....also felt my FD behaved differently during battle since ver2...but some pple thought that it is psychological effect...sigh....WTF.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
