            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I don't think there is any difference in gameplay in having an aura. It's just to make it look nice. My friends who are more well versed in japanese culture say that usually it's more for show than anything else that they do these things. Appearance counts in their culture. So usually the good guy must be beaten to a pulp then something happens. Ever wonder why all the heroes in anime are usually boyish looking who must experience a lot of problems first before blowing up with some sort of super power. Look at Samurai X, Vandread, blah blah all the ones who have a super lead character.<br><br>Anyway if I'm not wrong, in ver2, when 1 player with higher level battle a guy with lower level, the higher level can give advantage to lower level. Both hold down brake and accelerator during loading screen. The lower level guy will be 5 m in front of the higher level guy. Of course the Boost off is also activated. Not sure if this is in ver3.</div>

Some guys I tried to challenge refuse me just because they believed that this is true. I was only lvl12 and they were 6 or 7. Anyway I don't really feel that much of a difference in battle or TA. So I guess it's trash. Unless someone can get confirmation from Segarosso.</div>

Especially the clutching and shifting! Its so much more realistic compared to IDAS. But too bad its hard for beginners to grasp, hence IDAS being more popular. I'm only learning Suzuka Short now. Haven't progressed to the Full track yet. Hope to have some enlightenment on this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Can't really shift properly, but I fixed the left leg clutching and right leg for braking and accelerating problem already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>hmm yes the heeling and toeing is so much fun! sad that an essential feature of takumi's driving cannot be replicated in ID, but i think if they did a lot of ppl wun be driving well. i agree about it being hard for begainners to grasp. well for me, i have no problems with using both legs for braking. i am able to left foot brake when appropriate, such as trimming cornering speed, and right foot brake, such as for entry to a corner, when u need to downshift. also, practice heel and toe for entry to corners, its useful. personally, i can do monza and even sukuka using the manual H box, but I always prefer to use the sequential shifter, due to habit. my speciality track is long beach. love racing there. anyways, if u're on for it, why not we meet up someday to have a few rounds and exchange pointers?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha. Nah I'm not frightening.
