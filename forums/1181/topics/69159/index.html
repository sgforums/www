The method you described for 4WD can be used for large turns. The problem with this method is that you can get good control but your speed will drop a lot since you brake so many times and so long.<br>Edit:This method good for wet conditions.<br><br>And the bad thing about 4WD is that they usually have low top speeds so dropping speed too much is not too good. I think 4WD no way to win battle in Myogi. My fully tuned GC8V can only get to 203 in Myogi.<br><br>Parn, you in Singapore? Want to try battling with GC8Vs?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi WRX, I'm in Singapore at the moment...for good I think. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I usually play at Bugis nowadays, but not frequently even though it is the closest ID ver3 from my working place.<br><br>I'm currently using a RX7 Type R tune D....dun really like the tune as I am forced to stick with it when I upgrade from ver2. I'm trying to full tune it and it is still lots of games away from 990k. I think my tuning is at 600k+ and although my car has 1.8million pts...it is still a fair way from 990k, still need a couple lot more games then I can part change away my spoiler, exhaust, bonnet and wheels back to my original ver2 configuration.<br><br>You are correct about my method and is pretty cool to know that you know and is interested in how your car behave in the game and how you plan to improve it.<br><br>I'm definitely interested to find out how to turn as sharply as bunta does...there got to be a method for that and if I figured out, I will post it here.<br><br>And yes...I would like to battle with gc8vs, although I know how good the performance is...but I also know that the cornering of gc8v is not as good as its handling and acceleration. Although I am not good enough to win, but it will be fun playing with a worthy opponent than with punks.<br><br>Anyway I don't see anybody driving a yellow RX7 Type R tune D, so I'm probably the only one using it in Bugis. The name of my car is Sega Rosso in japanese...the default name given to your car if you don't input any name when buying the car. So if you see me...probably only on Friday, come up to me and identify yourself if you don't mind. We can have battle and I hope that you will not be disappointed with my poor skills as I am not good in ID...at least I don't make the time attack in any course in ver2 as fast as you. But since this is ver3 and gc8v are not as good in ver2 already, so I am interested in the performance of gc8v in ver3 and would like to experience it against a battle.<br><br>What is your car name? If I see you in Bugis, I will come up to you and introduce myself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Actually it's not only that GC8V is slower in ver3, all the cars are like that. The acceleration is now slightly slower so you won't be able to reach the turns at speeds like in ver2.<br><br>There are actually more people using GC8V in ver3 than in ver2. But I think the fact that there is still no part change for GC8V may put people off. I think they'll just play with the car for a while before getting a different one. Probably EVOs will be more popular than the WRX.</div>

He's the last black box with the question mark. Can't get past him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> After winning Takumi in this race, then Bunta in Akina is unlocked.<br><br>Nothing to pai seh about since you drive GC8V in this map. I think the RX will rule in this map. Tried my friend's new RX8 on this map and somehow it seems to fly as compared to GC8V. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>One thing you have to know is that for this map and the other new one is that you cannot knock at all. Or at least knock as few times as possible. I know it's not easy but try not to keep too close to his car to try to overtake him (I also guilty of this, too frustrated already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ) since you cannot see the road and you're most likely to knock. Brake a little or slow down to let him go first if you cannot beat him at the start of the race. Against EVO and RX in this map, I don't think you can. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>There are a number of spots on the track that suddenly widen a bit and then narrow again, take note of these. It is these spots that you have the greatest chances of overtaking. Also try overtaking at those big turns since they are also wider. Once you do manage to get in front, don't screw up! Or he'll force his way through by banging into you. Don't worry even if he's only 10 meters behind you, if you do the turns properly, there's no way he can overtake you, just like when you're trying to overtake him.<br><br>There is 1 turn with oil on the road. If you can, use it to get round the turn faster. Don't use it to crash into the side. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any GC8V drivers got advice on how to do the 4 jumps over the grass at Iro down. I still can't get the hang of it. I find the WRX cannot seem to turn fast enough to meet the jumps. I actually find it faster for me to not jump the grass and take the road as per normal. I'm going at about 50+, too slow or too fast?<br><br>Yeah I know, I suck at Iro. Been like this since Ver2. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
