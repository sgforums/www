            <div class='col-md body'>I think what we have here is a little misconception by Leon...<br><br>IMHO, if a newbie were to ask me what car to pick, i would recommend either the FD or the Evo IV, since both cars are easy to pick up and learn compared to the others (plus they run well almost everywhere)<br><br>However, i would not call them beginner cars, since some newbies who i recommended these cars to have gone on to become pretty good IDAS players with them, and they have no intention of switching their cars anytime soon. Plus, both cars are capable of power timings on almost all tracks, so it gives alot of room for learning and such.<br><br>So Leon, maybe u may not want to diss all FD users and such, but it appears u have done so. I also was a FD user in version 2, and i have great respect for anyone who uses this car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lol... my first car was a blue RX-7 Spirit R in version 2. My poly friend say it was a good car to use so i got it. But too bad lah, I that time dunno much about cars, was one hell of a super mega crappy noob. The highest level i got was 11 (very noob right). Nobody to teach me how to play properly, if not can kick all the DC2 users ass.<br><br>Anyway, go a little off topic. When i started version haven't transferred my fd to version 3 yet so i still use it to challenge those idiotic dc2 drivers there. got once they brought me to iro 2 times but different drivers. my fd only like 700K they aledi full tuned liao. i lost to them on startup but almost all the turns, i brake and turned at gear 4 so i was right behind their asses until the jumps where i overtook them and led the rest of the way. That day was really one of my most memorable day in version 2 era, but DC2 days are gone now. Three cheers to version 3!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
