            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry, the misfiring system probably because of his tune A exhaust. If you choose other tune, you can still get hold of the misfiring system but you will need to part change your exhaust to his 'sudo kyoichi' exhaust. Need time...but sure you will be offered the chance to part change it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>boredbugger...r u sure you can't get misfiring system through part change? I am sure that tune A and default tune comes with misfiring system. But if you take a look at the parts that makes tune A different from the rest of the tunes, you can see that tune A is entirely InitialD tuning. And only the sticker and muffler make up of this tune A, which is of course same as the default tune which also uses the InitialD tune and only the muffler is changed. That is why only tune A and the default tune comes with misfiring system as their muffler are both InitialD tunes. The tune B and C doesn't offers any InitialD tuning, so it is correct that they do not have misfiring system. However I am sure that even when you get tune B, you will get a chance to part change your muffler. And when you get offered the muffler with the 'sudo kyoichi' name, you know that it is the same muffler that they offered in tune A. So it is safe to assume that the muffler is the part providing misfiring system to the car.<br><br>Check out this url and you will see what i meant :<br>http://www.initiald.org/cgi-bin/initiald/v2.cgi?pg=car&amp;co=mitsu&amp;car=21<br><br>Don't be surprised, the first time I got surprise was when I saw somebody driving a trueno tune C having a 12k rpm meter.<br>But I do not know which part exactly that person change to get the 12k rpm meter. I have a trueno tune A but I dun use it much, just for collection only. So I never had a part change in my trueno...stopped using it after it reached 120,000 pts.<br>I suspect he part change his tune C trueno engine bonnet and muffler to the same one as takumi's tune A.<br><br>Check out this url for confirmation :<br>http://www.initiald.org/cgi-bin/initiald/v2.cgi?pg=car&amp;co=toyota&amp;car=01<br><br>You can see that the watanabe parts is the wheel, cibie is probably the two lower small lights and the sticker, muffler and engine bonnet is the InitialD tuning. Why the engine bonnet is the one causing the 12k rpm meter? Because for trueno tune A user, you would have notice that the engine bonnet is the upgrade that you get when you reached 120,000 pts and that is when you will have the 12k rpm meter.<br><br>Hope that I'm not wrong. Hope that more user will share their opinions for this topic as it does benefit readers of the forum greatly.<br></div>

Why? Because it is not part of the selected tune.<br><br>Say if what you mentioned is true, isn't it silly for Sega to allow the user to change tuning when the first tune is already the permanent one? What is the purpose of changing tune then? And what is the purpose of part change where you just alter the shape of the part but the part doesn't perform what it should be? Like...what is the purpose of holding on to the 12k rpm when your engine couldn't  rev it that high?<br><br>I'm sure it is not true as when you are changing tune during the car checkup screen, the moment you switch to another tuning, a screen will be prompted to remind you that you will lose all your previous tuning.<br><br>Hope that we can have more opinions regarding this. Thanks.<br><br></div>
