            <div class='col-md body'>There are a few reasons that can explain the difference you feel.<br><br>First of all, it is the car GC8V itself. At start (0 points), this car is already equipped with all the mods up till 120k points. Basically, it's not really a stock car as compared to the other cars at start. Therefore you would have found it easier using GC8V than using the other cars, up until 120k points. Oh and you should know, you can't have part changes for GC8V.<br><br>Second of all, it may be that AWD is just your style since you did play with some other cars and found them not so good. Actually, it's not that the cars are lousy, it's just your preference/style. Also I think AWD is also easier to drive than the others.<br><br>And finally, it's because subconsciously you memorized part of the tracks you have played on and so when you play them again, you're better than when you first played them. Basically you got more experience so your skills have improved. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with WRX. it could be just a simple case of ur experience. Plus, some people's style fits FRs, for others they prefer 4WD.<br><br>From my own experience, i have several ver 3 cars, both FRs and 4WDS. i finally decided on making the BNR34 my main car as it suits my style of slow-in, fast out. i dont like fancy drift shows or whatnot, so alot of the FRs i find difficult to drive. I prefer my car to grip on the road, so the BNR34 suits me just fine.<br><br>Maybe you found the same thing with your GC8V. personally i dont really like it, but since you do, have fun with it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

True a new driver may not have the skill to know the advantages/disadvantages of the drivetrain but it is also this lack of knowledge that will cause a new driver to use AWD driving style for a RWD or FWD car. Once you have reached a good skill level, you'll know how to drive cars with different drivetrains without much problems because you know how each one works. And from there you can select the one that is best.<br><br>coltzalin, I'm not sure how much you have played in the last few months but if it's everday then I guess experience would count as the reason. Otherwise go try different cars again. You should get back the same situation as before. If this is the case, then your current driving method is more suited for AWDs.<br><br>Also remember GC8V got all the parts at the start, so this may be another reason. Try a different AWD from start to see whether you can get the same results as GC8V.</div>

Well unless you do have a lot of spare time and money, try to stick to just 1 car that you really, really like. Otherwise if you keep switching between cars, you'll get more confused why certain things don't apply to certain cars, also cost factor.<br><br>Use 1 car and learn the basics first and from there maybe you can stick to the same car or try a new one. GC8V is pretty easy to use and you seem to find it better to use than RX7. Not sure if RX7 handles like RX8 but they should be similar. I've only been driving GC8V.<br><br>Just curious, do you ever use the brakes when playing ID? Usually new players don't use the brakes and AWD is easier to handle than other cars if you never/seldom use brakes.</div>

You need to figure out for yourself how you should handle each turn at which speed. If you constantly go in real fast and scrape the walls, you'll never find the proper way to handle the turns. Go in slow and then come out fast and not the other way around, fast in slow out. Try to do all your braking before the turn and accelerate out all through the turn. Doesn't matter if you brake too much, you can slowly adjust after you play more.</div>
