            <div class='col-md body'>Aww... not another debate?! Hey guys, seriously speaking this thread is about an official challenge not some debate. So if you wanna debate do it elsewhere. Sorry if I sound offensive, HENG@ and Sekundes. But let's not go off topic here. This topic is already heated up and let's not make it worse. So just cool off, and wait for the news.<br><br>Meanwhile, why not plan a gathering to meet up with these regulars, apart from the one that is coming up soon, rather than argue over trival things. Remember that some foreigners may also visit these forums. And we don't want them to see how heated up this forum is so heated up with minor arguments instead of sharing views, experience and providing help to newbies. So let's not think to much about this anymore and just relax and enjoy the game shall we?</div>
