Nothing compare to the rest of the world. Mine you, when you say something like this doesn't prove that you are very "mature".<br><br>Not all ppl have the chance to learn racing with real cars. Not only it is costly, it takes certain physical expectation out of the driver. Not all people are that rich to buy a car, and go for racing lesson.<br><br>You maybe good in racing, i maybe good in something else. Thats what makes the world round. So beening able to race doesn't mean your very big.<br><br>Also, if your really think that playing ID is juz a game, and we should get serious, then why are your spending time reading this post? Why spending your time posting, arguing with people over a GAME? Whose more childish now. Go spend you time doing something more MATURED...<br><br>Also, i don't wish to start a flame war with this. Whoever read if you have comment or feel like flaming me.. go ahead and pm me.<br><br>Regards,<br>Leonhart aka JoyCul(SgRacer)</div>

Talking about "real" car my father race with an SKYLINE almost risk his own life to win but the word he said "FUN" even he know his car will lose to an skyline but what's the reason to drive a car , you still have to pass the Gas to move the car, bake to stop like everyones life you run walk stop is it the same!! trainsport ur self from one place to another.(Coming back to initial D) Battle Each other to show what you are made off what skill that hid under your head that's all !!!! the word is till "FUN". Cuting Card is like you lose a drag race in real life you have to crash ur car for same reason. You spend so many @#$%ING money on initial D and on ur car then when you lose you cut your Best car how will you feel ypeich don't u have feelings come here to try to own the name "legend" everyone want to be the legend trying to inpove their skill beating many people so that u are known as one of the pro. Ok I end my Talk.<br><br>Correct Me If i said some thing wrong things can be forgive and forget  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a thought of mine, it doesn't really matter if IDAS is a game or a sport. Its for recreation yeah? Even if its competitive, like others sports such as tennis or even F1 racing, you dun see Martina Hingis going around breaking the loser's rackets or Michael Schumacher setting the loser's car on fire, etc.<br><br>If its for recreation, enjoy it to the max. Everyone has the freedom to have fun. However, a challenge is a challenge but I dun think it should end up with wanting the loser to cut cards.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
