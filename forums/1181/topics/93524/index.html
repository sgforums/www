            <div class='col-md body'>Well well... sounds something like a gumtape death match here. Though i'm not very agreeable with the cutting up of cards, but if HIRA has no problem with it then got nothing to say. Sure sounds exciting.. Keep me informed if it's on. Maybe they should have something like that too with the Leon_FC3S but FC3S version. Well.. Well... Boy I'm getting excited.</div>
