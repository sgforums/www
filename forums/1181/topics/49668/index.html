            <div class='col-md body'>for me i consider these points<br>1) never bang the walls (most important)<br>2) at the major turn where u can view a bridge like structure , u will need 2 decelerate moderately , brake if necessary.....<br>3) at another major turn , brakin is not neccessary , but if ur speed is 180km/h and above , release of accel may help<br>4) use kohanson's method of out-in-out technique. (2nd most important)<br>5) at some point , some cars may experiece the no-gain-speed (this is wat i call) circumstance , be flexible to this situation and drop gear if necessary.<br><br>thats wat i do....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>hope it helps 2 beat that irritant..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually its quite simple to beat the kopi car if u noe how... The turns are rather simple... dun have to drop gear for mi... I went past the turn at abt 160... For the first hairpin... mild braking b4 the turn will do the trick... for the 2nd one... u nd more brakes to get u through.. Another key to winning him is that the most u can hit the walls is one or 2 minor ones... If u hit more then tat then u wun see his rear at the end... Try to concentrate one ur driving n dun be bothered by the car chasing u oz it will only add pressure to urself... Hope all this is useful... good luck... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

For both it works the same way... The key thing to negotiate the turns well for mi is not the pickup but rather not losing too much speed at the turns... tats y i only use some brakes n not releasing the pedal... braking to mi dun lose as much speed compared to releasing pedal... not really sure abt the 86... But winning the kopi car has nothing to do with whether the engine upgrade have been done... im sure any car can beat the kopi car even if no upgrades have been done... Just be familiar with the track... i also used to stuck at this stage but just dun be bothered by that car n fly with ur car...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi. as for 86. the best is you don't brake at the turns. do drift earlier<br>down shift the gear, release accelerator when you reaching the bend and quickly turn your steering to the direction of bend to max and press on accelerator immediately after you turn. when your rpm goes up to 6-7kpm upshift to gear 5 and stablise your steering after that. this way you will not lose much of your speed.you can simply stay at 170 km all the way at the bend but you have to get the timing right for the turns. the kopi car was like 200m plus away from me.<br><br>just a piece of advice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few things u can do in any car:<br><br>Since u accel faster than he does..... right from the start drive a tight racing line to get as high a speed b4 entry into 1st hairpin. 1st hairpin should be the slower hairpin........ the 2 hair pins are taken at 170+ and 160+ respectively(in the dry. take about 5km/h out for wet weather running) but i can't remember the order they appear for the cappu guy stage. if im not wrong should be the slower hairpin 1st then the faster one. Dun worry about going thru too slow........ the worst u can do is 140+ thru it n thats ok because if u don't hit the wall then np... accel is on your side...... just beware of the counter-steer on exit. and try to turn in earlier so u nail the apex n do not slide wide. Driving in the wet requires a very precise line as u would want the best speed/grip combi. no sudden steering inputs as this would unsettle the car. if u aren't sure.... my recommendation would be to enter the 1st hairpin at 140+ and the 2nd hairpin at 155+ sacrifice a bit of speed there but its safer and u'd prob beat the cuppa guy by anything from 30m to 150m.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there is no best way to beat the track... No matter DC, Trueno AE86, Evo 4 etc its still the same.... for me i will just downshift and brake then just go.... wont lose much advantage only at most 30 then after a while u will increase back... Its just that try not KISSING any walls then u are safe... Can say bye bye to coffee car liao   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find a pretty good method to control the vehicle for the 2 turns is to play with the accelerator. When approaching the turn at about 200 meters, release your accelerator to about 1/2. The vehicle should still be able to  maintain its speed but the accelerating force is gone, it may even decelerate slightly. Use the out-in-out method (pump the brakes a little if too fast) and you should be able to take the turn much easier as your vehicle will sort of slide through. This may vary slightly depending on the vehicle mods and driving wheels.</div>
