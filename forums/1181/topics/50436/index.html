            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, a friend emailed me the following regarding your choice of wheels. I guess he got it from some website. Anyway, thought i share it with you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>======================<br><br>Explanation of wheel option:<br><br>In ID at certain point intervals you're allowed the option to purchase a new set of wheels. Many people have questioned whether there was a difference between the wheels performance wise. Aside from appearance I've personally haven't noticed any difference. I've also posted on a few japanese bbs in the past asking if there was difference in wheels, all of them said there is no difference, personally I have also have tried all the wheels and found no difference, even trying different ones on different tracks... But i do have to say that it could be psychological in the way you perceive the wheels to be different that affects your driving, most people have their "favorite" wheel which they think they drive best with, and when you switch to a brand new set of wheels you never driven before, you become a bit more unsure of its performance etc... when this occurs you could end up holding the brakes longer, not trusting the car to oversteer and because you're driving more conservatively it has a big impact on how the car can turn, just holding brakes a tad too long will cause the car to understeer and not be able to turn in time. Can i ask what is your time on akina downhill? and if you can run it consistently? I always had hard time telling difference between wheels and had my doubts of course but as i became consistent at 3 min akina i realized it was not the wheel but just my driving that mattered.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree..its more of the psycological part...everyone has his own preferred type of wheels. For myy integra, i am using the wheels for tune A. Suits me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

He stated that he doesn't feel a difference in the wheels despite having quite a few part change to his wheels, but he took the initiative to check out with some jap bbs(By the way, even though the japs did made ID ver. 2...it doesn't means that they know something okie? For example, sg did cooked the best chicken rice in the world, but not every sg people know how to make chicken rice.). Seems to me that he is trying to make his statement convincing rather than sharing his experience with us. If he really do strongly feel no difference at all, he should share his experience and explain why it is true rather than asking a couple of donkeys for support. If he is telling the truth, there should be people with same experience to back him up and he shouldn't feel insecure as to restort to asking people for confirmation. That is pretty lame.<br><br>Wheels does make a difference in the car's performance especially in handling a corner, this is probably the strongest part where the difference can be felt.<br>The difference has been proven in the posting "Is gold rim good?"...so go and have a look at it.<br><br>One piece of advice to the author of the quoting, if you cannot feel the difference in part change in the car's performance while playing, then it is YOU who is psychologically affected by what you read/hear and it is seriously affecting your judgement in observing things and also depriving you of your deserved game experience.<br>You are not a fast driver, you are merely a driver of a fast car.<br><br>How do you define a fast driver from a driver of a fast car?<br>A fast driver is a person who has mastered at least an average  course and is able to drive reasonably fast in any car in that course.<br>A driver of a fast car is a person who has mastered at least a car in an average course but is unable to drive fast when using any other car.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I have to say whoever wrote this quote is wasting my time.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to clarify that my posting is not directed towards Dark Conviction or any users of this forum. My posting reply was for the person who wrote the "Explanation of wheel option:" in Dark Conviction's posting. Felt that when I refers to author and author of  quoting can create confusion...so just want to avoid confusion. Anyway, thanks people, all of you have been great. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
