            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there...I dun use the DC2 cos it is the most powerful car in the version 2 right now and it is just too popular.<br>However you can try to turn into the corner early and depress the brakes periodically...for example, if you see your car still sliding out...depress the brake again and again until it isn't. But take note,<br>dun do a full turn of the steering wheel when entering the corner, you might need it to navigate ard the corner when u use the brake....also try not to release the accelerator as it will cause ur speed to plunge down before 4th gear limit.<br>If you can clear it at ard 160-165km/h....you should be able to outrun that cappucino.<br>Another thing...do you know that Usui is the killer track for DC2?<br>Try not to challenge pple in Usui in DC2...cos that car is not good in Usui.<br>Hope it helps...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">To beat the Cappucino, the most important thing is not to slow down during the turns by hitting the walls. During the first turn on the first lap, what you can do is before the turn approaches, release accelerator, depress brake gently, shift down to 4th gear, navigate the turn, accelerate and shift back to 5th gear. You can do it conservatively (ie: brake harder) and come out of the turn at around 155kph or be more adventurous and take the corner at over 165kph. Try it for the 2 major corners and if you do not hit the walls, you will be able to beat the cappucino all the time.<br><br>Good luck and hope this helps.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I beat the cap with my DC2 on my 3rd try... like what the others said, don't hit any walls... and at the first hairpin, you're probably doing about 165km/h... so before you reach the turn, shift to gear 4, then as you enter the turn, go 3, lift the accelerator, turn, step on the accelerator and go back to 4... you should exit at around 150+... good enough to immediately go back up to gear 5...<br><br>Also, I managed to do a bit of drifting on the wide turns of the track... meaning those at the corners... as you drive, when you do gentle turns, just shift the gears up then down again... just once, your gears will go from 5 to 4 then back to 5... and you'll find yourself drifting around the gentle corner... Not bad... managed to get up to 183km/h...</div>

If you can see the camera view of the car from outside, you will see that the car will actually have 1 wheel of the ground while taking the turn. The FC is front wheel drive. You lose partial acceleration if either of your 2 front wheels lift off the ground while going over the uneven surface. Tracks like Myogi and Akina are very flat so you'll have normal acceleration.</div>
