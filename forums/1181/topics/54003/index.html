Why is tat so?? No matter how i try this i still cannot clear a corner at a high speed and bang the wall... I need to master tat technique to be able to compete wif the pros...

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think the battle level or player level has any impact on your car's performance. The way to steer the car for a turn is quite variable depending on the sharpness of the turn, car's driving wheels, size and own preferences. Also not all turns in the game can be tackled with the same method if you want to get the best results. I have found that for some turns, the brake is necessary. For some other turns, releasing the accelerator is better than braking. I guess you need to experiment with the different ways of steering your particular type of car. I know it's going to be expensive but try going through a single track repeatedly at a lower speed. Although you don't go as fast, you'll have better control and from this better control, you'll be able to observe how your car can tackle the turn at a higher speed. Also try different methods, brake, downshift or whatever method is applicable to your car.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Lets talk about real life.<br><br>In real life, the real way to drift a car is to effect a weight transfer on your car by turning sharply enough to transfer weight to the outside. At the same time braking is needed to transfer weight to the front to lighten rear. Once this happens then car starts to oversteer.... then the way to make it drift fast is to set the wheel to the most ideal angle of slip so that the car turns thru.... if u observe closely u often see that in real life the cars when drifting, often has the wheels pointing to the "straight ahead" position, or at small angles of steer........ this is because u want some oversteer but not a lot of oversteer. In racing, a bit of oversteer is good. A lot of oversteer is not. If u have to oppo lock then obviously your car has oversteered too much and u are not being fast by oppo locking, but u are actually recovering..... in the process u lose valuable amounts of speed. If u are at full turning lock(not oppo lock) it means u are understeering. then no matter how much u turn.... is of no consequence.<br><br>In fact cars are designed to turn better and sharper up to a certain steering angle. After that its turn in is actually worse. One reason for this is suspension setup. Another is due to tyres being designed to grip in a certain direction(direction which they rotate) your tyres wil not grip if it is being pushed sideways instead of rotating along a surface... hence if u turn too much your tyres simply do not grip. It is a very basic thing that racing drivers learn, but outside of that, it is not known to most people. The ID pros would prob have learnt not to turn fully thru experience from playing a lot, but they would not know why it is so. I hope by explaining it to u u will be able to exploit this technique better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depending on what car u use, that will largely affect the way / technique you turn.<br><br>Assume you are using the DC2 or RX7, basically,<br><br>a)  Master the out-in-out method. ie: if turning right, before your turn, keep EXTREME left, dive into the turn and when you exit, you should also end out coming from the extreme left. When in the turn, do your best to keep your car as near into the apex of the corner as you can without crashing into it.<br>b)  General rule is the faster your speed is while approaching a corner, the earlier or sooner you must start committing yourself into the turn.<br>c)  If necessary, brake by tapping a bit and not jamming your whole foot down on the brake peddle.<br>d)  Try to achieve a slow (into the corner) and fast (out of the corner) control<br>e)  Dont go into a corner with full steering wheel lock.<br>f)  On akina, most corners are done with a "double" turn of the steering. 1st turn is gentle followed by a more committed turn.<br>g)  Myogi is a great way to practice as you only have 1 huge turn to worry about. You can use that to practice and master your out in out method. If you do it right, with the RX7, you should be able to turn at 198-202 kmh (provided your car is full tune).<br>h)  Dont brake unnecessary. Sometimes letting go of the accl early is good enough.<br><br>Do note that different cars require different techniques but the fundamental principles dont change or differ that much. Unless you are on a bike.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Hope this has helped.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
