            <div class='col-md body'>I think what Bunta did was to modify the car himself. It would take a good mechanic to know what he is doing. Assuming Bunta is a really good mechanic and since he is also one hell of a driver, he would be able to know what to modify to compensate or enhance his driving skills.<br><br>It wouldn't be too expensive if he knows where to get his parts or do repairs and maintenance by himself. Also a previous post mentioned the WRX is 2nd hand.</div>
