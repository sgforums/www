Mostly is they come and ask me for challenge. When i refuse then they start to say things like humji or whatever... so whose at fault? I can't even have the option of rejecting a challenge? If i had wanted a challenger then i would have on the green light isn't it?<br><br>Secondly, i play ID mostly is for fun... i am sure most of your play for fun too... So when i go with a group of frens, its normal that we want to play with one another... i am sure that you and your frens want to play with each other sometimes too... but i assure you that we are not those lamers who pump card or go for 9999m advantage those kind... when me and my frens play, we play seriously.. win or lose is depends on our skill and our performance in that battle...  After that, i don't wish for my fren to be challenge i simply play another game by myself... is that lame?? then they start scolding too... I am sure most of them are highly-skilled. Why don't they go look for someone of their standard? When they play with noobs like us they can pump their car winning percentage and since they know that we can't win back....<br><br>Either way this are just my pt of view... hope you don't get too angry over this post....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know what you peeps mean.<br><br>Such things can't be avoided. Well, in this case you should stick to your own beliefs and conscience if you really are out for the fun with your friends.<br><br>This term 'Bullies' is coined by the ID community. A lot of IDAS-ers play ID and come out with their own set of rules and they live by it. There are a lot going about, such as 'Takumi' rule and not rushing into a finishing line without waiting for your opponent. We don't usually see the latter one in HK. We form such terms and rules by ourselves.<br><br>Maybe its the way some really noob, innocent players play that attract the attention of the regular IDAS-ers, hence all this conflict.<br><br>The best way to avoid is just to not turn on your challenger light, and politely refuse and not rebuke any sarcastic or rude comments made either at you or your friends.<br><br>But well if I were you, I'd take that challenge for the pride of myself, experience and my car. =)<br><br>Just my POV.

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha....<br><br>Well, your a good player and you certainly can match up to anyway at any map. It would be a close match... but then, for noobs like us, its really a mere 1 sided match mah... its like we play to lose? LoL whats the fun in that.. somemore i am sure none of your wish to have a car with a very low percentage. Well, most of your would like to win mah.. if not might as well don play if keep losing....<br><br>Thats where the AI come in mah.. we train our skills with the AI mah...<br><br>As for the polite rejects, sometimes i agree that i nv hear what they say or those "bullies" who sit down and speak on top of their voice "wan qie bo", i would simply ignore them either act i nv hear or really becuz i nv hear.. Haha... being polite doesn't mean that you don't get those vulgar words from them... LoL.... either way, i can't really be bothered anymore.... don't wanna make my ID playing time very angry or sian... since i go there enjoy then muz really enjoy... LoL<br><br>Also, yesterday and today i juz played with 2 person whom i knew i would lost even before i play.... LoL... well, the 2nd person not so much ba... cuz i only know he not bad.. so play play lor.. hehe.. quite fun playing with your 2...<br><br>Well, same here.. juz my POV^^... hope it offense no1 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
