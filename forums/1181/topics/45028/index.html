Shifting down is neccesary when your current gear doesn't have enough horse power to increase the speed..<br><br>Braking is neccesary as it is one of the fastest way in slowing down. You can slow down by down shifting and releasing the accelerator which is the known as engine brake.. or you can pull the hand brake lightly to slow down your vehicle..<br><br>You should brake at the time before you enter a turn. You should know whats the limit you can go for that turn. For example, if that turn is a 180degree hairpin turn, you definitely need to apply the brake and down shift before turning. but if it's just a slight bend, you can release the accelerator for better grip as your car's weight will be shifted to the front tires..<br><br>If you were to take a turn on the outside of a curve, you will definitely loose a second or less. By using the out-in-out technique, you are trying to take the straightest path as straight as possible..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the carbon fibre bonnets are usually much lighter than the OEM factory made versions. As such, light weight will usually increase your power to weight ratio of your vehicle. Thus giving your car more "power" in that sense.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
