            <div class='col-md body'>Sportsmanship? Channon, lemme tell u something, there isnt any much of it left in IDAS these days.<br><br>I also play R34, also kena GDB, Altezza until i want to pengz already. Usually if the GDB or Altezza driver chie me a map that R34 can run, like Akagi or Tuban i will shake his hand. If i kena some dumbass, 100% R34-cannot-win map like Usui, Iro or Akina, i dont bother to shake his hand, and soon after that usually i pull out a 5-gear car to screw the fellow on a equally dumbass map. So what he say u no sportsmanship? I give no quarter to GDB or Altezza if they screw with me.</div>

Fine with me, since you were so good at Akina uh snow, i decided to qie with you dh, but what you might have forgotten was what you did during the race. there was a turn which consisted of a left and a small right, don't mind explain what you did when i was on the outer lane letting you pass me?<br><br>You delibrately cutted in and grinded my GDB against the side... Isn't that lame too coming from your point of view? I retaliated by playing Shomaru again, anything wrong with that? I personally do not see any wrong with it...
