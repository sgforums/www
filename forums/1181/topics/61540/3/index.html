For a 4WD, the grand hairpin can be taken at 2 speeds. You can go at 199 for the hairpin which is downhill and 201 for the hairpin which is uphill, or at least this was the fastest I ever got.</div>

WRX.. how did you manage to do that? the fastest i did for uphill was like 197-198.... </div></blockquote>Yeah this is quite tough to get. Not always successful myself either. First you need to enter the hairpin from the outer lane. You need to tap the brake very gently and the small point in time that you tap the brake is also the time you have to steer the wheel. Do not fully lock it, just a little bit before full lock. And this is the tricky part, you need to counter steer slowly when you are about halfway in the hairpin. Also after steering, lightly step on the accelerator and maintain it while in the turn. Once you're nearly out, floor it.<br><br>This works for a 4WD though. I saw one guy using an RX and what he did was a double tap on the brake and then steer. He got 200-202.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah you can only get above 200 for the uphill hairpin. Too much momentum on the downhill hairpin causes you to crash into the mountain if you go higher than 199.</div>

NY's alrite. pretty boring if you ask me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> might be the fact that i've tried most of the fun places <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> yeah Heng@... right now i've switched my EVO IV from tune A to B, but i want the stickers back... so should i tune it back to tune A ? but that would make me wait for the parts again right? do you think it's wise to tune it back to A just for the sake of the stickers and lose a front bumper?</div>
