But I'm just curious. How many times have you played this game to get 15 million points?? I'm also thinking NY stands for New York so maybe it's the points system that is different? On average I think you get about 5k to 8k in Singapore ID arcade machines. I took 6 months and I finished the story mode 9 times (max is 8 after that it just repeats) and I only have 2 million points and I only played the Time Attack's 4 course only once.<br><br>I used to play with a WRX and EVO7 so I'm a bit sorry to say, the 4WD cars in the game for Ver2 can't really compete with the other specialist cars like DC2 for the 5th and 6th track or like RX for the 3rd track. But overall they are kind of above average in all the tracks. As for going faster, there really isn't much the parts can do since there are no carbon parts for EVOs like the DC2. They just sort of complement your driving style. It's more on doing all the turns right in the track. Just practise more. And how did you get 15 million points??</div>

Too bad it's not customizable. The good thing about this WRX is the strong 3rd gear, make use of it in Irohazaka. I know it seems faster to go through the turn at a higher speed. But usually you'll suffer a little knock or bump. For the WRX it is faster for you to brake and slow down to 3rd gear to make the turn without knocking. Not all of the turns require you to slow down though. There are some turns in the 2nd section that allow you to just drift through at 105 km/h. So just drive into the turn, let go of the gas and just slide through. These turns are usually marked with yellow lines and there are 3 turning left and 2 turning right. If you think you're going a little bit too fast, try tapping the brake a few times and turning at the same time instead of stepping on it.<br><br>The other part is where you can jump over the grassy part in section 3. Don't screw this up. Just need practice to remember where to jump. There is another tricky S-shaped double hairpin (after the grass jumping part, section 4) which you need to enter at 3rd gear. Pump the gas and you can get through at 95 km/h.</div>

Turns with white lines need to brake or go at 80+. Only step on either accelerator or brake. Never both at the same time. Stepping on both at the same time seems to cause the WRX to go straight. I think when you step on both you lock all the wheels. If you can do this, it will be great. When doing a turn, alternate tapping the brake and the accelerator fast. This should keep the RPM up while letting you drift through the turn.<br><br>Oh I just remembered. I saw an EVO3 do 2.41 on Irohazaka before. Not sure how he did it, only saw his 4th section.</div>

You'll need to use the ditches by the side of the road to help you. But if you face a Cappucino and the driver knows what he's doing, you can forget it.<br><br>If you face a RX7 in Akagi (3rd track), forget it.<br><br>Unless you play Boost Off in both instances or are very skilled in blocking others then I guess you'll stand a better chance against the above 2 types of race. But you're actually facing the track's best car so you have a disadvantage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh heh, sorry made a mistake in my previous post. You should play Boost On to stand a chance against those cars on home turf, not Boost Off.<br><br>The ditches are not supposed to make you faster in terms of acceleration. They sort of act like those train tracks forcing your car to move along a certain line preventing your car from swinging in/out too much. So if you use those ditches properly, you should be able to take those turns at a much higher speed than normal. This means your average speed on the track should be faster.<br><br>You know the part with the 4 consecutive hairpins in the 3rd section for Akina down? Yeah you can use the ditches on the side you're turning to help you turn at a higher speed. It's not easy though as the ditch is just next to the 'barrier' so you might knock around like a pinball if you're not careful.<br><br>Other ditches are on the first 2 hairpins of the 1st section of Akina down. They're on the opposite side of the turn. These 2 ditches end just before the hairpin. They sort of allow you to turn earlier for the hairpin giving you more distance. It's because when one side of the car is in the ditch and you try to turn, the front wheels will come out first while your rear wheels are still in the ditch. Because of this, your car sort of turns on the spot. Another ditch you can use is at the hairpin just before the 3rd section. It's on the side you're turning to.<br><br>It seems Akagi also has ditches you can use. I'm not sure whether the ditches help or not but if you play Time Attack, you can see on the analysis screen for Akagi that they take note of whether you enter ditches or not. It's the same for Akina.</div>

Basically I don't think you'll even get to see his taillights.<br><br>I don't know of any tricks for Happogahara. But the DC2 is very good for this track as it has a sharp turning radius plus the car is heavy enough to prevent it from spinning out like Cappucino. Due to this they turn at much higher speeds than most other cars. DC2s usually get about 2.21 - 2.24 on this track. The closest I ever got with a WRX is 2.34. 10 seconds difference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also assume that you got beat by the DC2 in Akagi. I think I saw a DC2 get 2.19 before on Akagi. So I think more training is in order. Are you driving an EVO or WRX? I'm not sure if this advice can apply to both but for a WRX, yeah that's correct you can take the last 4 hairpins at 158.<br><br>Before entering the 1st hairpin, need to enter at about 165, tap the brake slightly, do a full turn and when you're nearly out of the hairpin, counter steer and do a full turn in the other direction. Do not try and maintain a neutral direction. You must full turn the wheel from 1 end to the other very fast. No need to brake but you will need to pump the accelerator <strong>gently</strong> unless you can confidently maintain 1/4. You should nicely slide your way through. Same for the next 2.<br><br>Oh I recommend training in the rain then playing in dry. You'll find sliding around very easy after wet conditions. Plus you can go challenge in rain. Next time challenge the DC2 in Akagi uphill wet. Heh Heh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Edit: This is for the WRX. Please try and adjust accordingly for EVO.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, my timing is about 2.59 to 3.00 min roughly. This is perhaps because i do train akina on dc2 before changing to fd after sick of dc2. Hmm... i think its easier for fd to use the ditches for the 4 hairpins turns as compared to dc2. So make full use of them. I am sure u will improve.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShenLong:</div><div class="quote_body">Oic... wah so good... my timing, i think my time is 3.5+++</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,wrx and evo4 can use the same skill to drive in everywhere.as for rx7. sad to said that 4wd cannot win because rx7 pickup is faster than wrx.so if the rx7 timing (2:16) leave them alone.wrx can run (2:16) on akagi,So train hard ,akagi wrx (2:16) evo(2:17);akina (2:52) evo (2:54);hippo  wrx (2:20) ev0(2:21); iroz wrx (2:40) evo (2:40). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

RX-7 pick up faster than WRX???? am i seeing things wrongly?? its impossible.<br><br>A 4WD pick up sure can win a FR car. RX-7 is only twin turbo rotary engine while WRX and EVO had the power of 4 wheel drive. No way RX-7's pick up can win a 4WD.<br>i can bet my life on it.</div>
