            <div class='col-md body'>yeah. i truely agree on that.. on akagi, rx7s have the stage advantage thing... so even if my evo gets a head start on other stages, i think the rx7 will still get the head start on akagi. and thanks again WRX, i'll train hard on it...i manage to do 151 on the last 4 turns now... .. hopefully i'll get faster...those dc2 dudes are kicking my ass here man.... lol.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Gutters helps also.<br><br>To beat a DC2 in Akina, all I have to say is there's only 50% chances of winning. The winning 50% comes from the pickup. For sure you will be in the lead from the starting point. Once in the lead, the next thing to do is to take the inner line of all the corners to block the DC2's path as DC2 turns faster than any other car. (Meaning block as much as you can)<br><br>As for the losing 50%... once the opponent DC2 overtakes you, that's it. Game Over.... unless you opponent is noob to that map and the keeps on banging on the walls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Lonely. i needed that advice. yeah btw.. i thought of getting a new Evo IV... hooking it up right from the start. thought of starting from tune A to get the fast acceleration, then switch to tune B to get the fast acceleration. i intend to change the rims to the 6 spoke enkei rims, Bozz Speed rear spoiler, and Bozz Speed dual muffler. You think that's the right way to tune it? i dunno about you guys.. but i always think that EVO IV can be faster than the RX7. i've been doing some research... so i thought by tuning it this way, my EVO IV would be really fast.. with speed and acceleration. i've looked into the previous post by Dark_Conviction,( my bad if i spell it wrong ) and i think those replaced parts would make up for the disadvantages of the tunes.so you guys out there, give me your opinion on that alright? peace.</div>
