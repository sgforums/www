The best for now is to do what the com does. Slow down before a turn, turn and then accelerate through the turn. After when you're more comfortable, experiment with other ways of tackling the turn.<br><br>As for the stars, there are 3 types. Legend of the Streets, Bunta's Challenge and on the card.<br><br>For Legend of the Streets and Bunta's Challenge, the stars in the game represents difficulty. The more there are the harder the com. Not sure about ver3, but in ver2 you can get up to 7 stars for the difficulty for Legend, just complete the entire story to get 1 star, complete again and get another star and so on. For Bunta's Challenge, there are only 15 stars per track now. Just win him in that track once to get 1 star and so on until 15.<br><br>For the stars printed on the card, I'm not sure how it breaks down totally but you can get stars printed on the card from Legend by completing each different area for the first time. Meaning when you first started out in ver3 and completed the 3 races for Myogi, you'll get 1 star printed. Each other area is also 1 star. This is only for the first time. You also get stars printed when your battle level reaches certain levels. Last component is from Bunta's Challenge, beat him once in all the tracks, you get 1 star printed. I'm not sure of the maximum number of stars you can get from Bunta though. In ver2, it was 10.</div>

But here goes.<br><br>For tackling turns, since all 4 wheels are driving the car, your turning arc would be quite wide. Since speed is the key here, the best is to remember Slow-In, Fast-Out. It just means you enter the turn slowly and (hopefully) come out of the turn fast. Do not do the opposite (Fast-In, Slow-Out) which is what most new players do as they tend to speed into the turn and halfway realise they're too fast and either brake hard or crash. To get this SIFO result, before the turn, brake, as well as maintain a light depression on the gas to keep the rpm up. Turn, downshift if the turn requires it and step on the gas progressively through the turn.<br><br>As far as possible, always try to maintain yourself in higher gears through the turns as dropping gears for AWD drops speed very fast. Remember you got 4 wheels touching the ground as compared to other cars. So when you drop gear you lose speed faster than other cars as all 4 wheels will respond to the change.<br><br>Next thing is alignment before the turn, follow the rule of Out-In-Out. This means you take the outer path before the turn, the inner path during the turn and finally the outer path when exiting the turn. This movement path normally allows for the faster speed. It also depends on the turn as some are sharper and some are wider. Sometimes due to the turn's characteristic, you can do Out-In-In. Quite rare. OIO also requires you to turn in advance. Remember you're going at a very high speed so don't aim at the exit path of the outer lane, neither do you aim at the inner path of the turn. You need to sort of aim at the barrier. Aim more at the barrier if you're faster. The speed should push you through.<br><br>Hopefully this can help you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Closest you can get is a RWD on Myogi (first map with the one and only huge turn) and even then it's not a good one. There is 1 last spot. One of the last tracks has a patch of oil on the road. If you go over the oil patch, you'll get your car into the drifting position whereby your car is almost perpendicular to the road. Unfortunately, the oil also slides your car into the wall so you can only get the drifting position but not the results. Drifting is recommended but you can't really do it. The com can do it (Damn cheat). It's most obvious when you see the com go down Irohazaka. It's the map of the downhill mountain race. Very windy. You'll see that the com's car is actually perpendicular (not 90 degrees but about there) to the road whereas your car would be following the path of the turn.</div>
