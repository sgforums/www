            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there...i think from what i know, usually the A tune is the best for all the 3 cars u mentioned. Different tuning will definitely affect the car's performance in the game. I have heard that the parts change  doesn't affect the car's performance...to which i have found is not true. For example, the wheels...some are more suit for acceleration and some are for cornering, some wheels are excellent for wet conditions(higher grip).<br>The rx-7 type r is not as good as the spirit r initially...but if u can part change the type r to be as good or even better than spirit r.<br>Why spirit r is better is because it doesn't drift as much as type r when entering/exiting a corner.<br>Best is to drive them first and decide for urself b4 getting any car.<br>Hope it helps...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be honest, the tune will only make a serious difference if your time ranking is in the world class standard. I may be wrong but i have an integra with a b tune and another with a c tune. i consistently get 2:38s on Irouhazaka and to date, cant really tell the difference. I rather focus on my driving technique than bother too much with the tune of my car as by driving better, i can shave many seconds off my time but changing a spoiler will probably shave off milliseconds ONLY if i am already at the world class level... which incidentally, i am not. Just choose the tune that you like (ie: make your car look super cool) and focus on your driving skills.<br><br>hope this helps.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...DC2 and GC8V are the overpowering cars in the game.<br>However it doesn't require much skill to learn and handle a DC2 and GC8V properly when the cars itself are godly. (Check out the internet ranking in version 2 if there is doubt.)<br><br>I believe I completed Irouhazaka in all of my first try. I think to drive fast in Irouhazaka, all you need is DC2 + knowledge of all jumping points and plenty of car points...possibly 1 million+++. The only driving technique and skills that the driver need to possess is the ability to do hair-pin turn at 3rd-gear...minimum requirement to clear Irouhazaka.<br><br>I'm not suprised that people can get consistent time result while driving Irouhazaka because there isn't much road variety in that course.<br><br>I still stand by what I mentioned before, part change do affect the performance of your car and racing experience.<br><br>For skeptic readers, try driving in all weather condition and try changing wheels and drive again in all weather condition to experience the difference. Perhaps the wheels change will give the driver the most significance difference in the part change.<br><br>Different wheels suit different weather conditions and driving style.<br>And if you know that your opponent is using a wheel only suitable for non-wet weather condition, try challenging him in that weather...high chances that you will win if your wheel is suitable for wet condition and the differences in skill is close between you and your opponent.<br><br>Ideal condition will be to part change your car where necessary until you feel that it matches with your driving style.<br><br>There is just so much satisfaction to be experienced from this game, pity that many gamers chose to experience only the winning part. Gone are the times where true gamers existed.<br><br>Lastly, DC2 and GC8V drivers do not get my respect no matter how fast they may get on their time ranking or internet ranking, until Sega Rosso fix the bug and balance out the cars in the game.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
