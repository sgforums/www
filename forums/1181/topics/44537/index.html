As mentioned in previous posting before,<br>after a standard car reached its fully tuned pts at 990K, the excess pts will contribute to the car's acceleration, cornering and handling.<br>So say if the standard car has a 1.5million pts when minus the fully tuned pts at 990K, reminder will be roughly 510K pts. This 510K pts will be distributed somehow to improve the car's acceleration, cornering and handling.<br><br>If the same theory is applied to a bugged car, can you imagine how cheating and a bloody bugger the driver will be? How much excess pts are we talking about? 999millions? I have seen bugged car driver playing bunta's challenge. I have never seen a car that charge at bunta's wrx at level 26 so fiercely.<br><br>So my theory is when being challenged with a bugged car, to switch to boost on mode. That way, the challenge can be made slighty fairly and thus the effects of a bugged car will not really make a great difference during the race. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>

You can notice the acceleration difference and their cornering speed and recovery time...sometimes quite impossible to believe. I've seen a bugged FC3S doing about 2mins15sec on akagi uphill with 1 or 2 hits on the cornering, I thought the driver or the car is damn good, but it just turn out to be a bugged car. I think probably a lot of timings in the internet ranking probably full of bugged drivers and their timings. Like you said, those bugged car drivers who doesn't burst time record are probably not driven by good drivers. We need an opinion from a good driver who drive a bug car.<br>I have also seen bugged card user keep playing bunta's challenge until level 28...at least the highest I have seen. It is driven by good driver of course.<br>I'm quite sure your GC8V will be super fast if it becomes bugged or has 990K+ points. I'm sure you will feel the difference.<br>Actually this question is best answered by people with bug car and standard car with 990K+ pts. I do not own a bug car, and if I do own one...it will of course has to be GC8V. I've tried that car with no card...the result is damn fast. At least I can get a 3mins 3secs on akina without trying hard...so tell me which untune car can go that fast?<br>Hehhee...just imagining driving a GC8V bugged car is enough to make me drool in front of the steering wheel liao. Not sure if anybody actually completed all the 4 course bunta's challenge, wonder will it unlock anything by doing so. If not, then it is quite lame to keep playing it. But with a bugged GC8V it might be possible to do so, who knows?<br>I roughly know how to make a bug car but not confirm lor....what I know is you need to make a new car and play until certain points then keep playing bunta challenge. But the condition is you must lose to bunta until your points get minus below the zero pts lor...and you get 999millions.<br>Judging from the hint given in other post...like playing bunta's challenge 10 times. I think probably it is after you win 10 times and get level 10 on any track. If you lose to level 10 bunta, you get subtracted 2000 pts and if you lose to below level 10 bunta, you get 1000 pts subtracted. My guess is if you keep losing, you will eventually get subtracted until your pts is about 1000+ pts. Maybe the machine will allow you to lose to the level 10 bunta and you lose 2000 pts and 1000+ pts - 2000 pts = 999 million.<br>Not confirm though, so don't go and try it and blame me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, Parn. But I'm still not too convinced yet about the bugged cards being more powerful. I do have 2 GC8Vs. 1 bugged and 1 normal. I only use the bugged car with my friends. The difference in driving between both cars can be felt but I think the difference comes from the stars on your card. I think it represents your player level. My normal GC8V has 23 stars while my bugged GC8V has 15 stars. I'm not so good with certain tracks as I still have yet to memorize the turns. But the car which I feel drives better is my normal GC8V. The difference between both cards is just their player level and I think it's this player level that makes the difference.<br><br>On the other hand, to be certain I think I'll have to start playing my bugged GC8V again to make sure. I'll keep you guys posted if I find something. May take a few weeks though.<br><br>One more thing, GC8V is a modified car right from the beginning and the arcade at Bugis still accepts bugged cards. Not sure if they allow you to make one though. Not going to drive any other car now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry about it Impreza WRX, I personally don't have a bug card so my assumptions are based strictly on observation only.<br><br>I'm not sure whether if the player level (stars) makes a difference in the overall performance of the car. I haven't play bunta's challenge yet.<br><br>GC8V is indeed a fully modified car right from the beginning. And as you keep using it, it still get its normal upgrade package like the rest of the other cars up to 990K. Perhaps the bug car that I have seen has already completed its last upgrade.<br><br>Maybe I should get a GC8V bugged car to experience it until it reaches its last upgrade.<br><br>Will keep everybody informed if I found anything new.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I can tell, there is no difference in a bug and normal card. What makes the difference is the level although I'm not sure whether it's the player level (stars on the card) or the challenger level.<br><br>I have tried it out since I have a bug and normal card of the same car. My bug card has max points but has only 15 stars on the card and is challenger levl 7. My normal card has 23 stars and is at challenger level 11. While driving both cars I found that my normal card has better acceleration and cornering. When I tried to do the same thing with the bug card, I find that I cannot achieve the same speed or type of cornering.<br><br>If there is somebody else with a different opinion, feel free to discuss it. I'm still wondering since this is all that I have observed and is not confirmed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Impreza WRX, the reason why you feel that your normal card is better than a bug card is because your normal card got more upgrades than the bug card. Unless your bug card is fully upgraded...probably after playing 80 times of the 4 course time ranking and the points are still beginning with 99+millions, then only the excess points will contribute to strengthen your bug car.<br><br>Okie...we need an opinion from somebody who has 2 bug/normal cars fully mod liao...990k achieved already. But 1 car with more than 990K points and another car with much lesser points than the first car or probably under 990K. It will be much easier to tell if the car with more than 990K points is performing much better or worse than the other car with much lesser points...even when both are already fully mod before.<br><br>Hopefully can be confirm soon....so I can use my points to keep playing the 4 courses.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

Bug card has 999 million points and normal car has 2 million points and I have played both till their 990k final tune up. But as I said before, my normal car performs better. The difference is that the normal car has a higher player and battle level than the bug car. It is from this that I assume that it is the levels that make the difference and not the points.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...so player level(the stars on the card) really makes a difference in the overall performance of the cars?<br>If true then everybody should really go and upgrade their player level to get as much stars as they can on the card....<br><br>Anybody else is able to confirm on this?<br>Thanks.<br><br></div>
