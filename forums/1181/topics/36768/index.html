            <div class='col-md body'>Drifting is a technique used through a turn to change the direction of the car for a proper exit. Practicing this technique is good for a vehicle that has under or over-steering problems in cornering. (This method is used in Rallying but it is also useful to be used Road Racing) There are many types of drift techniques, while i'm going to introduce some of them to you.<br><br><strong>Race Drift  </strong><br>This is performed at race speeds, when entering a high speed corner a driver lifts his foot off the throttle to induce a mild over steer and then balances the drift through steering and throttle motions. (note: the car that is being used for this style of drift should be a neutral balanced car therefore the over steer will induce itself, if the car plows through any turn this technique will not work).<br><br><strong>Braking Drift  </strong><br>This is performed by trail braking into a corner, then loss of grip is obtained and then balance through steering and throttle motions. (note: this is mainly for medium to low speed corners).<br><br><strong>Faint Drift</strong><br>This is performed by rocking the car towards the outside of a turn and then using the rebound of grip to throw the car into the normal cornering direction. (note this is heavy rally racing technique used to change vehicle attitudes during cornering, mainly tight mountain corners).<br><br><strong>Clutch Kick  </strong><br>This is performed by depressing the clutch pedal on approach or during a mild drift to give a sudden jolt through the driveline to upset rear traction.<br><br><strong>Shift Lock  </strong><br>This is performed by letting the revs drop on downshift into a corner and then releasing the clutch to put stress on the driveline to slow the rear tires inducing over steer. (this is like pulling the E-brake through a turn - note this should be performed in the wet to minimize damage to the driveline etc.)<br><br><strong>Emergency Brake Drift  </strong><br>This technique is very basic, pull the E-Brake or (side brake) to induce rear traction loss and balance drift through steering and throttle play. (note: this can also be used to correct errors or fine tune drift angles).<br><br><strong>Dirt Drop Drift  </strong><br>This is performed by dropping the rear tires off the road into the dirt to maintain or gain drift angle without losing power or speed and to set up for the next turn. (note this technique is very useful for low horsepower cars).<br><br><strong>Jump Drift  </strong><br>In this technique the rear tire on the inside of a turn or apex is bounced over a curb to lose traction resulting in over steer.<br><br><strong>Long Slide Drift  </strong><br>This is done by pulling the E-brake through a strait to start a high angel drift and to hold this to set up for the turn ahead. (note: this can only be done at high speed).<br><br><strong>Swaying Drift  </strong><br>This is a slow side-to-side faint like drift where the rear end sways back and forth down a strait.<br><strong>FF Drift  (Front Wheel Drive Drift) </strong><br>The E-brake as well as steering and braking techniques must be used to balance the car through a corner. (note: the E-brake is the main technique used to balance the drift).<br><br><strong>Power Over  </strong><br>This performed when entering a corner and using full throttle to produce heavy oversteer (tail slide) through the turn. (note: needs horsepower to make this happen).<br><br><strong>Heel &amp; Toe by Takumi</strong><br>Heel &amp; Toe and drifting are not the same thing.  People watch Initial D and see Takumi using heel and toe before he performs his magnificent drift around the corner, and they automatically decide that he used heel and toe to accomplish that amazing drift.  Well in a way he did, but not like people think he did.  Heel and toe is used to maintain speed when exiting out of a drift or any kind of real sharp turn.  To drift Takumi just simply shifts the weight of the car, (because he is that highly skilled) but how do you think he wins such mind boggling battles with an out dated Toyota Trueno?  The truth is that he can enter and exit the corner at tremendous speeds.  When entering a corner heel and toe is used to raise the RPM of the car.  When Takumi is drifting he is not applying the gas.  So what do u think would happen if heel and toe was not used?  I'll tell you what would happen, he would exit the corner at a much slower speed then he entered it.  When heel and toe is used, the clutch is pushed in and the toe of the foot is put on the brake while the heel is on the gas raising the RPM.  After you enter the corner you let off the gas, clutch, brake, etc. and use whatever technique you use to drift or just simply go around the corner really fast while using grip driving.  Whatever the case may be, heel and toe can be used for both. While exiting the corner you will come out at a much faster rate because you have raised the RPM which slowly drops while going around the corner when you are not stepping on the gas. When you exit the corner you should feel no jolt, or force on the car because it should be timed so that the RPM drops back down to where it was at when you entered the corner.  This way you do not lose any speed. This technique is one that takes great skill and practice, but it is the best for optimum power.<br><br><img src="http://members.lycos.co.uk/kohanson/images/drift2.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whoa... detailed.<br><br>i'm wondering, don't u have to specify whether the car is fwd or rwd?<br><br>eg, in the first type of drift, the "race drift" u mentioned lifting off the throttle to induce mild over-steer.<br><br>the way i see it, this can only happen in fwd cars. i doubt even in awd cars it will work.<br><br>in a fwd, when u lift the throttle up, it creates a drag in the front wheels, while the back wheels still want to move in the same direction, hence the tail comes out (over-steer)<br><br>but in a rwd, the drag will occor in the rear wheels and "pull" the car back which may even induce under-steer, definitely not what u want when ur drifting? we of course have to differentiate this to actually locking the back wheels with the hand brake ("emergency brake" technique), becos the former still maintains traction on the road while the latter doesn't.<br><br>correct me if i'm wrong! eheh i used to drive my car on a track in australia, but back here in sg no car, and anyway no place to race (legally) so wat the hell! er.. i guess there's kallang carpark? i'm like totally clueless about the racing scene in sg.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>while i'm still nit-picking (sorree about that!!) i might as well add in:<br><br>for the "clutch kick" this DEFINTIELY only applies to rwd, since u want to "upset" rear wheel traction thru the drive train.  if it's a fwd and u use this technique and lose traction in the front, b4 u lose traction at the back then you're not really drifting are u? u're just travelling sideways towards the kerb or wall! or something like that...??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heel Toe Shifting</span></strong></span><br><br>Heel toe shifting is a race shifting technique that allows drivers to downshift quickly while applying the brakes. Proper heal toe shifting keeps the engine, transmission, and wheel speed matched up so there is no jolt through the driveline while downshifting. When drifting, heel toe downshifting allows drivers to downshift in order to increase engine rpm, while braking to transfer weight forward and off the rear wheels.Both Fwd and Rwd can apply this technique but its recommended that Rwd are used because of the poor ebrakes systems.<br><br><img src="http://www.driftsession.com/images/heel_toe_step_1_black__white.jpg"><br>1. Before entering a turn, do your initial braking to transfer your vehicleÂ’s weight forward. Double clutch / heel toe downshift (see next step). Turn your wheels into the corner. Carry enough momentum into the corner to induce oversteer.<br><br><img src="http://www.driftsession.com/images/Heel_Toe_Step_2_black__white.jpg"><br>2. Clutch in, bring your vehicle into neutral, and release clutch. While on the brakes, slide your right heel over to the gas pedal and rev up (blip) the engine to match transmission and engine speed. Without matching revs on downshift, the engine speed will cause a jolt through the driveline, upsetting rear traction uncontrollably.<br><br><img src="http://www.driftsession.com/images/Heel_Toe_Step_3_black__white.jpg"><br>3. After matching revs, clutch in, and downshift your vehicle. Double clutching is optional, but reduces wear on your transmission. Use e-brake if momentum and downshift do not create enough oversteer.<br><br><img src="http://www.driftsession.com/images/Heel_Toe_Step_4_black__white.jpg"><br>4. Release the clutch, get off the brakes, and press the accelerator. Accelerate enough to keep tires spinning to continue oversteer. Add steering input (countersteering) to keep your vehicle from pivoting or spinning out.<br><br></div>
