            <div class='col-md body'>My most memorable race was in ver2 when a black RX7 challenge me in Akagi UH Dry. We played Boost Off and he trashed me obviously. I challenged him at Akagi UH Wet, Boost Off. The guy crashed for the first quarter of the track then stopped his car. He said out loud to his friend, say I play dirty and challenge him to a track condition he don't know how to play and then started driving in the opposite direction. Needless to say I won with max advantage. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  What a poor sport. Then it became a contest of who has the most credits at Akagi UH, DH, Dry and Wet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Edit: Oh, and Akagi UH Dry or Wet is obviously now my favourite track. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
