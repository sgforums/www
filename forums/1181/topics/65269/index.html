If you don't mind, count me in as a member. I current own a RX7 type R and Spirit R. My Spirit R hasn't reached max tuning pt yet, so I can't really compare between these two cars. But I reckon FD type R is better than Spirit R in ver2 because it has more parts to part change than Spirit R. In fact, in type R, tune A has the best initial tuning compared to the rest of the other tunes. If you want to rule Akagi course, regardless of which type of FD you use...change your wheels to the gold rims Mazdaspeed. You will realised that you can actually go pass a corner at a much higher speed compared to the rest of the rims. But the downside is...this rim basically sucks at wet conditions.<br><br>Best is to try it out for yourself to believe it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie...give u a description on the outlook of my type r....it is basically an initial tune A and when i renewed my card, i changed it to tune D. After that, i changed the tires, muffler and exhaust to tune A. Side mirrors and bonnet to tune B. Then i am satisfied with the car performance. I kept testing my car on akina and I found out with my setting...the difference with my dry and wet timings is only 3 secs...and which is not much difference anyway. So i reckon my type r is now good for dry and wet conditions in all courses. But of cos type r is not that fast in ver2, so i don't bother to keep chasing up on the time attack.<br>RIght now over here, ID machines r deserted....there is nobody playing it at all in all of the arcades in the city. I'm living in Melbourne, but I will be back in sg on 18 Jan.<br>The name of my blue spirit r is FD3SX. If you see me, dun mind to say hello. Alternatively, tell me ur name on ur car and if I see you, i will come up and say hello to you.<br>I'm not one of the fastest drivers around in Melbourne or Singapore, but I would like to drive together with any cars except GC8V and DC2...and which is why I wanted to join the team.<br></div>

Then he kept challenging me whenever he sees me in any arcade...pretty disturbing bugger.<br>Oh...i must have forgotten to tell you how shitty he is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>He likes to knock you from the moment u start the race, smashing into u on the corners which u r faster than he is and causing ur speed to drop like snail. And when he is faster than you, he likes to swing his car from left to right and right to left to block you. And even if you managed to squeeze beside him despite all his efforts, he use his car to push you to the wall so that you cannot pass him even if both your cars are side by side. Oh...and he also owns a DC2. Maybe you can or cannot understand my frustration with this hk player. Btw, I can say all the hk players that I met over here are all shitty players like that and they like to boost their ego by winning using really pathetic means.<br>Gc8v is quite powerful as an initial car. And it is not fair when you compared with other car in their initial stage. If gc8v users r really subaru lovers, they should co-own a gc8 before gc8v...that is before the bunta code is revealed. If they only play ID when the gc8v code is revealed, then it is alright.<br>Gc8v is good...good acceleration, good braking, stable handling, strong on both wet and dry. But I notice the cornering ability is not that good, especially on wet conditions...the cornering angle is too wide? But it is still a strong car and in good hands, it is a car you will not want to play against. Gc8v can win DC2...probably on Akagi uphill course.<br>I played in Jurong Point before...the players there r good. They are pretty ethical in playing and the faster player wins the game. No knocking, pushing you to the wall or silly blocking technique.<br>I'll probably go there to have a look when I'm back. For your info, I lost to the players there and I'm not saying all this because I win them alright. Its more fun playing fair and you feel happy even though you lose, afterall it is just a game.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">There is nothing wrong with gc8v...just my own preferences.<br>There is a shitty hk player here who couldn't win me using other cars and kept training on gc8v until his car is much better than me and win me. Then he kept challenging me whenever he sees me in any arcade...pretty disturbing bugger.<br>Oh...i must have forgotten to tell you how shitty he is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>He likes to knock you from the moment u start the race, smashing into u on the corners which u r faster than he is and causing ur speed to drop like snail. And when he is faster than you, he likes to swing his car from left to right and right to left to block you. And even if you managed to squeeze beside him despite all his efforts, he use his car to push you to the wall so that you cannot pass him even if both your cars are side by side. Oh...and he also owns a DC2. Maybe you can or cannot understand my frustration with this hk player. Btw, I can say all the hk players that I met over here are all shitty players like that and they like to boost their ego by winning using really pathetic means.<br>Gc8v is quite powerful as an initial car. And it is not fair when you compared with other car in their initial stage. If gc8v users r really subaru lovers, they should co-own a gc8 before gc8v...that is before the bunta code is revealed. If they only play ID when the gc8v code is revealed, then it is alright.<br>Gc8v is good...good acceleration, good braking, stable handling, strong on both wet and dry. But I notice the cornering ability is not that good. But it is still a strong car and in good hands, it is a car you will not want to play against. Gc8v can win DC2...probably on Akagi uphill course.<br>I played in Jurong Point before...the players there r good. They are pretty ethical in playing and the faster player wins the game. No knocking, pushing you to the wall or silly blocking technique.<br>I'll probably go there to have a look when I'm back. For your info, I lost to the players there and I'm not saying all this because I win them alright. Its more fun playing fair and you feel happy even though you lose, afterall it is just a game.<br></div></blockquote>I hate playing with people who cannot play fair too. Not that I race wif a lot of people b4 but I like to stand behind and watch. Think people in singapore play much fairer game unlike the one I met in KL who pick on new players with his DC.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah...I know there are players over here who forced you to challenge?

Some bloody kid with a DC2, full tuned. Me? A 10000 point GDB. Should have made him go home crying, but then again, for what? It's just a game. But still kinda pissed at his attitude. Still there to say: I also NEWWWWWBBBIIIEEE... Maybe what i should have done is grab my swiss army knife(left in my bag, from chalet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) and cut his card into flakes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The tires that are good on wet are, tune b tyres and a silver Mazdaspeed tyres that is similar to tune a tyres but instead of black, this tyre is silver. Tune A tyre is not so bad on wet but the silver Mazdaspeed one will give you the screeching sound when you go around corners at high speed in a wet course. Similar to Tune A tyre performance in dry course. You get the screeching sound when going around corners in high speed on dry course using Tune A tyre. Tune b tyres is all-round good for wet and dry...but as it doesn't give me the screeching sound, so I don't like it. Better to try out all the tyre to feel it yourself. At least this is what I have learnt while trying out the tyres in part change.<br></div>
