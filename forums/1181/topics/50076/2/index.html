When you press on either of these buttons, it will only take effect after less than 1 sec.

            <div class='col-md body'>hei guys... i've read  comments about id special stage.<br>why do you guys have so much negative comments about it?<br>it's becos u guys expected too much before the game is out..<br>it's confirmed that gamepad game will not replace arcade version.<br>as for me .. personally i've played it myself .. i find that there's no difficulty in doing things that i did for arcade version as i still clock the timing and drifting the same as i did in arcade. i muz say that the game replace some things that the arcade version dun have .. like extra maps and stages. the real map that's in the manga or anime. i got the same feeling that takumi had when i played the stage against levin86. the road is damn hard to drive on. I wish that version 3 will have that stage.. cos i bet even bug cars can't complete that stage in peace...<br><br>and also the rainy stage with the EK9... it's nice also.. withe sileighty also.. the maps are so real....<br><br>i agree the skidding sounds fake and disturbing as it's not the same as arcade.... pls give a chance for the game.. i find that it's deserve it's praises.<br><br>I disagree that GT is better than ID cos it's two different game and the style of playing is different and it's two different racing game. ID is street racing and GT is track racing...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> hope that you guys will continue supporting ID... all the best</div>
