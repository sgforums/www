HAIz... NVM&gt;. we will grow up as useful pple.. dun get pissed off over these things.. these are all marketing skills.. it's getting pple addicted to play ID...let them play.. if you're the one watching and wait.. think that you're lucky enuff to save that kind of money... hehehe like me sometime i really pissed off then walk away.. then i think again.. hei.. thanks to them.. i can use this money to eat my fav food..hahaha<br><br>anyway.. i find pple spending too much money on machines.. it's a bit dumb. playing with a purpose is better like relieving stress.. trying to use a lousy car to win a better car. both set at non-tune.. fair and square...  it's nice watching idiots spending money..<br><br>like me sometime.. i dun mind losing to the opponent.. or just play as i like.. i feel better.. relax... after playing.. so guys.. enjoy the game.. along the way you might learn something..<br><br>what's the pt of being good in games.. how far can it bring you??? a golden rice bowl .. no right.. have a purpose in life.. continue it.. these games are for us to enjoy.. not to throw our lives in it...<br><br>guys.. play hard think smart...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bismarck i'm 18..no more flaming ok?<br><br>well for me i play it as a hobby..really i play it for fun....but if you want to have more fun, you have to be good at the game you're playing right? so far on average, i only spend about 10-15 per week (at most 20)..i don't consider that a lot....instead of going to the cinemas often or going bowling, drinking, or even smoking, i use on it on my hobby...which is ID..i prefer spending my pocket money on playing ID than doing of all the above....so i might as well spend 8 bucks on 8 games of ID than going for a movie...you might say spending two hours in a theatre is more worth it...which is true depending on how you look at it..in a game, there are hardcore players and casual players...if you say what's the point of getting good at a mere game, then you're being too serious man...what's wrong with trying to be good at a game? in life you play hard sometimes you know..</div>
