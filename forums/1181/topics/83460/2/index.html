The teacher lets him off because he is young. The kid will very likely grow up to be a thief and a problem to society, posing much bigger problems than just stealing something small like a pencil. I hope i have made my point. Everything starts young.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  But at the end of the day, it's just a BLOODY GODDAMN GAME. i'm just trying to say kids shouldn't be spoilt.</div></blockquote>is punishing a kid a good form of education? hasn't this been the debate of the society for a moment in the past? punishing a kid, in my opinion, would leave to further rebellion from the kid. instead, educating the kid would be a better (but more tedious) solution to let the kid learn the right way. Education and not punishment comes first.</div>

Ah Shui (tt kid) chose not to.<br><br>so complaining about this is pointless.. but u may argue that u are having fun with ur fren and u dun wan to challenge other pple.. however there's not enough time to close the challenge when the nxt person sits down.. so wat i suggest u do..<br><br>1. go to a place where there's no pple around..<br>2. give tt person a win.. $1 is not gonna kill somebody ya?</div>
