The kid will very likely grow up to be a thief and a problem to society, posing much bigger problems than just stealing something small like a pencil. I hope i have made my point. Everything starts young.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  But at the end of the day, it's just a BLOODY GODDAMN GAME. i'm just trying to say kids shouldn't be spoilt.</div>
