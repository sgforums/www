            <div class='col-md body'>Mr or Mrs Wilderside<br><br>In this world, there is such thing call entertainment. How do u entertain urself? I dun play any arcade games, but i do find ur comment very funny. Is ppl's entertainment. Some spend money to play arcade games, some play Counter Strike, some play snooker, some play bowling, some watch movie, ...all these are examples of entertainments, and they of coz NEED money.<br><br>If a person play bowling, i go and say..ehh..u know playing bowling, instead of throwing the bowling ball, u r throwing money, i think i will get 1000 bowling balls flying to my face! Is ppl's entertainment. Maybe these ppl , value arcade games than singing karaoke or drinking in the pub or even watching movie. Is thier business.<br><br>Tell me then what is ur entertainment? Ur entertainment no need money? U had nvr spend money on entertainment b4? And using ur own money for entertainment is beyond stupidity as u mentioned? Isnt this funny and senseless. The new generations are born with mouse in thier hand. Digital games are very common for entertainment.<br><br>I just find that, this arguement is very stupid and baseless. Unless u r one that no need entertainment or life. Then, i wonder have u been dating. Dating also need some entertainment right, and entertainment need M O N E Y.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

U r linking arcade games with drugs...?? who is mad now? Is arcade illegal? But drug is. Ehh..i told u, i dun play arcade games, but is ppl's entertainment. Smoking, is that entertainment?? I dun categorized that as entertainment....and even my PROF dun see smoking as an entertainment. Do u know the meaning of entertainment. Go and ask ppl why they smoke, i bet in 1 million ppl, no one will say is entertainment. Golfers spend more than thousands, are they mad? Formula 1, millions...and life risking, are they mad? Go and tell Schumacher that he is mad. WCG spend thousands too, and err hm....are they mad?<br><br>I dun understand....is ppl's entertainment dude. Ppl can spend thousands too on home surround system to watch a better movie. Must entertainment be that healthy related, entertainment includes sports dude, but sports do not cover entertainment. Watch alot of movie healthy for ur eye? Go clubbing healthy for ur ear? I conclude, entertainment is not SPORTS. watt is ur entertainment..tell me then. Hmm, at least i know one of ur entertainment. Going to SGforum and talk crap. Ehh..waste money lah. Waste electricity. Go sleep go. Not HEALTHY to look at monitor screen, not good for ur eye lah.<br>I think u have serious problem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
