I dun categorized that as entertainment....and even my PROF dun see smoking as an entertainment. Do u know the meaning of entertainment. Go and ask ppl why they smoke, i bet in 1 million ppl, no one will say is entertainment. Golfers spend more than thousands, are they mad? Formula 1, millions...and life risking, are they mad? Go and tell Schumacher that he is mad. WCG spend thousands too, and err hm....are they mad?<br><br>I dun understand....is ppl's entertainment dude. Ppl can spend thousands too on home surround system to watch a better movie. Must entertainment be that healthy related, entertainment includes sports dude, but sports do not cover entertainment. Watch alot of movie healthy for ur eye? Go clubbing healthy for ur ear? I conclude, entertainment is not SPORTS. watt is ur entertainment..tell me then. Hmm, at least i know one of ur entertainment.

While its known that I've for long found all the feuds and sometimes unfriendly rivalry in this game childish and immature, I do think its totally crazy to compare it to drugs and smoking. Drugs, smoking and even alcohol are forms of self harm, wherelse simply playing a game is not. You are not directly harming yourself at the end of the day. And I have too many friends here who're on drugs or smoke too much, to the point that the distinction between an arcade game and taking drugs r very clear. Yes maybe u're right that it is madness. But its no more madness than spending money to watch a movie, at the end of which all u have to show for is a ticket stub. I think if u want any ounce of credibility in your arguments, u have to start thinking of proper logical arguments to make.</div>
