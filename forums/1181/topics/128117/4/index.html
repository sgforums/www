While its known that I've for long found all the feuds and sometimes unfriendly rivalry in this game childish and immature, I do think its totally crazy to compare it to drugs and smoking. Drugs, smoking and even alcohol are forms of self harm, wherelse simply playing a game is not. You are not directly harming yourself at the end of the day. And I have too many friends here who're on drugs or smoke too much, to the point that the distinction between an arcade game and taking drugs r very clear. Yes maybe u're right that it is madness. But its no more madness than spending money to watch a movie, at the end of which all u have to show for is a ticket stub. I think if u want any ounce of credibility in your arguments, u have to start thinking of proper logical arguments to make.</div></blockquote>Are you upset?<br><br>It is not madness, when exaggerration is used to exemplify the situation and the point, because some people just cannot think hard or far enough to see them.<br><br>You say 8 dollars for a movie, fine. How long is a movie? How long is one game? You play 8 games, one for three minutes, 8 for 24 minutes. A movie you get 2 hours, you get back properly on your investment. You speak as if any kind of money spent is a good investment. Some are good investments, some are ridiculous.<br><br>To me, I feel like I am talking to a group of people who are deluded, who are captivated by the machine, and won't listen to anything, except coming up with excuses or accusations of exaggerations, when you know the point.<br></div>

How long is a movie? How long is one game? You play 8 games, one for three minutes, 8 for 24 minutes. A movie you get 2 hours, you get back properly on your investment. You speak as if any kind of money spent is a good investment. Some are good investments, some are ridiculous.<br><br>To me, I feel like I am talking to a group of people who are deluded, who are captivated by the machine, and won't listen to anything, except coming up with excuses or accusations of exaggerations, when you know the point.<br></div></blockquote>me? upset? oh how funny this is. on one side, the initial D kids have accused me of being the same as u, on the other hand u think im one of them. its absurdly hilarious.<br><br>Let's just say maybe u get back more from a movie, but its still absurd to compare Initial D or any arcade games with drugs, smokes and alcohol. Because u're not comparing many other activities like watching movies etc. And u get a participation you don't get from a movie, so its not exactly fair to compare them in terms of entertainment value for $. Entertainment is not just about length of enjoyment, but the intensity of the experience as well. Why do u think there are people who will pay $600+ to drive a Ferrari around a track for 5 laps? that doesn't even last past 20 minutes. Or a go-kart blast around the Jurong Circuit will cost u $40 for 10 minutes. Lets make one thing clear. I never consider money spent purely for enjoyment an investment to begin with.<br><br>As for delusion, just so u know, I'm one of those who shun Initial D like the plague simply because of the way most people playing it are thinking nowadays. But I know an absurd argument when I see one(and that absurd argument being that Initial D is so bad its indirectly comparable to drugs and smoking), and I will speak out. Beyond that, what the rest of the kids want to think about my views on their attitudes on the game, I don't care. And so I certainly don't care about what U think I am or I do.<br><br>Finally, if u know u're talking to a bunch of deluded people, why still go so hard at it? I did what u did b4, and I decided I simply had better things to spend my time on than reason with the ID-crazy people here on seeing it as just a game. As far as ridiculous investments go, you're really investing a lot of time here on nothing ain't it? Why bother I wonder? So for me, I hope I'm not talking to someone who is deluded, captivated by thinking he is the only one who sees reason, and won't listen to anything, except coming up with excuses or accusations of exaggerations, when I'm sure YOU know the point.<br><br>If I were u, I'd go spend my time on better things than to try n reason here with the ID-fanatics.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
