            <div class='col-md body'>Hey i just started initial D not long ago,i am kind of confuse by those tuning to your cars which you can't see.Anyone can help me with this should i put yes all the time or should i just ignore it so my points will reach the 900k mark faster??<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>ConFuseD B|itz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There has been many discussions on the tune of a car and whether or not it affects it.<br><br>It is also confirmed that Tune A, B, C and D of an integra all can achieve 2:34 on irrohazaka (last stage). So does tuning make any difference? Some may argue yes, some may argue no. Even at the top levels of internet rankings, people have differnt views.<br><br>However, having said all that, the things worth changing are carbon fibre elements (like your black bonnet, black side mirrors etc).<br><br>There are also discussion that wheels make a difference on wet or dry conditions. Not to offend anyone but i personally dont see any difference. It is the tire and thread patterns on the tire and compound of that tire that makes a difference in real life and in the game, since we are only changing the wheel, there shouldnt be much differnce. As the wheel doesnt come into contact with the surface of the road. But a lighter wheel does improve the performance of your car (in real life) but not sure in the game. However, you might want to try to go for VOLK racing wheels option during parts change should it come up.<br><br>So perhaps, just go with the changes that you feel affects your driving positively and makes your car look real cool. and if it doesnt, next time just change back with the parts change option. If you are hitting the top 10 times in the internet rankings, then perhaps tuning may come into effect. If you are within the last 1000 rank, then it probably wont because changing a spoiler or not on your car wont reduce your Akina time from 3:0x to 2:50 seconds.<br><br>Hope this has helped.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello B|itz, you should not put yes all the time whenever there is a part change unless you know the difference between the parts you are changing and how it will affect your control over the car.<br><br>Of course, you won't know it unless somebody tell you the difference or you experiment it by yourself. So it is a risk to take if you decide to experiment.<br><br>The safe option is to stick to your current tune and continue sticking with it until you are unsatisfied with the car performance.<br>How is that so? You just keep playing and playing and there will be a time where you realise that your car is not going any faster than your driving should. By that time, you should already be quite familiar with all the courses in the game. Then it is time for you to part change your car.<br><br>But how do you know which part to change and how they affect your car performance? Observe when other players are playing, their car performance and car parts. Gather information and with minimum experimenting, you should be able to fine tune your car to the condition that you are satisfied.<br><br>Hmm...it also does matter which car you are using. If you want to get a car to keep winning and put a permanent boost on to your ego, you can simply join the Integera-lovers and get a DC2. If you do not want to spend too much money and wanna drive a fully-mod car, input the Bunta code and get a GC8V.<br><br>Sigh...there is no option of changing tires in the game anyway, however I must say that a bigger wheel does help your car to perform a better cornering and a heavier wheel does improve your grip in wet conditions and a lighter wheel really improve your overall acceleration.<br><br>It is normal to think that the different tuning offered in all cars will give similar performance. Of course it does, the tuning itself balances out car performance between different tunes. It is up to the player to part change their own tune to as optimum as they preferred. Different tune has its own advantage and disadvantage, the player is able to part change to eliminate the flaws and part change their car to what they feel as a super tune in their car type.<br><br>I personally never driven a DC2 before and I do not know how it performs. But I do observe that all different tunes of DC2 do not affect the car's performance, probably majority of DC2 drivers are<br>irrohazaka-lovers. Heehee...anyway, that car is too godly in game performance to notice the difference in tuning.<br><br>Good luck and have fun playing ID ver2.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank to all that helped me solve my problem in the game but if they offer you a tune once will they offer u the same thing twice when u missed it? If so should i reach 900k den i start taking all the tunes and modifications of the car btw i am driving a dc2 and my timing for the last map is 2"47"739... i wonder how the heck ppl get the 2"33 mark... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello B|itz, I can assure you not to worry about the part change if you miss it. The reason is because the part change always rotates around in a small set of car parts.<br>So if you miss it, just be patient and the parts will be offered to you again.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
