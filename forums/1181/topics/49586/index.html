As u go to harder tracks like Akagi n onwards... then u have to learn to reduce ur gear, brake n release pedal abit b4 u turn... it is something u can learn slowly... i would recommend u start with Usui time attack becoz its a track not very difficult to run n yet have 2 small hairpins.. So good luck to u...</div>

Like those  turns in Iroha, you can change down to 3 to negotiate the first few turns while some of them, you can use gear 4 to go through. And if you don't want to brake, you can down gear earlier and use engine brake. Your Speed will drop faster than just releasing the pedal. And for some of the U turns, like in Akina, you can just use gear 4, and release the pedal to gain traction..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree that there are many many dc2... in the beginning stage do switch off the challenge mode and train against computer first.  it would better if you were able to complete story mode one round first as you would get a feeling of playing on most the courses. some of the com players are actually quite strong!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the very simple reason y so many ppl using DC2 is clear.... it is a very good car in this game... most powerful in Iro n Happo n almost above average in other tracks... Thats why alot ppl use it... Another reason is becoz there are alot DC2s who are quite good... There are actually some good drivers in other cars like Fds n so on... When they challenge DC2s or vice versa, they usually will lose to DC2 in the last 2 maps... This is very frustrating for those ppl... thus they end up changing to use DC2 coz they are fed up with losing to DC2s not becoz of their skill but becoz their car is not optimum at the last 2 maps... thus there are more n more DC2s nowadays... Nothing much to do also... its their own choice... but im sure there are also alot of other car drivers who can beat DC2s once they master the way their cars work...</div>
