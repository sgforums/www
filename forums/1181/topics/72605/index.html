            <div class='col-md body'>Took this from another forum..<br><br>Now, there have been many people who ask which tune is the best for their car. I can tell you now that there is no definitive BEST tune/parts.<br><br>The differences between the tunes are minor, and the gap between times are a couple hundredths of a second at best, and a few thousandth at worst.<br><br>Each different tune and part causes your car to handle differently, but not so differently as to be able to magically drop your time by seconds.<br><br>Your choice of tune should reflect your driving style. Whether you prefer a car that slides more, or grips more. Whether you can handle a bit more understeer or not. There maybe a tune on each car that's easiest for the beginner to drive, but again, that depends on your own driving style.<br><br>I mean, look at it this way, Sega has the licenses from the aftermarket tuners to recreate their products right? Doing this adds a touch of realism to the game and generally gives it more credibility. But Sega can't make one tune so much better than another because it would alienate the other manufacturers. What if Sega made the Spoon tune on the DC2R 2 seconds faster than the other tunes? Everyone would love Spoon off and say fuck it to Mugen and C-West. Why then, would they continue to give Sega permission to recreate their products?<br><br>That's why we say that tunes are the same, and yet talk about which tune is better at the same time. Because the tunes do handle differently, and we want to discuss how that handling combined with our own personal driving styles affect our times. Overall though, all the tunes will all be pretty much equal to one another.<br><br>Get the tune/parts that you guys think look best. Experiment with the parts to find the parts that fit your driving style.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I read the same posting info in here for ver2 before?<br><br>Well, it is true that the best tune does not exist in those Tune A to D type of default tune. But if you were to choose the correct initial tune of your car when you buy it, you can part change away the parts that is hindering your car's acceleration, cornering and handling abilities to parts that will help in your car's acceleration, cornering and handling abilities. So far nobody has claimed to had the best tuning for any particular car. There are some people who part change their cars according to what they know is good for their car's abilities. Most people just part change for the 'fierce' outlook only. Don't be surprised, not many people want to share this info with others and not many people will believe you anyway even if you tell them out of kind intentions.<br><br>Since I'm an FD driver, so I can only comment on FD Type R okie?<br>Say you have 2 FD Type R, one is Tune D and the other is Tune B.<br>I can tell you from experience that Tune B is by default better than Tune D. Tune B is lighter, has better acceleration, handles much better than Tune D regardless of dry or wet or snow conditions. Tune D has better cornering abilities...better as it can take a corner at a slightly higher speed than Tune B. The reason is just because of Tune D's Mazdaspeed wheels. Part change Tune D's Mazdaspeed wheels away and you will realise that you cannot take the corner at your usual speed like you used to do so with Tune D's Mazdaspeed wheels.<br><br>Say if you have a default Tune D and you play....Akina downhill wet. Compare your timing with another Tune D with the spoiler and wheels changed to Tune A or Tune B. The minimum difference that you will get on the same Akina downhill wet will be at least 1second and not as minor as it is posted. For people who don't believe, I urged them to go and give it a try.<br><br>Sega simply do not make car's parts faster...they merely simulated the performance of the car's parts to be as close as the real one. How they can do it, I do not know. But I guess probably from the real car testers? For example wheels, some wheels are good for high speed cornering, some are good for grip, some are good for wet and some are good for snow. So if you want to do well in wet, you will want to own the wheels that are good in wet to shave some seconds off your timing or even to give you an edge over your opponent.<br><br>I hope more people will share their tuning/part change experience in this forum. Saw alot of players part change their cars selectively, so I don't believe it is just for the outlook only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Parn, i'm certain you improved by more than one second is because your skills simply improved. Not that it has anything to do with the tunes. When you are at a point where you cannot improve your timings or your skills are like MSK, you'll realise it makes less than one second difference. If a person starts the game like say one mth ago with tune a, then he switches to tune b just two weeks later and found his timings improved, it's because his skills simply improved, nothing to do with the tunes. In other words, tunes only matter to those with excellent timings and want to cut down that few more milliseconds. Needless to say, i too havent reach that point yet.</div>

They do something although in the game it probably does squat. It depends on the number of spokes you have for the rims. The more spokes there are, the more even the distribution of grip/power transfer from tires to ground. But the more spokes there are, the heavier the rim and so the rotation cannot be as fast as a rim with less spokes.<br><br>Spokes are the metal rods running from the center of the wheel to the sides.<br><br>Anyway as far as I know, I think in real life there is no relation between the rims' abilities and its colours.

Learnt something new. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> If it's applied to those wheels with the BBS design(the honeycombed ones), logical. Heavy, because of the many spokes, but better power distribution to the wheels, and onwards to the ground. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
