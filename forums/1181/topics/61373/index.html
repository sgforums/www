Bt for the 2nd map, need a little bit of skills. GTR's pickup can win most of the cars(provided shifting is done well). As for to keep him behind you all the way... with a bit of training and pratice shd be able to win. =)<br><br>Anyway if you find your friend really talks big, then dun play with him and ignore him lor. He cannot force you play with him also. And I think it's abit not nice to ask people here to beat him just because you cannot win him. All you need is a little more pratice. Good luck. If I were in your shoes, I will just watch him play from behind and see if can detect any of his weakness or not...</div>
