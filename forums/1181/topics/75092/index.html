            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I've decided to do an evaluation of both cars' battling qualities as they are both considered almost equally effective for battling.<br><br>THIS IS AN EVALUATION ON THE BATTLING ABILITIES OF THE CARS ONLY. THIS IS ALSO ASSUMING BOTH DRIVERS ARE EQUALLY SKILLED.<br><br>MYOGI- R34<br>Reason- R34 has better start-up and runs myogi better even though the RX8 runs well on myogi too.<br><br>USUI- RX8<br>Reason- RX8 has signicant difference in timings over the R34. Since the road is so wide, it is difficult for the R34 player to cover the 2-3 second difference.<br><br>AKAGI- DRAW<br>dry: RX8<br>wet: R34<br><br>On dry- the RX8 is 3 seconds faster than the R34. That 3 seconds should be enough to overcome the R34's blocking. On wet, R34 is only 2 seconds slower than the RX8, which should make it better than the RX8 for wet battles here if the R34 driver dosen't make any mistakes.<br><br>AKINA- RX8 hands down<br>R34 is on 3'06 while RX8 is on 3'02. The few wide roads should enable the RX8 to overtake the R34 with it's higher cornering speed. Places the RX8 can overtake are the S-Curves, the long straight after the RHOD, the short straight before the start of the consecutives, and the last home stretch, more than enough places for the RX8 to overtake. On wet, the R34 might have more of a chance, but still..<br><br>IRO- RX8 hands down<br>RX8 is faster by 5-6 seconds here. The skyline will be able to block all the way at the jumps, where it should be overtaken unless the RX8 screws up. Those who have driven the R34 will know it goes over the jumps at a terribly slow speed.<br><br>AKINA SNOW- R34 hands down<br>No explanation needed here. 4WD against FR. 3 seconds IR difference and the R34 has a better start-up. R34 will win unless there is a difference in driver skills.<br><br>HAPPO- RX8<br>RX8 is faster by 2 seconds. It should be able to overtake the R34 as almost every turn is a possible overtaking point on this map.<br><br>SHOMARU- DRAW<br>I think this depends on the direction chosen. If you choose outbound, and the RX8 is on the left, it will start ahead first. If say the R34 is the one on the left, it will start ahead first. So it depends on which direction is chosen. Unless the RX8 has homecourse boost?<br><br>TSUCHISAKA- RX8<br>Again, depends on lining at the start. But the RX8 has 3-4 seconds advantage over the R34 on this track for both directions. So it has the slight advantage here.<br></div>

Best tip is out-in-out, and slow-in fast-out. Always follow those two rules (or basics).<br><br>For iro, do you use the brakes? You'll need to use the brake for every corner there (yes, every corner) or you'll definately eat wall. For the RX8, only the first corner at the start of CP2 (the one with the funny left than a sharp right) and the jumps should be taken at 3rd gear. The rest can be taken at 4th, but you have to brake early for every turn as well. You need to brake during the turn too. Use the brakes. The style of just releasing accel and turning without using brakes on the dc2 cannot be applied in version 3.</div>
