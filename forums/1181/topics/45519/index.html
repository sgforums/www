            <div class='col-md body'>Nope. Doesnt really bother me what type of card they use. As long as after they win, they dont get all cocky and arrogant on me then its ok.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Otherwise, i will be forced to spear them followed by a jackhammer.<br><br>What ever tune and what ever type of card they use, it still requires a lot of skill to tackle any of the courses quickly. and besides, it is not life and death (or should not be) and its just a game. So i guess that's why no bother.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Dark Conviction. A bug card doesn't mean a super car, it just means the car is upgraded fully since the card has all the points required. What bothers me is the way they race with you. A level20+ DC2 with a bug card once challenged me and proceeded to ram me with his car all through the track whenever he got the chance. I know it's legal in the game but it shows that you need to resort to such tactics rather than your ability to drive through the track. Anyway I still managed to beat him by luck when he missed and rammed into a wall instead. So just because they have a bug card or they have a high level, it still is the way they race with you that matters to make the game fun.</div>

I met one guy with a bug card using a DC and with very high lvl. and he will only using speed boost when he's dunno the race course well. he will request u to disable speed boost when he knows that he's going to win. At first he will bang u when u start to accelerate at the start point .. that's where u will lose lots of speed.. and once you going to overrun him.. he will block you and crush u to the kerb... that's really bad... so avoid such drivers.<br><br>I muz say that there's one driver that like 86 and drove the levin 86 and i enjoy playing with him cos he's very professional in playing. he's that kind of sportsman that i respect playing .. i don;t mind chipping in $$ and play with him.., we only race on akina down hill... we're upgrading ourselves on that course.. we're getting faster and faster... i hope i can meet up with 86 drivers... hehehe.. cos i believe pple driving 86 must have the skill to drive cos 86 is hard to drive as it drift like nobody buz.. i'm trying to not lose my speed at curves.. it's very hard...<br><br>too bad i can't go for the competition at bugis cos i'm going to Brunei for training...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> [/quote]</div>
