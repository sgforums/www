            <div class='col-md body'>I am a player in Yishun, and frankly speaking, team invaders made Yishun Funland a place where it will be an nightmare to visit, if you are a noob, and a frustrating visit, if you are a pro.<br><br>They are skilled, ID-wise, with some of their top players having great times by SG standards. However, in their...shall we say, urge to win, they chose all 6 gear cars, and does not give mercy. Also, they bear deep grudges with players. I am presently one of their targets.<br><br>Vinson, AHBAO. 2 of the top players. I think, a former invaders member should know them.<br><br>Of course, they are considered unorthdox in their playing style, at least to the rest of SG. And in UGC, it happened that invaders had alot of problems with the other teams. This may account for it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heron_kusanagi... i do agree with what you say...<br>i also went to the UGC 2004 too, after careful analysing of their playing styles... i do strongly agree that they are indeed skillful... those players who are good analyst should see the difference too...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Ok if we put aside of their characters and attitudes, we should be able to see the difference in ID skills somehow... eh should i say, they should be rank the top 3 teams in SG... especially they retain their 2nd in position in SG...<br>Those who don't believe can go test their skills... but if they offend you somehow, then can't be help already... :p but if you are able to keep your mind clear and always concentrate and stay behind their car tail to watch how they play when battle, you will confirm be able to learn some skills... as i can see that they unleash with whatever they have always...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  even you stand behind them to watch, you will learn something too if you are a fast learner...<br>I somehow managed to learn a bit of their Irohazaka downhill skills, i try to practise many times and manage to hit a 3.03 using evo 4 finally, but that was many months ago...  noobs like me getting this timing is already happy enough...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Lastly, battle with them can make you learn something... but how much you can absorb must depends on yourself already...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
