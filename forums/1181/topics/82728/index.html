            <div class='col-md body'>Well those are cool ideas.....but generally i think lesser people will play it if it's too realistic (like the Ferrari Challenge)...part of the appeal of IDAS is that it is easy to pick up....so i doubt sega will add those changes.....and erm Initial D is not realistic at all..the physics are so fake! But it's fun nonetheless..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True what Hira said. But then why does the ID intro have the cars drifting when you can't do it in the game? Well of all the suggestions, the most difficult to implement and use would be the clutch system. This would definitely kill off the younger players or those who can't handle the clutch. But yeah clutch would be fun, at least this would give some hope of drifting the car in the game if the car can be drifted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>totally agree. my friends and I used to discussed that what if ID or most racing games have a real clutch system built in. I would say someone would be good enough to be able to do a drift in Gran Turismo 3 or master the drifting entry point and exiting point with heavy traffic in Outrun 2.This might prevent 'younger players' (i wont say kids in case I get flamed haha) to stop thinking they are good in IDAS or God of somekind lol.

When its boring, try to get the car as close to the barriers as possible for kicks.  Learn new stunts like driving with wheels in the longkang or even "floating" above it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.... Frankly speaking, i too would like to have a clutch system installed. But i further thoughts i would still prefer as it is. IDAS is not realistic. There is one game though i think should have a clutch installed. It's a new game called Wangan Midnight-Maximum Tune or something. With all that so called 'realistic' gear shift and such, i think the thing that is missing is the clutch. To me with the clutch, it will be much more fun and put a 'feeling' of enjoyment of driving your 'car'.</div>
