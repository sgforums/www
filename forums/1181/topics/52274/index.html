            <div class='col-md body'>For the strength and weakness<br><br>AE86 and Cappocuino try not to "kiss" any walls, if not the RPM pick up will be very slow. Also the cappocuino is a very drifty car so must control it very well if not you will be spending alot of time trying to counter steer back to position. Other than that, this 2 cars have a better top speed compared to the S2000 and STI.<br><br>S2000 for me is quite an average car with 6 gears. Nothing too fancy about this car. Tends to oversteer abit as well.<br><br>As for the STI, you will find that the handling will be quite different from the others as it's a 4WD car. You will be amazed by the pickup speed of this car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My car of choice is the Impreza WRX Type R. I have tried the AE86 and Capp but I just can't seem to control these 2 cars well. I guess I played too long with the WRX. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Anyway the strength of the WRX is in its pickup from start. Its first 3 gears are very strong and allow you to take the lead all the time against human players unless you knock around at the start. Also it has good acceleration in the higher gears only if you do not take any knocks even minor ones. It is also pretty easy to handle. The bad points is that it cannot be modified through parts change. Its course has been set so there is no room for customization. The WRX also has a hard time trying to reach its top speed and I think the top speed is only 205. I have not been able to go past that.</div>

If you realise, once you kiss the walls or something, the needle will be "stuck" at the 10K range... That explains there's no power so the crux is try not to bang/kiss any walls.</div></blockquote>That's why at times you have to light brake to store power in your drive, so eg when you exit a corner you will be able to rev up with those stored power.</div>

Also I don't think excess points past 990k (full tune) do anything extra to your car either. Haven't tried EVO4 but I did try EVO7. At full tune, I did get 198 - 199 for the 2 turns at Myogi.

Anyway I don't really believe that the more points or higher level means that the car is more super. It helps if your car is fully tuned but still it is basically your skill.

His cornering speed is 199 and his points is about 150k, I can still see the tuning notice for 165k.<br><br>From this uncle, I think it would depend on how well you know the car you are driving.

This is the bad thing for 4WD although 4WD have better acceleration over all the tracks due to 4 driving wheels instead of 2.<br><br>I do not think it is possible for the speed to go up to 220 except for 'Boost On' for challenge matches.

But ended up crashing into the barriers as too fast and cannot control. The fastest I have seen for story or time attack mode is 212 by the AE86.</div>
