Think maybe some 'pro' kicked some dirt into his face. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Well, your definition of 'pro' is quite generic. Those players who have been playing ever since the game was out probably developed some sorta sense of pride in the game (Yeah although its only a game)<br><br>I mean, its also a confidence booster. At least there's something you are good at. I know you can rebuke the post, but think of those people who have an inferiority complex. At least they found something to be confident in?<br><br>On the other hand, there are bullies outside who just dump money into the game and make it hard for new players to catch up or even learn without being burnt.<br><br>And lastly, guys, if you cannot tolerate, please don't post.
