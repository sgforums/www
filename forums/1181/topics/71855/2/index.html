I'm sure every ID player also control their sliding when going through every corner....unless a super newbie. From what I can read and understand in this posting, HIRA's definition of powerslide seems like can be achieved with braking first then when clearing the corner, you downshift the gear. And HIRA's definition of drift seems like downshift first then brake and release accelerator before going into a corner and accelerate while going into a corner. At least that is what it seems to me.<br><br>I think when you downshift, brake and release accelerator....it seems like a drift to me. I quite agree with jb_koala.<br><br>And also we have to face the fact that this is only a game. It is probably the most realistic drift game currently in the market, as drift as you can get. Unless...you have another better game to recommend to us, HIRA.<br><br>Hehehe...really no point even if you tell us all your real-life car physics in this forum....since ID is just an arcade game for people to enjoy. If you want realism....imagine if there is a clutch pedal on the left of the brake pedal. How many people would actually want to play it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I dunno...hehehehe...but for sure people who got real cars and drive everyday would find it super sian if they after driving to the arcade and then still need to drive when need to enjoy a simple arcade game.

The physics in ID RESEMBLE drifting, but it is not PURE drifting, it is POWERSLIDING.<br><br>And if you really think you are the ownage in ID or car physics, i'll give you a practical ID lesson instead of the theoritical one here, all courses (barring shomaru and myogi), one direction for each course, 7 races.

            <div class='col-md body'>N00b, read this..<br><br><a href="http://velocity.isfaster.com/drift/overview/overview.htm" rel="nofollow">http://velocity.isfaster.com/drift/overview/overview.htm</a><br><br>''Basically, drifting is getting your car sideways down a road. It doesn't sound very hard does it? Sounds a hell of a lot like power sliding huh? Well it ISN'T, it's much more COMPLEX. Instead of a drifter causing a drift and then countering to straighten out, he will instead over counter so his car goes into another drift. That is the reason many drifters do it in the mountains, because there are many sharp turns strung together. So in essence a good drifter has the ability to take five or six opposing turns without having traction at any point in time. To put it simply a good definition of drifting is, "Sliding your car through a set of opposed and grouped turns without having rear wheel traction as your car moves laterally through the turns."<br><br>you n00bs waste my time..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe it's a bit difficult to visualize the movement of the vehicle in powersliding and drifting since they look quite the same. In the game before the race starts, sometimes there is a picture of Takumi drifting the car. Look at it closely, the car is almost perpendicular to the road.<br><br>When you normally turn a car left, the left wheels (front and back) travel a shorter distance than compared to the right wheels. Powersliding is a sliding version of this. This is how all of the turns in ID is taken.<br><br>Drifting is when you get the car almost perpendicular to the road and actually smoothly follow the curvature of the turn. In this case, the rear wheels (left and right) will actually travel a greater distance than the front wheels (left and right). This is because the front wheels are on the inside of the turn and the rear wheels are on the outside of the turn. The closest to an actual drift I can think of is to use a RWD car and drive on Myogi. If you do a drift correctly, your view should be actually looking over the mountain side and not really be in line with the road. Also computer drivers on Iro perform minor drifts for the turns.<br><br>So yeah, there is no drifting in ID (except for Myogi and com drivers).</div>

In the game before the race starts, sometimes there is a picture of Takumi drifting the car. Look at it closely, the car is almost perpendicular to the road.<br><br>When you normally turn a car left, the left wheels (front and back) travel a shorter distance than compared to the right wheels. Powersliding is a sliding version of this. This is how all of the turns in ID is taken.<br><br>Drifting is when you get the car almost perpendicular to the road and actually smoothly follow the curvature of the turn. In this case, the rear wheels (left and right) will actually travel a greater distance than the front wheels (left and right). This is because the front wheels are on the inside of the turn and the rear wheels are on the outside of the turn. The closest to an actual drift I can think of is to use a RWD car and drive on Myogi. If you do a drift correctly, your view should be actually looking over the mountain side and not really be in line with the road. Also computer drivers on Iro perform minor drifts for the turns.<br><br>So yeah, there is no drifting in ID (except for Myogi and com drivers).</div></blockquote>i tried it usin 86 levin playin myogi in PS2... when i doin the curve my 86 goes perpendicular to the guardrail... not sure whether is it driftin... driftin to me is pullin the handbrake to clear a curve... like wat most pp did in 'need for speed underground' when they play drift tracks...</div>

Or another way is to look at com driver and you driving down Iro. Com drivers somehow get the front of the car to face the mountainside while the rear of the car just swing round the turn. It's a minor drift but still you can see the difference against your own turning in Iro. Your turning should just be a wide turn.</div>
