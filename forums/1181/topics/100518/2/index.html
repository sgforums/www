On the exit, a turbo car may have turbo lag. so once again, is it as simple to classify it as "turbo cars bad on entry good on exit" ? no. and honestly, the speed at which the air is entering the engine is not as much a factor as the RPMs the engine is in. honestly, i can't see how u can make statements like "there is a performance difference for a car in entry and exit if it is turbo or NA" because there are so many factors to consider.<br><br>honestly, on entry to a corner, a car being good or bad has nothing to do with whether its NA or turbo. it has more to do with brakes, chassis balance etc. on exit, it also depends on chassis balance, as well as the engine's torque characteristics. The statement highlighted in red shows that while u do have some knowledge of how engines work, it's still inaccurate and that there r certain factors u haven't considered yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heng,<br><br>Yes, you're right to say that it doesn't matter which car it is when you take the corner. What matters is the effect you get from both cars. A car with turbo does suffer from turbo lag which is why there was the anti-lag system which is used by one of the EVO in the game. It's called 'Bang Bang' as well, due to the sound it makes. A turbocharger works better if there are more exhaust gases, you get more gas when you're going faster. At lower speeds, a turbocharger can be considered as an extra load on the engine. There is a minimum rotary speed to be achieved before the turbo starts up. So if you slow too much, the turbo can shut off. The Bang Bang basically literally ignites fuel air at the turbo. This explosion causes the turbo to immediately start up. Not really good for the engine and turbo. At the point where the turbo starts up, this helps in air intake. The air intake is more as compared to a NA car with both at the same speed.<br><br>I never said that air intake equates to rpm. I said the speed of the car would affect the air intake for NA. More speed, more air. You can speed to 200km/h and then put to neutral, your rpm would drop but your speed wouldn't, you would start to slow down though.<br><br>A previous post said that the turbo is 'geh liao'. True, but the thing is that it has some benefits along with some negative ones. If the turbo is actually nothing useful at all, why is it installed? If it does absolutely nothing, it will just be an added weight on the car.<br><br>The performance difference is minor but it still exists. I agree that overall performance depends on what you have said but this thread is focusing on NA and turbo. Both have good points as well as bad points, it's where along the race that these points surface.</div>

It's just this whole rubbishy Initial D anime n game giving ppl a misconception of a car being good or bad on entry. hell i watch the anime too but most of it is hogwash. if ppl use that anime to learn about cars, then..... hell they're gonna learn all the wrong things. the most u maybe can say is that there is a slight difference on EXIT for a NA n a turbo car, and even I can't quantify which is better. Turbo lag, yes is undesirable. so maybe the NA car is better on exit? but if u toe n heeled and kept the engine RPMs high, and u get wheelspin on exit, thats undesirable too. so maybe the turbo is better because of the lag eliminates wheelspin, and due to the lower torque band, it then picks up faster when the tyres have higher adhesion? see u can't quantify good or bad just by whether a car is NA or turbo. so EVEN if this thread focuses on NA n turbo, there is no way u can draw a clean line n say which is good which is not so good.<br><br>of course if u were just talking about that rather unrealistic game, then ok loh... but remember that initial D is so full of hogwash.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why bring in the other things? When we do an experiment to compare 2 things, we keep other things constant, car type/build, driver, track, corner and so on. If you insist on factoring all the other things, obviously everything would change. Different cars with different parts with different drivers on different tracks will have different performances. What I'm trying to get at is that if 2 cars with every other condition the same (with no negative ones like wheelspin, or crashing) except for it being NA or turbo, there will be some performance difference at different points.

I've raced b4 and yes I've experienced the way different technical specfications can affect my race, but that was more due to the transmission, which I would feel makes a larger difference to a racing car's advantage on EXIT, than the engine. Also, u do notice that for most racing categories, the rules are fixed, and u either have Turbo or you don't. so it would really matter less to professional racers than u think. My opinion would be that chassis setup and tuning the engine's powerband to suit the circuit is ultimately more important, since it's not up to the racer or his team to decide if he wants a turbo or not.<br></div>

I believe that is currently impossible. Anyway I feel having both chargers add on too much weight for its benefits. Personally I like speeding down on a straightaway rather than going through corners.</div>

However, i know owning one of these is bloody impractical, because maintaining a turbo-ed car is a pain in the ass if not done properly. Here in Singapore, if i want a sports car, i'll go with something NA, which is more practical, like a Civic Type R EK9 or an Integra DC5</div>
