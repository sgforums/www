            <div class='col-md body'>I am wondering whether the level for ur card helps in the accerleration or any other ways for the car? cos i beat a level 16 fellow when i was at level 3. Moreover, i found out that it will not required 5 wins for me to increase each level. Can anyone clarify that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes correct Isr792000, battle level does not affect your car's performance in anyway. It is not necessary to have 5 wins to increase your battle level if you are playing with somebody with a much higher level than you. But how much the level difference is required, i do not know. I know that because when I am level 9, I played with a level 10 person and I win him 4 times and I level up to level 10. But when one of his frds took out his dc2 level 1 and challenge me on irohazaka. I don't challenge again after i lose to the dc2.<br>I don't like to put challenge mode on when I am playing, but I do take up the challenge when my gf accompany me to play and some ah bengs comes along and take the machine beside me and put challenge mode on. That is disturbing when his green challenge words flashing on the right side of my screen while I'm playing.<br>Anyway, regardless what level the opponent may be, they will sucks at uphill and reverse course with wet conditions. Hehehe... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehehe....Isr792000, I not playing ID in sg lah. I playing it in australia, melbourne. Anyway, I am not a very good player at ID. Just keep putting money inside the machine and play whenever I have chance lor...same as everybody else.<br>Hmm...Ryousuke_FC3S, I no hao lian skills to my gf...just dun want my gf to feel not nice when I have to lose to some ah bengs. You know...quite malu leh.<br>Anyway, I got 1 time when I really totally lose to a stranger opponent in front of my gf. Not because that person is better than me in ID lah, that person keep crashing into me and move his car from left to right continuously to keep me from overtaking him.<br>Like what most people say, it is unsportsmanship...but unfortunately it is very true in the arcade. So I have to learn a few uncommon courses to challenge back at that bunta wannabe(Why? Because he like to smoke a cigarette like bunta while playing ID).<br>The most disgusting thing is when he win, he like to smile arrogantly at me and my gf lor. Anyway, the last time I saw him playing, he is using a GC8V and thus I dislike bunta wannabe.<br>By the way, if any player dare to put challenge mode on, he must of course be prepared to face challenge. If he is not prepared to lose, then dun put challenge mode on.<br>Oh yah...Ryousuke_FC3S, you are using keisuke tune rite?<br>Don't part change away your wheels(The black wheel with the silver edge pointing out in the middle of the wheel) if you want to conquer the wet conditions. His (keisuke) wheels is damn good on wet and dry. You will not feel any difference in the handling of the car in wet and dry condition if you stick to his wheels. Of course the acceleration in wet is not as fast as dry, but it should give you a huge advantage over people who doesn't have wheels for wet conditions. Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
