            <div class='col-md body'>I have learnt a lot of little tricks here and there in my 800 battles on version 3 (600+ with my R34 and 200+ with my GDB) and also from videos and watching pros, so i have decided to share some tricks...if it can help anyone, i will be pleased.....if you have any tricks, do share too...but i expect sarcastic remarks, nonetheless..LOL<br><br>NOTE- i have posted all this in other forums, so now i have compiled them all together..i'm not so crazy as to type all this in one short..LOL<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Runner Tactics (for the one in front)</span></strong><br><br>1. False Opening Technique<br>This is my favourite. What you do is you cut in the apex very late, at the last moment. This will lead your opponent into thinking the apex is open for him to pass, but at the last moment you close the door shut. This will usually cause the opponent to smack the wall hard. It's a risky move because you need to cover the apex fully and you usually need to be agressive while implementing this. Effect is that the opponent will lose a lot of speed after smashing into the apex and this will affect his chances of overtaking you later on in the race. This technique is most effective on akina and akina snow.<br><br>2. Feint Motion<br>This is a variation of the false opening move. This will most likely not cause your opponent to smash into the wall, but this move might get the opponent off his stride and cause him to make a mistake. Again, the apex needs to be covered fully and the timing of the feint must be correct, or you'll screw yourself up.<br><br>3. Reverse Trick<br>The no.1 trick on iro. This is to obviously make your opponent go reverse as you stride away. To do this, you sort of make your car oversteer before a turn (your front is 90 degrees to the apex as much as possible). Then you hit the inner wall and get stuck for a split second, causing your opponent to go reverse.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to avoid being overtaken on the oil spill</span><br><br>Many people have fallen victim of this. Believe it or not, there is actually a way to counter this. To avoid being overtaken here is pretty simple. How do they overtake? They go through the oil early through the turn instead of late in the turn, and they only go through the edge of it. They exit on the outside. So how do you avoid being passed? The trick is to lead them in the wrong line before the corner. On outbound, before the corner i stay on the left, then just after i pass the checkpoint, i go on the outside. This will not enable him to go over the edge of the oil, since he does not have the space to get the right line before the corner. If you stay on the outside before the corner, there is every chance he will take the correct line and overtake you. If you stay on the inside just before you pass the checkpoint, it will also play serious mind games with him and get him confused, since players usually stay on the outside before this corner. Since i adopted this track, i have not been overtaken there even after playing some of the best singapore players. So there you go, a 'secret' trick. Try it out if you know the opposing player is a top player who can capitalise on minor mistakes, or if the opponent is a kamikaze player who takes risks.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to avoid being overtaken on the first jump on Irohazaka</span><br><br>Some of you might already know this...but i will explain it here for those who are constantly being overtaken on the jumps....i used to be overtaken on the jumps fairly often...so now if the opponent is right behind me just before i reach the jumps, this is what i do: i go to gear 2 to cover the first jump COMPLETELY, then immediately up to 3 to gain back the speed...previously i always took it at 3 and always got overtaken on that first jump..i have tried this two times already and both times the opponent got reversed....usually the opponent will rush in cause they think you will leave a little leeway on this first jump, so it's likely they will be reversed if you cover it completely.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chaser Tactics (for the one behind)</strong></span><br><br>Main point in battling is to remember the road and the curves. You can use psychology to cause your opponent to make a mistake. Those inexperienced drivers or who are prone to making mistakes easily can be won by swinging in left and right. Give him the impression that u're everywhere and he's bound to slip... However, that is where the track comes in.<br><br>When facing a fast player...<br><br>Places where there are consecutives (akagi dh last 4 hairpins, iro reverse consecs, akina dh's s curves, tsuchi's twisty section, happo's 4 hairpins) are good places to overtake, since you have to turn sharply left for one corner, and then sharp right for the very next one immediately..so it's harder to block for these turns..for example, happo's 4 hairpins...after the first sharp right, i would immediately start going to the left behind the opponent's car..this way, if he turns that little bit later than you or if he understeers, you will pass...and even if you don't you will still put him under pressure...i have seen pros do it and i have seen it done on the jap tourney videos..<br><br>Watch this vid below from thejap tourney and observe how they attempt to overtake and successfully pull it off...it is a boost on battle, but it can be done in boost off mode too. Btw its on akina snow uphill<br><br><a href="http://asx.pod.tv/am-sega/free/inid3_t03jjk3.asx" rel="nofollow">http://asx.pod.tv/am-sega/free/inid3_t03jjk3.asx</a><br><br>Well i'm open to any flames.

            <div class='col-md body'>for tsuchi, if the car in front is a evo, dont pass him, just put your front into his bumper, sooner it'll drift wildly and crash into something, than you make your pass. (dont try this if you got a cap, fd ae86 or an evo, good for gtrs gcb/gdb/rx8 form behind).<br>for iro, a fully tuned bnr34 vs a fully tune evo4, the evo4 does not even need to jump, it just turns normally, and is till faster than a gtr that makes thejumps.  as for reverse tactic, in those tight corners where this tactic works the best, dont follow too close, if the car in front stop in apex, try to hit it at his back, cause it to reverse, of course, it takes experience, and most of the time luck to do it. ( for boost off only, with boost on, feel free to hit).</div>
