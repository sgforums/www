            <div class='col-md body'>I did not follow the anime or manga for ID but I do know that it should not be called 'misfiring' in real life. The term 'misfiring' is used to describe a timing problem in the engine firing sequence of the pistons.<br><br>Basically the problem is instead of the piston firing properly at the correct time to add more power, it is firing at the wrong time and produces power which acts against the other pistons. Main symptom of this problem is power loss, if the problem is not so severe. You'll just feel that you don't seem to be getting the correct power for the rpm. More severe cases would involve the car jerking regularly, in this case, stop the car and call a tow truck.<br><br>For the EVO3 in the game, the reason why there is a 'lighting up' at the exhaust is because of the ECU. The ECU has been set up so that it is delivering a very, very rich content of fuel air mixture into the engine. This would give more power which would translate into better acceleration. This does not help in higher top speed as there is a limit to how much fuel air is burnt in the engine.<br><br>At the start since the car is still stationary, there is not much need for power. Therefore most of this fuel air mixture is not burnt in the engine and is passed out through the exhaust. Since most of the oxygen has already been used up in the engine, this exhaust gas will not flare up while passing through the exhaust pipe. Until it reaches the outside environment (out of the pipe) where there is more oxygen then it just flares up.<br><br>This is not very good for the engine, in terms of temperature and stress. It's just like having the Nitro system. But Nitro is worse since they're pumping a very high percentage of oxygen into the engine. I think it's about 90%. That's why there is a constant bluish flame coming out of the exhaust pipe. The unused oxygen just fires up.<br><br>Edit: As for whether this sytem gives the EVO3 better acceleration in the game, I don't know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, the misfiring system is actually called Anti-Lag System. Misfiring was a BS term created in initial d. In this system, petrol is pumped into the exhaust and ignited, to keep the turbine spinning. That's why there are the sparks coming out of the muffler. This prevents turbo lag and gives a higher exit speed. As Impreza WRX said, this is bad not only for the exhaust system, but also for the turbocharger.</div>

The turbocharger is not situated at the exhaust pipe but actually in the engine compartment with the engine. So there is no logical reason to deliberately cause ignition at the exhaust pipe to keep the turbocharger turbine spinning. Besides a turbocharger is no good for lower speeds, it's good only at higher speeds. For low speeds, a supercharger is used but becomes an extra load at higher speeds. So usually only a turbocharger is fitted into cars.<br><br>Oh well, it's ID anyway so I guess real life has to be suspended. Unless they have the idea of increasing the exhaust gas to increase the usefulness of the turbocharger which is not as good as the pumped up ECU idea (but high fuel bill) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . But even then, creating extra exhaust gas should not be done at the pipe but somewhere in the engine. Which is also crazy, sigh the poor engine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

You said that the ALS 'pumps petrol into the exhaust'. That's not what the site said. Petrol is liquid. And pumping it into the exhaust means having to pump it through the pistons. Essentially you'll flood your engine. That's what my second post asked about.<br><br>I did make a mistake though. ALS would give sparks at the exhaust pipe. A pumped up ECU would give an occasional slight orange flame at the exhaust pipe.<br><br>And I think a turbocharger would be better. True a turbo has lag but that is only if rpm drops or at start. A super has no lag but becomes an extra weight at higher rpms compared to turbo. If you're going to race at relatively low speeds/rpms, I guess super would be better.</div>

Best is to call it 'Bang Bang'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
