            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. my server is good again. Here it is for the Altezza. The comments are not my own unless in red. This is another compilation.<br><br>Basic Info<br><br>Car: Toyota Altezza RS200<br>Body Designation: SXE10<br>Colour Options: Silver, Red, Blue, Green, White, Yellow, Black.<br><br>Current recommended Shift Timing: 6000-&gt;6500-&gt;7000-&gt;7200-&gt;7200<br><br>Parts List<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Option A</span><br>Wheels: TRD (Toyota Racing Development)<br>Muffler: TRD<br>Rear Spoiler/Wing: TRD<br>Front Spoiler: TRD<br>Side Skirts: Toyota<br><br>Comments: This option offers the best acceleration and top speed. Handling is compromised, resulting in excessive oversteer. Best used in dry conditions as this option does not perform well in wet. Does not receive special upgrades.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Option B</span><br>Wheels: Volks Racing<br>Muffler: C-ONE<br>Rear Spoiler/Wing: C-ONE<br>Front Spoiler: C-ONE<br>Side Skirts: C-ONE<br>Rear Bumper: C-ONE<br>Hood/Bonnet: C-ONE<br><br>Comments: This option offers the best handling (both dry and wet), but sacrifices acceleration and top speed. Wall recovery acceleration seems to be unacceptable in my opinion. Best used in Wet conditions, and/or if you plan on mainly playing Happo and Iro. Does not recieve special upgrades.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Option C</span><br><br>Wheel: TOM's<br>Muffler: TOM's<br>Rear Spoiler/Wing: TOM's<br>Front Spoiler: TOM's<br>Side Skirts: TOM's<br>Rear Bumper: TOM's<br>Hood/Bonnet: TOM's<br><br>Comments: This option is the "Average" performer. Has both average acceleration and average handling. Accelerates a bit better than Option B along with slightly better wall recovery acceleration, but does not handle as well. Does not receive special upgrades.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Parts Test Review</span><br><br>Method of Testing: Please keep in mind that I did not review every part. However, I did an extensive review of the wheels, which did affect the performance of the car, which directly affected the way I had to drive.<br><br>For the test, I used a Full Tune, Option A RS200. The parts were tested one-by-one with no other modifications/purchases added. The parts were tested for Acceleration, Grip, Top speed, and overall performance in both Dry and Wet conditions. Tracks used were mainly Myogi (for high speed), Akina (for medium speed), and Iro (for low speed). Please note that my reviews are based on a Tune A trim. I am confident that parts perform differently with the other tunes.<br><br>- TRD Wheels (Tune A): Strongest startup and acceleration both in dry &amp; wet. Can attain max speed the best. Max speed attained was 205km/h at Myogi Dry. Physically smaller than the others. Unstable grip/traction at high speeds causes immediate power slides and oversteer. Also has unstable grip/traction at low speeds which make it slide more. This type of slide is good for courses such as Akagi and Akina, but not recommended for Happo and especially Iro where the turns are tight and the road small. Seems to lose speed very quickly, and cannot carry high speeds during turns compared to the others. But it's strong acceleration makes up for it.<br><br>- Volks Racing Wheels (Tune B): Physically larger than TRD wheels and physically the same as Tom's. Causes mild understeer, especially in wet conditions, which practically eliminates any sliding tendencies. Has the lowest acceleration and startup capabilities than the rest, which is more noticeable in wet conditions (actually lost to Bunta Akina Rain because of this wheel). Max speed attained in Myogi is 203km/h. Handles better in Iro Dry &amp; Wet versus the TRD. Terrible in Akina Dry &amp; Wet. Stable at high speeds with slight understeer, but has the most understeer at low speeds.<br><br>- Tom's Wheels (Tune C): Average startup and acceleration in wet and dry conditions...at least better than Volks by a strong margin. Max speed attained was 203km/h in Myogi with the most understeer at high speeds. Low speeds causes fairly Neutral handling with good grip which is great for Irohazaka. Does reasonably well in Akina, but TRD can take advantage of the long straights there. Carries speed well through the corners though, if you can take advantage of it.<br><br>- TRD Carbon Fibre Hood (Secret): Lightweight increases top speed and acceleration very slightly. This part can only be purchased through the Random Parts Change generator.<br><br>- C-ONE Rear Spoiler (Option B): Hinders top speed and acceleration very slightly. Increases handling and reduces oversteer very slightly.<br><br>- TOM's Muffler (Option C): Very good acceleration from between 1st-4th gear. Tailors off once you hit 5th and 6th gear. Offers no handling bonuses nor penalties.<br><br>RedLine12K's Review<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>exhaust:<br>Toyota: basic,average,steady nothing special<br><br>TRD: Good startup, good accel in 1-4, average in 5, slow in 6<br><br>C-ONE: average startup, very good accel in 3-5, 6 is average.<br><br>TOMS: powerful startup, average accel in 3-5, better 6 gear accel than others.(NOTE, I've heard that with the TOMS set of wheels this exhaust will cause understeer, which is why the TOMS tune has such a small spoiler to counter this. Try this with TRD wheels)<br><br>C-ONE hood: HEAVY, AVOID<br><br>NON-tune TRD carbon-fibre lightweight hood(black): GET THIS!<br><br>Thats all for today. Hope this helps.<br>Cheers<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
