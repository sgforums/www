Those players are probably newbies who has not played the game for very long. Normally when u knock against the wall, your speed will be reduce. If the speed doesnt reduce, most probably, they are using the "Boost off" mode. In this mode, the car which is trailing ie behind will have a "boost in his speed very quickly. If you really want to see experts play, i will suggest bugis arcade. Kids dominate the machines at tiong bahru plaza. Onl occasionally u will see above average players there. Regarding the lightings, i am not very sure. All i know is at the place where you insert ur initial d card, there is label indicating english or jap ver. Hope all these helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>regarding the lightning, some arcade use the colours to indicate what colour cards they have inside the machines in the early days of ver 2 as they do not have enough blue ver 2 cards.  thats right, at the begining they put leftover ver 1 red cards into the new ver 2 machines! now of course they do not have this problem anymore... maybe this problem will surface again in ver 3 and who knows they may use green lightning in ver 3 to indicate which machines have the new cards...<br><br>as of now ignore the lightning (regardless of white, blue or red) as they have no meaning now...</div>
