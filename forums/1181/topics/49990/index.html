            <div class='col-md body'>U talk about real driving huh ? Firstly does Singapore have alot of places for u to race ? Can your car in Singapore drive up to 180km/h ? Do you think everyone like u mention have all the kind of money to learn driving ? U think they enough age ? U think everyone have that kind of money to Own a BRANDED sports car etc.. ? U think we like to waste money like that ? u think we don't want a driving license? u think u dun want like u mention drive a real car then go racing ? For some ppl , they are underage of having a license , so what can they do? Nuthingz right? Everyone during their childhood will go play games in the arcade so those ppl only can visit the arcades and play / learn through games...Plz Dun get the wrong idea of playing Initial D is to bluff Xiao mei mei its true for some lamer but most of the ppl are not...BTW u find any1 in real racing shake hands after they lost the race ? Probably not right...but in initial d we do ! Even we lost win we will still shake hands.Playing Initial D maybe is a waste of money(I agree too)but this is the peoples' interest, they waste money so be it , let them be. This is a peacefull forum plz dun because of your unhappiness about ppl plaing Initial D then thus SPOIL everyone's mood. Everyone got their interest...(Dont u?u nv go ARCADE play before?) I am sorry abt what i posted yesterday.</div>

Although i debated with tat fela just to get rid of him too... but  i kinda agree with u there.. I guess his main purpose here is not just to create trouble... he just wanted to see if he was right abt all being ah bengs... n i guess some of us proved him right in the languages they used to rebut him... All we need to do is prove him otherwise like what mi n L3nn did n nothing much he can do too... Its a game of interest but there are really some points these guys playing ID have to take note too... interest is interest but if u still cant earn ur own living... i will still advice not to over spent in the arcades coz u dunno how hard it is to earn so much n there are really ppl who need it more... So enjoy ur games but also beware of u n ur parents' pockets...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
