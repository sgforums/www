            <div class='col-md body'>erm.. u could adjust the strength of the steering wheel... depends on how u hit the wall... if u tap the wall.. u lost about 1-2 kph.. however.. if u "glued" to the wall for a couple of sec.. ur speed will drop alot... thats all i could think of  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

SID (or Tsukamoto, dont like these tokyopop names haha) is a menace...you absolutely cant crash at the two grand curves on usui...or you will lose...so try braking more and playing it safety first..if you still lose despite not crashing, it could be you are taking them too slow...so try to find a medium, so you wont crash but still have a decent exit speed)..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>4. Well the wall penalty on usui is very high...since you are going at very fast speeds on this track, once you crash your accel will just go out the window...cause the impact with the wall is greater than on other tracks...(yes some physics do apply in this game lol) As sinistral said, if you only tap you wont lose so much speed.....but if you rub the wall or crash, you will have a very long lag that would cost you the race...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wait a minute. Sid? Are you playing ver2? That would also mean it's raining for this particular Usui track, right?<br><br>Yeah, what Hira said. Most are $1 a game so please don't go kill yourself after reading this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I was in Australia for studies about 3 years ago. I guess why they keep it at $2 (all of the games are bloody expensive!!) is because most of the people who play this are the rich asians. Anyway for the Aussies, they don't mind spending this amount of money if they can have fun. Go to their casinos, you'll realise the difference as compared to Genting or Batam. Just don't gamble  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For GC8V, if you're really sure of the track, use steering 1 or 2 if you want some feeling. 1 has almost no feeling and this is for dry. It's really no feeling at all if it's raining. That could explain why you felt the steering is like spoilt. But if you could pull the wheel towards you, I guess it's spoilt.<br><br>Anyway for the 1st turn, brake more but do not fully steer as you'll cause it to spin. Start braking lightly about 50m before the turn. You should be able to slide through nicely at about 155 - 160.<br><br>The 2nd turn is a bit tricky. Looks wide but you can't go too fast. Same thing as before, brake lightly before reaching the turn. Turn gently and slide through at about 170 would be alright.<br><br>One last thing, it's actually better to slow down a lot to go through the turn nicely than to speed through and crash. You really lose too much speed if you crash and usually it causes you to lose.</div>
