AE85 is not strong in uphill if it is SHIN USUI.<br><br>.................................................................................................................<br>Magneto Wong, Legend Of FC3S<br>MAZDA RX-7 Efiniti III [FC3S] - [LEON]<br>TOYOTA LEVIN SR [AE85] - [LEON]</div></blockquote>Hey Leon... AE85 is not only good in Akina downhill and usui only... as you yourself knows that you only try akina downhill and usui only... we ask you to try other course but you still don't want to... i guess you are too stubborn or lazy to try the rest only...  lol <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>if you are not that lazy again to read whatever in this whole topic... you should have see that someone already got rainbow aura... which means it should be a good car somehow... Levin AE85 is a car that really trains/improve the driver's skills... also, the reason why this car acceleration is slow is most likely due to the gear shifting... especially the start up that affects the rest...<br>Also, i have tested your car last week... so i dare to confirm that the correct gear shiftings for AE85 should be 5250,5750,6250,6500... this will gives AE85 a smooth acceleration for the rest of the gears to run other course too...<br>i have tried the 5500,5500,6250/6500,6500 gear shiftings for AE85, it does affect the AE85 acceleration somehow... eh people with sharp eyes should be able to see the difference... i guess some of us in this forums should have known that AE85 is one of the top 5 start-up/pick-up speed cars... those who wish to experience rocket/faster start up during battles should try 5250,5750,6250,6500... Hope this helps!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Good luck to all AE85 users!!!<br></div>
