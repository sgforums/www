              <p><em>Red Bull Racing driver Mark Webber has broken his leg in a road accident while taking part in his own multi-sport charity event in Tasmania.<br><br>The 32-year-old Australian collided head-on with a 4x4 vehicle while riding a mountain bike along a road near the historic convict town of Port Arthur.<br><br>The accident happened at 12.40pm local time on Saturday.<br><br>Webber was airlifted by helicopter to hospital where he underwent surgery on a broken right leg.<br><br>“The surgery is complete, a pin inserted and the recovery begins,” the event’s director, Geoff Donohue, was quoted as saying by the BBC.<br><br>“Mark’s in good spirits. The broken leg is the injury, and beyond that, he’s in really good shape.<br><br>“He has a little bit of a graze on his left forearm, but he has had full scans and everything else is clear.<br><br>“He’ll be in hospital for at least three days, for sure under a week.<br><br>“I was speaking to him before the operation, and he was already thinking about his rehabilitation.”<br><br>Webber's full rehabilitation is likely to take several months and rule him out of much of winter testing.<br><br>But Donohue added: "I suspect that as soon as Mark is able to fly, they will be keen to get him back to Europe.<br><br>"They will have people working out his rehab programme now with a view to getting him up and going as soon as possible."<br><br>Webber was tackling the penultimate day of the Mark Webber Pure Tasmania Challenge – a five-day, 170-mile endurance event involving mountain bike riding, kayaking and trekking that is now in its fourth year – when the accident happened.<br><br>Sergeant Jon Ford of Tasmania police told the Australian Associated Press that the male driver of the Nissan X-Trail that hit Webber was uninjured.</em></p>
