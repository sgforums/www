            <div class='col-md body'>QUALFYING RESULTS AND SPRINT RACE GRID<br><br>10/12/2005 - Dubai Â– A1 Team Switzerland has taken pole position for tomorrowÂ’s Sprint race at the Dubai Autodrome which threatens to end FranceÂ’s eight race dominance on the top of the podium. After securing pole for the Sprint race at the A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Malaysia but just missing out on a win after a 15-lap battle with France, driver Neel Jani is keen to turn things around this weekend. Â‘We finally got the car as we wanted today and I didnÂ’t make any mistakes. We got it all together for qualifying. However, I was on pole in Malaysia but it didnÂ’t work out so IÂ’ll have to wait and see how it works out in the race tomorrow.Â’ Asked if he thought he could win the sprint race tomorrow, Jani said Â‘I hope IÂ’m able to give myself a birthday present but for sure it will be very difficult,Â’ he said.<br><br>The result came as Switzerland put in the fastest lap time of the session in the fourth segment (1.45.926) after an exciting start to the afternoonÂ’s track action. The Mexican car left the track and crashed heavily just minutes into the first segment causing a red flag which meant only A1 Teams USA, India, Australia and Lebanon finished their flying lap. The bad luck continued into segment two for France who failed to record a flying lap time after brake problems saw them go wide and leave the track. However with the skill and determination shown over the season to date, France fought back securing second place on the grid.<br><br>A1 Team France driver, Nicolas Lapierre said: Â‘It was very difficult today. The first session was red flagged and we had problems with the brakes in the second after the drive shaft broke this morning. Then we had to put in two safe laps in qualifying segments three and four. It wasnÂ’t a great time, but at least we are starting on the first row. IÂ’m quite happy, but I have to make no mistakes tomorrow and there will be a lot of pressure. IÂ’m a little disappointed really, as we could have been faster.Â’<br><br>The close times seen in the morningÂ’s official practice sessions continued into the afternoon with A1 Team Ireland taking third place on the grid with a lead of just one hundredth of a second on A1 Team Brazil. A1 Team Ireland driver, Ralph Firman said: Â‘WeÂ’ve had a good couple of days and have progressed well. I was very disappointed with the first session, as we werenÂ’t able to go out. We are near the front for the sprint race at least. The first session was very slippery, but by the end it was fine. Hopefully we will be quick in the race tomorrow.Â’<br><br>A1 Grand Prix reached another milestone today when its 3.4 litre V8 power unit notched up 100,000 kilometre without a single engine failure. It was A1 Team South AfricaÂ’s Stephen Simpson who broke through the 100,000 barrier in this morningÂ’s third official practice session.<br><br>A1 Team  Driver  Aggregate Time<br>1  Switzerland  Neel Jani  3.31.918<br>2  France  Nicolas Lapierre  3.32.551<br>3  Ireland  Ralph Firman  3.32.626<br>4  Brazil  Nelson Piquet Jr  3.32.627<br>5  Great Britain  Robbie Kerr  3.32.634<br>6  Germany  Adrian Sutil  3.33.105<br>7  Czech Republic  Tomas Enge  3.33.307<br>8  Malaysia  Alex Yoong  3.33.320<br>9  Canada  Sean McIntosh  3.33.841<br>10  Portugal  Alvaro Parente  3.34.118<br>11  Italy  Enrico Toccacelo  3.34.141<br>12  Indonesia  Ananda Mikola  3.34.233<br>13  South Africa  Stephen Simpson  3.34.252<br>14  Japan  Hayanari Shimoda  3.34.502<br>15  USA  Philip Giebler  3.34.692<br>16  China  Tengyi Jiang  3.34.925<br>17  New Zealand  Matt Halliday  3.34.976<br>18  India  Armaan Ebrahim  3.35.007<br>19  Netherlands  Jos Verstappen  3.35.074<br>20  Pakistan  Adam Khan  3.35.183<br>21  Austria  Mathias Lauda  3.35.981<br>22  Australia  Christian Jones  3.36.276<br>23  Lebanon  Basil Shaaban  3.38.069<br>24  Mexico  Salvador Duran<br><br>The Sprint race will be contested over 50 miles lasting up to 30 minutes in duration.

The outcome of the race determines the grid position for the Feature race which will start at 15.00 local time with a standing start. The Feature race will be run over 100 miles (30 laps) lasting up to 60 minutes in duration.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SPRINT RACE RESULTS<br><br>11/12/2005 - Dubai Â– A1 Team Switzerland took their first win of the season, ending FranceÂ’s eight race run and putting them on pole for this afternoonÂ’s Feature race. Driver Neel Jani was joined on the podium by Italy and the Czech Republic who benefited from an unusual mistake by the French team which saw Nicolas Lapierre slip down to finish in seventh.<br><br>Winning his first A1 Grand Prix race Neel Jani said: Â‘It was a great result, but the big race is to come, itÂ’s not over yet. I managed to get a really good start.Â’ Asked if he thought he could continue the tradition of winning the Feature as well as the Sprint race, Jani commented: Â‘Of course I hope we can win, IÂ’ll try my best and see what the outcome isÂ’.<br><br>It was another action-packed start for an A1 Grand Prix race with pole-sitter A1 Team Switzerland leading into the first corner. Following was A1 Team Ireland, A1 Team Brazil and A1 Team Great Britain with France in a very unfamiliar fifth having gone wide and lost ground. Not everyone made the first corner cleanly with the first casualty being A1 Team Germany who had to pit at the end of lap one for a new nose cone.<br><br>The battle of the opening lap was between Brazil and Great Britain and by the end of the lap it was BritainÂ’s Robbie Kerr who was in third. On lap two the challenge from Brazil finished when Nelson Piquet Jr parked his car on the side of the track so implementing A1 Recovery for the very first time. This ground-breaking helicopter recovery service was given the green light by the FIA for A1GP to use it for the first time in Dubai.<br>A1 Teams Malaysia and Netherlands started a race long battle with HollandÂ’s Jos Verstappen moving from nineteenth on the starting grid to twelfth at the end of lap one. Despite the Dutch driverÂ’s best efforts there was no way he could overtake Malaysia but was less than a second behind at the end of the 15 lap race.<br><br>There were the usual wheel to wheel battles all the way down the field with New Zealand trying everything to get by South Africa on lap two. However, A1 Team France had a much easier time on lap four and was able to cruise by the Great Britain car relatively easily and take third place.<br><br>India and China may not have been in the points but this did not stop them battling on the track with the Chinese coming out on top on lap five after the Indian car slid off the track. All this time A1 Team Switzerland was holding a lead of about three seconds and never looked likely to be troubled by A1 Team Ireland who had more than enough to deal with as A1 Team France was up to within half a second of his rear wing by half distance.<br><br>Unfortunately for A1 Team Great Britain their third place was lost when Robbie Kerr spun on lap six and dropped down to ninth. A1 Team USA was being pursued by South Africa and the wheel to wheel battle was resolved in the favour of the South African car on lap eight when he moved into twelfth. A1 Team Mexico, despite being eighteenth was not going to make life easy for Austria but finally on lap nine the Austrian car was able to finally slip by and hold the Mexicans at bay until the chequered flag.<br><br>With just over a lap to go all looked set for Switzerland to be joined on the podium by Ireland and France but on the penultimate lap France spun off and dropped down to seventh and then the dramas continued with just a couple of corners to go on the final lap when A1 Team Ireland slowed dramatically due to an electronic fault with their gearbox. This allowed A1 Team Italy to claim their first podium and the Czech Team their second.<br><br>ItalyÂ’s Enrico Toccacelo commented: Â‘IÂ’m confident for the second race, we had a problem in qualifying but the team worked on the car and did a good job. I had a good start, despite the first corner which was really close, but I was lucky and got through ok.Â’<br><br>Also optimistic for the next race, and the rest of the season, the Czech RepublicÂ’s Tomas Enge said: Â‘It was an unbelievable race, the car was perfectly prepared and I had a clear race. There were problems in the first corner but I managed to get through and was fast enough to keep up with Toccacelo. Hopefully we are making progress now, we were unlucky at the start of the season, but it is starting to get better now.Â’<br><br>A1 Team  Driver  Time<br>1  Switzerland  Neel Jani  26.56.613<br>2  Italy  Enrico Toccacelo  27.04.860<br>3  Czech Republic  Tomas Enge  27.05.637<br>4  Ireland  Ralph Firman  27.06.574<br>5  Canada  Sean McIntosh  27.07.805<br>6  Indonesia  Ananda Mikola  27.10.009<br>7  France  Nicolas Lapierre  27.10.539<br>8  Portugal  Alvaro Parente  27.11.497<br>9  Great Britain  Robbie Kerr  27.12.050<br>10  Malaysia  Alex Yoong  27.13.234<br>11  Netherlands  Jos Verstappen  27.14.223<br>12  South Africa  Stephen Simpson  27.14.919<br>13  USA  Philip Giebler  27.18.655<br>14  Japan  Hayanari Shimoda  27.19.980<br>15  New Zealand  Matt Halliday  2725.478<br>16  Pakistan  Adam Khan  27.26.010<br>17  Austria  Mathias Lauda  27.27.301<br>18  Mexico  Salvador Duran  27.28.282<br>19  China  Tengyi Jiang  27.31.732<br>20  India  Armaan Ebrahim  27.41.498<br>21  Australia  Will Davison  14 laps<br>22  Germany  Adrian Sutil  2 laps<br>23  Brazil  Nelson Piquet Jr  1 lap<br>24  Lebanon  Basil Shaaban  DNS<br><br>A1 Team Lebanon did not start the Sprint race after spinning off on the formation lap and will therefore start the Feature race at the back of the grid.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FEATURE RACE RESULTS<br><br>11/12/2005 - Dubai Â– Resuming their usual podium position, A1 Team France won todayÂ’s Feature race after starting from seventh on the grid. Battling up from ninth, A1 Team Great Britain took second place followed by Stephen Simpson who drove his way to South AfricaÂ’s first podium finish.<br><br>Race winner Nicolas Lappierre said: Â‘I was really disappointed with the first race, but the team was behind me, and told me we could still win. The second race was crazy, it was just fantastic. I had a great start and a good strategy. When we saw the safety car come out the team made the perfect call for a pit stop. I had a good fight with Robbie and Stephen, and Robbie stayed with me and I had to push really hard. The track is really slippery when you went offline, and you had to pick where to overtake really carefully. This was a difficult race, I started seventh and there was a lot of overtaking to do. The track is really nice, there is a long back straight and the chance of overtaking.Â’<br><br>As the cars left the grid it was Switzerland and Italy side by side into the first corner and in the scrum that ensued behind them, Great Britain and the Czech Republic collided. One of the best starts was made by A1 Team Indonesia with the car slotting into third place from sixth on the grid.<br><br>As the cars started lap two, it was USA and South Africa side by side and A1 Team GBR recovering from the earlier mishap to hunt down Indonesia for third spot. Sadly A1 Team Ireland had not been able to rectify the gearbox problem that robbed them of a Sprint race podium and rapidly dropped from fourth on the grid to twenty-third at the end of lap one and eventually into retirement at the end of lap seven.<br><br>The pit stops started early with the first teams in at the end of lap one. A1 Team Brazil who was trying to recover from starting at the back of the grid was among them but it was not to be as their slow stop lasted for 51.8 seconds.<br><br>On lap three Indonesia came under attack from France and as they went into turn one on lap four the red, white and blue car was ahead and into fourth. The A1 Team MalaysiaÂ’s car was an early retirement from eight place and again A1 Recovery was called into lift the car away from the track.<br><br>On lap six IndonesiaÂ’s good run came to an end when the car spun as it came round a right-hand corner and hit the wall head on, bringing out the first safety car of the weekend. A1 Teams Great Britain and France who were at that point lying third and fourth took the opportunity to pit but Switzerland and Italy stayed out and this eventually compromised their races as when they did pit a lap later they ended up at the back of the field. In scenes reminiscent of Eastern Creek, it was A1 Team Lebanon, despite starting the race from the pit lane who ended up leading. However this was short lived as when the pace car pulled in at the end of lap eight, A1 Team Great Britain was in the lead by turn one. The Lebanese car made life a little more difficult for France who was not able to pass until lap nine and very soon afterwards Lebanon spun and let the rest of the drivers by with no problem.<br><br>Jos Verstappen who had battled hard in the Sprint race was again wheel to wheel racing in the Feature race, this time with A1 Team USA who he managed to get by on lap 12 to move up into fourth spot. At this point in the Feature race, A1 Team Great Britain was leading by a healthy 3.6 seconds from France but it was clear by the lap times being set by Nicolas Lapierre that it wouldnÂ’t be long before Robbie Kerr would have his wing mirrors full of another red, white and blue car.<br><br>India was in the thick of the action and was trailing Mexico and Australia who were battling hard, in fact the battle was so intense that on lap 15 the youngest driver in the race was able to overtake both the Mexican and Australian cars although by lap 17 they were by again. The progress of France saw the gap down to 0.4 seconds by the end of lap 19 and it was obvious by the amount of times that the British car was locking up that its lead was far from secure and eventually on lap 24, there was the familiar sight of the French car leading an A1GP race.<br><br>The revelation of the race was A1 Team China with the car not only in a points scoring position but in the top six by lap 19. Despite coming under increasing pressure from A1 Team Canada, one of the less experienced drivers on the field was able to not only hold onto his position but finish the race in fifth.<br><br>Pakistan and Austria were heavily involved in their own battle for seventh place and this was finally decided when they touched on lap 27 and Pakistan spun into retirement. On the same lap, A1 Team USA retired from ninth with what was an electronic fault when newcomer to the Series Philip Giebler pulled his car off the track. The action went on right to the flag as when A1 Team Netherlands crossed the start/finish line in ninth, the front wing of the car was clearly broken.<br><br>It was another exciting race for the A1 Grand Prix series and it wasnÂ’t just the fans that enjoyed the action. A1 Team Great BritainÂ’s Robbie Kerr spoke of his excitement. Â‘Unfortunately the tyres gave a bit in the feature race, and so France was able to get past. It was very exciting though. The car is getting better all the time and the results show it. The team made a great call to pit, but the second set of tyres werenÂ’t as good as the first and couldnÂ’t really last the race.Â’ Commenting on the possibility of the first race win for A1 Team Great Britain, Robbie said Â‘We are getting faster and IÂ’m confident that we can keep up, we just have to make the tyres last longer. We are working for a win, and weÂ’ll keep pushing, weÂ’ve showed we have the pace. Give us another chance and weÂ’ll take it.Â’<br><br>Speaking about his first time on the podium at A1 Grand Prix, Stephen Simpson said Â‘Words canÂ’t describe how IÂ’m feeling to come from twelfth to third. The team did a great job. ItÂ’s great to be able to keep up with the front of the field. When Nicolas came up behind me, I knew I was going to be able to him a run for his money. The last few races have been quite difficult, and A1GP is so close and itÂ’s getting closer all the time. This is just great for everyone at home, and in the build up for our home race in Durban on the 29 January.<br><br>Â‘There is a bit of pressure now to do well, the last few races didnÂ’t really go according to plan. My goal here was to score points, so this is a brilliant result for the team, and the hard work paid off. Our pace in the first race was good, and we only made a few changes before the feature race, it really was a team effort,Â’ he continued.<br><br>A number of teams were given drive through penalties and these seriously compromised their races. For Italy and Germany it was due to false starts, for Switzerland a pit crew infringement during the tyre stop and the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Lebanon for speeding in the pit lane.<br><br>A1 Team  Driver  Time<br>1  France  Nicolas Lapierre  56.17.068<br>2  Great Britain  Great Britain  56.20.782<br>3  South Africa  Stephen Simpson  56.23.758<br>4  Portugal  Alvaro Parente  56.25.067<br>5  China  Tengyi Jiang  56.47.856<br>6  Canada  Sean McIntosh  56.48.411<br>7  Austria  Mathias Lauda  56.51.510<br>8  Mexico  Salvador Duran  56.52.570<br>9  Netherlands  Jos Verstappen  56.53.213<br>10  Australia  Will Davison  56.53.414<br>11  Italy  Enrico Toccacelo  56.54.000<br>12  Germany  Adrian Sutil  56.54.916<br>13  New Zealand  Matt Halliday  57.06.192<br>14  India  Armaan Ebrahim  57.06.516<br>15  Japan  Hayanari Shimoda  29 laps<br>16  Lebanon  Basil Shaaban  29 laps<br>17  Switzerland  Neel Jani  27 laps<br>18  Czech Republic  Tomas Enge  27 laps<br>19  Pakistan  Adam Khan  26 laps<br>20  USA  Philip Giebler  26 laps<br>21  Ireland  Ralph Firman  7 laps<br>22  Indonesia  Ananda Mikola  5 laps<br>23  Brazil  Nelson Piquet Jr  4 laps<br>24  Malaysia  Alex Yoong  2 laps<br><br>Series Points to date Â– A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Dubai, UAE (11 December 2005)<br><br>1  France  106<br>2  Switzerland  75<br>3  Brazil  60<br>4  Great Britain  49<br>5  New Zealand  42<br>6  Portugal  39<br>7  Ireland  37<br>8  Netherlands  34<br>9  Malaysia  33<br>10  Canada  31<br>11  Australia  27<br>12  Czech Republic  24<br>13  Italy  21<br>14  Mexico  19<br>15  South Africa  14<br>16  USA  13<br>17  Germany  11<br>18  Indonesia  10<br>19  China  6<br>20  Japan  6<br>21  Austria  5<br>22  Pakistan  4<br><br></div>
