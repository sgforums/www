            <div class='col-md body'>Renault was not penalised for possessing confidential McLaren technical information due to Â“insufficient evidenceÂ” that it gained any advantage from it, the FIA revealed on Friday.<br><br>In a statement summarising the main findings of ThursdayÂ’s World Motor Sport Council hearing, the governing body confirmed that former McLaren engineer Phil Mackereth took a large amount of McLaren intellectual property with him to Renault.<br><br>But it said only a small proportion of this information was seen by any of his Renault colleagues, in the form of four drawings of parts from McLarenÂ’s car Â– and judged that these were of no benefit to Renault.<br><br>It therefore concluded that no penalty was warranted Â“due to the lack of evidence that the championship has been affectedÂ”.<br><br>In arriving at its verdict the WMSC drew a crucial distinction between the information Mackereth took from McLaren and that which actually disseminated within Renault Â– and said it could only be concerned with the latter.<br><br>...<br><br>It found that Mackereth had shown only four drawings of McLaren parts Â– of the fuel system, the gearbox assembly and damper systems Â– to other Renault employees, and the conclusion of the FIAÂ’s technical department was that three of these Â“were either of no use to Renault or were not in fact used by RenaultÂ”.<br><br>The fourth drawing depicted an innovative Â‘J-damperÂ’ system developed by McLaren as a substitute for the tuned mass dampers which were banned by the FIA in July 2006.<br><br>Renault admitted to using this information when it requested a rule clarification from the FIA due to concerns about the legality of McLarenÂ’s damper system.<br><br>However, the WMSC said the hypothetical design Renault supplied to the governing body suggested it did not have meaningful or reliable knowledge of the damper system actually being used by McLaren.<br><br>...<br><br>And whereas in the McLaren/Ferrari spying affair the WMSC suggested there was an ongoing transfer of information from FerrariÂ’s Nigel Stepney to McLarenÂ’s Mike Coughlan and others within McLaren over an extended period of time, it concluded that this was not the case with Renault.<br><br>...<br><br>But the FIA made clear that it reserved the right to call Renault back before another WMSC hearing should new evidence come to light.<br><br>Â“It should be noted that in the event of new information coming to light which calls into question the WMSCÂ’s conclusions in this decision, this matter may be re-opened by the FIA,Â” the statement said.<br><br><a href="http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=41409" rel="nofollow">http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=41409</a><br><br>Now we wait for Flav to sue Ron &amp; Co. for defamation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
