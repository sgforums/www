However, ex-racer-turned-entrepreneur Bob Jane wanted a race in Melbourne. He created a huge "thunderdome" and invented the AUSCAR series, bringing NASCAR action to Australia.<br><br>The desire to have a race in Melbourne did not wane. Despite the popular end of season slot for the Adelaide race, pressure was growing from the Melbourne motor sport community, and in 1992 Jeff Kennett was elected the new premier of the State of Victoria. He immediately set about improving Melbourne's profile. First on his list was the Australian Grand Prix.<br><br>An agreement was reached with Formula One in 1993, but the contract with Adelaide did not expire until 1995, so Kennett had plenty of time to prepare. A track was developed in Melbourne's beautiful Albert Park, part of it using closed-off public roads, and in 1996 the city held the first round of the World Championship. Since then, the venue has become the home of Formula One's season opener. The race is very popular with drivers and fans alike, and the party atmosphere of Melbourne keeps them coming back year after year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, what can we say?<br><br>Kimi: good driving, but whenever he's led from the front he's typically done well. I'll wait to see what he does when the chips are down.<br><br>Massa: pure tough luck in qualifying with a screwy gearbox. That said, he didn't quite hold up to Kimi in qualifying anyway.<br><br>Alonso: frankly disappointing. Typical calculated race on his part and I wouldn't expect him to trip over his team mate just to get in front, but nonetheless a processional performance on his part.<br><br>Hamilton: nice move off the grid getting around Kubica.<br><br>Fisi: same old, same old - emphasis on old.<br><br>Hekki: maybe he should have kept Alonso's shoes in the car - they might have kept him on the track. All the pre-season talk from him was, well, all pre-season talk.<br><br>Coulthard: WTF was he thinking?! Damn good thing he didn't take Wurz's head off.<br><br>Wurz: he kept his head. Nuff said.<br><br>Davidson: man of the match as far as I'm concerned. A B-team driver who's been sidelined for testing, and he's given a lot of people a big wake-up call.<br><br>Sato: he kept the car on the track. Nuff said.<br><br>Webber: he kept the car on the track. Almost.<br><br>Albers: he didn't keep the car on the track. Someone had to fill Sato's role.<br><br>Ralf: one of the top three drivers. Right.<br><br>Scott Speed: maybe the guy should consider changing his legal name.<br><br>Adrian Sutil: good one, getting in Davidson's way. Well, someone had to make Albers look good.<br><br>Heidfeld/Kubica: looking all right, but it's probably the car.<br><br>Rubens/Jenson: it's the car. It's gotta be the car.<br><br>Rosberg: it's the car. It's definitely the car.<br><br>Ferrari: once again, a nicely sorted out car. I'm not surprised they could get along without Scummaker, but doing so well without Ross Brawn is notable.<br><br>McLaren: so far so good as far as reliability is concerned. Alonso was spot-on when he remarked about the Ferraris having more race pace. Let's see how they go.<br><br>Renault: wake up, Flavio - it was the driver, not the car. Fisi's performance last year should have told you that already.<br><br>BMW: looks like they got the better part of the divorce.<br><br>Toyota/Honda/Williams/Super Aguri: Factory teams getting a run for their money from their B-teams. Something to think about.<br><br>Red Bull/STR: maybe they should have been watching Williams and Super Aguri a bit closer.<br><br>Spyker: ah well, someone had to take Minardi's place.</div>
