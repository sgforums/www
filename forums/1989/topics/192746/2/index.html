People are selfish by nature. When things go their way, they think the world is fair. When it is the opposite, they think they are being singled out for maltreatment.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm just loving every minute of this - the chickens have come home to roost:<br><br><blockquote>Schumi risks bringing sport into disrepute<br>Monday May 29 2006<br><br>Michael Schumacher has been warned that continuing to dispute the view of the stewards at the Monaco Grand Prix could bring further action against him.<br><br>Schumacher's team, Ferrari, have been advised that his denial of the stewards' verdict on Saturday might trigger a charge of bringing the sport into disrepute.<br><br>In one of the most controversial incidents ever to affect the sport, stewards relegated the seven times World Champion to the back of the grid after he'd been seen to park his car at the exit to the Rascasse corner, denying the other nine runners the chance of improving their lap time<br><br>Schumacher and Ferrari personnel gave personal evidence and the stewards examined telemetry in a meeting that went into great detail and ran for several hours.<br><br>Schumacher's own view of events has still to be fully articulated. Asked to clear up what had happened in Rascasse on Saturday he could only say:<br>"I have to admit that certain things must have looked a bit curious from the outside, but there were reasons for that and I don't really want to elaborate on it. It's not really anyone else's business either."<br><br>FIA president Max Mosley had indicated that the stewards will take similar action if it were to happen again and will not countenance a driver, even of Schumacher's stature, undermining the system: "It's absolutely essential that everybody understands that if you hold another driver up then there will be a penalty. The only way to make qualifying proper and fair is to be very clear about that."</blockquote>After all the crap he's pulled over the years, it's a beautiful sound hearing Scummaker wailing like the spanked b!tch he is.  It's all part of the fun, and I wouldn't mind if the FIA failed to put a stop to his yelping. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
