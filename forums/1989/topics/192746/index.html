            <div class='col-md body'>Michael SchumacherÂ’s claims that his miscue in the final moments of qualifying was accidental have not convinced all of his fellow drivers.<br><br>Soon after moving to the top of the timing charts the Ferrari driver ran wide at Rascasse and brought out the yellow flags, just as his key rivals were in the midst of their final flying laps.<br><br>Schumacher insisted he had simply made a mistake, but several of his competitors felt that explanation was stretching credulity.<br><br>Jacques Villeneuve, a nemesis of SchumacherÂ’s since their notorious clash at Jerez in 1997, ridiculed the GermanÂ’s pleas of innocence.<br><br>And while he maintained that SchumacherÂ’s actions were intentional, Villeneuve said he couldnÂ’t understand the logic behind them as they were bound to backfire.<br><br>Â“I hope it was deliberate, because if that was a mistake he should not even have an F1 superlicence,Â” JV told reporters.<br><br>Â“If you can make a mistake like that, you shouldnÂ’t drive a race car. ThereÂ’s no way you could make a mistake like that.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s the kind of thing I couldnÂ’t dream of doing myself.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know what goes through your mind when you decide to do that, when you know that the rest of the world can see.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t understand it, itÂ’s stupid. He didnÂ’t need to do that, heÂ’s a seven-times world champion, he was on pole position.<br><br>Â“Why do that? ItÂ’s only going to make him look bad.<br><br>Â“This is embarrassing. Embarrassing for a world champion. It would even be embarrassing for [Yuji] Ide [who had his superlicence removed earlier in the season].Â”<br><br>Williams driver Mark Webber was more circumspect in his comments, saying that only Schumacher would know whether he had blocked the track on purpose or not.<br><br>Â“I understand the second sector was well down,Â” Webber was quoted as saying by autosport.com.<br><br><strong>Â“You could say he was trying very, very hard in the last sector, but it looks like thereÂ’s been two moves on the steering wheel from what IÂ’ve heard.</strong><br><br>Â“Obviously if it is intentional it is childish, isnÂ’t it? It looks a bit tricky to be honest.<br><br>Â“Senna did some pretty wild things because he believed that was right. But will Michael sleep well tonight? Who knows?Â”<br><br>But Webber said that if Schumacher was found guilty of foul play the FIA should throw the book at him.<br><br>Â“If itÂ’s deliberate itÂ’s absolutely rubbish,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s massively below the belt and if thatÂ’s the case he should definitely lose all his qualifying.Â”<br><br>McLaren duo Kimi Raikkonen and Juan Pablo Montoya were both unimpressed with SchumacherÂ’s denials.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t believe that he really had any problems,Â” Raikkonen was quoted as saying by Reuters.<br><br>Montoya added: Â“Was it really a mistake? IÂ’m not so sure.Â”<br><br>In spite of the cynical reaction of some of his rivals, Schumacher remains adamant that he did nothing wrong and simply made a routine driving error.<br><br>Speaking in the post-qualifying press conference, he suggested that those casting doubt on his motives were simply adopting a partisan viewpoint.<br><br>Â“Your enemies they believe one thing and the people that support you believe another thing and that is what our sport is about,Â” he said.<br><br>The incident is currently under investigation by the FIA stewards. A ruling is expected imminently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh me, oh my, how all the Schumi Youth have come out bleating that their lad's been hard done by and how the FIA is out to get him.<br><br>Very well, letÂ’s be rational about examining the issue of SchumacherÂ’s guilt.  The accepted framework for such an endeavour is, of course, means, motive and opportunity.<br><br>Means: the analysts at the FIA have found no reasonable explanation for Schumacher to hit the brakes so hard at Racasse, and experts like Stewart and Rosberg, who are accustomed to driving cars with much less than the phenomenal handling of present day F1 beasts, have looked at the footage and said that there is no way that Schumacher could not have avoided leaving his car so neatly across the track.  Mind you, this wasnÂ’t the first time heÂ’s parked the car to give everybody else a hard time Â– at Austria in 2000, he lost his front wing in a parade-lap collision, and shut off his engine on the grid to try and force a red flag and restart.  Too bad for him it didnÂ’t work Â– the race started under a safety car instead.  You would think he would have learned from that.<br><br>Motive: in the previous races, even if Alonso had not broken SchumacherÂ’s winning streak, there would still be a number of races for Schumacher to win before he could claim points parity.  F1 fans have witnessed this situation before: if Schumacher is on the back foot but still has a sniff at the win, he will break the rules to tilt the odds in his favour.  In fact, as the three Austrian debacles provide stark testimony, Schumacher does not even need such a situation to resort to underhanded tactics.  In this particular instance, the sector times bear out that Schumacher could well have been relegated to second or even third place on the grid, undoing the work that he had done over the past few races to chip into AlonsoÂ’s lead.  The situation was ripe for Herr Michael Hyde to show his ugly face.<br><br>Opportunity: at the point of the Â“accidentÂ”, Schumacher held top spot, although it appeared from the sector times that the situation would have changed over the next minute by the cars behind him, and Schumacher/Ferrari were familiar enough with the rules to know that yellow flags in the last minute would have prevented any further change in the grid.  There is plenty of precedent for this sort of behaviour Â– all one needs to do is examine the number of times Ferrari have talked their way around regulations, from barge boards to front wings.<br><br>So, we have means, motive and opportunity.  What does Schumacher have to say in his own defence?  Â“You donÂ’t know what went on in the cockpitÂ”.  HeÂ’s right Â– we donÂ’t know if he intended to cheat or not, and itÂ’s his word against the telemetric data.  Any court of law would have taken at all of the evidence and testimony and declared him a damned (pun intended) liar.<br><br>ItÂ’s high time Schumacher either removed himself from the sport or was removed.  God knows it will be years before Formula one rids itself of his stench.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>look at the things he says....<br><br>And, alluding to previous controversial incidents with Villeneuve and Damon Hill, Schumacher said: Â“I have learnt very often that the past does get turned up.<br><br>Â“But I think everybody has black dots on their white jacket.<br><br>Â“I have been in F1 for 15 or 16 years and I think I can say there are not too many black dots on my jacket.<br><br>Â“In a way, I can live with it that people argue about these black dots.Â”<br><br>my word. his black dots are aplenty, and they go back to even before he was racing in F1... the cheek of that man to lie with a straight face.</div>
