Or rather they are negotiating something to continue the partnership. Nothing strange about that I suppose - Ferrari now supplies engines to Sauber, Toyota supplies engines to Jordan.<br><br>But I do see a problem though. Sauber are below WilliamsF1 in the constructors championship and will probably remain so in years to come. I doubt BMW will allow this to go on for long. They will probably start to supply inferior or rather older specs engines to Williams.</div>
