            <div class='col-md body'>According to reports in the Finnish press, Kimi Raikkonen has turned down a whopping $72 million deal to stay at Ron Dennis' McLaren team.<br><br>The reportedly rejected contract, which would have seen the 26-year-old Finn earn $24m per year until the end of 2009, will only intensify speculation that Raikkonen is already (secretly) committed to switch to the Ferrari team in 2007.<br><br>But his reluctance to pen a new Woking pact might also be linked with McLaren's less than shining winter season, not to mention his apparent irritation at Dennis' decision to already sign up world champion Fernando Alonso.<br><br></div>

At Mac, he'd have Alonso and at Ferrari he'd have MS, both of whom have something he doesn't yet have.  Between the two, though, I'd say Ferrari's the more sound choice - Alonso's going to be around a lot longer than MS, and the Macs are still way too fragile to be serious championship contenders.</div>

Honestly why would kimi want to stay at Mclaren when he knows that Ron is never gonna pay him more than what he is paying for world champion alonso. beside that, alonso is young, in fact younger than kimi, therefore would you have reason to believe that kimi would like to stay at mclaren to be #2 and let someone else takes the #1 place at ferrari when MS retire?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gaz has got a point.  Looking at the historical precedents, Ron and Senna were a lot closer, and ultimately, Senna delayed signing a his final contract with Mac for months before taking off for Williams.  Right till Adelaide, Ron left the door open for Senna to stay with McLaren, but Williams was where the promise was, and that was that.<br><br>Personally, if I were Kimi I'd be looking to move to Renault.  This looks like the second year in a row where they seem to have built a fast and reliable car, instead of being hobbled with German grenades (by the same measure, I really hope Alonso knows what he's doing by moving to McLaren).  Ferrari looks to be having another bad year, what with their pistons and the dodgy wings, and at this rate 2007 looks like a 50/50 proposition for them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">Gaz has got a point.  Looking at the historical precedents, Ron and Senna were a lot closer, and ultimately, Senna delayed signing a his final contract with Mac for months before taking off for Williams.  Right till Adelaide, Ron left the door open for Senna to stay with McLaren, but Williams was where the promise was, and that was that.<br><br>Personally, if I were Kimi I'd be looking to move to Renault.  This looks like the second year in a row where they seem to have built a fast and reliable car, instead of being hobbled with German grenades (by the same measure, I really hope Alonso knows what he's doing by moving to McLaren).  Ferrari looks to be having another bad year, what with their pistons and the dodgy wings, and at this rate 2007 looks like a 50/50 proposition for them.</div></blockquote>renault's future is still quite uncertain. some are speculating the renault might pull out of F1 all together. however I doubt bernie would want to let such an efficient team to leave. bad news at ferrari this season might be good news for Kimi. If Ferrari is down this year, most likely MS will call it quit, and start his own F1 team.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>will Kimi move to Ferrari if they don't do well then? Because altho Ferrari has had a long illustrious history in F1, lets not forget they had a 20 year slump, and also their financial situation can not stay the same forever. In fact I see their golden era has ended and while they might still be one of the best, winning is no longer guranteed.<br><br>I'd expect honestly that Kimi would have a better chance at McLaren because with McLaren I can see a peak period coming, after a slump of about 4 to 5 years. Pay-wise, I doubt if he would get less than Alonso. Neither would he be playing #2 to Alonso. If u look at Ron's way of running his drivers, he is actually much more fairer than a lot of other team principals in terms of paying them and gving them support.<br><br>Anyways in any case, I don't think Ferrari is a good place to end up for the next few years. IF theres anywhere he should move, Renault is a better deal. Their being strong now will help secure a future for them.</div>

And Emirate deal with Mclaren is believe to beonly for 1 year and partyly because the red front and rear wing livery will have to make way for vodaphone in 2007.<br><br>From what I know Ferrari has already signed contract extension with Philip Morris untill year 2011 and the team will be called  Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro Team. Market speculate that ferrari is set to gain around US$1b over six years, and this will easily make up the loses from vodafone.<br></div>
