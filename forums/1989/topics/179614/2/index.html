            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Ferrari with not go through the same financial slump they had in the past because Ferrari can float the company anytime and billionaire such as bernie, will rush to buy up a stake in the company. This year alone, Forbes has recorded 793 billionaires, and I bet 90% of them will own a ferrari, all will be very keen to be a stake holder in the company.<br><br>you cant just write off Ferrari just because 1 year of slump, which we all know it was mainly due to bridgestone and tyre change rules. Mclaren? They are a great team now, but what is going to happen next season no one knows because many key technical people has left Ron for other team.<br><br>Unless you have work with Ron before, or else what you are saying are pure speculation. If his is such a nice guy, then why did Adrian Newey keep speculating about retiring from F1 to build yacht, and then he suddenly switch to work for a smaller team and bring along with him his technical team.<br><br>Mclaren is in debt because of the technical centre, and I can assure you that Mclaren pocket will not be as deep as ferrari when it comes to paying his driver.<br><br></div></blockquote>disagree. Adrian's leaving is more to do with 2 reasons:<br><br>1) Red Bull paying insane amounts of money for personel.<br><br>2) Adrian needing a new challenge.<br><br>Red Bull is paying such insane amounts of money that its not just McLaren who's losing personel to them. Others up n down on the grid, namely Renault, are losing personal to them too. And if U wanted to poach personel, what better than to poach them from last seasons's 2 strongest teams?<br><br>Also, Podromu alone does not make up an entire technical team. A technical team is much bigger. And I'm not even talking about the lower ranking designers. I'm talking about key HODs.<br><br>And finally its a well known fact that Adrian wanted a new challenge and that the main reason for his defection is that he felt that he'd done enough to bring McLaren out of their 3 year slump. He might have retired from F1 but the competitiveness of the 03 McLaren rekindled his interest for F1. Then, in 05, the appearance of a team that is rich enough to afford him and yet midfield enough to present a mental challenge to him, is the key to him moving to another team. It has little to do with how Ron treats him. If he was treated so badly, there would always have been other teams willing to pay top money for him. The reason he jumped ship to RBR is the very reason he wanted to jump ship to Jag Rac. If Ron is such a bad boss do u think he'd have talked Adrian out of what was an effectively signed contract with Bobby?<br><br>Finally, I would personally doubt that McLaren is in debt. It is foolish to put down the team on the grid with the 2nd longest racing heritage and history as being in debt due to a new facility. The truth can't be further away. They might not be Ferrari but they are undoubtly the best british racing team ever. Looking at the glut of sponsers falling over each other to sign up with McLaren, I'd say financially they're certainly in the Pink. On the other hand, if Ferrari was as financially solvent as u say, then Luca shouldn't have needed to make those 'cottage industry' comments recently.</div>

If Kimi is already thinking he can't beat Alonso when they're in the same team, then perhaps he's not worth the respect, or supporting afterall.</div>

Looking at similar struggles that teams like McLaren and Williams have had in recent years, it is not unreasonable to expect that Ferrari may be in the doldrums for quite a while yet.<br><br>On the other hand, with the likes of Brawn and Byrne, I wouldn't put it past them to outdo their contemporaries in terms of recovery time.  Note that the 2003GA was not a very good car by their standards, but they bounced right back with the 2004 and swept 15 out of 17 races.<br><br>As for Kimi's move, it's 6-5 and call 'em.  He could well want to prove himself by beating Alonso on equal terms and winning the WDC with McLaren, but on the other hand this long stretch of being the bridesmaid but not the bride has to be getting to him, and it would be equally logical for him to want to join a team where he feels he can win.</div>
