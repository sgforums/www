              <p class="first"><span id="lw_1332499929_2" class="yshortcuts">SEPANG, Malaysia</span> (Reuters) - <span id="lw_1332499929_3" class="yshortcuts">McLaren</span>'s <span id="lw_1332499929_0" class="yshortcuts">Lewis Hamilton</span> needed less than an hour of the first free practice session for the 
              Malaysian Grand Prix on Friday to show that he will be the man to beat 
              in this weekend's race.</p>
              <p>The 2008 <span id="lw_1332499929_6" class="yshortcuts">world champion</span> scorched to the fastest time of the 90-minute session on a glorious 
              sunny morning south of the Malaysian capital, clocking one minute, 
              38.021 seconds to beat the rest of the field by more than half a second.</p>
              <p>As the afternoon forecast for heavy rain failed to materialise, the 
              Briton topped the timesheets again in a marginally slower time with 
              McLaren and Mercedes primed to battle it out for pole as <span id="lw_1332499929_1" class="yshortcuts">Red Bull</span> and <span id="lw_1332499929_4" class="yshortcuts">Ferrari</span> struggled for pace.</p>
              <p>"The car's been quite good. Made some set-up changes which I'm much 
              happier with and now just focusing on the long run pace," Hamilton told 
              reporters. "I didn't get too many laps but its definitely working - it 
              feels good at the moment."</p>
              <p>World champion <span id="lw_1332499929_5" class="yshortcuts">Sebastian Vettel</span> was second fastest in the morning with a time of 1:38.535, just ahead of the Mercedes pair <span id="lw_1332499929_7" class="yshortcuts">Nico Rosberg</span> and Michael Schumacher, who were separated by just 13 hundredths of a second.</p>
              <p>However, Vettel complained over the team radio that his Red Bull "was
               all over the place" as he toiled in the afternoon heat and could only 
              set the 10th fastest time, more than a second behind Hamilton.</p>
              <p>The drivers used both sessions to gauge tyre degradation around the 
              demanding Sepang circuit and with times slowing by around a second after
               10 laps, pit stop strategy for Sunday's race will be a key factor in 
              determining the eventual winner.</p>
              <p>"Well this track obviously you've got two very long straights so 
              overtaking is probably a little bit more possible than in the last race 
              but still, starting from the front is a much better position to be in 
              and so that's what I'm going for," Hamilton added.</p>
              <p>McLaren locked up the front row in the season-opening race in 
              Melbourne last week, with Hamilton's team mate Jenson Button going on to
               win comfortably, but the Briton had a far bumpier ride in the morning 
              before picking up his pace later on.</p>
              <p>The 2009 world champion, who won at the circuit in the same year, 
              struggled with an oil leak that limited his session to just 15 laps in 
              which he could only post the ninth-fasted time, 1.302 seconds behind his
               team mate.</p>
              <p>With his McLaren patched up for the second 90-minute spell, Button 
              was third quickest, splitting Schumacher and Rosberg, who were once 
              again very well matched around the 5.543km circuit.</p>
              <p>MASSA TROUBLES</p>
              <p>Romain Grosjean proved his third place on the grid in Australia was 
              no fluke with another strong showing in his Lotus, the Frenchman 
              overcoming early problems with his rear wing to clock the fifth-fastest 
              time in the morning.</p>
              <p>Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo matched Grosjean's feat in the latter 
              session and will be delighted to have edged out Ferrari's Fernando 
              Alonso, who showed a marked improvement from his early times but was 
              still 0.719 seconds behind the leader.</p>
              <p>Vettel's Red Bull team mate Mark Webber also looked far from 
              comfortable, finishing sixth and seventh respectively, while Felipe 
              Massa fared even worse in the Ferrari despite being fitted with a new 
              chassis for this week's race.</p>
              <p>The team reported Alonso's car to be "better in the long run" after 
              improving from 15th to sixth but his Brazilian team mate was 13th in the
               early session and dropped three places back in the latter run.</p>
              <p>"We need to concentrate on scoring points, as many points as possible," Massa said.</p>
              <p>"How many? We'll see how the car goes tomorrow in qualifying and in 
              the race as well. We don't have a very competitive car but I hope we can
               be able to fight to score some points."</p>
              <p>HRT had looked in danger of missing out on Sunday's race as they did 
              last week with Narain Karthikeyan, who only managed seven laps before 
              stopping with a hydraulics failure, and Pedro de la Rosa lapping more 
              than seven seconds off the pace.</p>
              <p>Both cars set times marginally outside than the 107 percent time 
              limit behind the leader that if they were duplicated in qualifying on 
              Saturday, would omit them from the starting grid.</p>
              <p>The pair improved enough to suggest qualification was possible but 
              the Indian driver ended the day in ignominious fashion, spinning off the
               track on the last bend in the final seconds of Friday's action.</p>
