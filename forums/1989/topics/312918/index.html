              <p>From The TimesMarch 31, 2008
                <br> <br> Max Mosley faces calls to quit as Formula One chief after ‘Nazi’ orgy</p>
              <p>Ashling O’Connor and Ed Gorman</p>
              <p>Max Mosley, one of the most powerful men in world sport, was under
              pressure to resign as boss of Formula One’s governing body last night
              after he was exposed enjoying a Nazi-style orgy with five prostitutes.
              <br> <br> Jewish groups condemned the behaviour of Mosley, 67, whose father,
              Sir Oswald, was the leader of the British Union of Fascists and a
              friend of Adolf Hitler.
              <br> <br> Mr Mosley was caught on video by the News of the World with five
              women in an underground “torture chamber” in Chelsea, where he spent
              several hours allegedly indulging in sado-masochistic sex.
              <br> <br> The Oxford-educated former barrister, who is president of the
              Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), reenacted a
              concentration camp scene in which he played the role of both guard and
              inmate.
              <br> <br> Speaking in German and brandishing a leather whip, he beat the
              women after allowing himself to be subjected to a humiliating
              inspection for lice and an interrogation in chains.
              <br> <br> Mr Mosley, a close confidant of Bernie Ecclestone, who holds the
              commercial rights to Formula One, paid £2,500 cash for the sex
              services, the Sunday newspaper claimed.
              <br> <br> His antics stunned Jewish leaders and motorsport insiders. “This is
              sick and depraved,” Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust
              Educational Trust, said. “For anyone to be in such a position of
              influence and power beggars belief. I am absolutely appalled.”
              <br> <br> Stephen Smith, director of the Holocaust Centre, said: “As Mr
              Mosley has condemned the racism in motor sport he should live up to the
              standards he sets. This is an insult to millions of victims, survivors
              and their families. He should apologise. He should resign from the
              sport.”
              <br> <br> Sir Stirling Moss, the former world champion racing driver whose
              father was Jewish, said: “I don’t see how he can continue. I hope he
              can, frankly, because I think he’s very good at what he does. I suppose
              what goes on behind closed doors is his business but when a thing comes
              out like this . . . it’s an absolute shocker.”
              <br> <br> Mr Mosley, whose two years in Germany as a young teenager gave him
              fluency in the language, has helped to turn Formula One into a
              multi-billion-pound business since he became FIA president in 1993. The
              FIA is a nonprofit association that represents the interests of
              motoring organisations and car users worldwide.
              <br> <br> Mr Ecclestone said that he was shocked by the allegations but did
              not expect Mr Mosley’s position to be affected. “I’ve known him an
              awful long time. If somebody had told me this without the evidence I
              would have found it difficult to believe,” he said.
              <br> <br> “Assuming it’s all true, what people do privately is up to them. I
              don’t honestly believe [it] affects the sport in any way. Knowing Max
              it might be all a bit of a joke. You know, it’s one of those things
              where he’s sort of taking the p***, rather than anything against Jewish
              people.”
              <br> <br> Mr Mosley, who lives in Monaco, is understood to be pursuing legal
              action against the News of The World for breach of privacy. His
              spokesman said: “This is a matter between Mr Mosley and the newspaper
              in question and the FIA has no comment.”
              <br> <br> Martin Brundle, the driver-turned-pundit who was recently the
              subject of a libel action brought by Mr Mosley, said: “It’s not
              appropriate behaviour for the head of any global body such as the FIA.”
              <br> <br> Mr Mosley, who once harboured ambitions to be a parliamentary
              candidate for the Conservative Party, is known for being eccentric and
              outspoken. Nicknamed “Mad Max” by some in motorsport, he once said he
              didn’t mind flak because he came from a family used to getting it all
              the time.
              <br> <br> Hitler was present at the wedding of his father, Oswald, and
              mother, Diana, which took place in Joseph Goebbels’s drawing room. They
              were interred in Holloway and Brixton prisons for their Fascist
              connections.
              <br> <br> Most recently, Mr Mosley stood up against racism in Formula One by
              giving warning of immediate sanctions if there was a repeat of the
              abuse against Lewis Hamilton, the only black driver on the circuit, in
              Barcelona during testing this season.</p>

              <p>I suppose Ferrari will start screaming that it's all a pro-Merc or - BMW conspiracy now. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Well, I don't really don't care how he goes, as long as he goes and stops wrecking the sport.  Now if Bernie will kindly join Balestre in that great racetrack in the sky, we'll be off to a good start.</p>
