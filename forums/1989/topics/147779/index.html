            <div class='col-md body'>Race Track: Istanbul Park<br><br>Location: Istanbul<br><br>Raceday: Sunday, 21 August 2005<br><br>Time: 2000 (race) [Local time]<br><br><img src="http://f1.racing-live.com/img/fiche_istanbul.gif"><br><br>Turkey makes its debut on the Formula One calendar in 2005 with an all-new purpose-built circuit in Istanbul. The spectacular 5.378 kilometre track is designed by famed German architect Herman Tilke, the man behind Sepang, Bahrain and Shanghai, and features 14 turns Â– eight lefts and six rights Â– with the cars expected to reach speeds of up to 320 kph.<br><br>An unusual feature of the venue is that the lap will run anti-clockwise, making the Turkish Grand Prix only the third race on the calendar to do so (San Marino and Brazil are the other two). It possesses a wide variety of corners, and while perhaps not as technical as, say, Shanghai, it should definitely provide the drivers with real challenge, especially given the reduced downforce available in 2005.<br><br>The character of the circuit should be further enhanced by plenty of gradients Â– the track is built on four different ground levels. There look to be fewer obvious overtaking opportunities than at some other Tilke circuits Â– it doesn't feature the long straights followed by tight hairpins that characterise the likes of Sepang and Shanghai Â– but no doubt the drivers will find plenty of their own once they get used to the track.<br><br>As you'd expect from a new venue, spectator facilities should be impressive Â– organisers know they have to rival the very high standards set by Bahrain and China in 2004. Planned seating capacity is 155,000, with 25,000 of those in the main grandstand, and parking will be available for 20,000 cars. Dominating the circuit's skyline will be two seven-floor VIP towers built at either end of the paddock.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Schumacher looks to experience in Turkey</strong><br>Tue Aug 16, 2005 9:38 AM ET<br><br>LONDON (Reuters) - Ferrari's Michael Schumacher says his years of experience should stand him in good stead for Sunday's first Turkish Grand Prix.<br><br>"I'm trusting in the fact that I usually adapt well to new circuits," the seven-times world champion said.<br><br>"I haven't seen much of it (the new Istanbul circuit) but I know that it's quite hilly and apparently has long fast turns. And that sounds good for a start," he told his Web site.<br><br>The 36-year-old has seen a string of circuits come and go since he made his debut with the Jordan team in 1991, including the latest additions of Malaysia, Bahrain and China.<br><br>"The race in Istanbul is going to be a premiere that will surely be very interesting for all of us," he said.<br><br>Champions Ferrari have had a troubled season after dominating 2004, when Schumacher won 13 of the 18 races.<br><br>This year, the German has won just once -- the six-car U.S. Grand Prix fiasco at Indianapolis in June that could barely be called a race.<br><br>However he finished a strong second at the last Hungarian Grand Prix on July 31.<br><br>"You're really eager to start driving again after a break," said Schumacher. "Many of the others may have needed this short break but if it had been up to me, I could have done without it. I'm happy to continue now."<br><br>The German said he had spent time with friends on a motorcycle tour of Norway and in the south of France to celebrate the birthday of Michelle Yeoh, the Malaysian fiancÃ©e of team boss Jean Todt. - Reuters<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Zonta steals McLarenÂ’s thunder</span></span><br><br>ToyotaÂ’s Ricardo Zonta banged in the quickest time of the weekend so far in the closing minutes of Friday afternoonÂ’s practice for the inaugural Turkish Grand prix, but overall it has been McLaren who have set the pace on day one at Istanbul Park.<br><br>ZontaÂ’s lap of 1m 25.583s was a fine performance, however, as the Brazilian, and McLarenÂ’s Pedro de la Rosa, edged ahead of Juan Pablo Montoya. The Spaniard lapped in 1m 26.196s, while the deposed Colombian had taken his MP4-20 round in 1m 26.525s. He was running different specification tyres to Kimi Raikkonen, who was fourth fastest on 1m 27.274s. Interestingly, MontoyaÂ’s best lap came just as an overcast sky deposited some drizzle on the new track, which has drawn rave reviews from all of the drivers. Jacques Villeneuve typified their comments when he said: Â“This is a great track! It has a really nice flow, a variety of different corners and is really good to drive.Â”<br><br>Jenson Button was close to Raikkonen with 1m 27.346s for BAR, and then came the star of the afternoon, Vitantonio Liuzzi. Despite running an earlier aerodynamic specification to team mates David Coulthard and Christian Klien, the Italian whirled his Red Bull RB1 round in 1m 27.578s to push ahead of series leader Fernando Alonso who lapped his Renault in 1m 27.579s. Giancarlo Fisichella on 1m 27.673s for Renault and Jarno Trulli on 1m 27.964s for Toyota completed the sub-1m 28s runners.<br><br>Takuma Sato rounded out the top 10 with 1m 28.081s to beat Mark Webber, whose late improvement moved his Williams up to 11th on 1m 28.120s. Coulthard was next on 1m 28.235s, followed by Michael Schumacher (1m 28.293s), Villeneuve (1m 28.404s), Rubens Barrichello (1m 28.460s), Ralf Schumacher (1m 28.641s), Felipe Massa (1m 28.681s), Klien (1m 28.828s) and Nick Heidfeld (1m 28.959s).<br><br>Friday is the day when teams conduct long and short runs and try both tyre options, so it is difficult to draw too many conclusions just yet, especially as the track remained dirty as it was only the first day it had been used in anger. Just as there were this morning, there were numerous incidents as drivers explored and sometimes exceeded the limits. Massa spun in the tight Turn 9 left-hander that leads to the start of the back straight, while Schumacher Snr, Webber, Raikkonen, Montoya and Liuzzi all ran wide in the Turn 10 right-hander that immediately follows. Turn 8 claimed both Klien and Barrichello, the former twice running way off the track and on to the tarmac run-off area there.<br><br>Tiago Monteiro once again set the pace for Jordan with 1m 30.626s, but Robert Doornbos got his Minardi flying to hound him with 1m 30.628s and to pip team mate Christijan Albers who recorded 1m 30.730s. Nicolas Kiesa once again saw off Jordan team mate Narain Karthikeyan, with respective laps of 1m 30.88s and 1m 30.899s. At the back, Enrico Toccacelo continued his acclimatisation to Formula One in the third Minardi with a best lap of 1m 33.813s.<br><br>ItÂ’s still too early to predict final form, but McLaren have got off to a great start, BAR are currently matching Renault, Toyota seem strong, and Ferrari are where they were on Friday in Hungary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tyre enquiry complete, say Williams</strong><br><br>Team cannot pinpoint cause, but confident of cure<br><br>Williams have concluded their investigation into the tyre incidents in Turkey, which saw Mark Webber and Nick Heidfeld forced to withdraw from the race after each suffering two right-rear failures.<br><br>With no other Michelin teams experiencing similar problems, attention immediately focussed on the FW27 and now Williams have determined as far as possible that a set of conditions spanning mechanical set-up, bodywork configuration and tyre deflections caused the failures.<br><br>Â“To address the tyre incidents that we experienced in Istanbul, we have worked through all the possible variables, such as pressure and camber, with Michelin,Â” said Williams technical director Sam Michael. Â“In the Williams R&amp;D labs at Grove we also performed some loaded tyre tests to check what type of deflections the tyres would have seen during the lap. Finally, at the test in Monza this week, we went through various trims of the bodywork to ensure that there is no possibility for the tyre to touch anything on the car.Â”<br><br>Williams also confirmed that although the FW27Â’s specification in this area had raced without incident in previous Grands Prix, a number of precautionary changes have been made to the car ahead of next weekendÂ’s Italian Grand Prix and engineers are confident there will be no repeat of the Istanbul problems. - formula1.com</div>
