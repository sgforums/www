            <div class='col-md body'>CNA/28/3/2006<br><br>SINGAPORE: Keep those fingers crossed and prepare for the ride of your lives.<br><br>If all goes well, Singapore could get to host a Formula 1 Grand Prix race as early as 2008. The man who steers the world's top motorsports event has all but invited the local authorities to thrash out the details with him.<br><br>In doing so, Formula One Management (FOM) supremo Bernie Ecclestone has made a dramatic U-turn.<br><br>About a year back, he told TODAY that Singapore would not hold a Formula 1 Grand Prix because of the full calendar. But speaking from London late last Friday, the Briton said that if Singapore is serious about hosting a Formula 1 Grand Prix, he will "positively try to make it happen".<br><br>Ecclestone's FOM company holds the commercial rights to the event and he said he could "squeeze" in another round in Asia and give Singapore the slot.<br><br>"I've been speaking to people about the possibility of a race (in Singapore). My advice now is that if somebody in Singapore is interested and wants to be the promoter to do this, they should contact me and we can start talking about this and see what we can do," added the Formula 1 czar.<br><br>The 2006 season has 18 grands prix, but last Wednesday in Paris, FIA - motorsports' governing body - approved new sporting regulations for Formula 1 that would allow a maximum of 20 races per season from 2008.<br><br>Responding to queries, Singapore Sports Council (SSC) chief executive officer Oon Jin Teik said: "A vibrant Singapore will be made up of unique, world-class events from the arts, entertainment and sports.<br><br>"Over the last few years, Singapore has built up a portfolio of sporting events that have brought buzz to this city-state.<br><br>"F1 motorsports is truly a sports business event. The success (or failure) of hosting such a major event is not just about fast cars and a track; instead, it requires a comprehensive plan that deals with understanding the target audience; developing a viable value proposition of commercial and lifestyle entertainment; ensuring widespread broadcast across the globe to draw sports tourism; garnering world-class sponsorship dollars; and building a sustainable year-long motorsports infrastructure.<br><br>"It is an expensive proposition but can bring good returns on investment for the country, if done properly."<br><br>"Work is in progress to profile, analyse and choose a preferred list of major events for Sporting Singapore to go after. The SSC will continue to work with all relevant agencies in the quest for a vibrant sporting calendar in Singapore.<br><br>"Personally, I have not met Mr Ecclestone but would be interested to have a chat with him," Oon added.<br><br>Ecclestone, 75, has turned Formula 1 into the world's most-watched sporting spectacle after football and it is currently worth US$2.8 billion ($4.5 billion).<br><br>Despite huge hosting fees that can rise to US$40 million, Bahrain and Malaysia reported earlier this year that Formula 1 pumps more than US$100 million into their coffers each race weekend.<br><br>While Malaysia, Bahrain and China all built new tracks, Singapore has no purposed-built circuit, but Ecclestone said: "I think a street circuit will work well. So, the moment we have a serious proposal, I will take a look at it and positively try to make it happen in Singapore. Get some people to contact me and I will talk to them."<br><br>"I think Asia is good. We have had a lot of success in Asia. Malaysia has become much stronger now and there is a lot more interest there.<br><br>"Maybe we can squeeze one more in Asia." - TODAY /dt<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another article from Today.<br><br>Mosley backs F1 in Singapore<br>FIA president cites strong fan base here as a plus point<br><br>Ian De Cotta<br>ian@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>Today Exclusive<br>.<br>A Singapore leg of the Formula 1 world championships has received the support of no less than the boss of the sport's world governing body, Max Mosley.<br>.<br>The president of the FIA who, together with commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone, has been instrumental in steering Formula 1 into a global sporting spectacle, told Today that "Singapore is a vibrant business region with a huge motorsport fan base and it would be a welcome addition to the sport".<br>.<br>Mosley wants to see the championships less in Europe and spread more worldwide and says that FIA encourages the development of motor sports in all regions Â— and that Asia is no exception.<br>.<br>The 66-year-old Briton, who has been president of FIA since 1992, said: "If the infrastructure and financial commitment is in place, then it is always possible that Singapore could host a Grand Prix in 2008."<br>.<br>Although the FIA approved a maximum of 20 races per season from 2008 onwards, Mosley said that most of the teams still see 18 races as the optimum number in a season.<br>.<br>But he also revealed that there is at the same time a strong desire for one or two races to be staged outside of Europe.<br>.<br>"One important aspect to consider is whether there is a strong fan base for the sport in the region," Mosley told Today.<br>.<br>"As we have seen from the many Singaporeans who frequent the Malaysian Grand Prix, this seems to be the case.<br>.<br>"I believe Singapore contributes the biggest number of foreign spectators for that race."<br>.<br>In an interview with Today this week, Ecclestone said that he could "squeeze" one more race in Asia and if Singapore is interested to host a round of the world championships and has a serious proposal, he would "positively try to make it happen".<br>.<br>In response, the Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Sports Council said they were open to discussing with Ecclestone on the possibility of hosting a race in Singapore.<br>.<br>Although the high cost of hosting fees has been cited as a potential bugbear to discussions between Singapore and Ecclestone, Mosley said the biggest obstacle, tobacco advertising Â— which has previously put the brakes on Formula 1 coming here Â— is not likely to be an issue.<br>.<br>"Tobacco advertising is not a matter for the FIA as we do not get involved with the commercial aspect of the sport.<br>.<br>"Having said that, it does seem that the tobacco companies are on their way out and it may even be that by 2008 there will be no tobacco advertising in Formula 1, so this would not be a problem for Singapore," said Mosley.<br>.<br>But the FIA chief offered one piece of advice if Singapore wants to be included in the championships: "As we have seen with Bahrain and China, the best way to get on the calendar is to show absolute commitment to build a Formula 1 homologated circuit and provide the financial wherewithal to run that circuit every year.<br>.<br>"There is only one Monaco and it is difficult for any race to match the history and tradition inherent in that event."<br>FIA president cites strong fan base here as a plus point<br><br></div>

The time to act is now.<br><br>If a purpose-built circuit is the way to go, then look at the proposed Grade 2 circuit in Tuas now and upgrade it to F1 standard i.e. Grade 1.<br><br>If we decide to go for a street circuit, I think we have a good chance to revise the proposal for the IR in Marina Bay, and a purpose-built street circuit can be incorporated into the design.<br><br>It will be the first purpose-built street circuit in the world and it is so much more workable because it is a green field site.<br><br>There seems to be a lack of co-ordination and overall strategic planning among the various government agencies.<br><br>On the one hand, the JTC under the MTI is working on the Grade 2 circuit in Tuas. On the other, the Singapore Tourism Board, also under MTI, may be looking at F1.<br><br>What about the Singapore Sports Council, which is under the MCYS?

            <div class='col-md body'>Formula One Race On "Circuit De Singapore"?<br><br>By Jackson Sawatan<br><br>SINGAPORE, March 31 (Bernama) -- About a year ago, Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew voiced his regret for not having built a Formula One racing track here.<br><br>"I think I was dim witted then...but I learnt a lesson and I'm telling my younger chaps, look, pay attention to all this, this is what will make Singapore buzz," he was reported as saying.<br><br>It was a mistake, he admitted.<br><br>Now the 82-year-old Minister Mentor and father of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, may get to see if his younger chaps were anywhere near to paying attention to what could be an opportunity to correct the island state's "F1 mistake".<br><br>In an about turn from a "no" a year ago, F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone said this week that Singapore could get to host the F1 race if the island republic wants it.<br><br>He told TODAY newspaper that he would "positively try to make it happen" if the F1 management received serious proposal from Singapore.<br><br>"I think Asia is good. We have had a lot of success in Asia. Malaysia has become much stronger now and there is a lot more interest there. Maybe we can squeeze one more in Asia," he said.<br><br>The FIA, the world's motorsports governing body announced last week a new regulation for the F1 motorsports that allow a maximum of 20 races per season from 2008 as compared to 18 races in the current season.<br><br>That is where Singapore could hope to squeeze in.<br><br>Land is a scarce resource in Singapore and it does not see a benefit in building a race track on tens of hectares of precious land only to be used once a year.<br><br>But Ecclestone said he thought that "a street circuit will work well".<br><br>Circuit de Monaco is perhaps one name that springs to the minds of F1 fans at the very mention of "street circuit".<br><br>It is a name given once a year to several streets in the principality of Monaco -- ordinary streets around the town which will be closed to the traffic when the principality host the Monaco Grand Prix.<br><br>So, will Singapore close its streets to the traffic to turn it into a "Circuit de Singapore" of sort or will it build a new race track?<br><br>The more pertinent question would be -- is it sustainable to have two F1 races, one at Malaysia's Sepang International Circuit (SIC) and another at the "Circuit de Singapore" just 300km away?<br><br>SIC chief Mokhzani Tun Mahathir does not think it is a good idea.<br><br>"If Singapore host a race, it will mean that the races there and Sepang would have to run back to back... we will definitely cannibalise on each other because we are going to attract the same spectators," Mokhzani told TODAY newspaper.<br><br>He said that the Malaysian Grand Prix depended on a small regional market.<br><br>Mokhzani's father Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad who is former Malaysian Prime Minister and an avid motorsports fan, was the brainchild of the Malaysian Grand Prix.<br><br>Malaysia went on to build the race track -- the second in Asia after Japan's -- and started to host a leg since 1999. China and Bahrain had also built their own race track.<br><br>The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) was non-committal on the possibility of Singapore hosting a round of the championship, only to say that it was studying motorsports events as part of its tourism portfolio development.<br><br>"Hosting the F1 Grand Prix will be a high cost affair and we will have to consider this carefully," STB's director of cluster development Oliver Chong said, adding STB was open to the possibility.<br><br>One thing is for sure though, Singapore had let pass its only real F1 opportunity when it decided not to build a race track. The opportunity had knocked only once on Malaysia's door and its leaders grabbed it at once.<br><br>The next one coming -- if there ever will be one -- is just an afterthought.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br><br><a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_sports.php?id=189070" rel="nofollow">http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_sports.php?id=189070</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TODAY 6/4/2006<br><br>Make known F1 feasibility studies<br><br>Letter from Kevin Wong<br><br>I refer to the letter "Set up new body to facilitate F1 in Singapore" from Cheng Khim Seng (April 3) .<br>.<br>I agree that we have to be synergistic in our efforts to ensure the success of F1 in Singapore. However, preliminary studies were already done by officials from the Singapore Motorsports Association (SMSA) and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) a year ago to identify plots of land suitable for a purpose-built track or a street race in and around the Central Business District.<br>.<br>We have not heard any latest updates from the SMSA or the STB.<br>.<br>We need to consolidate the findings of the studies to determine our needs and limitations in hosting such an event. Then we can proceed to engage the Formula One Management.<br>.<br>The engagement would put us in a better position to ascertain the people, organisations, government bodies and commercial sponsors that are suitable Â— and willing Â— to render their services and resources. If need be, a separate agency could be formed to plan, lead and facilitate the process.<br>.<br>This may be the biggest race Singapore has ever had, so we need to know who and what we are up against.<br>.</div>

'In fact, the areas suggested by them are as follows: Marina South; Tuas area near Raffles Marina; Sentosa; downtown along the Esplanade, around the Padang, etc; and other areas like Changi, Pasir Ris.'<br><br>He also said F1 promoter's fees alone are in the region of US$30 million, while the total cost of hosting an A1 race is only about US$18 million.<br><br>Another positive is that A1 host nations must field a team, Mr Ramachandra said. And that means a Singapore driver, which would help spark the development of a motor racing scene here.<br><br>'Cultivating a pool of talented Singaporean race drivers would allow Singapore to participate in other global motor racing competitions,' he said.<br><br>'It is also in line with the Sporting Singapore initiative.'<br><br>A1, conceived by Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum, a member of the Dubai royal family, pits 25 national teams against one another in various formats, including street races and rolling starts.<br><br>Unlike in F1, A1 drivers compete for their country - not a private team or constructor. And the cars are identical, using a Lola chassis and 550 bhp V8 Zytec engine with a top speed of 304 kmph.<br><br>Richard Dorfman, managing director of broadcast and television at A1 Racing, said: 'We are thrilled with the prospect of having a race in Singapore. Singapore truly has the platform to be the Monaco of the East.'<br><br>Singapore's infrastructure support and its geographical location are well suited for a race as part of the A1 Asian leg, Mr Dorfman said. 'The broadcast angle and publicity will be immense for a country like Singapore.' A1 is organised so that there are no calendar clashes with F1. The two seasons run consecutively, so there is no more than a couple of weeks' overlap, with F1 from March to October and A1 from September to April.<br><br></div>
