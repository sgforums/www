Minus that, you will have to do more in less time and to do it with 2 new drivers it is worst.<br><br>b) If you have 2 new drivers driving your car around the circuit the first time, the engineer and drivers will have no prior information about how to set up the cars, except to guess while doing testing in other circuit with similary characterist if any. that is the problem you have to face if you have 2 new drivers to deal with.<br><br>c) Test drivers are suppose to understand the driving style of the leading drivers that is why their purpose if to help set up the cars for them prior to their qualifying.<br></div></blockquote>a) Agreed that test time is important, but since the WDC assumes that a new guy like Alonso can not only drive but can give engineers a clear idea of his preferences, what's the difference?<br><br>b) If they work exclusively on prior knowledge of how the drivers drive, why bother setting up the cars for existing drivers?  By your logic the data should be sufficient.  Get a driver who knows what he wants (like Senna did) and whether he's new to the team or not won't make a whole lot of difference.<br><br>c) If test drivers could drive like the #1 driver, wouldn't they already be race drivers instead of being stuck in testing?</div>

None of that has changed over the past 20 years, regardless of regulations, budgets or windtunnels.

As far as I can remember, when MP18 was introduced the expectation was high and it is only when MP18 couldnt make it to race then people start to talk about the fundamental problem.<br><br>Hey dude it is always easy to talk about thing which have already been said done and proven. However that doesnt really make you a very knowledgable person as far as F1 is concern.<br><br></div>
