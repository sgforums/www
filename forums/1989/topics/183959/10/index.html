            <div class='col-md body'>Here's what Steve Matchett has had to say in 2004's "The Chariot Makers" about communications between drivers and engineers.  Just in case you don't know about Matchett, he's the technical editor of F1 Racing magazine and a former Benetton mechanic.<br><br><blockquote>How often have you seen the driver lift his hand out of the cockpit and perform a little mime while talking to his engineer over the radio?  It happens all the time, they all do it.  The driver, gloved hand held parallel to the ground, uses it to indicate how the car is reacting over the bumps, dips and corners of the circuit; stabbing his fingers forward to indicate the front of the car, swinging his wrist side to side to explain how the rear of the car is working.<br><br>These actions are always accompanied by a stampede of vocal explanations too, thoughts stream from the driver like water bursting from a dam, his brain still computating quick enough to handle decision-making where information is arriving at speeds in excess of a hundred metres per second.  The more urgent his hand signals, the wider the driver's eyes, the worse the car is handling.  You don't need to hear the conversation, his body language speaks volumes.<br><br>While the driver is in full flow, gesticulating and downloading his impressions of the car, his patient, long-suffering engineer will be watching, listening, nodding, scribbling notes, translating jabbed fingers and wide eyes into a potential set-up changes to camber, ride-height, suspension and front wing.  But not only that, the engineer will also be working to keep his driver's confidence on a high; keep him motivated, keep things moving forward.  Lose the driver's confidence in the car (its predictable handling and its ability to only improve) and the whole house of cards collapses.</blockquote>This passage was written two years ago, not twenty.  What does it say about the communications between the driver and the engineer?<br><br>1) The driver has to describe how the car is handling at various parts of the track - as Matchett describes, "the bumps, dips and corners of the circuit".<br>2) The engineer has to listen to what the driver says about how th car is handling.<br>3) The engineer also has to keep the driver motivated and confident.<br><br>So how's any of the above changed with technology?  If a car's understeering at a corner, the driver would have said it twenty years ago as he would have today, and the engineer would have taken notes back then as he does today.<br><br>Now Matchett talks about "camber, ride-height, suspension and front wing", all of which have been around for a lot longer than twenty years, but I won't go into that - the key issue here is that his job is to translate the driver's feedback into changes in the car's setup.<br><br>Sure, these days the mechanic may have to turn the screw up 180 degrees instead of 360 degrees to get the same increase in downforce, but between the driver and the engineer, what has changed?  The driver says the car's understeering, the engineer works out that the front wing anlge needs to be increased, and the mechanics receive instructions to make the adjustment before sending the driver out again.<br><br>So what happens when a driver and engineer start working together?  If the car's understeering and the driver says so, why should the engineer understand that feedback any differently?  Does any new technology change that?</div>

Why are you bringing it up?<br><br>I was disagreeing with you that WHAT they are saying is different in light of race strategy and driver aids, which you brought up.  Driver aids don't perform any fundamentally different function from suspension or aerodynamics - they all work to keep the car stuck to the ground as firmly as possible.  Race strategy still comes down to deciding when to come in and how hard to push at any given point of the race - pre-1994 it was a case of working out how much fuel was left in the car and how the weight affected tyre wear.  Post 1994 it was a case of how much fuel was left in the car and when to come in for a top-up.  Either way, the drivers and the engineers would to some extent have a say on when to come in, and the driver could receive the instruction to come in on a given lap and choose to either comply or stay out if he saw some advantage to that.  Regardless of the rules, that hasn't changed.</div>

What he didnt mentioned is how engineers could help or influence the drivers by providing them more specific information about their cars and offer advice for them to push harder or go slower.

I'll adress them in turn.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, but I didnt stop there, i did mentioned that car development will suffer because the engineers has to deal to 2 completely new drivers and it will take time for the engineers to know what is best for the drivers and how the driver can make the BEST of our the car. Not just limited to making minor adjusting during the race.</div></blockquote>Over and above what we have discussed, what examples can you put forward of this?  Let's say that drivers have differing preferences for the chassis' stiffness (I personally don't believe so, but let's go with that for argument's sake).  The new driver says, "It feels like the chassis is flexing too much when I go around at flat chat on turn 5, and it's jumping all over the place.  I could go faster if the car stuck to the ground better there".  Unless the chassis was carried over from the previous year - and these days a chassis design is lucky to last one full season - the input would be the same from the driver whether he's new or he's been there for years, would it not?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">I also mentioned that for a new driver driving a completely new car design by a completely new team, the driver will have to go through the additional learning curve of unstandling how the car will react to every circuit on the race calender even though he has won the race with other team before. I believe I did highlighted Ruben as an example because he was to struggling in the first few race of this season because of car set up.</div></blockquote>Yes, and Rubens is new to Honda.  What happened last year when he and Schumacher had been there for years and still couldn't make the car work satisfactorily all season?  If anything, the new driver brings in new input and informationt hat will help the team move ahead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">What Matchett quote is only one area of the working relationship of drivers and race engineers. What he didnt mentioned is how engineers could help or influence the drivers by providing them more specific information about their cars and offer advice for them to push harder or go slower. And in order to do this, the engineers will require a good understanding of his driving approach and his character and his limit, which could varies from race to race.<br></div></blockquote>Well, the specific information about the cars remains the same regardless of who's driving it.  The driver may be made aware that the car tends to be sensitive to crosswinds (as in the case of the FW26), or if it's tiwtchy at the back end (like the MP4-18 ).  All the engineer has to do is to make the driver aware of such idiosyncracies and let the driver adapt to it, and possibly assure him that the problem is being worked on as they speak.  Regardless of whether the driver is new or has been with the engineers for a long time, such information does not change and the drivers will still have to adapt.  As I've mentioned before, unless the driver's followed the chassis to a low-budget team, each driver will have to get adjusted to a new car with new characteristics at the beginning of the season.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">This article is to counter your statement that communication between the driver and engineers has not changed over the the past 20 years. What I am trying to show you is that the engineers of today are equiped with so much information and they have a bigger influence on the outcome of the race than before. And that change the way drivers and engineers work with one another as compare to 20 years ago.<br><br>.....<br><br>Again this is to counter your claim that nothing has change over the past 20 years with regards to communication in F1. Isnt telemetry all about communication?<br></div></blockquote>Yes, but communication between what?  If you're talking telemetry, especially with bidirectional telemetry being allowed again, the driver is cut out of the communications loop altogether, because the engineer can work directly with the car.  Using the article you posted as an example, the full extent of the communication between the driver and engineer is the engineer saying, "Okay, David, we've fixed the smoking problem - feel free to push now", with the driver thanking the engineer if he's not too busy.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">If you are talking about building a mass production road car, I would agree with you that this approach will be acceptable. For F1, that is approach is going to lead you nowhere, especially if you are talking about championship.<br></div></blockquote>I'll disagree with that.  The working principles in each car apply to all the others.  All the cars now have semi-suto gearboxes, bidirectional telemetry , traction and launch control, and variable engine maps.  While each team may make their own version of these things, the working principles remain the same.  Once, years ago, a team may have been allowed to introduce new technology like semi-auto gearboxes and active suspension, but as you have pointed out the regulations these days minimise that, and besides, if it worked, it wouldn't be long before other teams followed suit and it became the norm on the grid.<br><br>I hope you don't take this as being patronising because I mean no such disrespect, but if you can write in the way you did in the last two posts, I'll be more than happy to discuss points with you without being abrasive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
