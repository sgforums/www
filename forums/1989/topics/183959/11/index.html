I think you'd better open your eyes and watch F1. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote>I was saying that the main objective for cars manufacturers pumping in so much money into F1 is to sell more cars. Which you think is otherwise.<br><br>Then I dont quite understand why you start talking about private non manufacturers whom you know and I know are not putting that sort of money, with the exception of RBR who is trying to sell more drinks instead.<br><br>Btw, Ferrari is the only team that say they still sell cars to race, but from my point of view, F1 is their main marketing tools because Ferrari doesnt pay money for advertisement<br></div>

(That to me is that same as saying that the MP4/4 is the same as MP4/21 because they are still having 4 wheels, 1 driver, 1 fuel tank and 2 sets for brakes.<br><br>**yawn**<br><br></div>
