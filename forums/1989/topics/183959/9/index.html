The Englishman cries McLaren no more tear after.<br><br>One short discussion on a party, and two dinners with red bull boss Dietrich Mateschitz in Shanghai handed Adrian Newey, in order to turn McLaren the backs. Since then the star designer is pleased about simple structures and short decision ways: Â“McLaren is mutated to an enormous operation, with a structure, which resembles, complains rather a large concernÂ” Newey. Ron Dennis asked for one week time, for its star designer umzustimmen. It did not use anything.<br><br>At the new employer red bull gets the Englishman nostalgic feelings: Â“red bull is a team of the old impact. The people are straight out, open and relaxed. The decision ways are short. We build themselves up, discuss and say: Thus it goes.Â”<br><br>Adrian Newey: Â“Ron hates piles of paperÂ”<br>The matrix system of McLaren was not Neweys thing: Â“It brings a certain Frustpotenzial, because a committee replaces the particular. If chemistry is not correct, the people run into different directions.Â”<br><br>On the nerve Newey also the Ordnungsfimmel went from team head Ron Dennis. That can be pleased now that in the office of the technique boss no more paper mountains stack themselves. Â“Ron hates piles of paper. It always made a large elbow around my office. I pull the drawing board to the computer forwardsÂ”, say Newey.<br><br>The new McLaren MP4-21, which he sketched considerably, Newey presses the thumbs: Â“If the McLaren is successful, would be surely proud I. But my future is to bulletin with talksÂ”<br><br>Why Newey the change too do not red bull kept secret, and like it the chances of success of the team estimates tells Adrian Newey in the interview in the new expenditure of car engine and sport, number 5, starting from 15 February in the trade</div>
