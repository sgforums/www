Minus that, you will have to do more in less time and to do it with 2 new drivers it is worst.<br><br>b) If you have 2 new drivers driving your car around the circuit the first time, the engineer and drivers will have no prior information about how to set up the cars, except to guess while doing testing in other circuit with similary characterist if any. that is the problem you have to face if you have 2 new drivers to deal with.<br><br>c) Test drivers are suppose to understand the driving style of the leading drivers that is why their purpose if to help set up the cars for them prior to their qualifying.<br><br></div>
