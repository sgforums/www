Sure, nobody's going to disagree that aero is important, but going back to your point about Newey leaving (where this all started), do you think he's still that good after the MP4-18 fiasco?  On top of that, I'd question his motivation, not only at the point where he jumped ship, but since before the Jaguar mess.  It's time they got someone fresher and with more drive anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The MP4-18's chassis had too much flex as well, as did the 19's. This was a common weakness in twin-keel designs. The 19B was modified to reduce this and refine the aerodynamics of the car further.<br><br>Let's not forget - where was ex-Arrows designer Mike Coughlan in all this? Correct me if I'm mistaken, but he was more involved in the transition of the 18 to the 19. I didn't read about what Newey was doing during this time.</div>

Mclaren did tried to salvage the flaw by introducing MP19A, but Newey idea was to quickly design something new for MP19B because he believe there is no way you can make a winning car out of MP18 and still pass the FIA crash test.<br><br>FYI, Newey wasnt the only KEY aero engineer that left Mclaren.  And come next year, 2 of their drivers will leave too. I suspect Mclaren is going to suffer the same fate as Williams when both JPM and Ralf left them at the same time.<br><br></div>
