            <div class='col-md body'>It seems like the crack within the mclaren team is starting to appear now, and kimi seems to be very critical about it too. Is Kimi's future already not with Mclaren?<br><br>Another interesting news is that Ron has briefly mentioned that Hamilton might get a race seat in 2007, and this is against Mclaren's philosophy of no rookies in the team. Seems like sponsorship $$ for the first black F1 driver it too tempting and that might be the best option if kimi leaves.<br><br>There is also news saying that Marlboro is willing to foot the bill if Ferrari can secrure Kimi as MS team mate. I personally think that if Ferrari can continues to win races, I see no reason for Kimi not to take up this offer.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.<br><br>If the past few years' results were what the current team could produce, perhaps a change is exactly what McLaren needs.  The precedent is, of course, Ferrari, where bringing in a new team (Scum, Todt, Brawn and Byrne) broke a 16-year WCC drought.<br><br>I'd like to see some changes in Mercedes while we're at it.  Every since beryllium got banned, Haug and his mob have been struggling to build an engine that can get the car right up at the front.<br><br>I suspect that Gaz may be right here.  Mac will have a new team that will need to learn how to work together, and if they're half smart , they'll be focussing on getting reliability down pat before working on performance.  These things will take time, and unless something spectacular happens, 2007's not going to be all that great for them.</div>

Reason is because the cost of running a F1 team will become much more affordable comes 2008 and Ron will be very keen to join the likes of Williams and Prodrive as independent team.<br><br>As for Merc, it is an open secret that Merc wants to run his own team, just like Toyota, BMW, Renault, Honda, Ferrari and very soon maybe VW. Can they afford not to go solo? I dont think so. A Merc/AMG team is probably what they need.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Raikkonen's Ferrari deal is done - Lauda<br><br>18 May 2006<br>Former F1 champion and ex-F1 team boss Niki Lauda expects Kimi Raikkonen to take up a seat at Ferrari next season and believes Michael Schumacher will most likely retire. Lauda, himself formerly a Ferrari driver, says Ferrari's announcement they would let Schumacher take his time in deciding his future means that the Raikkonen deal is a certainty.<br><br>"Ferrari must have an alternative driver to Schumacher," Lauda told Reuters. "The most logical one is Raikkonen - and they can't afford to wait until the end of the year. If they did wait around until the end of the year they'd have no lead driver signed up and would have to race with Massa and their test driver."<br><br>"They must have fixed Kimi in one way or another and if Schumacher continues then Massa will be a test driver and if Michael doesn't continue Massa will race," he added.

I personally doubt the ferrari team was running such a big budget during the crisis, and I believe it was only after Marlboro become the title sponsor in 97 that they start all that huge spending spree.<br><br>As for toyota they are still a relative new team. If I am not mistaken, it took Mclaren about 9 years to win their first silverware. Honestly you cant really blame Toyota for the huge spending because they are own by the world most profitable auto company. As for Mclaren, it is only part own by Merc and dont think Merc &amp; Ron and TAG have the pocket that is as deep as Toyota.<br><br>Renault has been in F1 since the 70s but they have only been an engine supplier till 2000 when they bought over Benetton. Relative to other team, I think Renault have scored no. 1 in teams of points per million. And this year, it looks like they are heading for both championship again.<br><br>BMW is starting to close in on Mclaren and if BMW start to overtake Mclaren in the constructor points next year, mclaren will be in deep trouble.<br><br></div>

What makes you think that they are the most accurate?<br><br>Why dont you do a google search 'McLaren is F1's biggest spender' to find out where is the info is coming from.<br><br></div>
