McLaren was founded in 1966, scored their 1st formula 1 wins in 1968 with 2 wins in non-championship rounds, scored their 1st formula 1 championship round win with a win that same year in belgium. 9 years? your maths fail ah? even to their 1st championship itself, in 1974, it was 8 years, not 9.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> All through those 8 years, they were always a small team, and it wasn't till 1972 that they had a big sponser in Yardley. They came 2nd in 1968, and had 2 4th and 2 3rd places in the championship, with the exception of 6th in 1970 due to Bruce McLaren's death derailing the team for the year.<br><br>As for Renault, u've got your facts wrong again. Renault produced their own cars back in the 80s as well. In fact Alain Prost started out racing for Renault b4 moving on to McLaren. Renault's 1st ever 1-2 victory AS A CONSTRUCTOR was way back in 1982.

Yea sure in the past 2 races they looked like they were close challengers for McLaren for the podium slots eh? In the last 2 races McLaren scored 8 pts at Monaco and 9 pts at Silverstone.

Why do u go out of your way to slam them so much?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Is it because of your constant ignorance of the facts?

Mind you, back in those days the kit-car teams were the small-budget ones, always fighting to keep up with the manufacturer-backed teams like Ferrari.  Go do the math - back in the 80's, who else had the funds to build their own engine AND car?<br><br>As Heng has said, the funding situation in the 1960's is absolutely nothing like what it is today.  Comparing Toyota in 2006 with McLaren in 1960 is just plain silly.  A more apt comparison would be to Honda, who took 4 years to wint their first race in 1967.<br><br>BMW?  Closing in on Mac?  Is this like the predicted Ferrari 1-2 at Silverstone?</div>
