In 2005, the MP20 were clearly the fastest car and was close to winning both championship. In 2006 we would expect Mclaren to bring forward their success from last year, unfortunately there was a 180 degree turn and till now they have yet to win a single race and both championships are out of reach for mclaren after just 4 to 5 races into the season.<br><br>As a employer, Rib job is to extract the maximum potential out of everybody, especially the key engineers and drivers. For mclaren's case, it think their focus has shifted from people to Ron's majestic MTC. If there is nothing wrong within the company, there is no reason why Newey and so many other key engineers, drivers are leaving Mclaren one after another. And guess what, they are moving to teams with smaller budget.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>My argument of Mclaren suffering the same fade as Williams is on the driver front, not on the business relationship between partners or sponsors. The importance of partners working in harmony is another story all together and I am sure you have read what I have written about Merc relationship with Ron Dennis and TAG.<br><br></div>
