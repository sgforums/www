            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like KB has things well-covered here.  Just a few extra points.<br><br>First, the FW26 had the walrus nose as well as the twin-keel, and that consitituted a second flaw.  While the idea of using the nose design to direct flow further back worked, the car was sensitive to both pitch and crosswind and it never went as fast as it really could until Williams finally bit the bullet and reverted back to a more conventional nose.  That the car managed to perform as it did is attributed to the P84 engine which, like its predecessors was one of, if not the most powerful engine on the grid, which goes back to what I said about a good engine being able to make up for a lot, although not necessarily everything.<br><br>This illustrates the nature of a fundamental flaw.  You not only have to look at how acute the problem is, you also have to look at how chronic it is.  As Willaims illustrated, they knew the walrus nose had potential, but it also brought along problems that couldn't be quickly fixed, forcing them to drop the idea entirely.  The problem was so close to the central design concept that they couldn't get rid of the problem without getting rid of the concept.</div>

Just a few extra points.<br><br>First, the FW26 had the walrus nose as well as the twin-keel, and that consitituted a second flaw.  While the idea of using the nose design to direct flow further back worked, the car was sensitive to both pitch and crosswind and it never went as fast as it really could until Williams finally bit the bullet and reverted back to a more conventional nose.  That the car managed to perform as it did is attributed to the P84 engine which, like its predecessors was one of, if not the most powerful engine on the grid, which goes back to what I said about a good engine being able to make up for a lot, although not necessarily everything.<br><br>This illustrates the nature of a fundamental flaw.  You not only have to look at how acute the problem is, you also have to look at how chronic it is.  As Willaims illustrated, they knew the walrus nose had potential, but it also brought along problems that couldn't be quickly fixed, forcing them to drop the idea entirely.  The problem was so close to the central design concept that they couldn't get rid of the problem without getting rid of the concept.</div></blockquote>As far as twin-keel design is concern, at that TIME it was supposed to be the next big thing until teams come out with V-keel and no-keel design.<br><br>If you ask an aero engineers to comment on the aero efficency of the championship winning cars 20 years ago, they will definitely going to tell you that many of those cars are "fundamentally flawed" in aero design.<br><br>Ged, I would prefer that you deal with one topic at a time.

            <div class='col-md body'>An article that highlights the issues which some here are disputing.<br><br>McLaren bidding for Renault people<br>The latest whisper in the paddock in Barcelona is that McLaren is offering some interesting deals to a number of Renault engineers. The Woking team has lost a lot of people in recent months, notably to Red Bull Racing and is looking to strengthen its engineering team, notably in the area of aerodynamics where the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">loss of Adrian Newey and Peter Prodromou is a hard blow</span>.<br><br>With Fernando Alonso coming in to join McLaren next year it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">logical for the Woking team to want engineers that Fernando knows and trusts </span>and with Renault facing increasing uncertainty about its budget in the future, Renault people are an easier target than would normally be the case. This is particularly true with engineers who have been at McLaren before and one should not forget that Renault's technical director Bob Bell, for example, was a McLaren man from when he left university in 1982 until 1996 during which time he worked with John Barnard, Neil Oatley and Steve Nichols on a successful series of F1 cars until 1989 when he became head of the research and development department. Six years later he was put in charge of the top secret Maverick Project which aimed to build a 850mph car to use to challenge for the Land Speed Record. Bell left McLaren when that project was shelved in 1996 and moved to Benetton where he was head of aerodynamics before moving on to join Mike Gascoyne at Jordan where he took on the role of head of research and development. When Gascoyne moved to Renault in 2001 Bell followed and became deputy technical director and moved into the top job when Gascoyne headed off to Toyota.<br></div>
