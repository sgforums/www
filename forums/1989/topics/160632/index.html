            <div class='col-md body'>TOKYO : Former Japanese star driver Aguri Suzuki announced on Tuesday he would lead a new Formula One team next season with engines supplied by Honda Motor.<br><br>Suzuki, 45, said his "Super Aguri Formula 1" had submitted an entry form to Formula One's governing body, the FIA, last week.<br><br>"I'm filled with the desire to hoist Japan's flag on the podium as a constructor or team," Suzuki, who became in 1990 the first Japanese to score a podium finish in a World Championship round, said.<br><br>"I have joined many races. If I look at them as mountains, F1 is like climbing Mount Everest. No one knows what will be waiting for us ahead ... but I will do my best," he said.<br><br>The team will be based in Langley in Oxfordshire in Britain and use the factory of disbanded F1 team Arrows.<br><br>"We will use Honda V8 engines but the drivers are undecided," Suzuki told a news conference at Honda headquarters in Tokyo.<br><br>Suzuki said Japanese driver Takuma Sato, who was rejected by the BAR-Honda team last season, could be one of the drivers.<br><br>"We are in talks with Mr Takuma Sato and are also negotiating with several other drivers," he said.<br><br>Suzuki said the team was also negotiating with possible sponsors as "F1 is a world in which you can never have enough money."<br><br>Asked about news reports that Japanese Internet firm Softbank would provide financing, he said: "I would be grateful if such a major, wonderful company becomes our sponsor."<br><br>Suzuki also said he wanted to ask Japan's Bridgestone to supply tires.<br><br>Further details of the team will be announced between late January and early February, he said.<br><br>While the team has Honda backing, Suzuki denied it was the Japanese automaker's second team, saying Super Aguri Forumula 1 was original. Honda will own the BAR-Honda team outright next year. - AFP/de<br><br></div>
