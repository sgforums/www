But it was the slightly lighter car of Hamilton that got down to the end of the pit lane first.<br><br>Hamilton was reminded he should move aside for Alonso once out on the track. But he chose not to do so.<br><br>Starting with a lighter fuel load and running a fast pace, he was guaranteed to have a lighter car by the time they each did their qualifying laps.<br><br>It was a bit disingenuous, against what heÂ’d been asked to do by the team, and heÂ’d tricked himself an advantage. He was fighting this guy for the world championship and the team would just have to lump it.<br><br>Alonso, of course, was furious. Instantly realising heÂ’d been had, he instead switched his focus not to pole position Â– which now seemed unwinnable Â– but to trying to beat Hamilton on race strategy instead. He deliberately did his fuel burn laps very slowly and economically.<br><br>Having started slightly heavier and now having used less fuel too, he would maybe be able to save enough to run an extra lap up to the first pit stops. This might be enough to overcome the advantage of the pole that Lewis looked likely to get.<br><br>Because the originally intended order at the end of the burn-off had been Alonso-Hamilton, AlonsoÂ’s pre-assigned tyres had been stacked ahead of HamiltonÂ’s Â– and so Alonso was brought in a lap earlier than planned so that the tyres didnÂ’t need to be moved around.<br><br>With Hamilton continuing to do his original allocation of laps, this put Alonso ahead of Hamilton in the pits. At the first stop there was a delay, bringing Hamilton closer than ideal to Alonso.<br><br>They each then did their first flat-out Q3 qualifying laps and each returned for their final tyre change. Alonso was held for 20 seconds as the team found him the ideal gap in the traffic. The lollipop was lifted and Alonso was free to go.<br><br>But, seeing Hamilton stacked behind him in his mirrors, he realised a golden opportunity for revenge had fallen into his lap.<br><br>He knew how long he needed for an out-lap to arrive at the start/finish line to begin his flying lap just before the session ended and he knew how many seconds of the session were left because he has a display showing that on his steering wheel.<br><br>So he waited an extra 10s, just long enough to ensure heÂ’d still get there in time but Lewis wouldnÂ’t.<br><br>And that is it. Two hyper-competitive drivers fighting tooth and nail for the championship in the same team. The discord isnÂ’t really surprising. WeÂ’ve seen as much at this team before in the Senna/Prost era, we saw it at Williams during the Mansell/Piquet days.<br><br>But this is slightly different in that the major bust-ups are not between the drivers directly, but between each driver and Dennis. Each feels grievances against him.<br><br>Alonso has not even been on speaking terms with him for some time now, often chooses even not to acknowledge him Â– and is said to be threatening to walk out short of his three-year contract.<br><br>Hamilton, meanwhile, feeling in the heat of the moment that his delay had been orchestrated by the team as Â‘punishmentÂ’ for disobeying orders, had a very intense bust-up with Dennis.<br><br>At its root is control. DennisÂ’ previous driver Kimi Raikkonen has referred to him as a control freak, someone who needs to exert control over everything and everyone around him.<br><br>Raikkonen dealt with it by simply not engaging, by fulfilling his obligations at the track but in no way assuming its values in his general conduct, particularly once away from the circuit.<br><br>He has repeatedly made a point of saying how much more relaxed an environment he finds Ferrari.<br><br>Of DennisÂ’ current drivers, neither Alonso nor Hamilton share RaikkonenÂ’s proclivity for wild party antics away from the track. Both have a close circle of friends and their lifestyles donÂ’t appear to have the same potential for embarrassment to McLaren-Mercedes and its sponsors.<br><br>Yet still Dennis has managed to alienate them. Through over-control. Through trying to impose too rigidly the values of the team onto the drivers, by trying to treat them as employees.<br><br>Drivers of this calibre, who have the warrior mentality and unyielding nature necessary to make true champions, will not be treated as employees. They are that only on paper.<br><br>In reality they are the stars of the show, the guys whose special talent differentiates them from most of the others. The public does not want to see them as expressions of a corporate set of values.<br><br>As part of this lone matador persona Alonso joined McLaren under the impression that the focus of the team would be around his winning the title.<br><br>The reality is that under DennisÂ’ control that would happen only if the other guy wasnÂ’t at the same level. If he was, then Dennis would ensure equality Â– by force of control.<br><br>Maybe Dennis believed Â– like most others Â– that with the rookie Hamilton alongside it wouldnÂ’t be an issue.<br><br>But HamiltonÂ’s stunning performances have made any promise Â– implicit or imagined on AlonsoÂ’s behalf Â– impossible for Dennis to keep. Alonso has of course reacted to this situation angrily.<br><br>One might have thought that Hamilton, who largely owes his career to DennisÂ’ backing of him since he was 13, would more readily be prepared to accept control over him.<br><br>But thatÂ’s to misunderstand the mental make-up of a top-line competitor. In there, in the zone, there is only desire.<br><br>At some stage he was always going to have to make the brutal transition from protÃ©gÃ© to hard-edged racer fighting his own corner against the very hand that fed him if necessary.<br><br>HeÂ’s not in the car to feel grateful, heÂ’s there to win.<br><br>Formula 1 should not be portrayed as a team sport. ItÂ’s about the gladiators who go out there wheel-to-wheel, fighting at 200mph. ItÂ’s not about team structures and philosophies and core brands and values. They are internal matters Â– housekeeping.<br><br>The drivers should be the stars of the show, should be allowed to compete as hard against team-mates as against drivers from rival teams.<br><br>David Coulthard has suggested each driver on a team has his own pit crew, his own pit box Â– and if they want to stop on the same lap, they should be able to Â– with the crews from the same team racing each other just as surely as their drivers.<br><br>And the team owners should stand back and let it happen Â– concentrate on providing each of their drivers with the best possible cars and then let them make their own arrangements.<br><br>But that would require relinquishing a degree of control. And Ron Dennis appears to be incapable of doing that.<br><br></div>
