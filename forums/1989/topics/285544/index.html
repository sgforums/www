            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.gpticketshop.com/images/maps_big/f1BRA.gif"><br><br>Circuit: Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace, Interlagos, Sau Paolo<br>Length: 4.309 km<br>Laps: 71<br>Race distance: 305.939 km<br>Lap record: 1:11.473 (J P Montoya, Williams-BMW, 2004)<br><br>We head into the final round of the 2007 Formula 1 season with the driver's championship still up for grabs:<br><br>- The leader, Lewis Hamilton of McLaren-Mercedes, is aiming to be the first driver to take the crown in his rookie season, having surpassed all expectations.<br><br>- After Hamilton's misfortunes in Shanghai, he leads teammate and defending champion Fernando Alonso by just 4 points. The fiery Spaniard is aiming for a record himself - the youngest driver to win three championships, and consecutive ones at that.<br><br>- The dark horse from Ferrari, Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, is third, 7 points behind Hamilton, after a late charge in the second half of the season that saw him take 4 wins and 4 other podium places. He had twice come close to winning the title with McLaren and will be eagar to vindicate himself.<br><br>But first, the venue where this showdown will take place. Interlagos is built in a natural amphitheatre. It used to be a high-speed terror, although no fatalities occured, until it was revised to its current layout in 1990. It is one of the few venues which retains a third-world feel - the facilities are dated, team crew occassionally encounter burglars and robbers and access to the circuit via road is poor.<br><br>The track itself is remarkable as it runs anti-clockwise (Istanbul is the only other such circuit on this year's calendar). This means that the majority of lateral G-Forces affect the opposite side of the body to what the drivers are accustomed to. This, coupled with the very bumpy surface, make the race a test of physical endurance for the drivers. You may spot some of them resting their heads against the side of the cockpit towards the end of the race.<br><br>The corners are generally fast and flowing, save for a tight infield section in Sector 2. The full-throttle runs to turns 1 and 4 create the best chances for overtaking during the race. Medium-high downforce settings are usually applied with a compromise between Sector 2 and the long pit stretch in mind.<br><br>Bridgestone will be taking soft and super-soft tyres to the event. 2-stop strategies are the way to go here. Rain is no stranger to the race although the last 3 were held in dry conditions. When it does come however, rivers of running water and big puddles can make the racing treacherous.<br><br>Going by the general form, it appears that the McLaren drivers will have the upper hand as the MP4-22 handles bumps, tight corners and kerbs very well. They also have a strong track record here although RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen's teammate Felipe Massa won last year's race for Ferrari. Expect the F1-2007 to be closer or faster in the other sectors however.<br><br>Both teams will be fired up for this race as they have not tasted title glory in serveral years - Ferrari last won it in 2004, McLaren in 1999! Rumours and speculation continue about Alonso's loyalties and what gamesmanship he and Hamilton might engage in - and gift their other rival the crown.<br><br>Mark this Monday morning affair in your diaries, calendars and organisers - the closest title fight in years will be worth losing sleep for!</div>

Hamilton, Honda driver Jenson Button and Super AguriÂ’s Takuma Sato were all found to have used two sets of wet tyres during FridayÂ’s first session in Brazil.<br><br>The imposition of any penalty is at the discretion of the FIA stewards. The fear for Hamilton is that if the stewards deem that he has been unfairly advantaged by the additional track time on wets, they may impose a penalty.<br><br>The three drivers concerned have been summoned to see the stewards individually following the afternoon practice session.</div>
