              <p>Track: Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace, Interlagos, Sao Paulo <br>Laps: 71<br>Race start: 0100 HRS (Monday, SIN)</p>
              <p>This is the final round of the 2008 world championship and what a venue it is! The spectators are always passionate and contribute massively to the atmosphere, and it is easy to overlook the cramped and dated facilities.</p>
              <p>The track features several tight corners but also 2 very long straights which allow for overtaking. Setting up the car is tricky as the surface is very bump and increasing ground clearance reduces the grip available. It is only the third circuit that is run anti-clockwise and this, together with the bumps and usually warm conditions, makes the race physically arduous for the drivers.</p>
              <p>This weekend, the home crowd will be behind local lad Felipe Massa, who has to finish on the podium in order to have any chance of winning the world championship. Lewis Hamilton, who is 7 points ahead, needs to finish only 5th to become the youngest ever world champion and the first of Afro-Caribbean descent.</p>
              <p>While there is nothing to choose between the Ferrari and the McLaren, Massa is an Interlagos specialist and his teammate Kimi Raikkonen has rediscovered his blindingly fast form. However, barring a repeat of those errors which cost Hamilton the title this time last year, he will be very difficult to keep off the podium.</p>
              <p>In the constructors' championship, things are far more settled. Ferrari lead McLaren by 11 points. In the event of a McLaren 1-2 finish the red cars need to score only 8 more points to clinch that title. BMW have an outside chance of taking second, with just 10 points to McLaren, but their recent form does not suggest that they can catch up.</p>
              <p>It's an early Monday morning race, so make plans if you want to see which driver takes his maiden title! Qualifying takes place at midnight on Sunday morning.</p>

              <p>This will also be the last race where grooved tyres will be used. Slick tyres will be used from 2009 onwards as part of a package of rule changes.</p>
              <p>David Coulthard also makes his final F1 appearance after 15 seasons. He holds the record for the most number of career points scored by a non-championship winning driver.</p>
              <p>Rain is expected to fall on all 3 days, with the heaviest thunderstorms predicted for Saturday.</p>

              <p>Sadly, Nick, this year's WDC will simply be the loser in a self-buttf***ing competition.  Kimi or Alonso might still take Ham the Sham out of play, but we'd still end up with a "is this what it's come down to?" WDC.  It really should have been Kubica.  Ah well, there's always next year - hell, let's see if Vettel can show these clowns how it's really done.</p>
              <p>One thing we can hope for is rain so that it won't be a total yawnfest.</p>

              <p>Felipe Massa has dismissed suggestions he could consider resorting to dirty tricks in a bid to beat Lewis Hamilton to the world championship in Brazil on Sunday.<br><br>The Ferrari driver, who heads into the title showdown seven points adrift of his McLaren rival, was responding to comments made by former team boss Eddie Jordan over the weekend where the Irishman said Hamilton may face an attack from Massa and should be prepared to retaliate.<br><br>Jordan’s comments, however, have not been received well by Massa, who insists he will concentrate on his own performance and has no intention of winning the world title by foul play.<br><br>"Playing dirty has never been part of my game," Massa is quoted as saying by the Press Association.<br><br>"I don't want anything to do with it. The only thing on my mind is winning the race. <br><br>“The rest does not depend on me.<br><br>"If I'm champion, it will be a dream come true. If not, that's okay. I will try again next year."<br><br>He also took a dig at the former owner of the Jordan team, saying: "Since he sold his team, Eddie Jordan has had nothing to do with F1 except for what he says in the press!"<br><br>Massa, involved in his first championship showdown, will attempt to overturn Hamilton’s points advantage in front of a passionate home Interlagos crowd desperate to see a Brazilian world champion for the first time since Ayrton Senna in 1991.<br><br>Hamilton has said the home crowd factor means that Massa goes into the decider under the most pressure.<br><br>But Massa has cranked up the mind games between the pair again by insisting he has nothing to lose, while Hamilton has the memories of his failed title bid last year hanging over him. <br><br>"Lewis will try and put pressure on me, but I have zero pressure because I have nothing to lose," he said.<br><br>"I have my people behind me, and all the pressure will be on him, especially when you think of what happened at this race last year.<br><br>"I now can't wait for this final Sunday of the season."</p>

              <p>You would think that would have learned from the ground-effects saga of the early eighties to avoid increasing emphasis on aerodynamic grip in favour of mechanical grip.  Balestre was a jerk, but he had some clue about racing unlike Mosley.</p>

              <p>Mario'd better pull his finger out.  After this year's travesty, the fans deserve a real champ.  Hell, right now I'd even love for Rossi to swap over and put Hammie back in his little suburban box.</p>
              <p>All up, I'm ready to call the year right now given that either result on Sunday will be a cruel joke on the fans.  Good for Kubica and Vettel - it sure as hell beats the "what race is Scum <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> going to win" snoozextravaganza of years past.  Even better that Renault came good towards the end and kept the big boys honest.  The sport's been mangled by the management since 1994, but this year's penalties have really taken the cake.  Ron needs to keep the Sham under control, Hekki and Nelson need to get the hell out and let real racers get on the grid - hell, they don't even have the damn decency to be pay drivers.  Nico and Quick Nick really need to get back on their game. </p>
              <p>Coulthard, we'll miss ya - who else is going to pass the champ on the outside while flipping him the bird, and then threaten to "kick three shades of shit" out of the former champ's flunky?</p>

              <p>To be fair to Kovalainen, he's had his fair share of bad luck, and it's certain that his machine is not as bulletproof as the Hamster's. Shades of Irvine's and Barrichello's years with Schuey? He kept Hamilton honest at the beginning of the year and then the developments after Spain just went away from him.</p>
              <p>Glock has improved over the course of the season so he earns marks over Vettel. Bourdais stuck it into the younger Seb before the STR3 came along (and has since closed the gap), and I hope he is retained for next season because he can definitely drive less aero-dependent cars fast.</p>
              <p>I hope Honda retain both drivers too...I can't see Alonso going there and they are unlikely to find anyone better (let's not mention Sato), not even among the rest of the current GP2 cohort with Di Grassi already at Renault.</p>

              <p>Could be.  Hell, given Ham's golden Boy status with Ron, i wouldn't at all be surprised if Alonso got done in the same way.</p>
              <p>Can't say I paid too much attention to Glock - we'll have to see how he improves next year.  As for Bourdais, well, he's just had the worst luck.</p>
              <p>Neither of the Honda drivers seem to have had much luck this year.  Hopefully Ross can turn things around, and yeah, I can't see Alonso <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> signing for Renault.</p>
