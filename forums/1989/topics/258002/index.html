            <div class='col-md body'>Will Ferrari be favouring Massa over RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen very soon?<br><br>The Finn set the fastest sector times in Australia and pushed his teammate in qualifying, and then had the race pretty much to himself.<br><br>But the tables were turned in the next few races. Granted that he couldn't do much about Hamilton at Sepang on a weakened engine, but after that he's been behind Massa and the McLarens on pace, and not even on the same row of the grid as the Brazilian.<br><br>And now with one poor race and one DNF, RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen's 10 points behind his teammate. Has he already blown his chances for the rest of the season?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>the return of the iceman?</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.itv-f1.com/ImageLibrary/43344_1.jpg"><br><br>Kimi Raikkonen warned his rivals that there is more to come from him and Ferrari after winning the French Grand Prix Â– his first victory since the season-opener at Melbourne in March.<br><br>The Finn beat his team-mate Felipe Massa to the flag at Magny-Cours after passing the Brazilian during their final pit stops.<br><br>And after admitting relief at finally breaking his run of poor results, Kimi promised to deliver more of the same in the coming races.<br><br>"It's nice," he said.<br><br>"I think we have had a bit of a hard time, but I kind of expected to have a bit difficult times.<br><br>"Okay people always think that you've lost it when you don't have a good result.<br><br>"But we have just worked hard and tried to get it right and I think that we can still improve. We are still not where we want to be but we are definitely happier with the car since the last test, and the last races even but we just couldn't get it together so.<br><br>"I think we have the basis to have a good speed in the car now so I hope we can keep this up in the next races.<br><br>Raikkonen said that making a good getaway, a weak point for him this season, was a vital factor in his win on Sunday.<br><br>"Finally the start worked for me and it helped a lot," he said.<br><br>"I think the car was good all the time but not exactly perfect, but I was very happy with the car.<br><br>"I just tried to push and keep up with Felipe because I knew I was going to stop a bit later. Just before the first stop I had a quite a bit of traffic, but in the second stop we managed to get ahead of him.<br><br>"It was a good day for me and for the team."<br><br>Raikkonen added that while had pushed hard in the laps between Massa's stop and his own he had struggled to pace the Brazilian in the middle stint of the race.<br><br>"We needed to have a good run in to the second stop," he said.<br><br>"I was a bit further away than I really wanted to be from him, but that's racing. I couldn't really stay close enough. But it worked out perfectly in the end so I couldn't ask for more.<br><br>"Of course you would rather start from the front, it makes your life easier, but we knew we should be okay in the race.<br><br>"It all depended on what happened at the start and we had a very good start this time."</div>
