              <p>In breaking news from the world of Formula 1 ,</p>
              <p>The Red Bull Racing team has reportedly blamed Singapore's MRT system as the likely culprit for Mark Webber's retirement in last Sunday's Night Race.</p>
              <p>The Australian, was on course for a podium finish when his car's gearbox tried to select 2 gears at at the very same time and it broke on lap 30.</p>
              <p>He went in for a pitstop immediately and called it quits after being told of the spoilt gearbox.</p>
              <p>Red Bull's Team boss Christian Horner told Britain's Autosport magazine yesterday, that it appeared a sudden electrical surge at turn 13 was responsible for the mechanical failure.</p>
              <p>Turn 13 is the Fullerton Hotel hairpin which leads onto the Esplanade Bridge.</p>
              <p>And Horner believes that static electricity from an MRT train which was passing beneath the track, was somehow responsible for the gearbox failure.</p>
              <p>He also went on to suggest that the electricity surge was probably the same reason responsible in Sebastien Bourdais's crash during Friday's practice session, at the very same corner.</p>
              <p>Speaking exclusively to 938LIVE, Red Bull Head of Communications Eric Silbermann said they team is as certain as can be that the the breakdown was caused by static electricity from the MRT system.</p>
              <p>However, he stressed that the team is regarding it as another racing incident and will not make too much of it.</p>
              <p>Silbermann also congratulated Singapore for the successful staging of Formula 1's first night race and said the team is looking forward to the next edition.</p>

              <p>If that's the case, how come other team's not affected? It's weird how they use the word "Somehow".... they're a good team.... but if red bull have problem, shouldn't the STR have similar problems? or they use completely diff gearbox?</p>
