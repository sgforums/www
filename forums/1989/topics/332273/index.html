              <p class="first"> </p>
              <p class="first">MILAN, Sept 30 - Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo
              has poured scorn on Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, saying the "circus"
              track and the use of the safety car had been humiliating for Formula
              One.</p>
              <p>Formula
              One's first night race drew rave reviews from participants and
              onlookers, including the sport's delighted supremo Bernie Ecclestone,
              but was one to forget for the Italian team.</p>
              <p>Brazilian title
              contender Felipe Massa had his race ruined by a bungled pit stop while
              faltering world champion Kimi Raikkonen crashed near the end.</p>
              <p>"When
              we race on tracks which should be used for the circus, anything can
              happen including the spectacle of the Safety Car," Montezemolo was
              quoted as saying in Tuesday's Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper.</p>
              <p>"All this is humiliating for F1 and it is an aspect I want to talk about with the other teams in the next few weeks."</p>
              <p>Singapore
              saw two safety car interventions, the first of which turned the race
              upside down and contributed to Spaniard Fernando Alonso's unexpected
              victory for Renault.</p>
              <p>Montezemolo, appointed this month as the
              first chairman of the Formula One Teams Association, said before the
              race that street circuits and the lack of overtaking opportunities were
              not the right way forward for the sport.</p>
              <p>Ferrari's failure to
              score any points in Singapore meant McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, third
              behind winner Fernando Alonso, extended his championship lead over
              Massa to seven points with three races left.</p>
              <p>Finn Raikkonen is out of contention but Montezemolo still sounded confident.</p>
              <p>"We
              have the best Ferrari, Massa is the best. I expect... Raikkonen to show
              he is world champion in the remaining races, to help Massa, to race for
              the good of the team and to finish in front of the McLarens," he said.</p>
              <p>The
              team president also backed the mechanics who gave Massa the green light
              during a pit stop despite the fuel hose still being attached to the car
              as he sped away.</p>
              <p>"We have extraordinary mechanics who in other
              occasions have swung results our way. We must stay close to each other
              because Ferrari are always world champions and are still in the running
              to win," Montezemolo added.</p>

              <p>Only the chicanes were really narrow, wide enough for just 1 car, but it is wider and less sinuous. That was what Herr Rampf said to me, Jez, and the European GP this year was a procession.</p>
              <p>Generally overtaking is already a difficult task in F1 these days, with the current reliance on aerodynamic grip. Hungary is usually a yawnfest but it happens at other purpose-built tracks too, so that renders LDM's comments invalid.</p>

              according to what Willy Rampf told me. Let's see what effect next
              year's regulations will have, since we are told that drivers may be
              able to follow each other more closely and take different racing
              lines.</p>

              <p><br>yea, during the qualifiers they mentioned the narrowest part of the entire track is at the bridge (which one i do not know) at around 8metres... while Monaco's widest part is only 8metres.</p>

              On the point of circus ? Well it is there was lion, elephants and of course - the red clowns - Ferrari !!! 
              
              Sound funny when the Chief clown is complaining - when all the jokes is done by them.
              
              Cannot overtake ? How did the current 1st place guy get from 15th to 1st ? of course he overtook .... there has been lots of overtaking action , just because Ferrari does not have the balls to over take, that does not mean other will not !!!  maybe the horse logo need to change to a bull one , then they have some balls !!!
