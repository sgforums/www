            <div class='col-md body'>from f1.racing-live.com,<br><br>Momentum seems to be building for a Singapore Grand Prix with Bernie Ecclestone seemingly in favour of the concept while the Singapore Tourist Board, working with the Singapore Sports Council, is also keen to look at the costs and benefits of a Grand Prix.<br><br>"As part of developing our portfolio of events, we have so far been studying motor sports events as well," the Today newspaper reports Oliver Chong of the Singapore Tourism Board as saying. Â“Towards this end, we evaluate their tourism appeal and contribution, the economic viability, against the cost of hosting the events. We have not had any direct discussions with Mr Ecclestone on the race, but we are open to discussions on the possibility of having F1 in Singapore."<br><br>He warned however that the costs of hosting an event would have to be evaluated carefully. With cots one issue, another issue is the relatively close proximity of Malaysia's Sepang circuit.<br><br>Sepang Boss Mokhzani Tun Dr Mahathir warned that if Singapore were to host a race, it would probably be back-to-back with Malaysia and the two events would effectively ' cannibalise ' each other.<br><br>"As it is, the Malaysian Grand Prix is dependent on a small regional market and if there is another race 300km away in Singapore, we will definitely cannibalise on each other because we are going to attract the same spectators."<br><br>Singapore Motor Sports Association President Matthew Lee, perhaps unsurprisingly, is very much in favour of a home race. Â“ItÂ’s not a question of Â‘should we have F1 hereÂ’, but rather. Â‘when are we going to host it?Â’Â”</div>

We're going through the internal evaluation, then we make a decision."</span></strong><br><br>WHAT?!?!?! what what what?! what is this? when bernie says u CALL HIM to start talks, u jolly well CALL HIM, u don't meet with someone else, whoever "them" is. Erf. This is the best chance we ever gonna get to make good. It'd be utterly stupid if the ego and pride of our govt in thinking themselves more important than they are to lose it to other people!<br><br></div>
