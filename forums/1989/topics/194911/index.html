            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Engine freeze will happen says Max</strong><br><br>Formula 1Â’s bosses, FIA president Max Mosley and F1 CEO Bernie Ecclestone, have restated their desire to push through rules governing engine homologation for 2008, and are urging manufacturers to come on board and submit their engine blueprints as soon as possible.<br><br>The rules for the 2008 world championship, which 12 teams have now signed up to, require engine manufacturers to submit their engine designs for two years' time by the end of this June Â– when the sporting regulations must be ratified.<br><br>The teams would then be required to freeze development on these engines until the end of 2010.<br><br>So far only Renault, Ferrari and Cosworth are believed to support the concept, while others have been critical of the plan.<br><br>However Mosley insists that in the interests of maintaining a level playing field, the engines must be homologated as soon as possible.<br><br>Â“At the moment they [engines] are all on more or less the same level,Â” he said in an interview with Auto Motor und Sport published by the FIA on Wednesday.<br><br>Â“Therefore we have to freeze them as quickly as possible.<br><br>Â“If we give them time, than the people with a lot of money will have the opportunity to pull out a bit of a lead."<br><br>The F1 chiefs have also played down fears that the proposal will lock teams whose engines are less competitive into an unfair disadvantage.<br><br>When asked if the engine freeze was the equivalent of a football team being tied to the same players for three years, Mosley said: Â“ItÂ’s more like saying that the players have to wear the same type of boots for three years.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think the public is interested in the development of football boot technology. TheyÂ’re more interested in goals."<br><br>Ecclestone said: Â“They can change their staff if they want to.<br><br>He added: "IÂ‘m becoming a Ron Dennis supporter. Ron always wants to have a level playing field.<br><br>"What Max wants to create is exactly that."</div>
