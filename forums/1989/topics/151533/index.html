            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, it's not just in the cars - it's also in having an ironclad contract where your team mate has to give way to you.<br><br>Schumacher has only been able to do what he's done by the combination of the car, team orders and outright cheating.  In 1994, he won his first championship by knocking Damon Hill off the track, and he tried doing the same thing to Jacques Villeneuve in 1997.  In Austria '02 and '03, he had Barrichello pull over so that he could win and take points.<br><br>Look at the really close battles in the championship, and you'll see drivers within a dominant team fighting it out with no punches pulled.  Examples are Mansell/Piquet (1987), the classic Prost/Senna battles (1988-1990).  MS, on the other hand, has had Ferrari make Eddie Irvine and Rubens Barrichello bend over and take it from him.<br><br>On top of that, Ferrari disadvantaged all of the other Bridgestone runners by making an exclusive arrangement to develop the tyres specifically around their cars, and that's why so many other teams got fed up and moved over to Michelin.  This year's been great, because that monopoly has come back and bitten Ferrari and Bridgestone in the ass.  Now Luca di Montezemelo has come out and whinged like a spanked b!tch about the rules, but he was surprisingly quiet when the rules served his purposes.<br><br>On top of that, there really hasn't been much competition for him.  Everybody on the grid is scared of his "chop", but back when he started, guys like Senna used to drive around it like nothing happened.<br><br>What it comes down to is this:  MS is by no means a bad driver, but it's a crying shame that he's a 7-time world champion.  Between the rules, Ferrari's dominance, team orders, a lack of great drivers of the likes of Senna, Prost and Mansell, plus plain cheating, lies his 7 championships.  If he played it the way Fangio or Senna did, I'd say he'd be a 3-time WDC at best.</div>

He does, skills-wise. maybe not better than Senna but certainly amongst the Prost or Piquet level. But... his sportsmanship leaves something to be desired. He's no gent, no doubt.<br><br>He's actually 3rd in the standings now which I can't even begin to imagine how that i possible.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ferrari, McLaren look ahead</strong><br><br>Oct 18, 2005<br>The Straits Times<br><br>SHANGHAI - AS RENAULT celebrate their first Formula One constructors' title, rivals Ferrari and McLaren remain defiant and confident they will return stronger and better.<br><br>Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher insists Ferrari have what it takes to re-establish themselves as the leading team next season.<br><br>Ferrari won 15 of the 18 races last year en route to the German's seventh driver's title. But McLaren and Renault were the dominant force this season with Fernando Alonso finishing 71 points ahead of his predecessor.<br><br>Schumacher told his website: 'When you consider that we dominated last season and other teams managed to leap ahead of us this year, then there is no reason to believe we cannot do the same and be the best in 2006.<br><br>'We will work hard in the winter to achieve our target. This team is a class outfit and nothing has changed in that respect. We have a new challenge now and everyone, especially me, is looking forward to it.'<br><br>He is contracted at Ferrari for just one more season but has given no indication of wanting to retire.<br><br>McLaren boss Ron Dennis was less disappointed than Schumacher regarding the concluded season.<br><br>'We're not going to go out of this paddock... with our chins on our feet,' he said. 'We've done a pretty good job, we deserve the criticism that we level at ourselves, but we are hardly dismal failures.'<br><br>McLaren ended the season with 10 wins, two more than Renault, but otherwise empty-handed.<br><br>'We can't go away feeling that we've failed massively because if you come to McLaren and you see our corporate overview, the vision statement for McLaren Racing is to compete in and win every grand prix,' Dennis said.<br><br>'It doesn't say win world championships. It says enter every world championship race and win it.<br><br>'We recognise the importance of world championships and constructors' titles but we can hardly go away from here saying that we've failed miserably,' he added.<br><br>McLaren and Renault were in a class of their own all year.<br><br>They won every race except the six-car US Grand Prix won by Ferrari after the Michelin-equipped teams withdrew over tyre-safety concerns.<br><br>There was no doubt that McLaren had the faster car for much of the championship. But they paid the price for a lack of reliability and the other teams' inability to take points away from Renault.<br><br>Dennis said his team should also have been more aggressive with their new car early in the season, when Alonso built up his comfortable points cushion.<br><br>'We were too cautious in the first four grands prix,' he said.<br><br>'With the benefit of hindsight, we could have been more aggressive in the introduction of developments both on the car and engine that came in Spain.'<br><br>Dennis insisted that 'overall the performance of our cars has been good'. -- REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE<br></div>
