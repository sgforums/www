            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Monaco GP - FIA probe McLaren's win<br><br>Monaco GP - Formula One's governing body, FIA, is launching an investigation into Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton's 1-2 for McLaren in the Monaco Grand Prix.</strong><br><br>The two drivers dominated Sunday's grand prix without ever fighting each other for the lead with McLaren strongly denying that the team had broken the rules by ordering Hamilton not to challenge Alonso.<br><br>In a statement F1's ruling authority confirmed: "The FIA has launched an investigation into incidents involving the McLaren Mercedes team at the 2007 Monaco Grand Prix in light of a possible breach of the International Sporting Code.<br><br>"The relevant evidence is under review and a further announcement will be made in due course."<br><br>McLaren team chief Ron Dennis insisted that McLaren did not favour defending world champion Alonso over Hamilton, the British rookie who has taken the sport by storm posting here his fourth successive second place.<br><br>Dennis faced a barrage of questions on McLaren's strategy especially in light of the fact that Alonso had begun the race around the streets of Monte Carlo in a car carrying five laps less fuel than Hamilton.<br><br>This meant that Alonso was not only in a lighter car for qualifying on Saturday, but also in a lighter, faster car for the first part of the race.<br><br>Hamilton accepted this with a long face when he said: "I am in car number two so I am the number two driver."<br><br>Dennis said he understood Hamilton's disappointment, but pointed out that he would have reacted very differently if the team strategy had played into his hands.<br><br>"I think he's understandably disappointed and frustrated," said Dennis.<br><br>"He would not have been frustrated or disappointed if a Safety Car had been deployed and he won the race.<br><br>"Time will tell, wont it? We do not favour anybody. There will be times and places when they are free to race, but this isn't one of them.<br><br>"Everybody in the pit-lane and the media would be saying, 'what an idiot the team principal from McLaren is for allowing his cars to compete, when one of them is in the barrier."<br><br>Dennis added that his decisions were not tantamount to team orders, which are banned in Formula One, but formed instead a team strategy to win the race.<br><br>"Team orders is what you bring to bear to manipulate a Grand Prix.<br><br>"And we do not, and have not, manipulated Grands Prix.<br><br>Alonso leads the drivers' title race on 38 points, the same number as Hamilton, but has the edge as he has won two races this season.<br><br>AFP</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>JYS: Nothing wrong with McLaren actions.</strong><br><br>Sir Jackie Stewart says he feels McLaren did nothing wrong in Monte Carlo after the FIA announced it was launching an investigation of the Monaco Grand Prix.<br><br>The FIA announced on Monday that it was investigating the 1-2 finish secured by Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton 'in light of a possible breach of the International Sporting Code' - with the team being accused on employing team orders to prevent its drivers fighting for position during the race.<br><br>However, Stewart said he didn't see anything wrong with what had happened on the streets of Monte Carlo and told BBC Radio Five Live that team boss Ron Dennis had 'done the wise thing' in ensuring his drivers secured the best result possible.<br><br>"I saw nothing wrong with what occurred," JYS said. "He [Alonso] made a very good start, he took a lead that allowed him to have a good clear bit of air behind him.<br><br>"He set the fastest lap, and he won the race. It was fairly straightforward."<br><br>Team orders have been banned in Formula 1 since the 2002 season, when Ferrari were accused of making a mockery of the sport during the Austrian Grand Prix after Rubens Barrichello slowed on the line to hand victory to Michael Schumacher.<br><br>However, Stewart insisted that two incidents weren't comparable.<br><br>"The Schumacher-Barrichello case was blatant," he said. "He reduced his speed by maybe 30 or 40mph to have Schumacher pass him before the finishing line. It was a pretty blatant thing, it wasn't enjoyed by the crowd, it wasn't enjoyed by the media.<br><br>"But it's a very difficult thing to start telling team owners that if you are running first and second that you should keep driving your drivers to the absolute limit of their ability.<br><br>"I think it was a great result for Lewis Hamilton to finish second in the Monaco Grand Prix and get another podium finish. What if he had tried a little bit too hard in these last laps in Monaco and slid off the race track, hit a barrier and taken the McLaren out of the race? Valuable world championship points would have been lost by the team."<br><br>Alonso and Hamilton currently share top spot in the championship standings after five races of the season - although Alonso's two victories this season mean he has the edge of his rookie team-mate.</div>
