              <p>In case you aren't aware, it's the name given to the annual period when driver transfers and contract extensions are made and all kinds of rumours make the rounds.</p>
              <p>Button is not confirmed at Brawn yet because financial negotiations are far from settled. He wants far more than what the team are offering him after he took a massive pay cut to help them at the start of the season.</p>

              <p>The pieces are slowly falling into place:</p>
              <p><strong>Robert Kubica will replace Ferrari-bound Fernando Alonso at Renault for next season, the Enstone-based team confirmed on Wednesday.</strong><br><br>The 24-year-old will make the switch from BMW Sauber more than three years on from making his Formula 1 debut with the team, Kubica having unexpectedly come on to the driver market in late July after BMW announced it was quitting the sport at the end of the season. <br><br>Announcing the signing of the highly-rated Pole, acting Renault team principal Bob Bell said the outfit had been keeping tabs on his progress since he burst onto the F1 scene in mid-2006 – adding that he expected Kubica to play an integral part in Renault’s bid to return to the front of the sport.<br><br>“We are very excited to have signed Robert with the Renault F1 Team starting next season,” Bell said in a statement. <br><br>“Ever since Robert made his Grand Prix debut in 2006, he has been on our radar as one of the most naturally talented drivers of his generation and he has delivered on that promise so it’s great to have secured him in one of our cars next season. <br><br>“Renault has high ambitions and hopes for the future of the team and we feel that Robert can play a big role in fulfilling them.” <br><br>Kubica said he was pleased to be renewing his relationship with the French manufacturer having won its junior World Series in 2005 and then carried out his F1 test with the carmaker’s F1 outfit later that year.<br><br>The Pole, who finished third in last year’s world championship after scoring his maiden F1 win, is already setting his sights on a first sustained championship push next season.<br><br>“I am very happy I will be joining Renault in the 2010 season,” Kubica said.<br><br>“I feel I have a special connection with this team because in 2005 I won the World Series by Renault.<br> <br>“This gave me the chance to test with the team in Barcelona, which led to my debut in Formula 1.<br><br>“I share with Renault a strong winning mentality and feel comfortable with their friendly and open attitude. <br><br>“I’m highly motivated and optimistic that together we can be at the front of the grid next year and hopefully fighting for the world title.”<br><br>The length of Kubica’s contract was not revealed in Renault’s press statement, although it hinted the relationship would last for more than a single campaign by saying the Pole would drive for the team “from the 2010 season onwards”.<br><br><strong>Renault has yet to decide on its new lead driver's team-mate for 2010, with its current number two Romain Grosjean, Heikki Kovalainen and Timo Glock all drivers linked with the seat. </strong></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80197">Button becomes Hamilton's teammate</a></p>
              <p><strong>Jenson Button will move to McLaren-Mercedes next season to join compatriot and fellow world champion Lewis Hamilton, the team has confirmed</strong>.<br><br>The announcement of a multi-year deal between Button and McLaren follows weeks of feverish speculation about the champion's future, which was heightened when he paid a visit to the McLaren factory last Friday.<br><br>Although Button was initially expected to remain with the Brawn team that took him to the 2009 title, <strong>talks with Ross Brawn's squad reached an impasse over the issue of Button's salary. The Briton had taken a pay cut to help the team when Honda's exit left it in a delicate financial position</strong>, but now sought a wage increase having clinched the championship - and given that Brawn's finances would become more healthy following its takeover by Mercedes-Benz.<br><br>"It's always a difficult decision to leave a team when you've been there for so long," said Button. "But life is all about challenges - and, most important of all, it's about challenging yourself.<br><br>"So, although I won the world championship with Brawn GP last year, and I'll never forget that, I was always adamant that I wanted to continue to set myself fresh challenges. So that's why I've decided to join Vodafone McLaren Mercedes. <br><br>"You can't help but be affected by this team's phenomenal history. McLaren is one of the greats of world sport, and its achievements and list of past champions read like a Who's Who of Formula 1 - Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna, Mika Hakkinen and of course my new team-mate Lewis Hamilton. I've followed the McLaren team ever since I was a small boy, and it feels unbelievable to finally be a part of it."<br><br><strong>McLaren had originally lined up Kimi Raikkonen to fill its second seat, but these talks also broke down during pay discussions</strong>, leading to Raikkonen's decision to take a year off from Formula 1 next year, and leaving the way clear for Button to take the vacant McLaren drive as he was unable to agree a suitable deal with Brawn and Mercedes.<br><br><strong>Button's move ends a seven year relationship with his previous team, which he joined when it was still known as BAR in 2003, and stayed with through its difficult seasons under Honda ownership prior to this year's fairytale success.</strong><br><br>He said he had been deeply impressed by McLaren since beginning talks with the squad.<br><br>"When I visited the McLaren Technology Centre earlier this month, it wasn't simply the technical resources and the incredible standards of excellence that impressed me," Button said. "No, I was equally struck by the ambition, the motivation and the winning spirit that flow through everybody there. And then there's the team's epic history: put it this way, the trophy cabinets seem to stretch for miles.<br><br>"From a personal point of view, it's also a great pleasure to be joining a fellow British world champion. Lewis has achieved an incredible level of success in a very short period of time, and he's a wonderfully gifted driver who has earned the respect of every Formula 1 driver. I'm sure there's plenty that we can learn from each other, and I'm really looking forward to using our combined knowledge to push the team forward."<br><strong><br>With Button no longer in the frame, Nico Rosberg is expected to be announced as Mercedes' lead driver for its new works F1 assault with the erstwhile Brawn team, with Nick Heidfeld linked to the second seat.</strong><br><br>Button replaces Heikki Kovalainen at McLaren. The Finn took only one win during his two seasons as Hamilton's team-mate, and struggled for race pace this season despite some strong qualifying performances.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80187">Raikkonen takes a year off</a></p>
              <p><strong>Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen will take a sabbatical from Formula 1 next year, his manager has revealed, following the collapse of talks with McLaren about a deal for 2010.</strong><br><br>Raikkonen said last month that, in the wake of being released from his Ferrari contract, his only option to remain in F1 was with McLaren - because he wanted to be guaranteed a top-line grand prix car.<br><br>However, amid increasing speculation that Jenson Button is on his way to the British team, Raikkonen's manager Steve Robertson revealed on Tuesday night that discussions with McLaren had come to an end.<br><br><strong>"The options in F1 were with McLaren next season or not at all," Robertson was quoted as saying by respected Finnish newspaper Turun Sanomat, which has close links with the Raikkonen camp. "Kimi and McLaren were unable to reach an agreement, so he will not drive at the F1 level - at least not next year.</strong><br><br>"A gap year means nothing for Kimi. He is more interested in fighting for wins and the world championship. F1 will miss Kimi. He worked hard over the summer - doing things in a Ferrari that only the best drivers are capable of."<br><br>AUTOSPORT understands that there were several stumbling blocks to a deal being completed with McLaren prior to the team finding out that Button was available and interested.<br><br><strong>As well as a difference of opinion about wages, Raikkonen and McLaren were believed to not be in agreement about the number of sponsorship appearance days he should do, or about how free he was to do rallies.</strong><br><br>With Raikkonen only interested in returning to F1 in a race-winning car, his best option for 2011 would appear to lie with Red Bull Racing - which has a theoretical vacancy for 2011 with Mark Webber currently only contracted until the end of next year.<br><br>Although it is not clear what Raikkonen will do next year, it is possible that he will focus his efforts on the World Rally Championship - while he sorts out an F1 return. Red Bull could be involved in his rally plans too.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Schumacher will return to Formula 1 in 2010, after Mercedes GP confirmed on Wednesday that the seven-time world champion is joining its team next year.<br><br></strong>The German, who will turn 41 in January, has been linked with the outfit ever since Mercedes-Benz took over Brawn GP. <strong>He finally concluded a three-year deal to make a sensational F1 return on Tuesday evening.</strong><br><br>"The motivation I think is pretty straightforward," Schumacher said. "The call I got from Ross at the end of November concerning the chance to go racing, Mercedes being involved, I felt great.<br><br>"I never left the race track. I was tired of F1 by the end of 2006, but in three years of absence I got back all the energy that I am feeling right now. I played around with motorbikes and I feel ready for some serious stuff now."<br><br>Schumacher originally retired from F1 at the end of 2006, and he had appeared fully content to be away from the pressures and strains of racing in motor sport's top category.<br><br>He maintained links with F1 through an ambassadorial role with Ferrari, and his on-track activities revolved around outings in a kart and a move to motorcycle racing.<br><br>However, last season Schumacher agreed to a comeback as a temporary stand-in for the injured Felipe Massa at Ferrari. Despite training hard for the return, however, Schumacher's plans had to be called off due to a neck injury that he had sustained in a motorcycle crash earlier this year.<br><br>"It is obviously a topic that I understand is questioned, and I want to understand," Schumacher said when asked about his neck. "<strong>Before I gave a final okay I made sure that I was sure myself, and I can say 100 per cent the neck is no further issue.</strong><br><br>"Unfortunately it was too close to the accident in the summer when I tried for Ferrari, but the time now is enough to have healed completely. I can do everything I used to do, and no problem."<br><br>The events of the summer appeared to have rekindled his enthusiasm for F1 and when Brawn GP failed to conclude a deal with world champion Jenson Button for 2010, Schumacher was instantly installed as the favourite to replace him.<br><br>The deal could not be concluded until Schumacher's neck was given the all-clear by doctors but once that happened, talks advanced quickly to seal the deal.<br><br>Although he will be the oldest driver on the grid when the season kicks off in Bahrain, Schumacher said on Wednesday that he is not coming back simply to have fun.<br><strong><br>On the back of Brawn GP having captured both world titles in 2009 prior to its takeover by Mercedes-Benz, Schumacher has his sights set on adding more wins and championships to his tally.</strong><br><br>"It [Mercedes GP] is a team that has won both championships this year," he said. "With Mercedes Benz as a strong partner, our aim can only be to fight for the championship. <br><br>"There will be strong competition, as we have seen, but I am thrilled to be back in this one."<br>Schumacher's move to Mercedes GP marks a reunion between himself and the German car maker that helped push him into F1.<br><strong><br>He raced for Mercedes-Benz as part of its junior driver programme, competing in world sportscar events during 1990 and 1991.</strong><br><br>Schumacher's decision means that Mercedes GP will field an all-German driver line-up in 2010, having already confirmed several weeks ago that Nico Rosberg will race for it.</p>
