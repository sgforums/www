            <div class='col-md body'>Throughout F1's history there have been some great drivers but there has arguably been none as successful as super Michael Schumacher. So, will he ever be replaced as F1's number 1? Its probably hard to see but we have some great drivers about at the moment. Which is probably part of the problem. Alonso looks very strong but there are many drivers hot on his heels.<br><br>Will Schumacher ever be replaced? Well, you can never replace him but will there ever be a driver as dominant as he was? Probably. But i have the feeling it won't be for a while... Who has come close to him and who has the potential to be the next F1 Super-Power?<br><br><strong>Copied of another forum</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I concur with bear.  Rather than WDCs, seven events that stand out about Scummaker are:<br><br>Silverstone 1994 Â– banned for two races after ignoring stop-go penalty for overtaking Hill on the warm-up lap<br><br>Adelaide 1994 Â– bumped Hill off the track in the season closer to take the WDC<br><br>Spa 1995 Â– chopping back and forth across the track, leading to FIAÂ’s implementation of the one-move rule.<br><br>Jerez 1997 Â– tried to bump Villeneuve off the track<br><br>Austria 2001 Â– forced Barrichello to let him through on the last lap<br><br>Austria 2002 Â– forced Barrichello to let him through on the last lap Â– AGAIN<br><br>Monaco 2006 Â– parked car across the track to halt qualifying session when it looked like Alonso was going to take pole from him<br><br>Will there ever be another Schumacher?

            <div class='col-md body'>The Austria-gate incidents were probably down to team orders rather than Schumacher's making, but I can name not 2, but 3 other events to take their place:<br><br>1) USA 2002: Tried to create a photo finish after dominating the race, and ended up letting Barrichello through. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2) Austria 2002: Forced Barrichello to take the top step of the podium and broke protocol. The team orders rule hadn't yet been introduced and Ferrari were punished for this instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>3) Belgium 1998: Crashed into Coulthard while trying to lap him in wet weather.
