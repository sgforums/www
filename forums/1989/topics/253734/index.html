The technical nature calls for a high downforce set-up, wind direction changes are particularly pronouced and the cars with the best aerodynamic efficiency excel here.<br><br>It is not unusual to find team-mates much more evenly matched here. Overtaking is difficult, but not impossible, though the addition of a chicane prior to the last corner may alter the situation this year. The races seldom produced much excitement, until Fernando Alonso's recent rise to stardom. Being the home hero and a Catalan too, expect supporters turn up in droves on raceday.<br><br>Michael Schumacher scored his maiden Ferrari victory here in 1996 in atrocious conditions. He also took victory in 2001 after Mika HÃ¤kkinen's McLaren expried on the last lap of the race, ending the latter's run of victories at the track since 1998.<br><br>Alonso is the defending winner of this race and is tied for the lead of this year's championship with Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen and Lewis Hamilton. David Coulthard set the unofficial lap record for the circuit's new layout (1:21.066) during testing last week.</div>

Try as he certainly did, the world champion couldn't quite match that on his final flier.<br><br>Robert Kubica took fifth on the grid for BMW Sauber, while qualifying specialist Jarno Trulli demoted the other F1.07 of Nick Heidfeld to seventh.<br><br>Heikki Kovalainen, David Coulthard and Giancarlo Fisichella rounded out the top 10.</div>
