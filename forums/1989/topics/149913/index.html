Schumacher's contract at Ferrari expires after the 2006 season.<br><br>"I'm happy in this team," said Schumacher, 36, who has won seven world titles. "I don't want to back out now at a point where we're not doing so well. I can't imagine driving for another team.<br><br>"I haven't yet signed for anything for beyond 2006. But I'll do it as soon as the right moment for me comes. The decision will be made in due time.<br><br>"I don't have any idea when I'll retire," he said. "But I don't think that I've got a lot of years ahead of me."<br><br>Bild reported on Thursday that Raikkonen, who won last weekend's Turkish Grand Prix for McLaren, had signed an advance contract with Ferrari. Raikkonen has won five races this season and said he had no intention of leaving McLaren.<br><br>Schumacher will be joined at Ferrari by Brazilian Felipe Massa next season after Rubens Barrichello departs to BAR. Ferrari have suffered a disappointing season in 2005.<br></div>

The new deal will see the team and Cosworth collaborating not just on the engine, but on the forthcoming FW28Â’s entire drivetrain package, including transmission, electronics, software and installation architecture.<br><br>Williams used CosworthÂ’s legendary DFV V8 - still the most the successful engine in Formula One history - back in the 1970s and Â‘80s and the Northamptonshire-based company is already well advanced in the development of its 2006 unit, which has routinely exceeded 20,000 rpm during dyno testing.<br><br>"Cosworth is a leading global authority on V8 engine technology,Â” said team boss Frank Williams. Â“Next year is a brand new start for all concerned given 16 years of V10 engines. Some teams and manufacturers have absolutely no experience of V8s while others enjoy only limited experience. Cosworth, however, have excelled both historically, as well as in contemporary V8-powered international motorsport. The evidence of Cosworth's V8 progress we have seen so far validates completely the expectation we have of enjoying a class-leading package given next season's engine rule changes."<br><br>Tim Routsis, Cosworth's CEO commented: "Our experience and track record with V8 engines is unrivalled and we are naturally delighted to be alongside one of the most uncompromising and pure-spirited teams in Formula One. We have been working on the development of next year's V8 since April 2004 and right from the onset, our performance targets have been set very aggressively. We are confident that our blue-chip partnership with WilliamsF1 can augment the record of winning the championship every decade since the 1960s. We have developed the 2006 Cosworth V8-CA engine with nothing but front-running success in mind for both the near and long-term. The involvement of Cosworth's sister company, Pi, has been instrumental in achieving this outcome."<br><br>Patrick Head, WilliamsÂ’ Director of Engineering, added: "Williams has made this partnership decision purely on technical merit. Among the range of options we considered, Cosworth are very well advanced with existing development and are committed to taking the potential of this collaboration further. Our engineers have already reflected on the very productive and highly motivated nature of the relationship between our two organisations. We speak the same racing language and both have something to prove next year and there can be no greater motivation to succeed."<br><br>Cosworth currently power the Minardi and Red Bull teams, with the latter due to switch to Ferrari customer engines in 2006.</div>
