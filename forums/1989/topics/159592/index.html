            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Qualifying format</strong><br>All cars are permitted on the track. At the end of the first 15-minute period the slowest five cars can take no further part in qualifying. These cars will make up the last five grid positions in the order of their times, the fastest occupying 16th position.<br><br>The times for the fifteen remaining cars are reset for the next session. At the end of the second 15-minute period the slowest five cars can take no further part in qualifying. These cars will make up the grid in positions eleven to fifteen in the order of their times, the fastest occupying 11th position.<br><br>The times for the ten remaining cars will be reset for the next session. For the final period, lasting 20 minutes, the cars will be arranged on the grid in positions one to ten in the order of their times, the fastest occupying pole position.<br>Cars will be under parc ferme conditions from the time they enter the track for the first time during qualifying until the start of the race. Changing tyres and adding fuel will no longer be part of the parc ferme regulations.<br><br>Fuel may be added to cars at any time during the first 40 minutes of qualifying and any car eliminated during the first two periods may then be refuelled at any time until the pit lane opens for the race. Teams will be required to fill cars taking part in the final 20-minute period with the amount of fuel with which they intend to start the race. Any fuel used during the 20-minute period may be replaced before the start of the race.<br><br>If 22 cars are eligible to take part in the Event, six cars will drop out after each of the fifteen minute periods leaving ten for the final 20 minutes. If twenty four cars are eligible to take part in the Event, six cars will drop out after each of the fifteen minute periods leaving twelve for the final 20 minutes.<br><br></div>

Seems that the last 20 minutes of qualifying is a mini race for pole!!! Or is the article just saying the last 10 position will be determined in the last 20 minutes?<br><br>Got the article from F1-Live.com and no interpretion was given there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for easy understanding-<br><br><blockquote><br>Following approval from the FIA World Motor Sport Council on the Wednesday, the one-hour qualifying session on Saturdays will now be split into three distinct parts, each with multiple drivers on track simultaneously, and each with the drivers running as many laps as they want:<br><br>Part one: All 20 cars may run laps at any time during the first 15 minutes of the hour. At the end of the first 15 minutes, the five slowest cars drop out and fill the final five grid places.<br><br>Part two: After a five-minute break, the times will be reset and the 15 remaining cars then will then run in a second 15-minute session - again they may complete as many laps as they want at any time during that period. At the end of the 15 minutes, the five slowest cars drop out and fill places 11 to 15 on the grid.<br><br>Part three: After another five-minute break, the times are reset and the final 20-minute session will feature a dramatic shootout between the remaining 10 cars to decide pole position and the starting order for the top 10 grid places. Again, these cars may run as many laps as they wish.<br><br>As an added twist, an element of suspense and pit strategy remains entwined in the new format. In the first two 15-minute sessions, cars may run any fuel load and drivers knocked out after those sessions may refuel ahead of the race.<br><br>However, the top-ten drivers must begin the final 20-minute session with the fuel load on which they plan to start the race. They will be weighed before they leave the pits, and whatever fuel they use in the 20 minutes may be replaced at the end of the session.<br><br>In other changes approved by the Council for 2006, the rule limiting a driver to a single set of tyres for qualifying and the race will be dropped. Tyre changes will be allowed during the race, though drivers will be limited to seven sets of dry-weather tyres during the weekend. Tyres used in qualifying and the race must be of the same specification.<br><br>The Council also approved a package of measures for the 2008 season. These include the introduction of the FIA's Centreline Downwash Generating wing, larger wheels with slick tyres and a single tyre supplier. The package will be brought forward to 2007 if an 80 percent majority of the Formula One Technical Working Group agree to do so before the end of December 2005.</blockquote></div>
