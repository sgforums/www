            <div class='col-md body'>Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has confirmed that this year's French Grand Prix will be the last to be held at Magny-Cours.<br><br>Ecclestone replied with a firm "yes" would asked by French newspaper L'Equipe whether Formula 1 would leave Magny-Cours after 2007.<br><br>"It's a little bit disappointing because we organised this grand prix and it has never developed in the way that we would have liked it to," Bernie told L'Equipe.<br><br>Magny-Cours replaced Paul Ricard as the French GP venue in 1991, but has come under increasing criticism for its isolated location, and lack of facilities and atmosphere.<br><br>The French motorsport federation (FFSA) announced in March that it was 'suspending' the Magny-Cours F1 race for 2008 because "not all the conditions necessary for success were met."<br><br>Benie is open to having the race in the heart of Paris.<br><br>"A beautiful track on the roads of Paris - going up the Champs-ElysÃ©es, going round the corner there...<br><br>"You can always dream, can't you? I'm trying to turn dreams into reality."<br><br>Speculation has suggested that a circuit could be created at Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport, or the Disneyland Paris resort. Ecclestone said that the latter plan had its merits.<br><br>"Why not Disneyland?" he said. "It has hotels, you can get there by train, it would be ideal."<br><br>However, the race may not be on the 2008 calendar since work on such new venues hasn't even begun.</div>

PorscheÂ’s only F1 victory the following year; and the first win for a turbocharged car in 1979, which revolutionised F1 engine technology.<br><br>And along with its fair share of processional races, it has also delivered moments of high drama.<br><br>None more so than the Â’79 race at Dijon, where Gilles Villeneuve and Rene Arnoux earned an eternal place in F1 folklore with a display of uninhibited wheel-to-wheel combat which has never been equalled for sheer intensity and excitement.<br><br>Of the seven F1 venues that France has furnished since the start of the world championship, the public road courses of Reims, Rouen and Clermont-Ferrand were among the sportÂ’s most exhilarating theatres.<br><br>Magny-Cours pales by comparison, a contrived modern layout of chicanes and hairpins with no overall theme and little character.<br><br>ItÂ’s not exactly a bad circuit, but itÂ’s hard to imagine it kindling any great enthusiasm for F1 among those not already won over by the sport.<br><br>That said, in the midst of all the tight complexes and constant radii are three very keen bits of racetrack: the long Estoril right-hander at the start of the lap, and the fast chicanes of Nurburgring and Imola.<br><br>These three corners, both in person and through the slow-motion Â‘moodÂ’ shots in which TV directors delight, give a fine insight into the racing driverÂ’s art and how well his car is handling.<br><br>Which is just as well, for Magny-Cours is not renowned for serving up spectacular entertainment or riveting wheel-to-wheel battles.<br><br>Last yearÂ’s race was so gripping that Renault issued a press release about the engine rules in the middle of it.<br><br>It is, in short, the sort of place where drivers Â‘wait for the pit stopsÂ’ rather than attempt an overtaking move.<br><br>If one man can break that tradition and turn a potential snooze-fest into a thriller, itÂ’s surely Lewis Hamilton, who has shown an uncanny knack for finding inventive new passing places during his first season of F1.<br><br>Recently, of course, Hamilton has had no need to exercise those skills, having dominated the two North American races from the front.<br><br>No matter how often they are recited, the 22-year-oldÂ’s achievements in his rookie season still beggar belief: seven podiums in seven races, two accomplished wins, and a 10-point title lead over his double world champion team-mate.<br><br>ItÂ’s that remarkable record, rather than any real bad blood between the McLaren stable-mates, that has put Fernando AlonsoÂ’s nose out of joint.<br><br>The Spaniard admitted at Indianapolis that, while HamiltonÂ’s winter testing pace showed he would have few problems adapting to F1, he had not expected Lewis to set the world alight in the way he has.<br><br>As Pat Symonds has observed, Alonso is an intensely competitive individual who finds being beaten extremely difficult to deal with Â– like most great champions.<br><br>But despite the theatrical swerve towards the pit wall, there were signs at Indy that he has begun to readjust his mindset to the reality of his situation, to accept that there will be days when Hamilton beats him fair and square, and others when he has the upper hand.<br><br>Unlike in Montreal, Fernando did not throw his car off the road in his efforts to get the better of Lewis; after a concerted bid to take the lead was foiled, he settled for eight points, and embraced his team-mate on the podium.<br><br>Perhaps it was a watershed, the moment when Alonso stopped obsessing about being beaten by an upstart rookie and began to acknowledge Hamilton as simply a formidable rival, to whom he will inevitably lose from time to time.<br><br>If Fernando has indeed found a new mental equilibrium, he is likely to prove an even more dangerous opponent for Lewis over the remainder of the season, and their rivalry Â– which, despite the tensions it gives rise to, McLaren has so far given an admirably free rein Â– will only intensify.<br><br>Will AlonsoÂ’s fightback begin at Magny-Cours, where he won convincingly in 2005 and where Hamilton had one of his few less-than-stellar GP2 outings last year?<br><br>Or can Ferrari reverse the trend of the last three races and get in on the act?<br><br>Certainly, the Maranello squad has been talking up its chances after an encouraging test at Silverstone last week, where Felipe Massa set the fastest time.<br><br>The Brazilian believes Ferrari has hit upon the causes of its recent loss of form, and is confident a revised aerodynamic package and other new parts on the F2007 will bridge the performance gap to McLaren.<br><br>The biggest problem the team has faced is an inability to generate enough grip from the tyres to match the first-lap pace of its Mercedes-powered rival, which has kept it off the front row of the grid since the Spanish GP and allowed BMW Sauber to get within striking distance.<br><br>Given the difficulty of overtaking in France, its fortunes this weekend are likely to hinge on whether it has successfully addressed that handicap.<br><br>The first race at Magny-Cours, in 1991, was arguably the best, featuring an absorbing duel between Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell which the Briton won after a pair of opportunistic passing moves at the hairpin.<br><br>It would be fitting if the unloved Nevers track could bookend its F1 history with an equally entertaining contest Â– before what we hope will be the revival of the French GP at another venue in the not-too-distant future.</div>

"We should not have gone there in the first place. And we only did so because of former FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre."<br><br>The French motorsport federation, the FFSA, said last week they were still determined to fulfil their current contract with Ecclestone, running out in 2011. The FFSA said that they were looking at alternative venues for the race.<br><br>However, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon met with Ecclestone on Tuesday and the Briton agreed, in principle, to keep the race at Magny-Cours next year.<br><br>"He (Ecclestone) agreed in principle to maintain the race at Magny-Cours in 2008, and even 2009, if there were no other alternative," a spokesman for Fillon told Reuters.</div>
