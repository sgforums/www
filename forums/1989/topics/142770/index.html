And unless he can somehow find the cash, it looks as if the 24-year-old's Minardi career - and perhaps his F1 career as well - are coming to a premature end.<br><br>"Patrick being replaced at the next race is a strong possibility because of sponsorship money not being paid," Stoddart said, adding that he already had three drivers in line to replace the Austrian.<br><br>The Australian also revealed that he is holding talks with a Turkish driver about the possibility of him teaming up with Minardi for the inaugural Turkish GP. The race takes place in Istanbul on 21 August.<br><br>"We have talked to a Turkish driver and if a commercial deal is concluded, we would be proud to run him in Turkey," Stoddart said.<br><br>The driver though, is unlikely to race given that a superlicence is needed to compete in a F1 grand prix.

Doornbos will partner fellow Dutchman Christijan Albers. </span><br><br>"We are pleased to welcome Robert to Minardi," said team principal, Paul Stoddart, following TuesdayÂ’s announcement. "He has demonstrated clearly over the last year that he has the pace necessary to compete in Formula One, and we are pleased to give him the opportunity to make his World Championship debut at this weekend's German Grand Prix.<br><br>Â“I believe he is going to do an excellent job over the coming races, and I'm sure the Minardi team can expect even more enthusiastic support from the Netherlands, if that's possible, as we now have the first, all-Dutch driver line-up.<br><br>"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Patrick sincerely for his efforts on behalf of the team, and although commercial considerations mean we have had to bring our relationship with him to an end, this decision should in no way be taken as a reflection on his skill or ability as a driver. We continue to rate him very highly, and wish him all the best for the future."<br><br>Friesacher made his Formula One debut with Minardi at the start of the 2005 season. The Austrian scored his first and only world championship points with sixth place in the United States Grand Prix.</div>
