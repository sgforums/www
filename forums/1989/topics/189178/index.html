I kind of wish we took part more, so we could be involved in all of this."<br><br>The film produced by Pixar, the film-makers behind Toy Story, sees Wilson star alongside octogenarian race-fan Paul Newman and a certain M Schumacher- who cameos as a red racing car.<br><br>"It has come from director John Lasseter's love of cars, he has set it in a world of cars, and I am literally the voice of a race car,Â” says Wilson about the film.<br><br>Â“So it tells my journey, starting as an obnoxious race car, who gets his comeuppance and learns his lessons. It's a really Hollywood story!"- itvF1</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Panis announces his retirement</strong><br><br>18 September 2006<br><br>Toyota revealed on Monday that Olivier Panis has decided to leave the team at the end of 2006 and thereby put an end to his 12-year Formula One career. Panis, winner of the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix, has been with Toyota since 2003, as both a race and test driver.<br><br>"Toyota has made much progress and I am happy to have been a part of this,Â” said the Frenchman. Â“The team was always very motivated and still is. I am really positive about the job the whole team has done and will miss everyone I have worked with.Â”<br><br>Panis last raced for Toyota in 2004 and having spent the past two seasons testing, the 40-year-old now hopes to return to a racing role elsewhere.<br><br>Â“I know that it is time for me to move on and fulfil my wish to race again,Â” he explained. Â“I am looking forward to new racing challenges outside Formula One but I will keep a close eye on Toyota's performance and hope they achieve all the success they deserve."<br><br>Toyota, meanwhile, thanked Panis for all his efforts over the past four years and wished him well for his future career.<br><br>"We are very thankful to Olivier for the high level of commitment he put into working with the whole team all along our four years of collaboration,Â” said team principal Tsutomu Tomita. Â“His technical experience and human qualities greatly contributed to our team development as much as to the improvement of its overall performance."<br><br>Panis made his Formula One debut with Ligier back in 1994, going on to take his first - and only - Grand Prix win in 1996 in Monaco. He missed the second half of the following season after breaking both legs in a crash at the Canadian Grand Prix, but recovered to continue racing for the Prost team in 1998. He spent a year as McLarenÂ’s third driver in 2000 before resuming his racing career with BAR in 2001, finally switching to Toyota in 2003.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Williams-Toyota package making good progress</strong><br>18 December 2006<br><br>The Williams-Toyota package is making good progress this winter according to WilliamsF1 technical director Sam Michael. The team has focused mainly on building up better reliability than it had with the Cosworth engine in 2006.<br><br>"We started testing back in September with the FW28B car, which is a modified FW28A with the Toyota engine and our 2007 seamless gearbox," said Michael. "This car has completed over 6,500kms and no fewer than three complete on-track race simulations as part of our plan to significantly improve reliability in 2007."<br><br>"In addition to reliability, we have been working hard on understanding the changes in the tyres that Bridgestone are now supplying, and there are no untoward surprises," he added. "They are quite consistent and easier to manage, which is helpful when trying to evaluate different set-up changes from a stable baseline."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Kimi different kettle of fish to Schu - Massa</strong><br>18 February 2007<br><br>Felipe Massa says his new team mate Kimi Raikkonen is a different kettle of fish to former partner Michael Schumacher. Despite this, and despite the limited time the duo have had together at Ferrari, Massa is confident they'll get on.<br><br>"Kimi has a different character and personality to Michael," Massa said. "He does not talk very much and keeps himself to himself. He appears to be very fair and he does not seem to be the type of guy who plays the political game."<br><br>"He is good to work with and I am sure I won't have any problem with him," he added. "The important thing is that he works for the team so that we both have the best car possible." - f1.gpupdate.net<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Raikkonen and Massa are equal - Brawn</strong><br>14 March 2007<br><br>Ferrari's former technical director Ross Brawn says Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen are on equal status and will be free to fight it out for superiority in the Ferrari team on track. Brawn is currently on a year break from F1, but was involved in signing Raikkonen as Schumacher's replacement.<br><br>"Michael established his superiority through the natural order of things, by being the fastest," Brawn told BBC Sport Online. "It was never written into his contract that I was aware of - the only thing there was, he had first call on the T-car and that's what will happen at Ferrari this season - a natural order will evolve. Michael still had Felipe very much under control by the end of the season."<br><br>"But Felipe has progressed an enormous amount and if he keeps up that rate of progress he'll be a massive competitor in F1 in the future," he added. "It's just a question of whether he does."<br><br></div>
