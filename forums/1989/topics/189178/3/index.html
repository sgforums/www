But we will not, under any circumstances, favour one driver over the other.Â”<br><br>Dennis again spoke of his distress at the consequences that flowed from the teamÂ’s qualifying procedures going awry.<br><br>Â“What happened yesterday was really unacceptable,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“We have a very, very strong commitment to parity.<br><br>Â“This was one of those times when as hard as you try Â– and we try very hard Â– there was a deviation from our plans in qualifying, and that put the team in an extremely difficult position which has cost us all of the constructorsÂ’ points today in the event that we donÂ’t follow through with lodging an appeal.Â”</div>
