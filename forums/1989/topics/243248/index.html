            <div class='col-md body'>Well, what can we say?<br><br>Kimi: good driving, but whenever he's led from the front he's typically done well.  I'll wait to see what he does when the chips are down.<br><br>Massa: pure tough luck in qualifying with a screwy gearbox.  That said, he didn't quite hold up to Kimi in qualifying anyway.<br><br>Alonso: frankly disappointing.  Typical calculated race on his part and I wouldn't expect him to trip over his team mate just to get in front, but nonetheless a processional performance on his part.<br><br>Hamilton: nice move off the grid getting around Kubica.<br><br>Fisi: same old, same old - emphasis on old.<br><br>Hekki: maybe he should have kept Alonso's shoes in the car - they might have kept him on the track.  All the pre-season talk from him was, well, all pre-season talk.<br><br>Coulthard: WTF was he thinking?!  Damn good thing he didn't take Wurz's head off.<br><br>Wurz: he kept his head.  Nuff said.<br><br>Davidson: man of the match as far as I'm concerned.  A B-team driver who's been sidelined for testing, and he's given a lot of people a big wake-up call.<br><br>Sato: he kept the car on the track.  Nuff said.<br><br>Webber: he kept the car on the track. Almost.<br><br>Albers: he didn't keep the car on the track.  Someone had to fill Sato's role.<br><br>Ralf: one of the top three drivers.  Right.<br><br>Scott Speed: maybe the guy should consider changing his legal name.<br><br>Adrian Sutil: good one, getting in Davidson's way.  Well, someone had to make Albers look good.<br><br>Heidfeld/Kubica: looking all right, but it's probably the car.<br><br>Rubens/Jenson: it's the car.  It's gotta be the car.<br><br>Rosberg: it's the car.  It's definitely the car.<br><br>Ferrari: once again, a nicely sorted out car.  I'm not surprised they could get along without Scummaker, but doing so well without Ross Brawn is notable.<br><br>McLaren: so far so good as far as reliability is concerned.  Alonso was spot-on when he remarked about the Ferraris having more race pace.  Let's see how they go.<br><br>Renault: wake up, Flavio - it was the driver, not the car.  Fisi's performance last year should have told you that already.<br><br>BMW: looks like they got the better part of the divorce.<br><br>Toyota/Honda/Williams/Super Aguri: Factory teams getting a run for their money from their B-teams.  Something to think about.<br><br>Red Bull/STR: maybe they should have been watching Williams and Super Aguri a bit closer.<br><br>Spyker: ah well, someone had to take Minardi's place.</div>
