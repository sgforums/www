              <blockquote>
              <p>Following its successful maiden Grand Prix last year - the first Formula One race to take place under floodlights - the Singapore GP and local news daily Today have now launched a contest which will allow fans to name three corners of the city circuit.<br><br>The three corners at play are Turns 1, 7 and 10. The first was an easy candidate for the contest as it is always a crucial moment at the start of any race.<br><br>According to the circumstances at hand, Turn 7 was the scene of several tactical or improvised overtaking manoeuvres last year, and the action seen there prompted the need for a name as well.<br><br>As for Turn 10, it proved a difficult challenge to handle for many drivers due to its triple apex and bumpy kerbs; both Kimi Raikkonen and Giancarlo Fisichella ended their Singaporean race in the barriers as they attempted to navigate through.<br><br>Fans can choose from a variety of sources for their inspiration, be it former F1 drivers, landmarks, shapes, characteristics, etc. However, although the contest is open to all regardless of their location in the world, adding a local aspect to the potential names is a must.<br><br>In addition, the name submissions must not contain more than three words (including the terms 'corner' or 'turn') and have no commercial connotation.<br><br>"The judges will be looking to choose names that are punchy, have a strong local connection and are easy to pronounce," said the Singapore GP's deputy chairman Colin Syn to the Today newspaper.<br><br>"With a global race weekend television audience of more than 110 million and with 600 foreign media in town, it is a great opportunity to highlight our local icons throughout all the action-packed 61 laps," Syn added.<br><br>The contest winners will each receive a three-day pass for the 2009 edition of the Singapore Grand Prix in addition to a tour of the pitlane.</p>

              <p>Singapore reveals new corner names<br><br>Friday, 20 March 2009 11:30<br><br>Singapore Grand Prix organisers have announced new names for three corners at the Marina Bay circuit following a worldwide competition.<br><br>The venue for Formula 1’s night race, which made its debut on the calendar last year, asked fans to come up with names for turns one, seven and 10 with the ideas needing to have links to the local area.<br><br>Organisers have now revealed the winning entries following 1,800 entries, with <strong>the first corner – which will be made sharper for this year’s race in a bid to reduce corner speeds and increase overtaking – named ‘Sheares’</strong> in deference to the Benjamin Sheares Bridge which towers over the track at that point.<br><br><strong>Turn seven will now be known as ‘Memorial’</strong>, due to its proximity to the monument honouring civilian World War II victims.<br><br><strong>The turn 10 chicane, meanwhile, where Kimi Raikkonen and Giancarlo Fisichella both crashed last year has been named the ‘Singapore Sling’</strong> after the city state’s famous cocktail.<br><br>“Just like any icon, the corner has to be treated with respect” said deputy Singapore GP chairman Colin Syn.<br><br>“Drivers have to be careful here, but it can serve as a slingshot if they tackle it well. <br><br>“I guess after the exploits of some drivers last year, there could be jokes about a Wallbanger, but we chose to name the turn after the Singapore Sling because it is known internationally and fans everywhere can relate to it instantly."<br><br>This year’s Singapore race takes place on September 27.</p>
