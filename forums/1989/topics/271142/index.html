            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.gpticketshop.com/images/maps_big/f1HUN.gif"><br><br>Track: Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary<br>Circuit length: 4.381 km<br>Laps: 70<br>Race distance: 306.67 km<br>Fastest race lap: 1:19.071 (Michael Schumacher, 2004)<br><br>Located a stoneÂ’s throw away from the beautiful city of Budapest, the Hungaroring hosts the only Grand Prix in Eastern Europe. Set in a natural amphitheatre, spectators can enjoy a great view of the circuit. However, the races in fair weather are usually processional due to its tight, twisty nature, and a dusty surface that reduces grip and makes overtaking difficult.<br><br>The number of laps covered during the race and the slow speed are second only to Monaco. A makeover in 2003 saw the pit straight lengthened and Turn 1 and Sector 3 modified in an effort to improve the racing action and move the pitlane exit off the racing line.<br><br>The cars are set up with a high downforce configuration in order to get around the many long and slow bends quickly. The surface is bumpy, and smooth driving is crucial. Very little grip is offered off the racing line due to the dust that settles there. As a result, qualifying on the side of the grid with even numbers is undesirable as it usually means a poor start for the drivers who qualify there.<br><br>The grand prix usually sees sweltering heat and bright sunshine, but last yearÂ’s race was the first ever to be held in wet conditions. Only 9 drivers made it to the end, with Jenson Button taking his first win. Given HondaÂ’s current form however, he will need another miracle to repeat that feat.<br><br>This circuit is also significant to BMWÂ’s Robert Kubica, F1's only Polish driver, who made his debut in last yearÂ’s race as Jacques VilleneuveÂ’s replacement. He finished in 7th place but was subsequently disqualified for having an underweight car. Check out LOT Airlines' promotions for what is considered his home race.<br><br>The event is also considered a home race to the Finnish contingent on the grid, which this year consists of Ferrari's Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen and Renault's Heikki Kovalainen. With the end of the Austrian Grand Prix in 2003, one can expect to see fans of William's Alexander Wurz here too.<br><br>Current world champion Fernando Alonso also took his first win at this circuit in 2003. He is now just 2 points behind the championship leader/McLaren teammate Lewis Hamilton, after taking maximum points at NÃ¼rburgring while Hamilton finished with none. The other previous winners who are still active are RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen (2005), who retired at the last round and crashed out of the lead of last yearÂ’s race, and ButtonÂ’s teammate Rubens Barrichello (2002).<br><br>Hamilton's mishaps at the last race have closed up the drivers championship, and it now looks more like a 3-horse race. Can RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, now with an outside chance, claw his way back into contention? Or will McLaren dominate a procession as they did in Monaco? Try to stay awake during the race to find out!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The truth is oÂ­ne of the following:<br><br>McLaren were too smart by half<br><br>Or Alonso is the smartest driver in the world, and had this all calculated out in the cockpit of his car.<br><br>Alonso said of the incident, "I leave the pits when I'm told to."<br><br>And that makes the most sense.<br><br>If Ron Dennis is angry and upset, he oÂ­nly has his own team to whine at for wasting the precious seconds that left Hamilton second. If Ron Dennis is angry and upset, it clearly wasnÂ’t his driver who created the situation.<br><br>If Ron Dennis is angry and upset that McLarenÂ’s intended orchestration of the front row didnÂ’t happen as planned, he oÂ­nly has oÂ­ne place to point the fingerÂ…<br><br>At his team. Not his driver.<br><br>Even so, the oÂ­ne who ought to be furious is Fernando Alonso.<br><br>While Alonso will start from Pole oÂ­n a track where it is extremely difficult to make a pass, the team cost him a full lap of fuel by forcing him to sit idle in his pit stall.<br><br>They wasted 55 seconds oÂ­n the second to last stop, plus 19 seconds oÂ­n his final stop, plus the nine questionable seconds. That works out to 1:23 or oÂ­ne full lap.<br><br>Tomorrow, that lost lap could be very costly for Alonso. That is..<br><br>If McLaren allows him to win. Because if he does, heÂ’ll overtake the teamÂ’s favored oÂ­ne in the Formula oÂ­ne points standings.<br><br>Will Ron Dennis allow that to happen ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>uhh.. from the stories i read around, what has it got to do with Ron Dennis at all? seems like Alonso was the one who caused the delay... so why the part where they are not allowed to score constructors' points?<br><br>although there are signs that this could be a mess-up by the team when Hamilton was asked about it and he said to 'ask the team'<br><br>however, it was clear as day that Alonso was waved out by his team but he sat there while Hamilton waited behind him...<br><br>maybe Alonso feels that a cheating world champion has retired and wants to take his place.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">Alonso punished for Hamilton move</span></span></strong><br><span class="small"><strong>Alonso had been fourth in the morning session</strong></span><br><br>Fernando Alonso has been stripped of pole and moved five places down the Hungarian Grand Prix grid after impeding Lewis Hamilton in qualifying.<br><br>Hamilton was handed pole hours after being delayed by his team-mate in the pit lane, meaning he was too late for his final lap.<br><br>McLaren will also not be allowed to score constructors' points.<br><br>Nick Heidfeld (BMW Sauber) was bumped up to second with Kimi Raikkonen third and Ferrari's Felipe Massa 14th.<br><br>Massa, third in the championship and 11 points adrift of Hamilton, suffered after a costly mix-up on his fuel levels.<br><br>Hamilton leads Spaniard Alonso by two points with seven races remaining.<br><br>The 22-year-old British rookie was fastest until the Spaniard pipped him by 0.107 seconds with his final lap of the session in the dying seconds.<br><br>Hamilton was unable to reply after being forced to wait behind Alonso at their final stop, leaving him too little time for a final flying lap.<br><br>Alonso and Hamilton, as well as team principal Ron Dennis, were summoned to an FIA inquiry to explain why the Spaniard had stopped for such a long time.<br><br>"The commissioners decided that Alonso unnecessarily interfered with another competitor, Hamilton, and he has been penalised five places on the grid," said an FIA statement.<br><br>"The attitude of the team at the end of qualification was considered prejudicial to the interests of competition and motor racing."<br><br>McLaren immediately appealed the decision but this will only cover the withdrawal of points not the personal penalty handed out to Alonso.<br><br>Hamilton refused to be drawn in to criticising Alonso for delaying his exit out of the pit lane ahead of his final run.<br><br>"There's not really much to say - you saw what happened," he said.<br><br>"The team did a great job and we had very good pace, but I'm not aware of what happened. You should ask the team."<br><br>When asked as to how long he missed out on setting a final quick lap, he tersely replied: "About the same amount of time I was held up in the pit stop."<br><br>Explaining his hold, Alonso said: "The team held me back in this. We tried to have some space with the Ferrari (Raikkonen) in front of us."<br><br>But team boss Ron Dennis said: "It is a matter to be discussed within the team, and we will do so later."<br><br>Briton Jenson Button, who took a first Grand Prix win from 14th place in a wet race in Hungary last year, qualified his Honda a disappointing 17th.</div>
