              <p class="first"><strong>Formula 1 has been thrown into chaos after eight of
              its major teams said they are now planning to set up a rival
              championship for the 2010 season.</strong></p>
              <p>The threat by members of
              the F1 Teams Association (Fota) intensifies their row with world
              motorsport boss Max Mosley over his budget cap proposals.</p>
              <p>"The teams have declined to alter their original conditional entries to the 2010 F1 Championship," said the teams.</p>
              <p>"We've no alternative than to commence preparation for a new championship."</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Mosley was insistent on introducing a voluntary £40m budget cap for teams to curtail a "financial arms race" in F1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="videoInStoryC">
              <div id="emp_8108708" class="emp"><img class="holding" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45945000/jpg/_45945953_cousutil_512.jpg" alt="David Coulthard"></div>
              
              <p class="caption">F1 breakaway would be bad - Sutil</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Fota refused to agree to his conditions, prompting championship
              leader Brawn GP, Ferrari, McLaren, Renault, Toyota, BMW Sauber, Red
              Bull Racing and Toro Rosso to take their drastic action.</p>
              <p>They
              announced their decision following a four-hour meeting on Thursday
              night ahead of this weekend's British Grand Prix at Silverstone.</p>
              <p>"Since
              the formation of Fota last September the teams have worked together and
              sought to engage the FIA and commercial rights holder (Bernie
              Ecclestone), to develop and improve the sport," read a Fota statement.</p>
              <p>"Unprecedented worldwide financial turmoil has inevitably placed great challenges before the F1 community.</p>
              <p>"Fota is proud that it has achieved the most substantial measures to reduce costs in the history of our sport.</p>
              <p>"In
              particular, the manufacturer teams have provided assistance to the
              independent teams, a number of which would probably not be in the sport
              today without the Fota initiatives.</p>
              <p>"The Fota teams have
              further agreed upon a substantial voluntary cost reduction that
              provides a sustainable model for the future.</p>

              underlying issue is the governance of F1 - and particularly the
              leadership of Max Mosley. Fota is no longer prepared to put up with the
              FIA having absolute power...</a>  </strong> <br></div>

              <p></p>
              <p>"Following these efforts, all the teams have confirmed to the FIA
              and the commercial rights holder that they are willing to commit until
              the end of 2012.</p>
              <p>"The FIA and the commercial rights holder have campaigned to divide Fota.</p>
              <p>"The
              wishes of the majority of the teams are ignored. Furthermore, tens of
              millions of dollars have been withheld from many teams by the
              commercial rights holder, going back as far as 2006.</p>
              <p>"Despite this, and the uncompromising environment, Fota has genuinely sought compromise.</p>
              <p>"It
              has become clear, however, the teams cannot continue to compromise on
              the fundamental values of the sport and have declined to alter their
              original conditional entries to the 2010 world championship."</p>

              <p>Fota added that its championship would put F1 fans first and boast the best drivers and sponsors.</p>
              <p>"This
              series will have transparent governance, one set of regulations,
              encourage more entrants and listen to the wishes of the fans, including
              offering lower prices for spectators worldwide, partners and other
              important stakeholders," added the statement.</p>
              <p>"The major
              drivers, stars, brands, sponsors, promoters and companies historically
              associated with the highest level of motorsport will all feature in
              this new series."</p>
              <p>Former champions Williams and Force India
              have already committed unconditionally to the FIA's world championship
              along with three new entrants - Campos, US F1 and Manor.</p>
              <p>The
              FIA has said there are other would-be newcomers waiting to take the
              places of those teams that refused to enter unconditionally, although
              one, Lola, has already withdrawn its application.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The stage is also set for a legal battle, with the FIA saying
              champions Ferrari and the two Red Bull teams have existing contracts
              which commit them to the existing championship.</p>
              <p>The FIA had set
              a 19 June deadline for five teams - Brawn, BMW-Sauber, McLaren, Renault
              and Toyota - to convert their provisional entries into unconditional
              ones or risk being excluded.</p>
              <p>The FIA responded to the teams'
              move in a statement on Friday, saying: "We are disappointed but not
              surprised by Fota's inability to reach a compromise in the best
              interests of the sport."</p>
              <p>It claimed that "elements within Fota
              have sought this outcome throughout the prolonged period of negotiation
              and have not engaged in the discussions in good faith."</p>
              <p>The
              statement added: "The deadline for unconditional entries to the 2010
              FIA Formula 1 World Championship will expire on Friday evening. The
              2010 entry list will be announced on Saturday."</p>

              <p>BBC F1 pundit and former team boss Eddie Jordan said it might
              ultimately need Mosley to announce he is not seeking another term of
              office to resolve F1's civil war.</p>
              <p>He told Radio 5 Live: "It's posturing, but it has become very serious, and heads will roll before this sorts itself out."</p>
              <p>Jordan added there was "absolutely not a chance" that the sport could sustain two rival series next season.</p>
              <p>The BBC, which broadcasts F1 in the UK, said in a statement: "We are monitoring the situation."</p>
              <p>It added: "We never comment on the details of contracts, because it is commercially confidential information."</p>
