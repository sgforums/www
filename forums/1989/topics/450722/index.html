              <p class="first">Mercedes'
               Nico Rosberg claimed his first Formula One race victory in 111 attempts
               as he led from pole position to take the Chinese Grand Prix in style on
               Sunday.</p>
              <p>The German's faultless drive in Shanghai saw him comfortably home 
              ahead of the McLarens of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton. The Red Bull 
              of Mark Webber was fourth and reigning two-time world champion Sebastian
               Vettel fifth.</p>
              <p>Rosberg showed no early nerves from pole position and made the 
              perfect start to stay ahead of team-mate Michael Schumacher going into 
              the crucial first corner at an overcast but dry Shanghai International 
              Circuit.</p>
              <p>The big loser at the start was Vettel, whose nightmare weekend got slightly worse when he slipped from 11th on the grid to 15th.</p>
              <p>With the seven-time champion Schumacher using all his experience to 
              act as a buffer from the chasing pack, Rosberg was able to stretch his 
              lead with 10 of the 56 laps under his belt in relative comfort.</p>
              <p>But in lap 14 that strategy -- intentional or not -- came undone in 
              amateurish fashion when Schumacher appeared to have been given the 
              all-clear from a pit stop before one of the wheels was properly 
              fastened.</p>
              <p>A Mercedes mechanic frantically waved his arms but the 43-year-old 
              was gone, only to slow up and stop shortly afterwards as he was forced 
              to meekly bow out, his chance of a first race win since coming out of 
              retirement over.</p>
              <p>Minutes later Mercedes confirmed on Twitter: "Michael's right front 
              wheel was not fitted properly at the stop leading to his retirement."</p>
              <p>At about the same time, Rosberg was in the pit lane so he could 
              switch to intermediate tyres, allowing Sergio Perez to briefly head the 
              field, before he too pitted, allowing Ferrari's Felipe Massa to briefly 
              take the lead.</p>
              <p>But the flying Rosberg was back in front once more when he easily 
              passed Massa's cumbersome Ferrari, with Button and Hamilton now hot on 
              Rosberg's heels. They were soon joined by Romain Grosjean, who was to 
              finish sixth.</p>
              <p>Rosberg surrendered his lead to Button when he pitted on lap 35, then
               Webber had a hairy moment when he ran wide on the kerb, launching the 
              front of his Red Bull into the air, drawing gasps from a packed crowd.</p>
              <p>Rosberg was out in front again when Button stopped for a final time 
              and appeared to linger, allowing the Lotus of Kimi Raikkonen to jump 
              into second, with Vettel's assault taking him up to third with 42 of the
               56 laps gone.</p>
              <p>Button's challenge appeared over, with Rosberg enjoying a more than 
              22-second lead over second-place Raikkonen with 10 laps to go and on a 
              fresh set of tyres. Vettel meanwhile used all his ability to pass Button
               and move into third.</p>
              <p>With eight laps to go, a mistake by Raikkonen saw him plummet down to
               midfield, while Vettel, Button and Hamilton duelled over second and 
              third.</p>
