            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.gpticketshop.com/images/maps_big/f1BEL.gif"><br><br>Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps<br>Track length: 6.976 km<br>Lapcount: 44<br>Race distance: 306.944 km<br>Fastest lap: 1:45.108 km (Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, 2004)<br><br>This monster of a circuit is the longest on the calendar and one of the most challenging. Winding through the forests in the Ardennes mountains, it is a firm favourite among the drivers. It has been likened to 'a drive home in the country', as several awesome bends simply follow the natural contours. The names of Eau Rouge, Blanchimont and Pouhon are legendary.<br><br>This event was absent from the 2006 season as the bus stop chicane underwent a revision, the pit straight was...erm...straightened, and the facilities were upgraded.<br><br>The track sets itself up for exciting racing as it is one of the few where a driver in an inferior car can shine. Most memorably in...<br><br>...2000, Mika HÃ¤kkinen passed Michael Schumacher and a backmarker (Zonta) simultaneously in one of F1's greatest overtaking manoevers.<br><br>...1991, Schumacher made his debut at this track, qualifying 7th before retiring on the starting grid with gearbox trouble. 4 years later he braved the rain on dry tyres to take the win, after starting 16th.<br><br>...1998, David Coulthard triggered a 14-car pile-up. After the restart, he and Schumacher collided while the former was about to be lapped. This paved the way for the Jordan team's (now Spyker) first win, which was also to be 1996 champion Damon Hill's last.<br><br>...2004, Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, in an inferior and damaged car, also passed Schumacher for the lead and set the fastest lap at the finish line.<br><br>A medium downforce set-up is used to give a good compromise between speed on the straights and that in the fast bends. Setting up the ride height is also tricky - greater ground clearance favours the sudden gradient change of Eau Rouge but affects the rest of the lap. The weather also presents another challenge. Due to the circuit's length, it can be wet at one end and bone-dry at the other. The teams that think on their feet quickly stand to gain the most.<br><br>RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen won the last 2 Belgian Grand Prix, but he is not 18 points behind the championship leaders from McLaren. Massa's retirement at Monza put him a further 5 points behind. At McLaren, Alonso is now just 3 points behind his teammate after the Spaniard won the Italian leg.<br><br>Spa is expected to suit the Ferraris more than their homeground as it is fast and flowing. The McLarens rode the kerbs of Monza better but they will have none of this advantage in this race.<br><br>We will hear the outcome of a new investigation into the espionage scandal on the preceding Thursday, but I assure you that whatever the outcome it wil not detract from the action on the track!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kimi Raikkonen underlined his status as the modern-day Spa master by chalking up his third consecutive victory at the majestic Belgian track and keeping his world title hopes alive.<br><br>The Finn delivered a flawless lights-to-flag performance to lead home team-mate Felipe Massa in a 1-2 finish for Ferrari that was every bit as resounding as McLarenÂ’s tour de force at Monza a week earlier.<br><br>The MP4-22 was no match for the F2007 around SpaÂ’s fast sweeping corners and Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton had to settle for third and fourth places.<br><br>By winning the intra-team battle Alonso made further inroads into HamiltonÂ’s dwindling championship lead, whittling it to just two points with three races remaining.<br><br>RaikkonenÂ’s victory means he retains a slim chance of wresting the title away from the McLaren duo, cutting his deficit to Hamilton to 13 points with 30 still up for grabs Â– although he will have to hope that the Mercedes-powered teamÂ’s impressive reliability falters.<br><br>After McLaren was stripped of all its points by the FIA last Thursday, Ferrari only had to beat the BMWs at Spa to seal its 15th constructorsÂ’ title Â– which it duly achieved.<br><br>After a spectacular start and some action-packed opening laps, much of the excitement in the race fizzled out and it all became rather processional.<br><br>Both Ferraris got away well from the front row, while the McLarens fought a pitched battle over third.<br><br>Hamilton tried to go round Alonso around the outside of La Source but was given short shrift, the Spaniard running him very wide across the asphalt apron on the exit.<br><br>Even so, Lewis got a better slingshot off the hairpin and drew level with Fernando as they turned into Eau Rouge.<br><br>The pair then proceeded to drive side-by-side through the first two parts of Formula 1Â’s most awe-inspiring corner, Alonso finally forcing Hamilton to cede on the right-handed climb through Raidillon.<br><br>Heikki Kovalainen made an excellent getaway to vault from ninth to sixth, which put him in a strong position as he was on a one-stop pit strategy.<br><br>The penalty of carrying extra fuel and weight is greater at Spa than at any other track, however, and the Finn was unable to avoid back into the clutches of his pursuers.<br><br>Mark Webber was the first to pounce, getting a run on Kovalainen on the long drag up the Kemmel straight and edging him towards the inside on the approach to Les Combes to grab the preferred line into the chicane.<br><br>By lap 11 both BMWs had got past too, courtesy of rather fraught outbraking moves into the Bus Stop chicanes, demoting Kovalainen to ninth.<br><br>Raikkonen soon stamped his authority on the race, edging steadily away from team-mate Massa with each passing lap.<br><br>After six tours he was 2.4s to the good; by lap 12 he had doubled that margin, giving himself a comfortable cushion ahead of the first round of pit stops.<br><br>The McLaren duo simply had no answer for the FerrarisÂ’ pace, Alonso falling 9.7s behind Raikkonen by lap 12 with Hamilton a further 2.5s adrift.<br><br>Raikkonen and Alonso pitted together at the end of lap 15, and their team-mates followed suit after one more circuit Â– but it made little difference to the order or gaps.<br><br>The middle stint progressed in much the same fashion. Ferrari, and Raikkonen in particular, had the race by the throat, leaving the McLaren drivers to wage a private duel for the final rostrum place.<br><br>Raikkonen relinquished briefly the lead when he initiated the second round of stops at the end of lap 31.<br><br>Massa and Alonso followed him in on successive laps, but Hamilton Â– who had taken on more fuel at the first stops and was on a longer middle stint Â– stayed out until lap 38.<br><br>The British rookie wasnÂ’t fast enough to capitalise, however, and after taking on service he rejoined more than five seconds behind Alonso.<br><br>The closing stages were enlivened by the shrinking gaps between the two leading Ferraris and the McLaren pair as Massa and Hamilton mounted last-gasp charges.<br><br>With a couple of laps remaining Massa had got RaikkonenÂ’s lead down to two seconds, but Kimi the Â‘IcemanÂ’ remained unflustered and coolly increased the gap back to 4.6s by the chequered flag.<br><br>Hamilton threw caution to the wind in his pursuit of Alonso Â– until a big scare on the penultimate lap when he got out of shape in the middle of the 160mph Pouhon corner and had to drag the McLaren back into line.<br><br>As so often this year, Nick Heidfeld finished Â‘best of the restÂ’ behind the habitual top four, albeit a whopping 52 seconds shy of the winning Ferrari.<br><br>After running wide at La Source on the first lap, the German the opening stint behind Webber and Nico Rosberg, but leapfrogged both with a later first stop.<br><br>Rosberg drove another yeomanÂ’s race for Williams to finish sixth, which finally hauled him above team-mate Alex Wurz in the driversÂ’ points standings.<br><br>Webber capped a strong weekend by taking seventh for Red Bull, although his team-mate David Coulthard fell victim to yet another hydraulic problem with 15 laps to go.<br><br>KovalainenÂ’s one-stop strategy didnÂ’t really pay dividends, although a bigger problem was the Renault R27Â’s lack of raw pace.<br><br>Nonetheless the rookie drove well again to fend off a marauding Robert Kubica for eighth Â– his sixth consecutive points-paying finish.<br><br>Kubica paid heavily for the engine change penalty he incurred on Saturday, which dropped him from fifth to 15th on the grid.<br><br>The Pole made good initial progress but lost ground behind the one-stopping cars in the middle stint.<br><br>One man deserving a more than honourable mention is Adrian Sutil, who performed superbly in the much-improved B-spec Spyker.<br><br>Helped by a fairly light fuel load, the young German made a cracking start, making up four places on the opening lap.<br><br>He climbed as high as 12th Â– giving the likes of Coulthard all the pressure he could handle Â– before ultimately slipping to 14th.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The rest of the pack had no answer to the speed of the top 4 cars...
