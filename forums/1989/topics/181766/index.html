15:11<br><br>Fernando Alonso began his title defence in the best possible fashion with a superbly judged victory in the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.<br><br>But, unlike the early races of last year, the Spaniard didnÂ’t have things his own way Â– not by a long shot.<br><br>Instead he was made to work hard all afternoon by seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, whose pace signalled a major Ferrari revival this year.<br><br>The Â‘oldÂ’ maestro and the sportÂ’s youngest ever champion fought a pressure-laden race-long duel, the outcome of which was decided when Alonso emerged from his final pit stops just metres in front.<br><br>On an afternoon full of stellar performances, one of the best came from Kimi Raikkonen, who charged through from the back of the grid to claim the final podium spot.<br><br>The McLaren driver just held off a rampaging Jenson Button, who gave a magnificent exhibition of overtaking as he fought to make amends for a poor start.<br><br>From third on the grid the Briton was left standing when the lights went out and lost three places into the first corner.<br><br>Schumacher got away well from pole but his hopes that team-mate Felipe Massa might act as his rear gunner were soon dashed when Alonso outmanoeuvred the Brazilian at turn four.<br><br>McLarenÂ’s Juan Pablo Montoya ran fourth while Button spent the first few laps trading fifth with Honda team-mate Rubens Barrichello before settling the matter on lap four.<br><br>MassaÂ’s Ferrari debut went sour on lap eight when he spun under braking for the first corner and very nearly took Alonso with him.<br><br>When he pitted to change his flat-spotted tyres at the end of the lap, the Ferrari mechanics had to scramble to replace a defective air gun and he was stationary for an agonising 47 seconds.<br><br>Now fully into his stride, Button closed in on Montoya and pulled off a superbly opportunistic outbraking move at turn one to snatch third place.<br><br>Meanwhile Schumacher slowly but surely extended his lead over Alonso, stretching the margin to six seconds before triggering the first round of pit stops on lap 15.<br><br>As expected, AlonsoÂ’s Renault had more fuel on board and did not have to stop for another four laps.<br><br>But, whereas last year that would have given him a clear advantage, enabling him to pump in a series of fliers on a low fuel load, the return of tyre changing this season has disrupted that neat equation.<br><br>Sure enough, the extra grip afforded by SchumacherÂ’s new Bridgestone tyres offset AlonsoÂ’s lower fuel load and the Spaniard was not able to make any real inroads, emerging from the pits still around four seconds adrift of the leading Ferrari.<br><br>Once he was back up to speed, however, Alonso began to lop great chunks off that margin and by lap 26 the protagonists were nose-to-tail.<br><br>As ever, catching proved easier than getting past and, unable to break through the FerrariÂ’s turbulent air, Alonso bided his time in the hope that he could leapfrog Schumacher at the next round of pit stops.<br><br>Absorbing as the lead battle was, there were tight scraps all the way down the leader board as the Sakhir circuit afforded some thrilling passing and re-passing.<br><br>Button had to pass Montoya a second time after losing out at the first pit stop exchange, once again getting the job done with a skilful piece of outbraking at turn one.<br><br>Raikkonen, though, had moved ahead of both of them thanks to prodigious pace and a one-stop fuel strategy.<br><br>Despite carrying a ton weight of fuel in the back of his McLaren, the Finn had scythed through the field in the opening laps and, although he briefly fell to sixth, he reclaimed third when the pit stop cycle played out.<br><br>Meanwhile the drama was building at the front of the field.<br><br>When Schumacher peeled into the pits on lap 37, the Renault team told Alonso over the radio: Â“These are the winning laps, mate.Â”<br><br>But, just when he needed a clear road to capitalise on his superior speed, Alonso found the track littered with traffic.<br><br>Frustrated at the lack of blue Â‘move overÂ’ flags, Alonso kept up his rhythm as best he could and hoped that his cushion would hold when he pitted two laps after his rival.<br><br>It did Â– just Â– although it took a muscular move at the first corner to keep the Ferrari at bay.<br><br>Schumacher didnÂ’t yield the lead easily, but Alonso had track position turning into the first corner and seized his chance.<br><br>The Ferrari loomed large in his mirrors all the way to the chequered flag, but Alonso had the situation covered.<br><br>On the slow-down lap he dedicated his win to his Renault pit crew, who pulled out all the stops at the raceÂ’s critical juncture.<br><br>Behind Raikkonen and Button, Montoya came home fifth ahead of Mark WebberÂ’s Williams.<br><br>Meanwhile WebberÂ’s team-mate Nico Rosberg had a sensational debut, overcoming an early spin and unscheduled pit stop to claw his way back to seventh.<br><br>Remarkably, the 20-year-old German set the fastest lap of anybody as he carved his way back up the lap chart!<br><br>Christian Klien gave Red Bull Racing some cheer by bringing the hitherto unreliable RB2 in the final points-paying position.<br><br>Bahrain Grand Prix results - 57 laps<br><br>1.
