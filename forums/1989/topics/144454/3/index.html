Certainly not about what they should or should not be doing.<br><br>U're gonna have to refresh me, which was the race he piled into Pizza. Monaco... well no overtaking there is there? UK, well his car had a problem. At least he didn't throw it off the road so much that he damaged it. As for playing percentages, I doubt if u can be 100% sure about that. 03 was a very mixed season, and who knows how good the McLaren was? Besides, it was bloody fragile then as well, and the team might have asked him to bring it home in the points ya dig? I will still doubt that Kimi plays percentages because the way I see it, I sometimes WISH he'd slow down a bit and maybe the car won't break. IF he were playing percentages, I'd certainly want him to push a bit more. But I don't, because he isn't. Anyways, Alonso was outclassed much of last year by Trulli and I felt that he'd lost the plot in 04. Sure is nice that he's bucked up now, but he needs to temper his hotheadness with intelligence. Like I said, bollocks without brains is no use. I'm sure u can appreciate this point yourself? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

What's won's won, whats lost's lost, no point talking about the shoulds where the WDC is concerned.<br><br>anyhows, i suppose, if u could combine senna and prost into one, u'd get the ultimate racing driver. And i suppose kimi and alonso combined would be the same too. but u know what's scary? There IS one such driver who seems to be a almost perfect combination of senna + prost, or kimi + alonso. Thats the red baron himself. his only archilles heel is in a wheel to wheel fight.<br><br>u know what tho? I still haven't seen kimi and alonso duke it out on the track side by side. screw the 05 rules. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Those things u talk about are more applicable for endurance racing. And yes I've done both sprint races AND 24 hours endrance racing so I know the diff. U know what? The problem we're tackling here is component failure. Where the component fails due to manufacturing flaws u can conserve or u can push, trust me, it will still fail. I've suffered from that a few times. Besides, u're talking about a very low basic level of racing. The instructor HAS to teach u to finish races because when u start learning to race your skills are so unpolished that u basically create a lot of wear and tear when u change gear, turn the wheel, brake etc, ok? At my level we already no longer talk about that sort of basics because everybody is drilled in the art of driving without causing undue and unnecessary wear and tear on the machine. We're discussing a higher level where such basics are already covered and not within the scope of discussion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>A real racer like Ayrton Senna always pushed the machine to its limits. Just too bad that Maccies lasted longer back then. Alain Prost was more of a driver. Never really able to fight wheel to wheel like Kimi or Alonso or Montoya does. Michael Schumacher's another one who loses out fighting wheel to wheel. As for Jacques, well when he fights wheel to wheel, everybody loses out!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>A driver, in the world of sprint racing, is someone who conserves the car. A racer is someone who goes all out.<br><br>As for race school, don't tell me u went to one. THAT's all they taught u?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Here we're not talking about component failure arising from mistreatment of the machine by the driver. Think u need to understand that when we say "racer mentality" it doesn't mean driving the car ragged like a newbie. Maybe u need to consider that we're viewing the issue from 2 very different levels of playing field.<br><br>btw, u might want to consider what is actually classified as a sprint category race and what is considered an endurance event under FIA classification rules, not under our local SMSA's jargons.</div>
