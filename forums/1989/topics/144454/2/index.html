The way he opted to push that car at nurburgring was defo a racer's heart t work. if he wanted to play the percentage game, he would have opted to pit, new rules be damned. 8 points are better than 0. No I think Kimi pushes as hard as alonso n MS. Alonso tends to be over aggressive n loses his cool sometimes. Just because a driver is exciting doesn't mean he's the best racer.</div>

As Mike Gascoyne commented, ""We radioed Fernando to check everything was OK, he said yes, so we let him continue racing.  The car had clearly been damaged, but looking at the lap-times, he didn't seem to notice."<br><br>Now THAT's a racer of the likes of Senna and Mansell, and I've never seen Kimi do anything close to that.</div></blockquote>Disagree. I particularly remember Spa 02, where he charged straight on thru Oliver Pani's tyre smoke, because in that split second he could tell from the tyre marks on the track where his toyota would be, and what sort of smoke it was. That, and the way u saw him slice thru traffic yesterday charging hard on Schuey's heels, tells me more that he's a racer than a driver. back in 03, renault had a pretty good car, nowhere as good as a Ferrari but better than the Mc. The fact that alonso had even destroyed his undertray and lost a bargeboard, says something about him being (un)able to keep his cool. The reason we don't see Kimi drive within 1 sec of MS with a car with no undertray, missing bargeboard etc is simply because Kimi remembers the car works better on track than off it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>besides, Alonso had 2 incidents which has not impressed me. Actually his unforced error in canada makes it 3, but the previous 2 were him driving right into mark webber's wreckage in brazil 03, and monaco, where he drove out onto the marbles trying to pass ralf. I mean, what was he thinking in monaco? Sure ralfie ought not to get on the gas again too early, but go ask any racer, all of us, down to go karters, know that its suicide to try n lap someone on the marbles. Its no use charging and pushing 100% when u don't know how to reign it in and keep your cool really. A trip into the barriers doesn't help u win a race does it?<br><br>Besides, of the 2, who can u truely say drove the wheel off his car?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Why else do u think MS could keep getting a better run out of the final corner? it wasn't just kimi, alonso was also more or less trying to follow rubens thru, and if alonso was such a racer, why wouldn't he have passed rubens by the end of the race? he only had nosecone damage, and at most a bit of light undertray damage, nothing he couldn't handle, and his car was so much more superior than the ferrari ain't it? Trulli was bloody driving without a whole rear diffuser and he still managed 4th.<br><br>Besides, hey if Alonso was such a racer, why didn't he just pass his teammate in Canada instead of whining n Bitching about it on the radio to his team?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> He had to wait till Fisi's car failed to get past, and then he promptly drove it into the wall.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>btw for monaco, ask any racing driver and they'll tell u its suicide to drive out onto marbles. maybe its survivable so bad on proper racing circuits which are used more often, but at monaco, which is used once a year, and with its armco barriers and no run off area? what WAS he thinking? that is a mistake only beginners would make. and instead of backing off, he gunned it?! on the marbles?! urgh. no use if he has bollocks but no brains.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Monaco '03?  Can't say I remember - didn't Alonso finish fifth after starting from eighth?  Lemme see if I can get my hands on the footage.<br><br>As for Monza, the car's handling was already off after the job Jos did on it.  Was it unforced?  Yes.  Was it an unforced error?  No.<br><br>As you noted, Hungary's a bad place to overtake <strong>for position </strong>- Fisichella only managed to squeeze by Rubens after Rubens got onto the marbles.  What I'm saying is that yesterday's race is no reflection of anybody being a real racer - you know Hungary and Monaco are characteristically like that, and that's why some fans have been arguing for both to be taken off the calendar.  Again, yesterday, only Albers and the Jordan drivers were being difficult about blue flags - the rest literally went out of their way to keep from holding the leaders back.<br><br>Canada?  What was he going to do?  Take a charge at Fisi and cost Renault all their points right then and there?  This isn't Senna/Prost or Mansell/Piquet we're talking about here, and Alonso isn't anywhere as close to dumb as Half.  If anything, Fisi was having an uncharacteristically good day out and was enjoying th moment, but he was holding his team mate up.</div>

I mean, going off and thus destroying his undertray AND a bargeboard wasn't going to help him go faster really. Racing is not just about balls, like i said. Brains are needed as well. Which is why i prefer kimi. I've too often seen alonso's intelligence blanking out. As well as doing the prima donna, such as Bitching n whining about Fisi.
