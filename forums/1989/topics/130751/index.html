All Spanish GP news to be posted here.<br><br>Sat 1st Qualifying Results<br><br>TRULLI STEALS ALONSO'S THUNDER May 7, '05 8:59 AM ET<br>for everyone<br><br>Last Updated: Saturday, 07, May, 2005, 13:15<br><br>Jarno Trulli spoiled home favourite Fernando AlonsoÂ’s party by pipping him for provisional pole at Barcelona on Saturday.<br><br>Formula 1Â’s ace qualifier edged out the Spaniard by just 0.016s after Alonso, in common with most of the rest of the field, lost time in the final sector.<br><br>McLarenÂ’s Kimi Raikkonen, who was one of the first drivers to go out as a result of his Imola retirement, set a benchmark that stood until the dying moments of the session.<br><br>The FinnÂ’s lap began inauspiciously when he ran wide onto the gravel at the exit of Turn 2. But the error cost him surprisingly little time and the rest of the lap was spot-on, yielding a 1m14.819s.<br><br>Even so, Raikkonen looked vulnerable as several drivers bettered his first sector time and seemed on course to usurp him.<br><br>But the tenths ebbed away in the last few corners where crosswinds made grip levels unpredictable.<br><br>Trulli judged it to perfection, however, hooking all three sectors of the lap together nicely to topple Raikkonen with a 1m14.795s.<br><br>Only Alonso was left to run, and the crowd cheered their man to the echo as he ventured out on his out lap.<br><br>At the second split he was on target to beat Trulli, but once again the final sector proved his undoing and he had to give best to his former team-mate by the slenderest of margins.<br><br>Indeed, the top four names on the timesheets were blanketed by less than 0.1s, so the ultra-competitive 2005 season is, if anything, intensifying in Spain this weekend.<br><br>The leading quartet was completed by the second Toyota of Ralf Schumacher. The German will be slightly disappointed to lose out to Trulli yet again since he had been quicker than him throughout this morningÂ’s practice.<br><br>But with so little in it at the sharp end of the grid, Ralf has every chance of redressing the balance tomorrow.<br><br>The two Williams were unexpectedly quick and have provisionally annexed the third row, Nick Heidfeld shading Mark Webber by a miniscule 0.004s.<br><br>Heidfeld's provisional placing is academic, as he will demoted 10 spots after the team installed a new BMW engine overnight.<br><br>Webber, though, may just stay in that region of the grid since he has a 0.36s buffer over the seventh-placed driver Â– none other than Michael Schumacher.<br><br>The Ferraris have not been on the pace so far this weekend, but when Schumacher slammed in a fastest first sector many in the paddock assumed the team had been sandbagging.<br><br>That theory was swiftly disproved, however, as the world champion faded dramatically as the lap wore on, ending up 0.6s shy of the pole time.<br><br>Team-mate Rubens Barrichello qualified ninth but is another to face a 10-place grid relegation as his Ferrari mechanics performed an engine change following practice this morning.<br><br>The Maranello twins were sandwiched by Giancarlo Fisichella in the second Renault, while David Coulthard rounded out the top 10 in the leading Red Bull entry.<br><br>Grand prix returnee Juan Pablo Montoya was the first man out in qualifying and paid the price with a lowly 12th best time, over a second slower than team-mate Raikkonen.<br><br>First qualifying times from Barcelona<br><br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>BMW in talks to supply Sauber in 2006<br>Unhappy with 'midfield position' with Williams<br><br>BMW confirm link to supplying Sauber with its<br>V8 powerplant in 2006<br><br>BMW, engine-suppliers to the Williams Formula One team, are in talks to equip Sauber too from next season, the German manufacturer's managing director revealed here at Circuit de Catalunya on Saturday.<br><br>"We are in constructive negotiations with the Sauber team concerning the supply of engines," said Helmut Panke. "Frank Williams is aware of that. The overall strategy is that all engine manufacturers will be asked to supply at least two teams... for the 2006 season."<br><br>Ferrari, who announced last month that they would be supplying Red Bull Racing with engines, currently equip Sauber under the Petronas badge. BMW are envious and frustrated at the success rival manufacturers like Ferrari and Renault enjoy in the lucrative world of Grand Prix racing.<br><br>"The performance of the BMW-Williams team up to now has not been such a high performance that we will expect easily to become champions this season. Formula One is the premium league in motor sports. This is why BMW will continue to be in there. This is why it will have to find a way to be successful and achieve a way to become champion in Formula One. I clearly say that with the current 'midfield position' of BMW, we are not happy."<br><br>As to BMW going it alone Panke said: "The question of having our own team has come up over and over, because whenever, for example, Renault does very well, people say, 'look, Ferrari and Renault, they are the ones who show us what should be done.'"<br><br>Williams are equal fourth with Ferrari on 18 points in the race for the constructor's title ahead of Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gianmaria Bruni wins from Scott Speed<br>Barcelona - GP2 - Race 1<br><br>Gianmaria Bruni showed it to Speed in GP2<br><br>Former Minardi F1 racer Gianmaria Bruni won todayÂ’s GP2 series race after a dominant drive in an exciting race. The Coloni Motorsport driver led from the start and held off a late charge from iSport InternationalÂ’s Scott Speed in the final laps to take a great win. Heikki Kovalainen took the final podium position in third, following another great drive, this time from eleventh.<br><br>As the five red lights were extinguished at the start, it was Bruni who got the jump on pole sitter Scott Speed. They diced side by side down the main straight, but it was Bruni who made it through turn one first. From there, he pulled out a two second lead from Jose Maria Lopez, who had also managed to get past Speed at the first turn.<br><br>By lap 18 however, Speed had caught up to the back of Lopez, and as the DAMS driver fought with the American, Bruni pulled out a commanding lead. On lap 24 Lopez pitted, leaving Speed in free air to try and pull back BruniÂ’s advantage. When Bruni stopped three laps later, Speed put the hammer down.<br><br>He led for five laps, before pitting himself at the end of lap 31. His pit crew got him back on the road quickly and he emerged less than five seconds behind the Italian. The next time past the pits the gap was down to 3.3 seconds, then 1.9, and with just four laps to go, Speed was less than a second behind Bruni. Gimmi, however, had something in reserve, and put in his two personal quickest laps of the race to pull the smallest of margins back out again, crossing the finish line 1.203 ahead of the American.<br><br>KovalainenÂ’s third podium in a row came after a similarly determined fight. Having made an early compulsory pitstop, the Finn was left in clean air to set some fast lap times. When the pitstops played out, he was in fourth, but a mistake by Lopez saw Heikki snatch third place. Neel Jani and Nelson Piquet Jr also swept past the DAMS to take fourth and fifth, with Lopez taking sixth, Carroll seventh and NegrÃ£o eighth. Nico Rosberg set the fastest lap of the race with a 1:25.875 on the penultimate lap.<br><br>Kovalainen therefore maintains his lead in the championship standings on 20 points, followed by Bruni with 18 and Speed on 16.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Schumacher talks down Alonso title hopes<br>McLaren Mercedes the ones to watch out for<br><br>Tough times for Schumacher<br>and the Italian Champions<br><br>Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher talked down the title hopes of Fernando Alonso here Saturday as the Spanish driver continued his chase for victory on home soil in the Spanish Grand Prix. Alonso has been tipped as heir apparent to Schumacher after winning the last three races but the German, whose Ferrari team are struggling this year, insists Alonso is just one in a queue of drivers lining up to take his crown.<br><br>"I know this comparison (between Schumacher and Alonso) is fashionable at the moment but I have to say I have a bit of a problem with it," said Schumacher. "There are a lot of other guys who are very fast. Clearly it would be an advantage for us if we scored more points than him but again there are also other drivers that I see fighting for the championship. I still believe McLaren Mercedes will have a big chance."<br><br>Alonso set himself up for another strong challenge in Sunday's race at the Circuit de Catalunya when he finished second to provisional pole position winner Jarno Trulli in first qualifying here Saturday. Schumacher, who pushed Alonso hard for victory at the last race in San Marino, was a disappointing seventh fastest of the 18 drivers but he insisted his pace in the race will allow him to close on his rivals.<br><br>"For one lap we are not strong enough, but I am certainly much happier on race pace, we are much more competitive then," said Schumacher, before admitting his hopes of victory are still slim. "We are strong in long runs but not that much compared to the others and it will be extremely difficult to win, but in racing nothing is certain."<br><br>Schumacher, who started 13th at the last race after a mistake in second qualifying, faces the first task of securing seventh place on the grid or improving his position in final qualifying Sunday morning. But he admitted: "We have already proven that we have struggled on the one-lap qualifying and you have to say whatever happens in final qualifying, this is not the ideal position on the grid."<br><br>Team boss Jean Todt remained philosophical after the opening qualifying run, insisting that making race predictions was futile and suggesting that he is hoping to capitalize on reliability problems of their rivals. "We are not really surprised by qualifying," said Todt. "We know what are our strong and our weak points and it is clear that in tomorrow's qualifying we will not be able to do much to move up the order. But if Michael can stay pretty much where he is at the moment, then we have a fighting chance, given that reliability and consistency of performance of the various car-engine-tyre packages will play a key role."<br><br>"So far this season, our performance levels in the races have come from both ends of the spectrum, so it is hard to make predictions about what might happen in the race."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1st qualifying - Driver's quote-<br><br>Jarno Trulli, Toyota (1st, 1m 14.795s):<br>"I'm delighted to be on provisional pole, and especially so because this is the first time Panasonic Toyota Racing has managed the feat. My lap was nice and clear but I must say I'm surprised to have taken such a perfect result. I was struggling to find grip this morning, but in the end things went much better in qualifying. I have no doubt that the race will be hard tomorrow as the front of the grid is so tight, but we will do our very best to convert this result into pole position tomorrow morning. Then I will give everything I have in the race."<br><br>Fernando Alonso, Renault (2nd, +0.016s):<br>Â“It was a special qualifying session for me, to be competing in front of all the fans and see their support around the lap today. In the car, I made a couple of small mistakes on my timed lap, so I am pleased to be in the top three for tomorrow morning and, probably, the race. There was a little more grip out there than I had expected, so I am encouraged because the car has the potential to be faster. But it has felt good all weekend, and I think we are set up well for tomorrow in second qualifying and the race, when I will be able to attack even more.Â”<br><br>Kimi Raikkonen, McLaren (3rd, +0.024s):<br>"A pretty good result considering that we started quite early in the session. I'm upset as I made a mistake at Turn Two by going wide and I lost probably around half a second - without that we would have been quickest. However it's tomorrow where it really counts and I can't wait. The car has been working well and we have the pace so with a strong lap we should be in with a chance of a good starting position."<br><br>Ralf Schumacher, Toyota (4th, +0.075s):<br>"I'm happy with my lap, which was good and clear. Perhaps I was a bit too cautious in the windy final sector, but to finish so close to the front is great news. I ended up only 75 thousandths of a second off pole, so I can't complain! In the end, it could have gone either way but even though I am not on provisional pole I am still confident looking ahead to tomorrow. The performance is there, the car is there, the tyres are there and I'm very confident with the car on race fuel. So now I will look to capitalise on this good start in the race. Tomorrow's another day and that's what counts."<br><br>Nick Heidfeld, Williams (5th, +0.243s):<br>Â“I am happy with my lap today, although I didnÂ’t push flat out knowing that I will have to start my race from the back. With regards to the set-up of my car, it was much better in qualifying compared to this morningÂ’s free practice sessions. Since we have known that I will have to start from the back we have concentrated even more on race set-up and I am quite confident that we have the potential for a strong race tomorrow. We are going to try our best on Sunday but itÂ’s not going to be easy starting from the back.Â”<br><br>Mark Webber, Williams (6th, +0.247s):<br>Â“I had a pretty clean lap notwithstanding that this place is incredibly sensitive to the wind. Anyway, itÂ’s the same for everyone else. I didnÂ’t have any running at all yesterday, due to the engine issue and of course I would have preferred to have put a few more laps under my belt in order to get better prepared for the race, but thatÂ’s what IÂ’ve got and 6th is not too bad. Since they laid the new tarmac, this is a different Barcelona circuit to what we were used to in the past. ItÂ’s pretty good and a lot easier on the tyres compared to what we had before.Â”<br><br>Michael Schumacher, Ferrari (7th, +0.603s):<br>Â“It was a reasonable performance in this qualifying session. I was looking strong in the first sector, but then lost about four tenths in the last two. If we look at my pace this morning, it is obvious we have made up some ground this afternoon, closing the gap to the others. Whatever happens in final qualifying, this is not the ideal position on the grid. So we will have to rely on our race performance. I am much happier with that and I think we are much more competitive in race trim. It is fair to say, we are still struggling with our single lap performance.Â”<br><br>Giancarlo Fisichella, Renault (8th, +0.806s):<br>Â“I did a clean lap, maybe a little conservative, but the important thing for me was to make up positions and get into the top eight. I think things will be better tomorrow morning - Heidfeld will lose positions with his penalty, and Michael (Schumacher) is only two tenths ahead of me, so I hope I can climb up into the top six in qualifying. For the race, we have a good pace in longer runs and a good set-up for tomorrow afternoon. The podium is a long way to go from eighth, but I certainly think I can score a good points finish.Â”<br><br>Rubens Barrichello, Ferrari (9th, +0.951s):<br>Â“Obviously, IÂ’m a bit disappointed that we had to change the engine on my car before this qualifying session. The car seemed to be difficult to drive over the one quick lap even though the balance of the car was quite good. The situation was not helped by the fact I made my run in the early part of the session. I think the car is good in race trim, although of course I will be losing ten places on the grid, which will make life difficult. It is a similar situation to Imola in some ways, in that we seem to struggle in qualifying, but on old tyres in the race, I am sure we will be much stronger.Â”<br><br>David Coulthard, Red Bull (10th, +1.000s):<br>Â”I was a bit too cautious in the final sector of my lap, so I think I could have got another half second out of the car. We have done a slightly better job in qualifying here than we did in Imola, but I think we still need to get more out of the carÂ’s potential. That is the only way for us to move forward. Having said that, I am reasonably comfortable with the race balance for tomorrow.Â”<br><br>Felipe Massa, Sauber (11th, +1.068s):<br>"I had a good lap and the balance was okay, a bit of understeer here and some oversteer there, probably because of the wind, but nothing too bad. With a similar performance in tomorrow's final qualifying I think we can do a good job in the race."<br><br>Juan Pablo Montoya, McLaren (12th, +1.107s):<br>"It's always a disadvantage to be one of the first cars out on the track as the conditions will improve throughout the session. My engineer actually said earlier today that we would be lucky to be in the top ten. It was my first run on new tyres and the circuit had changed from this morning, particularly the direction of the wind and I had a lot of understeer. However there is another qualifying session in the morning and I think we will be in a good position for the race. I'm feeling fine and have experienced no problem with my shoulder and am looking forward to the rest of the weekend."<br><br>Vitantonio Liuzzi, Red Bull (13th, +1.493s):<br>Â“Qualifying did not go too well for me. I had a problem with the brakes at turn 10. We changed something on the brakes before the session and it obviously did not do the job. Also, I locked the car in the hairpin and went straight otherwise the car was not too bad. But I think it will be very difficult for us tomorrow, in terms of moving up the grid. We will have to wait and see how the race pans out.Â”<br><br>Jacques Villeneuve, Sauber (14th, +1.999s):<br>"The balance of the car was not too bad this afternoon, so really I expected to be faster. Sometimes this season it's been a problem for me getting the best out of the tyres over a single lap, but the gap was quite big today. The car felt okay but that grip situation seemed to be a little bit extreme here, so I'm mystified."<br><br>Narain Karthikeyan, Jordan (15th, +3.762s):<br>Â“It has not been my quickest lap since the beginning of the weekend but I am nevertheless still satisfied. It was a bit difficult to warm up the tyres, but then the car balance was ok. The race tomorrow will be very exciting, as all drivers know the Circuit de Catalunya quite well and I hope we will finish the race in a good position.Â”<br><br>Tiago Monteiro, Jordan (16th, +4.245s):<br>Â“The car was different to drive compared to this morning as the track temperature was warmer, but I did a good lap. I am sure that we have chosen the right Bridgestone tyres and the right car set-up for tomorrowÂ’s race. Now we have to put together the different bits that we have learnt and see where we can improve.Â”<br><br>Christijan Albers, Minardi (17th, +4.768s):<br>"It was a reasonable qualifying lap, even though we had some understeer. It is also a satisfying result, as we had some bad luck yesterday and this morning. Everyone is working really hard, and we are definitely going in the right direction - I think we will have a good car for the race."<br><br>Patrick Friesacher, Minardi (18th, +5.511s):<br>"I'm not so happy with qualifying, as I was more than a second quicker in free practice this morning. I had more understeer for this afternoon's run and there just wasn't enough grip, so I couldn't really push the car hard in the way I would have liked. We'll have to see if we can improve tomorrow."</div>

Short term results, long term disadvantage.<br><br>Anyways the way ferrari is trying to damage the sport on the issue of testing, im not surprised they're not doing well. how hilarious. testing so much extra and yet can't even finish decently? no wonder they're against a testing cap!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
