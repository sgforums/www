Not only is it a fantastic example of a track that combines speed with skill, it also has a heart and soul all its own. It has seen some of the finest races of all time, but also some of the sport's worst accidents. The names of the great drivers and the sounds of engines from years gone by linger in the grand old trees which surround the track in the royal park.<br><br>Work began on the track in 1922 and was completed in under half a year. After Brooklands and Indianapolis it was the third permanent race track in existence. With a banked oval track incorporated into the design of the road racing circuit, the total track length stood at a whopping 10 kilometres.<br><br>The list of famous victories and horrifying accidents is long, and all combine to make Monza one of the most magical places on the Formula One calendar. For many there is nowhere that encapsulates the sport better than this circuit. The Italians call it "La Pista Magica," the magic track, a description few would disagree with.<br><br>Monza is a small town located 16km to the north-east of Milan. The circuit is easily reached from the city using the A1 and A4 motorways, and then the local S36 that provides access to Monza.<br><br>By train, from Milan go to Monza Station. Free shuttle buses are normally laid on over the race weekend from there to the circuit, travelling on the black line.<br><br>Linate airport, just to the east of Milan, handles domestic and European flights, while Malpensa airport, to the north-west, handles international traffic.<br></div>

Look at the first few laps and see how Alonso kept popping out of Button's slipstream - having to push the car that hard did not help cooling at all, and quite certainly would shorten its life span the way Alonso was fighting for the points.  Nice bit of cheating by the FIA - err, Ferrari team.<br><br>Well, still and all, I can't begin to describe how glad I am to see the back of Scum.
