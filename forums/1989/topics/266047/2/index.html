            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ferrari furious at hearing outcome </strong><br><br>Ferrari has responded with anger and disgust to the FIA's decision not to penalise McLaren for possessing leaked data.<br><br>At today's extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Paris, McLaren was found guilty of having broken the sporting code when a 780-page dossier of Ferrari information was found at chief designer Mike Coughlan's home Â– but was not punished because there was "insufficient evidence" that the team had made use of the data.<br><br>This decision has enraged Ferrari, which believes the guilty verdict should have carried a punishment regardless of whether there was proof that McLaren had benefited from the information.<br><br>"Ferrari notes that Vodafone McLaren Mercedes has been found guilty by the FIA World Council," said a Ferrari statement.<br><br>"It therefore finds it incomprehensible that violating the fundamental principle of sporting honesty does not have, as a logical and inevitable consequence, the application of a sanction."<br><br>The FIA's original summons to McLaren referred only to the team having "unauthorised possession of documents and confidential information belonging to Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro, including information that could be used to design, engineer, build, check, test, develop and/or run a 2007 Ferrari Formula 1 car."<br><br>Ferrari vehemently rejected McLaren's defence that the case related only to a rogue individual rather than the team as a whole.<br><br>It claimed that the FIA verdict undermined Formula 1.<br><br>"Today's decision legitimises dishonest behaviour in Formula 1 and sets a very serious precedent," the statement continued.<br><br>"In fact, the decision of the World Council signifies that possession, knowledge at the very highest level and use of highly confidential information acquired in an illicit manner and the acquiring of confidential information over the course of several months, represent violations that do not carry any punishment.<br><br>"The fact that Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of such information was discovered totally by accident and, but for this, the team would continue to have it.<br><br>"This is all the more serious as it has occurred in a sport like Formula 1 in which small details make all the difference.<br><br>"Ferrari feels this is highly prejudicial to the credibility of the sport."<br><br>The team did not make any comment about whether it would appeal against the FIA's decision, but it will continue to pursue the cases it has brought against Coughlan and its former engineer Nigel Stepney, who is the alleged source of the leak.<br><br>"It will continue with the legal action already under way within the Italian criminal justice system and in the civil court in England," Ferrari's statement concluded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And now Ferrari are considering appealing against the decision.<br><br>CEO Jean Todt said <span style="color: blue;">the fact McLaren that questioned FerrariÂ’s compliance with the bodywork regulations at the start of the season and called for a clarification of the rules was attributable to inside knowledge of his teamÂ’s designs.</span><br><br>And he claimed the more stringent bodywork deflection tests subsequently introduced Â– which were believed to hurt Ferrari more than other teams Â– showed that McLaren had gained an advantage even if it had not incorporated Ferrari designs on its own car.<br><br>Â“During [the WMSC] meeting, the McLaren bosses, with no exceptions, admitted that their chief designer had obtained since back in March, prior to the Australian GP, documents from Nigel Stepney,Â” said Todt.<br><br>Â“Some of this data was used to prepare a clarification request submitted to the FIA, aimed clearly at us, given that throughout the Melbourne weekend, the McLaren team principal and his closest colleagues made statements in which they threw doubt over Â‘some carsÂ’.<br><br>Â“Therefore, such information was in fact used to obtain an advantage over us: not through an improvement in their performance, but instead through limiting ours.<br><br>Â“It is important to underline that the information used to try and damage Ferrari through the FIA might be only a part of the information received by McLaren.Â”<br><br>Todt argued that possession of leaked information was sufficient grounds for a penalty, and said it was unreasonable for the burden of proof to lie with Ferrari.<br><br>Â“As confirmed in that decision yesterday, <span style="color: blue;">the violation was already there in the simple possession of the information, which in itself constitutes an enormous advantage in a sport like Formula 1,</span>Â” he said.<br><br>Â“In FerrariÂ’s opinion, it is like playing a hand of poker with a rival who already knows what cards you are holding.<br><br>Â“It remains incomprehensible that apart from possession, one must also demonstrate the effective and visible use of this information on the McLaren car.<br><br>Â“Actually, this very same fact, on the basis of available information which the FIA used to find McLaren guilty, shows that the offence lies in the possession without the need to prove anything else.<br><br>Â“The proof is there and this led to the FIAÂ’s decision. Therefore I find it difficult to understand how the verdict makes sense.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Â“Furthermore, I have to say that the proof of effective use requested by the FIA is impossible for Ferrari to furnish, because of course, Ferrari does not have access to the McLaren car.Â”</span><br><br>Todt accused McLaren boss Ron Dennis of reneging on an understanding they had reached to establish a better working relationship between the two arch-rival teams.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Â“A few weeks after the race in Melbourne, the McLaren team principal proposed that we should reach a sort of agreement to establish a better relationship between our two teams, thus avoiding any future denunciations to the sporting authority,Â”</span> Todt said.<br><br>Â“I replied that I found it impossible to believe him, because on several occasions we had seen that certain commitments had always been disregarded by McLaren.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Â“There was an exchange of views and, believing in their good faith, I agreed to sign this agreement on 9th June last.</span><br><br>Â“Since that time and even earlier, McLaren was perfectly aware, not only of the emails sent by their informer within our company, but also of the fact that their chief designer had stayed in contact with him and had received and continued to be in possession of a significant amount of technical information that belonged to us.<br><br>Â“So, on the one hand, they had come to say Â‘let us trust one anotherÂ’, and on the other they were hiding serious facts such as those just stated above, but making no effort to inform us as would have been in the spirit and to the letter of our agreement.Â”</div>
