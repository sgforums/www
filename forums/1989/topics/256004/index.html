Narrow and winding, it's the slowest on the calendar. The race distance is 45 km short of the usual grand prix distance but it still takes the longest time to complete even in fair conditions.<br><br>Speaking of the weather, it last rained on race day in 1996 and 1997. Only 3 cars, led by Ligier's Olivier Panis, finished the former, and in both races the chequered flag fell at the 2-hour mark.<br><br>The close proximity of the armco barriers and the absence of run-off areas demand absolute concentration from the drivers. attack kerbs and graze barriers on their flying laps, but the tiny mistake can spell the end of one's race. However, the perfect lap is an absolute joy for the viewer to watch. It is a circuit that separates the men from the boys.<br><br>A very high downforce configuration, short gear ratios and very soft tyres characterise the Monaco car set-up. Attrition is usually high, not only due to accidents but also the lack of cooling the engines receive and the battering the gearboxes get.<br><br>The late Ayrton Senna holds the record of 6 wins at this track. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the first of those 6 victories. Michael Schumacher and Graham Hill are tied on 5 apiece. The German will be remembered for his sensational drive to victory in 1997 and also for stalling his car towards the end of qualifying last season, a move which raised questions about his sportsmanship and earned him a penalty.<br><br>McLaren-Mercedes' Fernando Alonso goes into this season's race as defending winner and holder of pole position. However it is his teammate Lewis Hamilton who currently leads the drivers' championship. Hamilton has won on this circuit in GP2. Other winners on the grid include Kimi RÃ¤ikkonen, David Coulthard and Jarno Trulli.<br><br><strong>Free practice takes place on Thursday instead of Friday.</strong> Qualifying and the race will be held on Saturday and Sunday respectively at 2 p.m. (8 p.m. for us)</div>
