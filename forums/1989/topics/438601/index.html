              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPRORE: A 
              furious Felipe Massa confronted Lewis Hamilton after the Singapore Grand
               Prix on Sunday, as the drivers followed up their clash on the track 
              with an angry exchange.<br><br>Brazilian Massa accused the 2008 champion
               Hamilton of not using his mind following a collision as they scrapped 
              for fifth place in the early stages.<br><br>The Ferrari driver, who 
              suffered a puncture that spoiled his race, said Hamilton, of McLaren, 
              had almost caused a very dangerous accident and demanded that the 
              sport's ruling body, the FIA, penalise him. <br><br>Massa confronted his
               rival in the mixed zone, where drivers talk to the media, slapping 
              Hamilton on the shoulder before spinning him round to offer a sarcastic 
              thumbs-up, and telling him he had done a "good job, very good job". <br><br>Hamilton responded by shouting: "Don't touch me man. Don't touch me." <br><br>Asked to explain the incident, Hamilton said: "Well, there you go." He then left without commenting further. <br><br>Massa
               said: "How many races this year he did this? He went in the wrong 
              direction and he paid and he never learned. The FIA is looking for sure 
              for that, because he is doing that so many times. <br><br>"I think he is not learning. I tried to speak to him after we waited, but he didn't listen to me. <br><br>"I
               called to him two times, but he didn't listen to me, he went past me. 
              He didn't even look to me... I called him to speak, but when I saw him 
              go, I said, 'Very good job, well done. Like that you will win many 
              championships.'" <br><br>McLaren team chief Martin Whitmarsh moved 
              swiftly to defend his driver and said he, like most observers, viewed 
              their collision as a pure racing accident. <br><br>He said: "Lewis is 
              still a young guy, he is learning and he will learn from all of this. He
               will win races and I am sure he is going to win more  championships. <br><br>"He
               is an aggressive and assertive driver, but he will win many more races 
              than you or I and I am sure he will win many championships." <br><br>Hamilton's
               incident packed race saw him start fourth, slide to eighth, recover, 
              collide with Massa - breaking his front wing - and make five pit-stops, 
              including a drive-through penalty.<br><br>He finished in fifth place, after at one time running 18th, while Massa finished ninth. <br><br>Hamilton has suffered a spate of controversial incidents this year and has been accused of being over-aggressive and dangerous. <br><br>Whitmarsh
               said: "When you are told you are back in 18th or 19th place in a race 
              like this on a circuit like that, it is deeply, deeply frustrating. <br><br>"So, to deal with that and perform as well as he did was extraordinary - so he should have some credit for that. <br><br>"But none of us are perfect, the team has made some mistakes and we will make more mistakes. <br><br>"We don't want to, but that is life."<br><br>- AFP/de</span></span></p>

              <p>He is complaining because Hamilton's excessively dangerous driving caused an accident and caused him the points for the race.</p>
              <p>F1 is not about this type of dangerous driving. Aggressiveness should not be confused with reckless.</p>

              <p>I don't know the details so not able to comment, but I noticed the article said Massa had a tire punctured because of the accident. I don't know how bad Hamilton's car was after the collision, but a punctured tire could have made a significant impact till he was able to get to the pits.</p>
              <p>This is a race where 1/10 of a second is crucial and I understand that the Singapore track doesn't have much chances for over taking.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying whether Massa is any good as a F1 driver, but your basis to say that he is not good is not valid.</p>
              <p>Besides, the issue here is not whether Massa is any good as a F1 driver. The reckless actions of Hamilton is the problem.</p>

              <p>no denying hamilton is reckless.  but he is a damn good racer.  we need more drivers who are willing to overtake and take risk.  frankly a formula race is boring without incidents.</p>
              <p>i dont understand why ferrari is keeping massa.  it isnt he is not good, just not good enough for the front runners.</p>

              <p>That's got nothing to do with whether or not Shamilton should be at the wheel.  The fact is that he's been involved in a bucketload of incidents this year.  That's not racing - that's just crashing.</p>

              <p>Motor Racing: Hamilton doesn't learn, says Massa</p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SUZUKA, Japan: 
              Brazilian Felipe Massa reacted angrily after clashing with Briton Lewis 
              Hamilton during Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix - the second on-track 
              altercation between the pair in as many races.<br><br>Massa and Hamilton
               were fighting over fourth place on lap 21 of Sunday's 53-lap race when 
              they clashed under braking at the final chicane, with Hamilton's McLaren
               snapping part of the front wing endplate off Massa's Ferrari.<br><br>The
               resultant debris caused the safety car to come out for a three-lap 
              period, and Massa was furious with Hamilton after the race.<br><br>The 
              incident came just one race after Hamilton crashed into the back of 
              Massa in Singapore, a move which punctured the Brazilian's left rear 
              tyre and saw the Briton hit with a drive-through penalty.<br><br>Massa confronted Hamilton after that race, leading to a brief physical and verbal altercation.<br><br>Hamilton
               finished fifth at Suzuka while Massa came home seventh, with the two 
              drivers separated by just four seconds at the end of the race.<br><br>Massa
               said he didn't care to hear Hamilton's explanation for the incident, 
              which was the third time this season that the pair have come together in
               a race.<br><br>"I don't care to be honest about what he said, the only thing I care about is what he did," Massa said.<br><br>"I
               was much quicker, so I went to the left-hand side and I braked there. I
               stayed on my line (and) he moved his car and touched my car. There's 
              nothing more to say."<br><br>Massa called for the FIA, the sport's 
              governing body, to be tougher on Hamilton in future races. Race stewards
               investigated Sunday's clash but elected to take no further action. <br><br>"They have penalised people for much less this year and this time they didn't do it," Massa said.<br><br>"For
               what he says, I don't care. He doesn't learn. I race against him, 
              against whatever driver in the same way. He has already passed the time 
              to speak, which I tried and he didn't."<br><br>Hamilton downplayed the incident, blaming the incident on the lack of visibility afforded by the wing mirrors on his car.<br><br>"I don't really know what happened with Felipe - I had no idea he was there. I have no problems with him," Hamilton said.<br><br>"The
               only thing I have to say is that I can't see anything out of my mirrors
               and they vibrate down the straight so much. Maybe it's something we can
               fix.<br><br>"I want to apologise for our cars touching, but fortunately nothing happened to either of us.<br><br>"There was no bad intention towards Felipe."<br><br>- AFP/fa</span></span></p>
