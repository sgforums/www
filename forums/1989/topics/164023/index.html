            <div class='col-md body'>Race Track: Sepang International Circuit<br><br>Location: Malaysia<br><br>Race Day: Sunday, 20 November 2005<br><br><img src="http://www.a1gp.com/images/tracks/lg_sepang.gif"><br><a href="http://www.a1gp.com/images/tracks/sup_sepang.gif" rel="nofollow">click for larger view</a><br><br>The Sepang International Circuit consists of three circuits in one. The main racetrack is 5.542km with the South Track being 2.7km and the North Track 2.8km. The latter was the final one to be completed and hosted its first official race in July 2003.<br>One of the spectacular features of the circuit is the smooth and sweeping chicane capable of being negotiated at speeds in excess of 200kph. The fastest part of the circuit is the start/finish straight between turn 15 and turn 1.<br>The track features 15 corners and eight straights with a minimum width of 16m increasing to 25m in some parts, providing many overtaking opportunities. The circuit is covered by 27 closed circuit TV cameras via fibre optic cabling and includes on-line, real time tracking of race cars, combined with electronic marshal posts which will flash coloured lights to the drivers instead of flags.<br>World champion F1 driver, Michael Schumacher was consulted on the design of the track in his capacity as a member of the Formula One Drivers Safety Commission.<br>The architecture of the Sepang complex blends modern technology with the Malaysian culture. In total, the track can accommodate some 130,000 spectators, with 30,000 in the unique double-fronted main grandstand whose roof resembles a banana leaf. Tilke introduced the first double frontage grandstand to be built at any racing circuit.<br>As the track has been built in a stadium-type location, with the track recessed in the valley, all spectators can see at least 50% of the circuit no matter where they sit. The Canopy Tower, nestling at the tip of the V-shaped double grandstand, has a roof similar to the Malaysian national flower, the hibiscus. Seats here give a view of 70% of the track.<br>The two-storey pit building is one of the largest in the world, housing all the main facilities. There are 30 pits, including 12 offices for the FIA and administration, plus race control, time keeping, media centre and interview room plus photographers' room. There is also a medical centre including a small operating theatre to handle minor surgery.<br><br>Hermann Tilke of Tilke Engineering from Aachen, Germany designed the circuit working with local company Iktisas Ingenieurs.<br>The state-of-the-art circuit, Sepang International Circuit was officially opened on March 9, 1999 by the Prime Minister Dato? Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. It was completed in a record of 14 months and with the recognition of its ultramodern facilities, it was given the honour to incorporate the F1 logo in its name.<br>The 5.542km (3.443 mile) track was built in just 14 months by main contractor WCT Engineering on a 260ha former palm oil plantation near to Kuala Lumpa International Airport (KLIA), who own and manage the circuit.<br>The Malaysian Government requested KLIA to obtain the rights to host a Grand Prix, and subsequently build the circuit. A taskforce was then formed to ensure that the circuit project would run smoothly. Members of the taskforce went to Formula One circuits around the world to learn about the layout and organisation of a Grand Prix.<br>In December 1996, a masterplan was presented to the Prime Minister and soon after, work began. At its peak there was over 1,000 people working on the site. In December 1998, the circuit opened with its first race meeting, the Proton 300km Merdeka.<br>Two months later, it was also awarded a two-year licence for motorcycle racing, which culminated in the Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix.<br>Over nine million cubic metres of earth were moved on the 115,000mÂ² site during the construction. Local company, Pakar International, constructed the wastewater treatment plant for the circuit.<br>PKNS Infra Berhad (PIB), a subsidiary of Selangor State Development Corporation (PKNS) carried out the landscaping work throughout the circuit site. PJIH provided the electrical HT/LV distribution system and high mast lighting for the racetrack along with the telephone system and external infrastructure works.<br>The 2005 Formula One Grand Prix was the biggest race day attendance in the history of the Formula One Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix, which previously recorded the highest attendance in 2003 with 101,455 spectators. Last year, the statistics stood at 84, 010 as the 2004 race clashed with the general elections.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>19/11/2005 - Sepang Â– After an exciting afternoonÂ’s qualifying which saw the last three sessions declared wet as the black clouds rolled in and heavy rain fell on the Sepang International Circuit, A1 Team Switzerland has taken its first pole position at the Malaysia A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Sepang International Circuit, 2005 presented by Astro.<br><br>Neel Jani said: Â‘It was very difficult on track today as there was rain on some corners and not on others. I thought I would have been able to go faster in the second session but there was drizzle in some parts of the track. It is very difficult to make a tyre choice in those conditions. It is very difficult to read the weather here and it could start to rain in the race, but we did get the chance to try a dry set-up in the damp conditions to see how the car reacts.Â’<br><br>Commenting on the rolling start in the Sprint race, Jani said: Â‘In the first race it is easy to tell who is professional or not. The first race is really about looking after the car and getting a good grid position. Tomorrow I have some professional drivers around me so it should be ok.Â’<br><br>Twenty-four A1 Teams took to the track in the first session, all recording lap times within 2.506 seconds of each other. As the rain started to fall in the second session, lap times increased and as conditions worsened, session three became a wash out. Only three teams, those from the Czech Republic, Mexico and Lebanon braved the treacherous track to complete their flying lap. The rain eased slightly as session four began and 18 A1 Teams chose to complete the session although with slower lap times, the table remained unchanged from the first two sessions.<br><br>Alexandre Premat, who will take second position on the Sprint race grid said: Â‘The second session was good, although I think we decided to go out too late, and it made it difficult behind so many cars and the track was getting wetter. We have learnt a lot about how to prepare the car in the different conditions and I hope to win tomorrow. If it rains tomorrow it will be very difficult as vision behind another car is very bad.Â’<br><br>A1 Team Ireland achieved their best qualifying result to date, putting them third on the Sprint race grid. Driver, Ralph Firman said: Â‘IÂ’ve had a really good weekend. We were very strong, and although we didnÂ’t have the best lap in the first session we had a good lap in the second session. ItÂ’s hard to tell what will happen tomorrow as we donÂ’t know what the weather conditions will be. It is a wide circuit and there will be good overtaking possibilities. For those that look after the tyres through the race there will be chances to overtake near the end. Being in the top three is good and we have a great opportunity and chance of winning a race tomorrow.Â’<br><br>A1 Team Malaysia, who also put in their best ever qualifying result are the only team that will take advantage of A1 Grand PrixÂ’s unique rule which allows them to swap drivers between qualifying and the two races. While Alex Yoong qualified in seventh position, Fairuz Fauzy will drive in tomorrowÂ’s Sprint Race and Alex in the Feature Race.<br><br>A1 Team  Driver  Aggregate Time<br>1  Switzerland  Neel Jani  3.48.962<br>2  France  Alexandre Premat  3.49.868<br>3  Ireland  Ralph Firman  3.49.969<br>4  Great Britain  Robbie Kerr  3.49.972<br>5  New Zealand  Matt Halliday  3.50.569<br>6  Netherlands  Jos Verstappen  3.51.036<br>7  Malaysia  Alex Yoong  3.51.199<br>8  Brazil  Nelson Piquet Jr  3.51.398<br>9  Portugal  Alvaro Parente  3.51.547<br>10  Italy  Enrico Toccacelo  3.51.894<br>11  Indonesia  Ananda Mikola  3.51.996<br>12  USA  Bryan Herta  3.52.013<br>13  South Africa  Stephen Simpson  3.52.118<br>14  Pakistan  Adam Khan  3.52.200<br>15  India  Armaan Ebrahim  3.52.829<br>16  Germany  Timo Scheider  3.53.267<br>17  Mexico  Luis Diaz  3.53.656<br>18  Czech Republic  Tomas Enge  3.53.766<br>19  Japan  Hayanari Shimoda  3.53.948<br>20  Austria  Mathias Lauda  3.54.989<br>21  China  Tengyi Jiang  3.56.047<br>22  Canada  Sean McIntosh  4.00.397<br>23  Lebanon  Khalil Beschir  4.17.659<br>24  Australia  Will Davison  4.17.860<br><br>The Sprint race will be contested over 50 miles lasting up to 30 minutes in duration.

            <div class='col-md body'>20/11/2005 - Sepang Â– A1 Grand PrixÂ’s Sprint race at the Sepang circuit produced a nail-biting climax after 15 laps of wheel-to-wheel racing. Although this was the seventh win of the season for A1 Team France, this weekendÂ’s driver Alexandre Premat worked from the start to the chequered flag and it was only on the final lap that he was able to take the lead.<br><br>France first had to pass Great Britain with Robbie Kerr getting a better start and on lap one slotting into second place behind A1 Team Switzerland, with the French car in third. A1 Team Switzerland was given some breathing space as France and Great Britain battled in the early laps. It was a slight mistake while under breaking into the hairpin on lap four that allowed France to gain the advantage into the following corner and so pass Robbie Kerr. At the end of lap five, Switzerland led France by 1.7 seconds but lap by lap, the gap came down and it was highly likely that France would manage the overtaking manoeuvre it had tried on several occasions when a gap at the start of the final lap was 0.170 seconds. SwitzerlandÂ’s Neel Jani didnÂ’t make it easy for France but after swapping positions it was finally in turn four where he had to accept the runner-up position. A1 Team France eventually won by 1.2 seconds.<br><br>Commenting on his win, Alexandre Premat said: Â‘I used my PowerBoost button to try and get past Robbie Kerr and in my mind was thinking everyone can make a mistake and hoped that those in front would do. Neel and I had a few corners very close and it was very hard. I hope to get a good start in the next race and get a good gap for the championship. That will be enough.Â’<br><br>When asked if he thought he was going to win the race Neel Jani commented: Â‘No not really. Even at the start I felt a lot of oversteer and I knew that once Alex got past Robbie it would be very difficult. On the last lap I couldnÂ’t hold him any more and had to let him past. I hope we can change the set up for the next race, the team are trying to get the car readyÂ’.<br><br>A1 Team Great Britain, who take third place on the Feature race grid said: Â‘The start was good, I went up the inside and pulled up alongside Neel Jani, but he closed the door and I had to pull back. I had to keep my head down and keep concentrating but eventually I had problems with the brakes and ran wide. The brakes had no feel and I had understeer into the corners.Â’<br><br>While the focus was on the leaders, there was tough competition all the way down the field particularly between Portugal and USA and India and Germany with the youngest driver in the Series, 16 year old Armaan Ebrahim driving with skill beyond his years and giving his team their best finish to date with eleventh.<br><br>Twenty of the 24 teams completed the race with Australia pitting twice, first after losing bodywork in a clash on the first lap and then with a front left puncture after completing just four laps. Both Lebanon and Indonesia retired with mechanical problems although Ananda Mikola had to pit at the end of lap one after damaging his front wing in the scrabble to the first corner.<br><br>The home driver, Fairuz Fauzy had double cause for celebration, setting a personal best finishing eighth for A1 Team Malaysia and also announcing his engagement.<br><br>A1 Team  Driver  Time<br>1  France  Alexandre Premat  29.21.541<br>2  Switzerland  Neel Jani  29.22.772<br>3  Great Britain  Robbie Kerr  29.26.606<br>4  Brazil  Nelson Piquet Jr  29.28.334<br>5  Netherlands  Jos Verstappen  29.29.514<br>6  New Zealand  Matt Halliday  29.34703<br>7  Ireland  Ralph Firman  29.35.423<br>8  Malaysia  Fairuz Fauzy  29.37.323<br>9  Portugal  Alvaro Parente  29.41.932<br>10  USA  Bryan Herta  29.42.386<br>11  India  Armaan Ebrahim  29.42.935<br>12  Germany  Timo Scheider  29.44.648<br>13  Pakistan  Adam Khan  29.46.755<br>14  Japan  Hayanari Shimoda  29.47.788<br>15  Canada  Sean McIntosh  29.48.949<br>16  Czech Republic  Tomas Enge  29.51.551<br>17  Italy  Enrico Toccacelo  29.52.712<br>18  Austria  Mathias Lauda  29.53.179<br>19  Mexico  Luis Diaz  29.55.912<br>20  China  Tengyi Jiang  29.58.622<br>21  South Africa  Stephen Simpson  9 laps<br>22  Lebanon  Khalil Beschir  9 laps<br>23  Indonesia  Ananda Mikola  5 laps<br>24  Australia  Will Davison  4 laps<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>20/11/2005 - Sepang, 20 November Â– Eight has proved a lucky number in Malaysia for A1 Team France who won the Feature race after starting from pole position while A1 Team Switzerland again followed home in second place. However, there was a newcomer to the podium with A1 Team Czech Republic finishing in third, one place higher than their previous best.<br><br>This time France made no mistake by getting away and into an early and unchallenged lead with A1 Team GBR taking second. It was Switzerland who pressured BritainÂ’s Robbie Kerr but was not able to overtake him until lap 12 after the two of them had been racing wheel to wheel for about one third of a lap.<br><br>Alexandre Premat, who amazingly only used one of his eight PowerBoosts throughout the Feature race said: Â‘I used the PowerBoost button once to pass Neel Jani and after that the race was quiet. After the start I was in front and was lucky because Neel was fighting with Robbie Kerr. The car was great to drive and I decided with my engineer that it was best to do a pit stop in the middle of the race, as the car was becoming difficult to drive. The team did a great pit stop. I know Neel was pushing really hard and it was the mechanics that did a good stop and got me out about 15 seconds in front of him. Ten laps before the end I was backing off and looking at the car.Â’<br><br>A1 Team SwitzerlandÂ’s Neel Jani commented: Â‘I think we could have won easily. In the first race I was fighting the car but in the second race the car was fantastic and as soon as I passed Robbie I was able to catch Alex quickly, it was the opposite to the first race, we had a really good chance. But unfortunately the pit stop took about half a century! The car was so good that when I got out of the pit I was coming through the field really easily and passed about three cars on one lap. The PowerBoost button helped but with these cars you can follow quite easily the car in front and get close in the corners without losing any grip.Â’<br><br>Commenting on the teamÂ’s first podium finish, A1 Team Czech RepublicÂ’s Tomas Enge said: Â‘We were very unlucky in the first race, due to a bad qualifying position. At the back of the field there is more chance of an accident and that is what happened to me. I also had a gearbox problem, so the car was awful. The mechanics did a great job, and got the car ready just in time to get out of the pit lane for the second race. It was perfect, a good pit stop, although we lost a few seconds to Italy, I was able to make this time up and finish second.Â’<br><br>It was again an action-packed race with the first casualty being A1 Team China when their A1 race car rolled several times after contact with Portugal on lap two. Luckily Tengyi Jiang was soon out of the car that landed on its wheels and A1 Team Portugal was able to continue after visiting the pits for repairs. Soon after this it was India and Pakistan who collided with Armaan Ebrahim running into the back of the car driven by Adam Khan. India continued in the race although it was eventually excluded after receiving a push start from the marshals while Pakistan never made it back to the pits.<br><br>Battles down the field were fast and furious with Mexico and Australia driving side by side on lap eight while contesting fourteenth position. Two teams who had an awful lot of hard work to do were A1 Teams Netherlands and Brazil who both failed to get away from the grid with the other cars. Nelson Piquet Jr was particularly lucky as cars swerved around him on the grid but he soon started to make his way up the field and scored a point for his team.<br><br>Italy, USA, Canada and the Czech Republic were also doing battle and for several laps the four were only separated by 1.5 seconds. The pit stops came relatively late in the race with A1 Team France waiting until the end of lap 16. Until that point the order at the top had been France, Switzerland and Great Britain but of these three, only France managed a trouble-free pit stop. Theirs took just 40.5 seconds while for A1 Team GBR it was problems both getting the wheel off and putting the wheel nut on that kept them there for nearly two minutes. When the car lost all its drive a short while later it was all over for the British team. The Swiss stop at the end of lap 18 was 53.11 seconds.<br><br>Mexico was the last of the teams to pit and therefore its top three position as the race drew to a close was unrepresentative. At the end of lap 28, they came in from fourth and dropped down to sixteenth. The other late stopper was A1 Team Netherlands with their stop at the end of lap 26 when lying in eleventh place.<br><br>A1 Team Canada was on for a top six finish but when Sean McIntosh decided to try an overtaking manoeuvre for fifth on lap 22 that was the of the end of his race as he clipped the rear of Enrico ToccaceloÂ’s Italian car and afterwards accepted total responsibility for an error in judgement.<br><br>The local fans, the majority of whom were wearing A1 Team Malaysia t-shirts waved their flags enthusiastically every time Alex YoongÂ’s bright yellow car passed them. For them, the last lap was particularly sweet as Alex came up behind A1 Team New Zealand and used all his experience to snatch fifth place, matching the teamÂ’s highest finishing place so far.<br><br>A1 Team  Driver  Time<br>1  France  Alexandre Premat  1.00.06.495<br>2  Switzerland  Neel Jani  1.00.11.051<br>3  Czech Republic  Tomas Enge  1.00.22.184<br>4  Italy  Enrico Toccacelo  1.00.30.233<br>5  Malaysia  Alex Yoong  1.00.38.136<br>6  New Zealand  Matt Haliday  1.00.39.192<br>7  USA  Bryan Herta  1.00.39.832<br>8  Germany  Timo Scheider  1.00.41.876<br>9  Ireland  Ralph Firman  1.00.42.240<br>10  Brazil  Nelson Piquet Jr  1.00.45.883<br>11  Australia  Will Davison  1.00.56.978<br>12  South Africa  Stephen Simpson  1.00.59.334<br>13  Japan  Hayanari Shimoda  1.01.04.243<br>14  Indonesia  Ananda Mikola  1.01.11.734<br>15  Mexico  Luis Diaz  1.01.28.935<br>16  Netherlands  Jos Verstappen  1.01.53.803<br>17  Lebanon  Khalil Beschir  29 laps<br>18  Portugal  Alvaro Parente  29 laps<br>19  Canada  Sean McIntosh  21 laps<br>20  Great Britain  Robbie Kerr  20 laps<br>21  Austria  Mathias Lauda  17 laps<br>22  India  Armaan Ebrahim  11 laps<br>23  Pakistan  Adam Khan  4 laps<br>24  China  Tengyi Jiang  1 lap<br><br>Series Points to date Â– Malaysia A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Sepang International Circuit, 2005 presented by Astro (20 November 2005)<br><br>1  France  92<br>2  Switzerland  65<br>3  Brazil  60<br>4  New Zealand  42<br>5  Great Britain  38<br>6  Malaysia  32<br>7  Netherlands  32<br>8  Ireland  29<br>9  Portugal  29<br>10  Australia  26<br>11  Canada  20<br>12  Czech Republic  16<br>13  Mexico  16<br>14  USA  13<br>15  Italy  12<br>16  Germany  11<br>17  Japan  6<br>18  South Africa  6<br>19  Indonesia  5<br>20  Pakistan  4<br>21  Austria  1<br></div>
