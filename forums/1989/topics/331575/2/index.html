              <p>Oh, puh-leeze.  A few mill doesn't go as far these days as it used to.  Besides, why do they need to pay anyone off when they can just sit back and let Monkey Boy Hamilton fumble the ball for free? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>By the way, if you do want to talk about taking undeserved wins, the FIA did a sterling job last year stripping McLaren of all points for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>copying Ferrari's designs</strong></span>. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As for being political, McLaren's trying to salvage the Spa points in court is nothing other than a political exercise.  I have no objection to that - it's part of the sport.  What I do object to is how bad Mac are at it, especially in not muzzling Monkey Boy.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I thought Bernie's bullshit about catering to European audiences (after years of claiming to make F1 a world sport) was going to be this fortnight's exercise in utter and complete stupidity, but Lewis "Cochran" Hamilton took the gawd-damn cake when he went into a  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>courtroom</strong></span> and asked a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>lawyer</strong></span>: "Are you a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>racing driver</strong></span>?" and then bragged about being St Bloody George slaying the dragon when his very presence in said courtroom was by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the express arrangement of his own team</strong></span>! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Sure, I don't expect the punk to be a parchment-waving philosopher, but for the love of God, that doesn't mean that he (and his dear old dad) have to be the retard clodhoppers from the local fish and chippery. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Alonso?  He da man - the R28's not a great car but he's wringing every bit of life out of it.  By all the signs it's looking likely that he'll be with renault next year, and it'll be interesting to see how that works out.</p>
              <p>IIRC, it was in the early laps at Monza in 2004 where Alonso got bumped over a kerb and lost part of the undertray, but despite that he was still lapping within a second of the leaders.  There have been a few good drivers who have turned up on the grid since, but for a while there he was the only real racer (as opposed to driver) out there, and the man who ended Schumacher's hot streak.  McLaren were unbelievably stupid to let him out of their sight, but then again, if they had to resort to stealing other people's designs, they've fallen a long way since the red-and-white days.</p>

              <p>I dont think thats quite fair. Certainly mike and nigel were rogues. And if Fiarrari's been getting a boost for years, its quite poetic justice that someone decided to give Macca a boost, even if it wasn't welcome and caused more problems than good.</p>
              <p>However, I have to say I disagree with you. what you feel about Lewis is what I feel about Alonso.</p>

              <p>I'm not a huge Ferrari fan myself - championships need to be won on the track and not in the courtrooms or team briefing rooms.  On the other hand, stealing the other guy's designs is even worse than legally challenging the ump's call.</p>
              <p>As for Hamilton vs Alonso, apart from two WDCs, Alonso has done one thing that Hamilton hasn't, and at the current rate, may never do.  Alonso worked with Renault from 2002 through 2004 to turn them into a championship-winning team, much like what Schumacher did to end Ferrari's 20-year dry spell, and perhaps Brabham from an earlier era.  I'm a huge Senna fan, but even Senna never did that (although he was known to keep analysing the telemetry data till the engineers begged to go home).</p>
              <p>Hamilton, on the other hand, came in as Ron Dennis' hothouse project and, if his claims are to be believed, will never be in a position to lead a team to the top.  Frankly, he doesn't have much of a rep for developing cars and if he ever found himself in a midfield team, I doubt he'd ever get to the top.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i conceed that point about hamilton to you. as for stealing the other guy's designs, its not as if martin or dennis told mike to go steal it from ferrari. god only knows why mike and nigel colluded in that manner. I suspect it's got something to do with joining honda. Mike would have needed to incorporate the design to try it out, see if his own revisions were effective. He and nigel would have probably waltzed off to honda with ferrari AND macca technical info and designs. I shudder to think what a mess it would have been if it'd happened.</p></div>

              <p>i dont even think ron or martin knew where that data actually came from and thought it was produced in house. Ron went to the FIA the moment he suspected it wasn't "in-house" <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p>I don't think Ron saw the design. Mike probably had the design, pointed it out to Ron with some "oh this is what i suspect it is" bullshit story along with a design he probably claimes to have drawn up himself using "computer assisted analysis". Mike wouldn't have been stupid and let the higher ups know, esp with Ron and Martin's idealogies. He'd have gotten the chop. And truth be told, sprung floorboards CAN be picked up with photography. Video analysis was already good enough back in... 01? to pick up the famous flexing bargeboards at ferrari, the floor would be pretty obvious.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Still unlikely.  In the case of barge boards, or tyre sidewalls as Michelin were investigated for, the parts in question were visible.  Floorboard flexion would be a lot more difficult to spot, and even if you did, you'd actually have to have a close look from under the car to know about the spring.  Coughlan could spin any story he wanted about some computerised whizbang analysis, but when it came to the existence of the spring (as opposed to the floorboard just being too flexible), Ron and Martin must have picked up that something didn't add up.</p></div>
