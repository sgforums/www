              Lewis wins despite FIA's machinations and bias towards fiarrari, and despite a rival who needed his teammate to gift positions to him to even challenge Lewis. Lewis certainly didnt receive such help from his own teammate, which makes his achievement even more epic. Funny how old man justice was keeping an eye on proceedings and made sure that in the end, the trophy went to the most deserving driver.
                  
              Roll on next year ^^

              <p>Both Glock and Trulli were  on dry tyres and lost about the same amount of time.</p>
              <p>And Macca seem to have gone the old Ferrari route. Heikki suffered all the mechanical failures, and wasn't able to maintain his early season form which saw him set fastest lap twice and keep Hamster honest, as the developments on the car went away from him.</p>
              <p>Hamster deserved a penalty for the way he drove into Glock and Webber at Monza, if the one at Spa is questionable. At least with the current result though the sad folks on the BBC aren't harping about the latter, which would have been the case if Massa had won (after turning his car round and around in Oz, Sepang, England and Japan).</p>
              <p>Hamster is very quick. There's no denying that, but like a certain Schumacher before him, he doesn't need those stunts. His gesticulations in Bahrain towards Fisichella (who was racing with him for position) stank as well.</p>
              <p>I'm with Ged - Kubica made only one mistake all season, at Silverstone, and gave it everything at every race. The midfield battle was very close this season - every team other than Force India was on the podium at the end of at least one race.</p>

              One simple answer:
              
              Any of you drove any sort of racing machinery on slicks in the wet before, then you're qualified to talk. I believe Glock. Why? I've experienced being in the wet on slicks before, it's worse that trying to dance on buttered ice. I'm not surprised he lost that much time, I'm surprised he didn't lose more.

              <p>The championship is won over a year, not in Brazil. Both made many mistakes, but Hamilton made more. Is there a reason why he should force people off track, or ignoring a red light?</p>

              <p>Suddenly Ferrari's own mechanical unreliablity is not a mistake? And forcing people off track, thats utter bull. Basic racer know-how 101: If someone tries to uber late brake, don't try to outbrake him, brake early and take the normal line. Kimi also made a mistake, what we racers call "in sympathy". And if the championship is won over a year, then hamilton might have made more mistakes but massa did not perform as well more often. Heck, Hamilton didn't even have a teammate gifting him positions. Who deserves it more if you actually want to be objective about it? If Massa was so good and deserving why didn't he also win Malaysia? Kimi proved Ferrari had the front running pace in Canada, why did Massa only finish 5th? Why did he finish 13th in Brazil?. That is hardly a shining example of someone who didn't make mistakes. Certainly not big enough ones for the average layperson to notice, but significant enough that, by YOUR own logic, OVER a year, he scored less points. Perhaps if he was more consistant, he'd win. But his mistakes + Ferrari's mistakes (and not just the pitstop bobos, but the technical unreliablity too) mean that he lost.</p>
              <p>Honestly, again by your own logic, is there any reason he should tip Hamilton into a spin at Fuji, despite being one of the "imagine if there was a wall at the chicane" brigade, is there any reason why he should cause an avoidable accident with Seb Borduais and still get away with it? Or any reason he should pull right out in front of poor Sutil in Singapore after his own clumsy spin? Any reason he should not even be able to keep the car pointing straight at Silverstone? What was that? Lewis made more? Ohhh do say that again you're such a hilarious chap!</p>

              <p>That's a bit of a stretch, though.  By that measure, Anthony Hamilton should really be 2008 WDC.  Besides, we all know that the choice is the team's rather than the drivers, at least at the start of one's career.</p>

              <p>To me, it's still a measure of how Ferrari backed both of its drivers fully by giving them equal machinery, as we saw when they were both given faulty conrods for their engines. Rear-end stability was lacking in the car and that was Raikkonen's bugbear for much of the summer, until rear suspension improvements were introduced at Fuji.</p>
              <p>Hamilton was given the better machinery and the car was developed for him. Kovalainen kept him honest in the first few rounds and set fastest laps, then he started having issues with rear tyre wear and brake temperatures (just to name 2, from Silverstone and Monza). Why was he anonymous against the likes of Vettel in Canada and Italy, and Trulli in France? Surely he didn't become Ralf overnight.</p>
              <p>He allowed Hamilton to pass at both Silverstone and France but they were not consequential - Hamiton had better pace in both races.</p>
              <p>As for Fuji, Hamilton closed the door on Massa and gave him no room - Massa had 2 wheels on the grass. And for the stewards to penalise him at the start he must have braked ridiculously late, beyond the braking point, to set off the chain of events.</p>
              <p>I do have issues with Hamster as I feel he has no respect for other drivers other than those he has been mates with (Rosberg and Sutil), having been parachuted into the best teams instead of working his way up. Aside from the gesticulating and the chopping I mentioned earlier, he doesn't make himself any better than Raikkonen and Schumacher by snubbing the Driver's Association.</p>
              <p>However, Massa hasn't impressed me with his ability to stay out of trouble, and he has only ever won races where he was dominant from the start (or through disqualifications). I don't think he is to blame for Sutil's crash, or for the unsafe releases from the pitlane - the latter were traffic light errors.</p>

              <p>Suddenly Ferrari's own mechanical unreliablity is not a mistake? And forcing people off track, thats utter bull. Basic racer know-how 101: If someone tries to uber late brake, don't try to outbrake him, brake early and take the normal line. Kimi also made a mistake, what we racers call "in sympathy". And if the championship is won over a year, then hamilton might have made more mistakes but massa did not perform as well more often. Heck, Hamilton didn't even have a teammate gifting him positions. Who deserves it more if you actually want to be objective about it? If Massa was so good and deserving why didn't he also win Malaysia? Kimi proved Ferrari had the front running pace in Canada, why did Massa only finish 5th? Why did he finish 13th in Brazil?. That is hardly a shining example of someone who didn't make mistakes. Certainly not big enough ones for the average layperson to notice, but significant enough that, by YOUR own logic, OVER a year, he scored less points. Perhaps if he was more consistant, he'd win. But his mistakes + Ferrari's mistakes (and not just the pitstop bobos, but the technical unreliablity too) mean that he lost.</p>
              <p>Honestly, again by your own logic, is there any reason he should tip Hamilton into a spin at Fuji, despite being one of the "imagine if there was a wall at the chicane" brigade, is there any reason why he should cause an avoidable accident with Seb Borduais and still get away with it? Or any reason he should pull right out in front of poor Sutil in Singapore after his own clumsy spin? Any reason he should not even be able to keep the car pointing straight at Silverstone? What was that? Lewis made more? Ohhh do say that again you're such a hilarious chap!</p>

              <p>In Canada, he had to queue behind Kimi and then the hose did not deliver any fuel.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, how could he have sent Sutil into the barriers when he was already facing the wrong direction? Sutil had already run wide.</p>
              <p>In Japan, how could the Ferrari drivers avoid him? Raikkonen did not brake late. Are saying that Raikkonen should have braked earlier (thus causing a pile up behind)? Also, tell everyone how Massa could avoid Hamilton apart from putting all 4 wheels on the grass.</p>

              <p>yea but the team, esp those with the budget, would generally go for who they think is the best right?

The general rule is that the more deserving drivers will likely be in championship contending cars. Lewis didnt get to where he is by being a 3rd rate driver with skills undeserving of being in F1 did he?</p>
              <p>So I know maybe u dont like him for his personality, but he still deserves the championship. Certainly more than a certain "Mr Battering Ram" in 1994...</p>

              <p>I don't see any of that as being relevant.  The point I addressed was your stating that Lewis Hamilton approached Ron Dennis at the age of 10.  What I'm saying is that it was Anthony, not Lewis, who approached Ron.</p>
              <p>In the Kubica example, it's the driver choosing the team - how can you compare that to the team choosing Hamilton?  It's not even apples-to-oranges - it's apple-to-tree.</p>
              <p>As for whether he deserves the championship, it's a matter of opinion and my opinion is that he doesn't - I've been around long enough to see better, and I've seen chaps who have gotten more out of thier equipment.  You know well enough that some former WDCs (and even some non-WDCs) would have sewn up the championship long ago instead of scraping in literally at the last minute owing to some other dickhead's fuck-up.</p>
              <p>I'll stand by my view of the 2008 WDC - it was a "who can buttfuck himself less" competition.</p>

              <p>I only need to remind you about where Heikki was in the first few races, giving Hamster a good run for his money. But after double non-points finishes in Spain and Turkey, he was always facing trouble with either his brake or tyre temperatures. Heikki was a development driver before so obviously he's not lacking in feedback, so something went away from him in the development of the car. Ferrari used to prioritise Schuey's challenge in the past and McLaren prided themselves on not doing that, so why are they resorting to that now?</p>
              <p>Sutil went in too hot into turn 17 in Singapore from my point of view. He wasn't steering for the escape road...and Webber hit the barriers there in the same way too in practice, if you recall. (Edit: He had brake problems too, like many other drivers)</p>
              <p>You could argue that Massa could have used his brakes in Fuji. I say that Hamilton could have used his mirrors, but he squeezed Massa out as he went for all of the racing line. He was half a car ahead so the penalty went his way, but he could have saved himself a lot of trouble in the process. It didn't happen at Monza but it had to happen sooner or later.</p>

              <p>I would rather waste time with some logical arguments than do the same spewing some ferrari-biased drivel like you do. At least with Ged, much as i disagree with some of what he says, he's impartial.</p>

              <p>I only need to remind you about where Heikki was in the first few races, giving Hamster a good run for his money. But after double non-points finishes in Spain and Turkey, he was always facing trouble with either his brake or tyre temperatures. Heikki was a development driver before so obviously he's not lacking in feedback, so something went away from him in the development of the car. Ferrari used to prioritise Schuey's challenge in the past and McLaren prided themselves on not doing that, so why are they resorting to that now?</p>
              <p>Sutil went in too hot into turn 17 in Singapore from my point of view. He wasn't steering for the escape road...and Webber hit the barriers there in the same way too in practice, if you recall. (Edit: He had brake problems too, like many other drivers)</p>
              <p>You could argue that Massa could have used his brakes in Fuji. I say that Hamilton could have used his mirrors, but he squeezed Massa out as he went for all of the racing line. He was half a car ahead so the penalty went his way, but he could have saved himself a lot of trouble in the process. It didn't happen at Monza but it had to happen sooner or later.</p>

              <p>my dear nick, you would have to provide some real proof that macca is skewing things lewis's way. Actually, did u do engineering? You did didn't you? Technical errors are more often the fault of a string of processes. Things can often go away from people in the development of the car. Heikki could have had a car that was more to his liking and then as the car developed he found it harder to cope... just like Kimi. Are you going to say Ferrari skewed the development of the car Massa's way? No. The designers, engineers, do their physics wizadry on computer, based on theoratical physics and theoratical perfection. Some drivers are more adaptable, others aren't. To suggest a team is showing preference towards one driver based on the underperformance of their other driver due to any lack of ability on his own part is quite a fallacy. Nick, I really expect better than that from you.</p>
              <p>By the way how were the Ting Tings?</p>
