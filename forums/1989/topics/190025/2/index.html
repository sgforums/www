He has the talent, a new engine, some testing at Valencia in the run-up and they are usually strong there.</div></blockquote>exactly. WHERE are these aero upgrades? Why aren't they holding their own in the midfield? I'm not expecting them to challenge the top 4. I'm just not expecting them to be moving backwards. If the 2 men have such a significant impact on the aero dept of McLaren that McLaren have only leapfrogged Honda in terms of outright speed since the season's start, how come the team they went to are moving backwards?<br><br>I don't think the impact they have on McLaren is as significant as some people here are suggesting. If u have a good basic infrastructural department already laid out, the basic design philosophy that was already in existance in that dept doesn't disappear overnight because some key people have left. In fact u open the way for an evolution of ideas by bringing someone new in.<br><br>I don't agree that McLaren is not fast enough now because some ppl have left. There were periods when these men were at McLaren and McLaren wasn't fast enough either, esp in the latter part of 03, and the 1st half of 04. An engineering dept is so complex and interlinked that u cannot quantify the loss of a few personel as a total talent drain. We've seen that with Renault when Mike Gascoynne left.</div>

RBR is literally an ex Jaguar team that has been struggling for so many season and you expect that by changing name and getting AN in for 3 months they will be to compete with top team?

However what we are talking here is not about the possibility of a mclaren revival, or questioning their ability to win races this season, we are talking about their chance of winning the CHAMPIONSHIP.<br><br></div>

My point is that a middling driver pulls fastest laps in the same kind of car that the *ahem* 7-time WDC is flopping about in, and said *ahem* 7-time WDC's former teammate (who won the occasional race in a Ferrari) has gone to another team is and now wandering aimlessly towards the wrong end of midpack.  It's supports your view that it's 80% car and 20% driver, although in Ferrari's case that could be unfair to the car.</div>
