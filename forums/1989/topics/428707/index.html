              <p>SINGAPORE - THREE new features have been introduced to make this 
              year's Formula One season more exciting - but that has not blurred the 
              lines between man and machine, former F1 racing driver David Coulthard 
              insisted on Saturday, after a meet-and-greet session with about 100 of 
              his fans. On the contrary, he said it reminded him of Ayrton Senna in 
              the 1980s, a genius racing driver and three-time F1 world champion who 
              died in a crash during the 1994 Italian Grand Prix.</p>
              <p>To increase the chances of overtaking this year, a driver can 
              leverage on the new Drag Reduction System (DRS) that adjusts the car's 
              rear wing for greater speed and the Kinetic Energy Recovery System 
              (Kers) that recovers and converts heat from braking to electrical energy
               for up to 6.67s. However, such tools still need to be called upon by 
              the driver, as demonstrated in the last Shanghai GP race, Coulthard 
              said. In that race, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton critically overtook his 
              teammate Jenson Button by firing up his Kers twice at the start-finish 
              line.</p>
              <p>Said Coulthard, 'There is a misperception that the drivers are less 
              important than they used to be and that people can look back with 
              rose-coloured spectacles and think that the pioneers in the 1950s were 
              the real drivers.'</p>
              <p>Pitstops have also become crucial to a podium finish. 
              According to Coulthard, tyres in the last 15 years were so efficient 
              that they made little difference to the qualifying and racing timings. 
              The F1 pundit said that the new Pirelli tyres, however, behaved 
              differently with the new compounds. The tyres now degrade drastically 
              and lose their performance at the end. Again, Hamilton effortlessly 
              overtook Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel in Shanghai because he had much 
              fresher tyres. Hamilton went on to win the race.</p>
              <p>Coulthard, who first joined the Williams F1 team as a test 
              driver in 1993, said this type of racing would have suited him better at
               the end of his racing career, which lasted from 1994 to 2008. The new 
              season is more about balancing the grip of tyres over time than revving 
              the V8 engines and then sprinting, Coulthard said. He remembered how in 
              1987, five-time F1 champion Nigel Mansell famously overtook teammate 
              Nelson Picquet in Silverstone despite losing around 30s after a pitstop.
               Mansel had reeled in his teammate just after 10 to 15 laps.</p>
              <p>'I think we've had a lot of excitement in the three Grand 
              Prix we had this year. And the drivers, teams and pitstops are a key 
              part of that,' said Coulthard. He will be performing stunts in a Red 
              Bull Racing show car in an 800m closed stretch of Orchard Road on Sunday
               from 4pm onwards for the Red Bull Speed Street Singapore.</p>

              <p>F1 fans can take their own cover photo shoot with the 
              championship-winning RB7 race car set up at Torque's booth. Those who 
              prefer to take to digital tracks themselves can try out the Red Bull 
              X2010 supercar in the PS3 game GT5 at the Sony booth.</p>
              <p>Singapore GP, the race promoter for the Singapore Grand Prix, has also set up four race simulators.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's F1 driver Alex Yoong will also be driving the Audi R8 LMS 
              in a showcase from 4pm onwards. The car will be competing in the 
              Malaysia Merdeka Millennium Endurance race in September this year. The 
              Renault Megane RS will also take to the roads. Renault currently 
              supplies engines to three F1 teams - Red Bull Racing, Lotus Renault and 
              Team</p>
