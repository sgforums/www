              <p>I am a royal Starhub mobile user for many years, in fact I am a hubber with all 3 starhub services. But I have problem with starhub mobile coverage in my office, most of the time there is no signal at all. This problem has been with me for 1.5 years already but I use to have a company phone so I just let it be. Recently my company cancel the company line to cut cost and I have huge problem now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I called Starhub and in this instances they are very professional. They sent down a technician to my company to do a coverage studies and they agree that reception is very bad. However when I ask to terminate the number I was ask to pay a fine for early termination. This is absolutely not acceptable, why should I be <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;    ">penalize for Starhub problem and the fact that I already pay for 1.5 years of service that I can only use 1/3 of my time (the other 1/3 in office and sleep)? </span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do, since they do mention the early termination fee when you sign the contract itself. I would suggest weighing the choices. How long before your contract ends, cost of termination etc. I would choose the one that costs less, though usually people stick until the contract ends. I'm not sure what else to say, because I personally use prepaid.</p></div>

              <p>Even if you don't use the line AT ALL, they would still send you a monthly bill as per contract terms.</p>
              <p>Pay someone else to take up your remaining contract and transfer your line to him. You can try posting on the marketplace sections on HWZ and VRZ.</p>

              <p><br>Starhub problem? It was never a starhub problem.. They never claim they are providing good coverage anywhere in Sg. It all depends on yr luck. </p>
              <p>You enjoy their every seconds usage ougoing call benefits and now u complain their coverage su*ks?</p>
              <p>It just like u buy a Kia and expect it to perform like a Benz..</p>
              <p>Hi pal. U pay what u get. As for the contract, u signed it and now grain thru it. After it end, switch to Singtel which has the best coverage in Sg.</p>
