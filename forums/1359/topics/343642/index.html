            <div class='col-md body'><p><br>Hi,<br><br>I would like to write about an unreasonable shop in Sim Lim Square that refuses me to exchange for a better home cordless phone.<br><br>I bought a uniden cordless phone from the shop, came home and realized that the product does not meet my requirements and requested for a change to a phone with a better specifications. <br><br>However, the shop refuses to change and insists that it is our problem for buying that phone. They insist that they have told us the specification and since we bought the phone, it means that we have accepted his recommendation. But when we came home and try out the phone, we then realised that the shop owner did not tell us a few things. First, the phone display does not have back light. Second, the volume of the phone is very soft even when we tune to the loudest.<br><br>We tried to explain to them our concerns and requested for a change but they refused and even threatened us to bring this issue to CASE. Also, I suspect that the phone might be illegal because some printings on the box are incorrect; the country of the manufacturer is spelled wrongly.<br><br>The shop is called Office-Link Electronics, located in Sim Lim Sq, unit 02-56. I was so angry with their attitude and conduct.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Shane</p></div>

              <p>The once-sold-not-my-daiji attitude is one of the things that made the reputation of vendors on the lower floors of SLS stink as hell. Even Wikipedia has a section of an article dedicated to the scam tactics used by vendors in SLS.</p>

              <p>TS, you just happened to meet some unreasonable sellers who lack the goodwill to conduct the exchange for you. Next time, do avoid those stores and purchase from reputable sellers instead even if it means spending a few more dollars, as you may realize it would be very well worth it.</p>

              <p>I dont think you can exchange it, if they didn't say you can. From what i know most shop in simlim have 7day return policy, no matter is it faulty or what, you can exchange the value of money spent on similar item or other item if you find the item not to your liking. Not many people abuse this as people buy = they need it, they want it. They wont like wanna "try" the product out for this....</p>
              <p>yup... So I guess you bought a lesson.. No use complaining etc... To me = waste of time.</p>
              <p>just treat the money as a lesson bought.</p>

              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">Sim Lim is bad Shopping Center. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">For example: <a href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-reviews-2890207-prod-travelguide-action-read-ratings_and_reviews-i;_ylt=A0S0z.4Z2AZJBA8B4zx2G2oL"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://travel.yahoo.com/p-reviews-2890207-prod-travelguide-action-read-ratings_and_reviews-i;_ylt=A0S0z.4Z2AZJBA8B4zx2G2oL</span></span></a></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">I will worn all people to stay away from them!</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">Seem like there have many shops which don't want to do business but they just open shop for cheating. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">In my case I want to buy a cordless phone. He present a good model in 130 S$. I paid by credit card. Then he wrote receipt. Then he said model which I bought is not good. It's very short rang just about 6 meters! How come! So we test it and I found that it true. So he try to sale 260 S$ model to me. It's too much for me to pay for cordless phone. He deny to cancel my purchase. I went out and call my Singaporean friend. And he recommended to call credit card to deny that purchase. I'm very worry how can I prove that I didn't get any phone from them. So I go back to that shop try to negotiate with him perhaps there have other model which I can purchase in acceptable price for replace my previous purchased. But I can't find it. And I think is it true that Panasonic produce a bad product like this? As I had no way out. So I ask him to give me the model which I purchase may be I can claim later. Then he brough another model which I didn't buy. I said no it's not what we are dealing with. He said you have to look at receipt! It doesn't show the model I pay for.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">Now I know this guy doesn't want to do business but he is a cheater. He offer me a very low price which actually he can't sale. He shop my card first and write receipt which is not show model I buy. And then he try to make it like this model is no good by push mute button when testing. And try to sale me a very expensive model. This is very disappoint me. I though it very dangerous to buy things form Hong Kong. But in Singapore even worst.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;">This shop is :-</span></div>
