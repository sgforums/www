I stay in the west and they do not have any branches near my place. As I'll be in the East area over the weekend, i agreed to pick up the phone at that outlet. Just to make sure that I don't make a wasted trip, I called their branch ahead to check.I was told by the staff she will call me back to confirm availability of phone.No one called.3 hours later,I called again and received the same reply. Subsequently I was unable to get through the line from 8.30pm onwards. As I was told I will be able to get my phone after 5pm, and since I've already hung around the area for SO MANY HOURS, I went to the shop. When I arrived, they finally bothered to check!!!It was then I found out there was no stock after MUCH probing and staff calling the person in charge of the roadshow. They did not apologise and made excuses such as the shop is busy, etc. I was disappointed as they don't have the least bit of decency to inform me of the delay promptly. I was told that they only INTEND to call us on MON/TUEs! Is this the kind of service I deserve after switching from Starhub to Singtel??? Is this the image you require your EXCLUSIVE RETAILER to bear??? My wife's plan with Starhub is ending soon and she initially had thoughts of switching to Singtel. Now she's reconsidering after such poor service.Nonetheless I appreciate this issue be addressed."<br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px;">I'm wondering if this post will by weeded out by Singtel, but I definitely need to warn people about their bad service...</span></p></div>
