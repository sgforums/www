              <p>I just changed service providers to M1 when I bought a new iphone4. Nobody told me that M1 does not automatically provide common services like pay-as-you-roam.</p>
              <p>Imagine my surprise when I had no service on my recent trip to Germany. I was frustrated. This is a common service provided by the other service providers. I actively sought out a pay phone and tried calling M1. But with the hefty IDD charges to be paid as I was put on hold, I decided to have a relative call M1 to sort out the problem instead. I spent more than SGD30 on IDD calls on this. All the while going from pay phone to pay phone.</p>
              <p>To their credit M1 managed to activate the roaming service for about 30 mins. Unfortunately, as I was driving down the Autobahn and they could not contact me for verification, they took it upon themselves to deactivate the roaming service again. As though I had no common sense to switch off my phone or NOT bring a phone if I did not intend to be connected all the way in Germany.</p>
              <p>After a few tries, I gave up, bought a cheap German phone and sim card (because the iphone4 uses a micro-sim card), sought out numerous internet cafes along the way and tried to stay as connected as I could so that my office, friends and relatives could still find me. The bummer of it all was that I could not access internet banking as these days it is all linked to your mobile phone number. Fortunately my bank absorbed the international call charges when I needed to transfer funds.</p>
              <p>It is unfortunate that this has been my first 2 months' worth of experience with M1. To all those who say M1 is good and have excellent customer service, I say that they probably have to since their service provisions are not up to par. It is no wonder that they hold the smallest share of the mobile phone market. I only changed service providers on my friend's recommendation. I am now stuck on a 2 year contact. </p>
              <p>No more M1 for me if I can help it.</p>
              <p>:(</p>

              <p>Be prepared they may possibly overcharge you when you terminate your contract with them upon contract expiry.  That was what happened to me.    When terminating my contract,the staff told me since I had paid the full month they shall pay me the balance in the next bill.    Instead of paying me the balance they overcharge me.</p>
              <p>Anyway, all telcos in Singapore are under the current govt who are money minded and all their service sucks.    I have contracts with all the telcos and none of them is honest where billing is concerned, they are experts in overcharging.    </p>
              <p>So do be careful to check your bills.</p>

              <p>Sigh. That's the point. When I signed up with M1 I asked all the pertinent questions. The fella at the shop said that I get FREE autoroam for 24months with my new sign up. I asked him if I needed to activate anything and he said it's free so will be activated immediately on signing up on the new plan. That was why I was so pissed in Germany.</p>
              <p>When I called M1 after the incident, they told me that because I was on a corporate plan, I do not get free autoroam. When I complained that was not what their over the counter staff said, all they could do was apologise. </p>
              <p>Autoroam service aside, I quoted the text on their website that said that ALL lines come with pay-as-you-roam service. I asked them whether this service needed to be activated and they confirmed that so long you are over 18 years of age it is automatically linked up to your line unless you call them to specifically cancel pay-as-you-roam.</p>
              <p>Where is the fault if I had asked all the questions before I signed up, and even surfed the web to make sure I was ready before my trip?</p>
