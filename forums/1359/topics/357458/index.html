              <p>Reason for selecting: “take back the words” is no longer a symbolic expression; information technology is going to make the medicine for regret.</p>
              <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img class="size-full wp-image-167 aligncenter" title="mobile-phone-recall-message-vertu-buyvertureplica.com" src="http://blog.buyvertureplica.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mobile-phone-recall-message-vertu-buyvertureplicacom.jpg" alt="mobile-phone-recall-message-vertu-buyvertureplica.com" width="430" height="320"></p>
              <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">The technology of recalling a sent message is a great relief to people who have sent embarrassing texts. This technical patent applied by Samsung provides people who have sent out embarrassing texts a chance to delete the texts in the receiver’s mobile phone. It is said that this technology requires a specific mobile phone to be developed so that the “delete” command can be received on the receiver’s cell-phone and the message that might embarrass people can be deleted before it is read. Therefore, whenever the sender finds the text he/she sends out may turn out to be embarrassing, then he/she can take action immediately.</p>

In July 2005, Korea’s SK Telecom announced that they were going to provide their customers a new service which enabled the customers to dispel the annoying mosquitoes for one meter around using their mobile phones. It is said that the users only have to download a clip of sound whose frequency human ears couldn’t hear but mosquitoes cannot bear. What is interesting is that the frequency to dispel mosquitoes in Southeast Asian countries differs from that in Korea.<br><br><br></div>

              Reason for selecting: knowing both the human language and the dogs’, mobile phones are putting a show<br>Korea’s second largest wireless operator surprisingly said that since 13th May 2005, they would be providing a special service, which is to help the pet dog owners to know about the information sent out by their pets and their emotions from cell phone messages.<br>
              <div><img src="http://blog.buyvertureplica.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/vertu-handset-dog-buyvertureplicacom.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>mobile phone<br></div>
              <div>First of all the users have to connect their mobile phones to the internet, and then register information about their dog’s breed and age, and the service system will record the dog’s bark. The dog owner will later receive a message telling him how his dog feels like, for example “I’m happy” or “I feel frustrated”. The operator also said that they could translate the pet owner’s messages into barks for the dogs to feel their owners’ love so they could understand each other.</div>

              Reason for selecting: the “loud” information technology dares to take the burden of health ensuring<br>This marvelous invention is from a graduate student majoring in design in London. Once this wristlet is worn on the wrist then no need to worry the patient will take a wrong medicine due to the paramedic’s negligence.<br>It is reported that there is a chip, two small LCD screens and advanced sensing technology stuff inside the wristlet. The chip can store information about the patient’s medication needs, including the types of medicine and the right dosage. With the help of sensing technology, the wristlet can read the codes printed on the drug bottles, and once there is mistake it will issue warning to the doctors and nurses in time. After the patient leave hospital, the information stored in the chip will automatically upload to the hospital’s central data base, and the wristlet can be used by another patient after the previous info is emptied.<br><br><br>

              <div>Reason for selecting: mobile phones take the role of “match makers”, and blind dates don’t have to be face-to-face<br>Britain’s largest dating agency is going to provide a mobile phone service named remote observation in March, 2005 which means a blind date has no longer need to be face-to-face.<br>Users who have chosen this mobile-matchmaking service will have to take a video interview and answer some questions. The system will ask the user what type of partner he/she is looking for and a self introduction is also required. After that, the online database will automatically generate a one minute video clip. People can then search and download other people’s video information. It is reported that this service can highly improve the success rate of finding a partner.<br><br><br><br></div>

              <div>Reason for selecting: medical examination is being courted by information technology and wireless module creates carry-on hospitals<br>Similar to a watch that is worn on the wrist, this product has a built-in bioprobe to check pivotal physical signs and wireless module for communication. This news reported in June 2005 is from an Israeli mobile communication solution provider. They have developed a portable medical device which allows the patient to monitor his/her own health status while a doctor is not present. This device can be worn on the wrist like a watch and the wireless module installed internally can pass the wearer’s health data to related medical centre for in-depth analysis.</div>

              Reason for selecting: a voice is all it needs for verbal communication and you say all when you say nothing at all<br>This device is invented by Advance Research Project Agency of the U. S. Department of Defense (DARPA). It is said that the device can detect what the speaker want to say through the person’s nerve and muscle movement and therefore the speaker doesn’t have to make a sound at all.<br>This function is carried out by the Tune Electromagnetic Resonance Collar (TERC) around the speaker’s neck. It is a sensor using the sensing technology specially designed for magnetic resonance imaging and this collar can detect the change in capacitance caused by the vibration of vocal cords.<br>Besides, DARPA has bought a device developed by NASA Armstrong Laboratory which includes a electrode named electro-sensor that is put around the speaker’s neck and can detect the resistance variation during the call and then a private network would then process the data and confirm the discourse mode, even silent reading can be detected. The discourse mode will later be sent to the computer’s voice generator to restitute the caller’s voice.<br><br><br><br>

              Reason for selecting: from identifying texts to knowing sign language, the IQ of mobile phones has achieved great leap<br>
              <div><img src="http://blog.buyvertureplica.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/tn_docomo-d904i-slider-vertu-buyvertureplicacom.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br></div>
              By shaking a mobile phone up and down twice, spam calls and messages can be deleted; and speed dial can be fulfilled by finger painting numbers on the monitor. In early 2005, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics announced that they have developed the world’s first mobile phone that can identify continuous movement.<br>It is said that this mobile phone had adopted the up-to-date technology of identifying continuous movements. The user only has to shake the cell phone to delete spam messages, to hang off spam calls, to achieve speed dial and generate sound effects automatically. By finger drawing “O” or a cross on the monitor phrases like “Oh yes” or “Oh no” will come up automatically.</div>
