            <div class='col-md body'>One -<br>You are charming imaginative and independent. Usually your<br>style is ahead of others; you know what's in and what's way out.<br>Sometimes you're a little too aggressive when it comes to pursuing<br>a love interest. You have a way of drawing attention wherever you<br>go, and this dramatic flair usually attracts the strongest guys.<br>Your competitive nature either draws or repels guys/gals...but<br>those who can't handle your power aren't your type anyway. At<br>times you can be possessive, manipulating and demanding with your<br>friends and in love relationships. You like guys/gals with lots of<br>intellige! nce... and knock-'em-dead good looks don't hurt either.<br><br>Two -<br>Your love nature is sentimental, romantic and kind. Your<br>easygoing, mild manner allows almost everyone to feel very<br>comfortable with you - especially shy guys/gals. Your modesty and<br>tact enable you to get along easily with both sexes. You are a<br>natural peacemaker and can be very persuasive with words, which<br>helps you to gain the respect of your classmates. You can also be<br>too sensitive at times, and your greatest drawback is a lack of<br>confidence to stand up for yourself in conflict. Your favorite<br>type of guy is a gentle, affectionate one who is also strong and<br>playful. A great sense of humor is also a must. A guy/gal who<br>loves to listen to music and dance should rank high on your list<br>of favorites,too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Three -<br>You are imaginative, fun-loving, thrill-seeking and expressive.<br>You're so charming that you attract many friends and you are<br>almost never lacking guys/gals. In your earlie! r years, you may<br>be totally shy and self-conscious, but you'l! l lose those<br>qualities in the high-school years. You can be sort of vain or<br>even a bit of a show-off when you get caught up in exciting events<br>in your life, but you usually redeem yourself in some playful way<br>before you lose a friend. Jealousy shows its ugly head sometimes,<br>but generally you aren't affected by it unless your guy/gal tries<br>to provoke it. In the guy/gal department, you prefer the athletic<br>or artistic types. You're in absolute heaven when you find both of<br>those qualities in the same guy/gal. When you're looking for love,<br>a guy/gal who can make you laugh scores points, big time!<br><br>Four -<br>You tend to be loyal, dedicated and good hearted. You're one of<br>the most diligent students when you really try, and you tend to<br>make your schoolwork a priority. You also express those same<br>qualities in your love relationship. No one is more faithful and<br>trusting than you. In fact, those tendencies can be a little<br>negative in your romantic life. You may sometimes ! hang on too<br>long to a guy/gal who doesn't give you the respect and love you<br>deserve. You can be stubborn and a bit of a troublemaker if the<br>mood strikes you but you can usually dig yourself out of that hole<br>just in time to stay out of major trouble. You usually fall for<br>extremes when choosing a love mate - he/she may be a show-off or a<br>teacher's pet. Whatever the type, it helps if he/she is<br>good-looking, too, but that's not a major consideration for you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Five -<br>Your love attitude is adventurous, charismatic and spontaneous.<br>you're creative and adaptable, and you can come up with the most<br>exciting and sometimes daring things to do. Your quick<br>intelligence and way with words help get you out of the problems<br>that come with being flirtatious and playing hard to get. You need<br>to pay close attention to your personal values because you love to<br>try new and different things and easily go along with the crowd<br>and the consequences can put extra strain on your relation! ship<br>with a boy/girl. You like guys/gals who have great bodie! s and<br>good looks, along with exceptional brain and high grades. It helps<br>if they are highly athletic or involved in as many activities as<br>you, otherwise you might get bored! Variety is the key to your<br>love attitude number.<br><br>Six -<br>You are warm, loving, devoted and affectionate. Your outgoing,<br>thoughtful nature attracts many girlfriends/boyfriends to you, and<br>usually some of the nicest guys/gals too. Because of your need to<br>care, you can end up in a relationship that requires too much<br>care-taking to make it balanced. Since home and family play<br>important roles in your life, you are unlikely to be attracted to<br>guys/gals who your parents wouldn't like. Sometimes you have a<br>slight jealous streak... but it doesn't last long. Some people<br>with this love attitude number are prone to making harsh<br>judgements of others, especially when others don't share your set<br>of values. You are especially attracted to the good looking,<br>boy/girl-next-door type who is smart as well as ! a gentle<br>man/woman.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seven -<br>Your love nature is thoughtful, poetic, mystical and<br>mysterious. A few people with love attitude number seven are class<br>clowns, and they usually attract guys/gals who like to be given a<br>hard time. But most of you are the quiet, reserved types who<br>dislike calling attention to yourself. Your type generally<br>attracts guys who feel the same way you do. Your refined,<br>independent and secretive nature is very alluring to certain<br>guys/gals. At times you can also be somewhat fault-finding and a<br>little demanding in your love relationship and with friends. You<br>are mostly attracted to guys/gals who aren't like all the rest; a<br>loner easily attracts you. And, if he/she reads a lot and enjoys<br>learning, he/she is especially perfect for you.<br><br>Eight -<br>Your love attitude is confident, powerful and exciting. This<br>number usually makes for a very conscientious student, someone who<br>puts schoolwork ahead of a social life. However, you al! so enjoy<br>being a leader among yourclassmates and will seek of! fices or<br>other positions that enable you to use your leadership skills.<br>Because of this, you can be somewhat intimidating to certain<br>guys/gals. You can also be a little too intense, bossy and jealous<br>for your own good. Your love match is definitely someone who is<br>smart, handsome and popular. You like quality over quantity and<br>will usually wait until the guy/gal with the best attributes comes<br>along.<br><br>Nine -<br>You have a sophisticated attitude that is also generous and<br>considerate. Your responsible, charitable nature may find you<br>attracting guys/gals who want someone to confide in or who makes<br>them feel secure. At a very young age, you developed the type of<br>personality that makes others feel safe and protected. You will<br>carry these qualities into your adult years and, down the road,<br>you'll be a good mom/dad because of them. On the negative side,<br>you can be argumentative and overly emotional, and you usually<br>possess a temper that can make everyone run for cover. ! You like<br>the kind of guy/gal who is responsible and impeccably dressed and<br>has gorgeous eyes and a great body. Charm, wit and (of course)<br>brilliance could make him the perfect guy/gal for you.<br>&gt;<br></div>
