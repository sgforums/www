She knows she's got you in the net. It can happen to not just you, but other guys as well, I hope you get what I mean.<br><br>Although I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt, still I don't think anyone should treat someone whom they consider special this way. When we think this person is special, shouldn't we take the extra effort to treasure/care/love for him/her? Why go around breaking people's heart if he/she is really that special? If so, then I think the word 'Special' has been misused/abused. I don't 'test water' with someone special and then telling him a couple of weeks later 'Sorry, I don't think I can be with anyone now.' It's clearly the case of a rebound r/s and then she realised you're just not the one. All those are sweet nothings to make you hang around, that's as simple as that.<br><br>Honda, think about it... Cast away all you have, think logically and rationally. Don't becoz of a few sentences, your whole life goes awy again...
