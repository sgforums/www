It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, But what is more<br>painful is to love someone and never find the courage<br>to let that person know how you feel.<br><br>2. A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you,<br>only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go.<br><br>3. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch swing with,<br>never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.<br><br>4. It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's<br>also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives<br><br>5. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone-but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.<br><br>6. Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that<br>fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a<br>smile to make a dark day seem bright.<br><br>7. Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you<br>want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the<br>things you want to do.<br><br>8. Always put yourself in the other's shoes. If you feel that it hurts you,<br>it probably hurts the person too.<br><br>9. A careless word may kindle strife; a cruel word may wreck a life; a<br>timely word may level stress; a loving word may heal and bless.<br><br>10. The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything<br>they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.<br><br>11. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, ends with a tear. When you<br>were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one smiling and everyone around you is crying.<br><br>my fren knows that i am down they sented me this... i will share it with all! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
