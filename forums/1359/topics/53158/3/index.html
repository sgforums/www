            <div class='col-md body'>That's to leave for herself an alternative, should one day she feels she's lonely and needs companion. She knows she's got you in the net. It can happen to not just you, but other guys as well, I hope you get what I mean.<br><br>Although I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt, still I don't think anyone should treat someone whom they consider special this way. When we think this person is special, shouldn't we take the extra effort to treasure/care/love for him/her? Why go around breaking people's heart if he/she is really that special? If so, then I think the word 'Special' has been misused/abused. I don't 'test water' with someone special and then telling him a couple of weeks later 'Sorry, I don't think I can be with anyone now.' It's clearly the case of a rebound r/s and then she realised you're just not the one. All those are sweet nothings to make you hang around, that's as simple as that.<br><br>Honda, think about it... Cast away all you have, think logically and rationally. Don't becoz of a few sentences, your whole life goes awy again... If you have a friend facing the similar situation, what will your advice be?<br><br>Lastly, I should say all human beings are selfish.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hONdA_rIDeR:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmmm... hello everyone and cereal.. just had a chat with her by sms.... she told me that at the moment,being with someone is not the life that she is looking for.she don wan to put in emotions and stuffs now when she is trying to get over the previous.hai........... in think she still loves the previous guy. den i ask her was is a game or was that a prank being with me for a moment she say its wasnt a prank nor a game.. it was serious and she just cant be with anyone right now.lasty she still say ashe still regard me as a someone special.hai......why must all girl think... like that, make guys confuse cum heartbroke only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote></div>
