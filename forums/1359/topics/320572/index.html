              <h1 class="clr">Apple unveils new iPhone with faster Web, GPS</h1>
              <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - - Apple Monday unveiled a new version of its
              popular iPhone built for high-speed wireless networks with faster
              Internet access and more features for business users.</p>
              <p>"It's incredibly zippy," chief executive Steve Jobs said as he
              demonstrated the new mobile device at the opening of Apple's annual
              Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.</p>
              <p>"We've learned
              so much with the first iPhone. We've taken what we've learned and more
              and created the iPhone 3G; and it's beautiful."</p>
              <p>The iPhone 3G --
              for third-generation mobile networks -- is designed for faster Internet
              downloads, longer talk times, and takes advantage of the high-speed
              network to provide GPS mapping built in, Jobs said.</p>
              <p>Apple will
              begin rolling out new versions of the sleek smartphone devices July 11
              and make it available in 70 countries. The first-generation iPhone is
              available in six countries.</p>
              <p>"The next time you are in Malta and need an iPhone, you will be able to get it," Jobs aid.</p>
              <p>IPhone's
              software update features "many new languages," including two forms of
              Japanese and two forms of Chinese, one that lets users draw characters
              on the devices' touch-screens.</p>
              <p>"You can switch between languages
              on the fly," Jobs said. "It's one of the great advantages of not having
              a bunch of plastic keys for your keyboard."</p>
              <p>The crowd cheered
              when Jobs announced the iPhone 3G will sell for 199 dollars with eight
              gigabytes of memory. Apple will charge 299 dollars for a model with 16
              gigabytes of memory.</p>
              <p>"It is a very aggressive price point and it
              is going to do some damage to the other players in the market," Gartner
              analyst Van Baker told AFP, listing BlackBerry and Nokia among
              competitors in iPhone's crosshairs.</p>
              <p>"It is clearly moving iPhone from being noticeable in the market to being potentially a market leader."</p>
              <p>The eight-gigabyte iPhone 3G will be half the price of its predecessor and work twice as fast, according to Apple.</p>
              <p>Jobs
              also said iPhone's second-generation software will let business users
              send and receive Microsoft Exchange email, in a direct shot at rival
              BlackBerry.</p>
              <p>The iPhone software update is aimed at a business
              market that is currently hooked on BlackBerry devices made by
              Canada-based Research In Motion.</p>
              <p>BlackBerry handsets have long let people "push" work email to the devices using the Microsoft email system.</p>
              <p>Apple
              worked with Cisco Systems to build virtual private network (VPN)
              services into iPhones so businesses can establish secure connections to
              protect data being transferred.</p>
              <p>Thirty-five percent of US Fortune
              500 companies and the US military have "beta" tested iPhone's
              enterprise email, according to Jobs.</p>
              <p>"It really has the ability
              to pack the power of a laptop into the size of a smart phone," said
              Randy Brooks, senior vice president of information technology at Walt
              Disney Company.</p>
              <p>The iPhone 2.0 software update will be free to iPhone users and be available for iTouch iPods for 9.99 dollars.</p>
              <p>Apple
              introduced a "Mobileme" service that lets people access personal email
              accounts on iPhones, laptops, or home computers via the Internet.</p>
              <p>Apple
              also showcased iPhone applications crafted by third-party developers as
              part of a move to stock an "App Store" slated to open online for
              business July 11.</p>
              <p>IPhone programs including games, social networking, medical studies, and converting the devices into musical instruments.</p>
              <p>The original iPhone was launched on June 29, 2007, and set off a global buying frenzy.</p>
              <p>Jobs said Apple has sold six million iPhones to date and predicts Apple will sell 10 million by the end of this year.</p>
              <p>Apple's
              stock slipped more than two percent during the day's trading but
              recouped a smidgeon of lost ground to 182.21 dollars at 23h00 GMT.</p>
              <p>Investors
              may be frowning on Apple because most of the announcements were leaked
              prior to Monday and the improved iPhone won't be available for more
              than a month, according to analysts.</p>
              <p>"With the exception of Mobileme we knew everything else was coming," said Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle.</p>
              <p>"The only surprise is the thing is not ready yet. It came across like Jobs didn't have it together."</p>
