              <p>I'm cool.. just like when i advise him on the warranty claim on my 1st
              post in this thread, i'm trying to advise him on what i felt would help him in claiming even thou i still feels and insisted that he is cheap, and also i still felt that he is trying to do a
              final claim prior to warranty expiry date and thats what tonnes of ppl
              did, no harm at all, its normal even thou i'm not one of those but i've got nothing against it, as a matter of fact its typical of human being or at least 50-60% of ppl all over the world to do that,
              just ask ard ppl working in IT , commincation line or any other equipments that carries a warranty and you'll get an idea of what i meant, while he PMed me to ask for advise which i didn't even bother to reply simply because
              this thread already had enough advises from many others, but he started using the "F" word on me, which i deem as rude, and looking back at his post in this thread, he had to edit almost all posts directed at me.. so, that probably says much about him as a person, sorry my bad, he is probably a joker, claiming me being a behind the screen warrior is an even bigger joke, assuming i'm 50 years old is just???? i'm really in lost of words on this... hahahahaahahahaha</p>
              <p>just hope he can really keep to his promise that he would <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NEVER</strong></span><strong></strong></span> use Nokia HP again... and just to make it worst for his promise, there is a new Nokia smart phone coming out.. using S60 V3.2.3 platform instea of the S60 V5 which N97 used... but oh..my bad again smart phone is probably not for him thou!!! hahahahahahahahaha...</p>

              <p>WTF f man , to think this happen to me on xmas eve aka silent night.Today, i went to woodlands nokia store because my N76 the silver chrome peels due to manufacturing defect (i earlier changed a small part during march for the same problem).After inspecting the customer service guy agreed to change as its under warranty.So he took my HP, make me sign 2 papers  and told me this friday can collect liao.But after 1 hour when i at home the nokia call me and claim my handphone got some chemical erosion inside and will "spread" overtime saying they got take pictures and according to them the warranty is voided and ask me wait until friday to take back the phone without any warranty done.<br><br>Firstly: I believe the 2 pieces of papers i sign is something thats black and white to confirm the warranty and now they wanna back out ? I mean they should have checked properly.<br><br>secondly: I didnt even drop my phone into any water or spill onto it or what , what chemical erosion sia its so lame the person still say it happens without my knowledge.<br><br><br>Third: Nokia warranty is to cover something thats due to thier defect in workmanship thats what i know and i believe this isnt wrong.Then i only merely ask them to change the chrome which peel off due to thier poor workmanship and they agreed and again i got one part changed earlier in March.And now, because of a supposedly chemical erosion they claim my warranty voided after the signing of papers.On top of that i didnt ask them to change the eroded parts ( if its even true), which isnt thier fault but the chrome peel.<br><br><br>I somehow feel im shortchanged in this case can anyone tell me if there is anything that can be done, as i paid quite abit for this phone which is very problematic. </p>

              <p>Why do forums always have trouble-stirrers.  In the first place, a forum is a place for healthy discussion, not a war of words and insult exchanges.  I would really appreciate it if the <span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">administrator</span></strong> </span>do something about this unnecessary problem.  Apparently, there is no control over this problem whatsoever and presumably,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">the administrator in control of this forum site should, all the more, enforce some kind of control</span></span></strong> to rid this forum of these "parasites" trying to attack and spoil our healthy discussion.  <strong>Otherwise, your<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">administrator</span></span> role is just being obsolete. At least do something to show you(being the administrator) are putting in effort <span style="color: #ff0000;">other than</span> your outdated "forum rules and regulations" because clearly, these rules and regulations are apparently not being adhered to!!!</strong></p>
              <p>Anyway <strong>Kokia</strong>...regarding your handphone case...have you tried challenging the hph shop agent about the signing of the documents? Because the way I see it, you are in the right and they are in the wrong. You have already signed the papers.  Anything after that event would be solely their fault and not yours.  You should demand to talk to their supervisor.  Otherwise, you have a right to sue them for attempting to cheat you.  What kind of customer service is this?  It's just absurd.  So far, what's the latest events involving ur phone now?</p>
              <p>Sorry i didn't read the earlier entries but only this first one about ur handphone warranty being voided.</p>

              <p>lol, your cool ? look at how pissed off you were all from your
              words, you are feeling so insecure and tryign to hide like u lose
              your cool against someone younger than you but serious everyone has
              eyes and we can all see your pissed off look and no, dont bother
              scratching your bald head trying to think of a counter anymore
              because simply you are making fun of yourself on every post you
              make, just now you should be planning on how you retire, oops if
              you even got a job and maybe you should hang out less often
              argueing with 'kids'. And your all cool that you put in so much
              effort to track, monitor and reply to this thread like "oh..my bad
              again smart phone is probably not for him thou!!!
              hahahahahahahahaha", how cool :)</p>
