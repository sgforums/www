              <p>Yea..young ladies are always like that.... I went for my Nokia 6151 servicing too at Suntec City....the customer service was not bad....I sent my phone and it was fixed to my expectations in a matter of time.... but not for 1 particular man....</p>
              <p>He yelled in front of the lady.... Almost all the 30-odd crowd were looking...</p>
              <p>Apparently from what he mentioned, he was furious by the fact that he had been coming to the service center many times and still has not gotten the problem fixed yet....</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>DAY 3 : <br><br>It is indeed regretable that i have to walk out of the Nokia Customer Care fuming with anger. Firstly, today i decided to head down personally to see the extend of corrosion, that they claimed photographs were taken. That was the first thing i asked for upon reaching the desk. To my utter dismay, the 2 photographs which they shown me looked perfectly fine, hence i questioned why did they use it as an excuse to void my warranty of cosmetic peel which is totally two different thing. This dissolved my thought of the peel being caused by corrosion, and after looking through the warranty statements, the closest i could get to was "damage caused by water, misuse, abuse or poor ventilation", which in this case the "damage" was the cosmetic peel problem. So at this point in time, it somehow dawn upon me that Nokia was going all out to void my warranty. Upon questioning the photographs, the staff replied that these damages couldn't be seen by naked eyes and shoved everything to the technicians which ironically wasn't present in the entire centre, when they look for them. No offence but this customer care really left me feeling doubtful as well as the corrosion that couldn't be seen by naked eyes.<br><br><br>  After presenting my arguements which was listed out in the previous notice(infront) and the absence of thier arguements in the warranty and mine printed exactly word for word with issue being "cosmetic peel" ,all the staff kept harping on was "We are sorry but thats the rule, as long as we find a defect even after accepting the warranty we have to void it". And i got so angry by thier repetitive arguements which wasn't even stated in the warranty card. As a consumer i believe i have the right to have my cosmetic peel issue warranted. And so after like 10 minutes, a more senior staff came to me. The relatively senior staff spoke a language which i figured to be English and i even wonder at times if she knows what i was talking about at all. And again, she kept repeating the EXACT same point which the earlier junior staff has mentioned and to top it up, instead of the possible reasons such as chemical and liquid spill, she now adds a possibility of "physical damage". On top of that, the previous staff even mentioned how this corrosion is valid because my phone will spoil in 1 weeks 2 weeks time and for him , he once had it a month later. This instantaneously even got me more angry to the point that he got so desperate and started doing predictions or rather groundless arguements. So my thoughts was "What if i never came? Could my phone have lasted longer than his predictions?". After like 15 mins i realised its pointless to stay on that seat when all they ever do is argue with the EXACT same point. At one point in time a smirk was even shown on the junior staff's face.<br><br><br><br>I got all fed up and i refused to take back my phone, i sincerely hope that my case will SERIOUSLY be taken into consideration and the appropriate customer care be given to me as a consumer. The next time i walk out of the centre, i will be bringing back my phone no matter the outcome. However if situations doesn't change then i can say that this will be the last Nokia phone i will ever be using for the rest of my life.</p></div>

              <p>i might be a kiddo in your eyes but i'm not as cheap as you in trying to get that phone replaced prior to the expiry date.. and BTW you haven't answer my question on when did the peeling appeared?</p>
              <p>as for whether i'm a keyboard warrior or not is what for me to know and for you to find out.. while your used of that "f" letter shows that what i've claim (trying to pull a last min warranty claim) is indeed the truth.. while most ppl would be daring to admit, you chose to cover it up and sound like a saint.. but pls remember... dun ever use a Nokia for the rest of your life...we'll be so sad losing a "BIG" client like you....</p>
