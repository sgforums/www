              <p>I am a M1 subscriber for their mobile phone service.</p>
              <p>And i am downright disappointed with the service that the telco provides man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their 3G coverage is far from impressive to begin with. The signal fades and dies off almost everywhere and I find my Iphone running out of battery juice by constantly trying to search for a connection rather than for other usages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just earlier today, I've found some suspicious amounts on outgoing call charges and decided to make a call to the M1 customer helpline to get an idea of exactly what am i billed for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guess what they told me? The CSO on the other side of the line said he wont be able to provide a breakdown of my bill unless i pay 5 bucks to request an itemised bill be printed out. And he is not able to look from his side into the system on the breakdown of my call charges.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What the Hell ? The other telcos provide the breakdown of the number of calls and call durations on their bills. Why arent they charging extra for that? What makes M1 so special to be the only telco not to print the call duration on the bill and have to charge extra if the customer wants to see it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if i am suspicious about my call charges, how does it makes sense for me to pay yet MORE to get another itemised bill just so i'm able to clarify on those charges?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if i paid to get this itemised bill, after looking at the breakdown, if i find that i have a dispute over the call charges , who will i have to call and speak with to clarify those charges?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bingo, the CSO on the M1 customer helpline !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is where they really contradict their own asses man, if they cant access my calls breakdown, how in the blue hell are they able to verify charges with me if i have a dispute over it ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if i need to pay more everytime, only then i can see my calls breakdown, it simply defeats the purpose of calling the customer helpline altogether, aint it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After much insistence, the CSO somehow micraculously was able to give me the call duration and charges of some of the longest calls i've made. Funny, didnt he say earlier he wasnt able to access my call details? And magically he can now all of a sudden? I am really getting suspicious of the type of protocols M1 practices. So they are not unable to access your call details, rather, they are unwilling to disclose it, unless you pay the designated amount to print the itemised bill for it. I cant think of another better term than the word 'cheapskate' to describe them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But thats not all. I am given another shock when the CSO revealed that another call i am charged for was for an 1800 number.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WHAT ??!! Being charged for an 1800 number ? Aint 1800 numbers supposed to be toll free? And M1 got the cheek to charge for that? Thats dah first I've ever heard man !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The CSO said that different telcos practice different policies and it is in M1's protocols to charge for 1800 numbers. Is he fucking sure of what hes saying? Because if somehow i found out that aint true, i'm gonna gather a bunch of M1 users with me to freaking sue for deceit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The CSO mentioned that basically only their customer care hotline was toll free and M1 customers will have to pay anything else they call.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, doesnt that make M1 just a shameless money grubber? If thats the way they do business, what is there to procure customer loyalty to ensure the customers will stay and recontract with them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am seriously pissed with the asinine service they've given me and I swear upon my gracious soul I aint gonna ever be a M1 customer again until something is done to rectify the shit practises they have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm sure that there are other M1 users here and I welcome you to share any dreadful experiences you had with this miserable excuse for a telco, if any..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God bless ya ~~</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Come on lah, dont pop silly questions leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think i am old enough to differentiate what is 1800 and 1900 loh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, why would i be calling 1900 numbers? I dont like donating money and I have a girlfriend for god's sake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What dah hell is this talk about you are still using your local airtime even when you are making toll free calls? Understand the term, TOLL FREE?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Toll free means FREE USAGE mah !! Do you get charged by Singtel and Starhub for calling 1800, ever ?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can bring to me a bill by Singtel and Starhub, stating that you are paying for the usage of a 1800 line, i'll kowtow to you immediately on dah spot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for the billing itself, i am not requesting for some super detailed bill to check on calls per second you know?  Merely one with the calls durations listed on it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singtel and Starhub prints some form of your outgoing call durations on their bills ! You can at least make some validation you are adequately paying for what you use !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However M1 has none of these !! What is imprinted on their bill is a charge, thats it !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then may i ask, how are you to know if you are correctly billed for your call usage? What makes their bills any different from a loan shark flyer then?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They could simply slap down any charge and you would LL have to pay for it unless you fork out EVEN MORE money to get the call duration printed out, just so you can check it, because the CSOs at their end claim they cant look into the call usages from the system.. what kind of shit service are they providing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why make it so inconvenient for the customer to clarify on their call charges, makes me wonder ..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why make it so inflexible to print a call duration table on a 4 page long bill makes me wonder ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why makes M1 so unique out of the three telcos to be charging for anything and everything ? Call duration print outs and even 1800 toll free numbers !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is apparent that their agenda is to milk customers for as much money as possible !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've never seen a more shameless way of conducting business ~~</p>

              <p>Come on lah, dont pop silly questions leh.</p>
              <p>I think i am old enough to differentiate what is 1800 and 1900
              loh.</p>
              <p>Besides, why would i be calling 1900 numbers? I dont like
              donating money and I have a girlfriend for god's sake.</p>
              <p>What dah hell is this talk about you are still using your local
              airtime even when you are making toll free calls? Understand the
              term, TOLL FREE?</p>
              <p>Toll free means FREE USAGE mah !! Do you get charged by
              Singtel and Starhub for calling 1800, ever ?!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>If you can bring to me a bill by Singtel and Starhub, stating
              that you are paying for the usage of a 1800 line, i'll kowtow to
              you immediately on dah spot.</strong></span></p>
              <p>And for the billing itself, i am not requesting for some super
              detailed bill to check on calls per second you know?  Merely
              one with the calls durations listed on it.</p>
              <p>Singtel and Starhub prints some form of your outgoing call
              durations on their bills ! You can at least make some validation
              you are adequately paying for what you use !!</p>
              <p>However M1 has none of these !! What is imprinted on their bill
              is a charge, thats it !!</p>
              <p>Then may i ask, how are you to know if you are correctly billed
              for your call usage? What makes their bills any different from a
              loan shark flyer then?</p>
              <p>They could simply slap down any charge and you would LL have to
              pay for it unless you fork out EVEN MORE money to get the call
              duration printed out, just so you can check it, because the CSOs at
              their end claim they cant look into the call usages from the
              system.. what kind of shit service are they providing?</p>
              <p>Why make it so inconvenient for the customer to clarify on their
              call charges, makes me wonder ..</p>
              <p>Why make it so inflexible to print a call duration table on a 4
              page long bill makes me wonder ...</p>
              <p>Why makes M1 so unique out of the three telcos to be charging
              for anything and everything ? Call duration print outs
              and even 1800 toll free numbers !!</p>
              <p>It is apparent that their agenda is to milk customers for as
              much money as possible !</p>
              <p>I've never seen a more shameless way of conducting business
              ~~</p>
