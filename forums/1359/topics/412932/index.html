              <div class="content">
              <p>By Bill Rigby and Sinead Carew</p>
              <p>SEATTLE/NEW YORK - Microsoft Corp's last-ditch attempt to reclaim 
              its prominence in the smartphone market won favorable early reviews on 
              Monday, but it may come too late to claw back customers from Apple Inc 
              and Google Inc.</p>
              <p>The world's largest software company, along with network carriers 
              and handset makers, is planning to spend more than $100 million on 
              marketing the phones, which analysts said could compete with Apple's 
              iPhone, but that may be a struggle.</p>
              <p>"We are the first to admit that Microsoft is fighting for third 
              place, not first or even second, at this point; but we believe this is a
               key step toward rebuilding confidence in their ability to innovate in 
              mobile," Wells Fargo analyst Jason Maynard said in a research note.</p>
              <p>"This isn't going to move the market share needle in the short term."</p>
              <p>"They have phones with slide-out keyboards, larger screens, high 
              definition outlets -- all features that the iPhone does not have," said 
              Ross Rubin, a consumer electronics analyst at retail research firm NPD 
              Group. "That should help Microsoft's competitive position. There will 
              always be a segment of customers that seek out the newest devices."</p>
              <p>The line-up of nine new phones from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, LG 
              Electronics Inc, HTC Corp and Dell Inc will start to appear in stores 
              later this month in Europe, and in November in the United States on 
              AT&amp;T Inc's network.</p>
              <p>The handsets are much closer in look and feel to Apple's iPhone than
               earlier Windows phones, with colorful touch-screens and "live tiles" on
               the starting screen for quick access to email, the Web, music and 
              exclusively, games on the Xbox system.</p>
              <p>"The user interface is quite innovative because it takes advantage 
              of those precious few seconds when eyes hit the glass and actually gives
               you something useful," said Al Hilwa at research firm IDC. "It will 
              probably be copied by other platforms over time."</p>
              <p>Microsoft said the launch will be backed by heavy television 
              advertising in the run-up to the holiday shopping season, as it looks to
               vault itself back into the market.</p>
              <p>"This is Microsoft's last chance to be a major player in the 
              smartphone market," said analyst Jack Gold of J.Gold Associates. 
              "Microsoft will be required to undertake a massive consumer education 
              campaign if it wants to stand a chance of differentiating itself from 
              iPhone and Android, which have far greater market presence."</p>
              <p>British actor and writer Stephen Fry, an outspoken fan of Apple 
              products, praised the phones on stage at a launch event in London.</p>
              <p>"When I got one of these my first feeling was it's fun to play with.
               I have felt enormous pleasure using this phone," said Fry, who was 
              invited, but not paid, to speak at the event. "Yes, I love Apple, but 
              I'm not a monotheist. I want biodiversity in this market and all of us 
              that love it should welcome that too."</p>
              <p>LAST CHANCE</p>
              <p>The new phones represent Microsoft's last chance to catch up in the 
              smartphone market with rivals who overtook it in the past few years.</p>
              <p>"I've been looking forward to this day for some time," said 
              Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, showing off the nine phone 
              models at a launch event in New York.</p>
              <p>Ballmer, who has admitted his company "missed a generation" with its
               recent unpopular phone offerings, said the new phones would eventually 
              be available from 60 mobile operators in 30 countries.</p>
              <p>The first phone from AT&amp;T, priced at $200, will be available on 
              November 8, said Ralph de la Vega, CEO of AT&amp;T Mobility and Consumer
               Markets. Some phones will be available October 21 in Europe.</p>
              <p>AT&amp;T will give the phones ample room in its stores for 
              promotion. "We're expecting these to be really big sellers," said Jeff 
              Bradley, AT&amp;T's senior vice president for Devices.</p>
              <p>"This is a marathon, not a sprint. They are not going to change 
              their position today or in the next month," said Michael Gartenberg, an 
              analyst at research firm Gartner. "But they've established themselves as
               a credible player."</p>
              <p>Microsoft did not give any sales forecasts for the new phones.</p>
              <p>NEW FEATURES</p>
              <p>The new phones, which are built on the Snapdragon processor made by 
              Qualcomm Inc, represent Microsoft's best attempt yet to introduce live 
              connections with its other products and the Web.</p>
              <p>Users will be able to play Xbox Live games on the phones, link to 
              Windows Office, use the Bing search engine and download and play music 
              through its Zune music software. TV episodes are also available for 
              download via AT&amp;T's U-verse service. Updates from Facebook will be 
              incorporated into a user's contacts.</p>
              <p>Game maker Electronic Arts Inc said it will introduce a wave of 
              games for the new phone software this holiday season. That should boost 
              the phone's popularity among gamers, especially the 25 million 
              subscribers to Microsoft's Xbox Live gaming network.</p>
              <p>Microsoft has a market share of only 5 percent in the global 
              smartphone market, according to research firm Gartner, compared with 9 
              percent a year ago. Google's Android system has a 17 percent market 
              share, jumping from only 2 percent a year ago.</p>
              <p>Gartner expects almost 270 million smartphones to be sold worldwide this year, up 56 percent from last year.</p>
              <p>In comparison, Gartner expects only a 19 percent increase in worldwide PC sales to 368 million units this year.</p>
              <p>Microsoft shares closed up 2 cents at $24.59 on Nasdaq. AT&amp;T shares rose 10 cents to $28.32 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
