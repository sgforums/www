              <p><strong>Telcos may spend more to boost network capacity</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Singapore telecom operators are expected to invest 
              between S$1.3 billion and S$1.4 billion this year to boost their network
               capacity.on expectation of a surge in mobile data volumes. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Analysts said it is 
              also to meet new measures by the Infocomm Development Authority of 
              Singapore (IDA), which wants more coverage and capacity.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Earlier this week, IDA introduced a slew of measures to boost the quality of 3G mobile services for subscribers.<br><br>From April 1, telcos must ensure that there is more than 99 per cent coverage in outdoor areas, roads and MRT tunnels. <br><br>And there must be more than 85 per cent coverage within buildings, especially offices.<br><br>Another new standard is that drop call rates must be less than 1 per cent.<br><br>Operators can be fined up to S$50,000 if they fail to comply with any of these new standards.<br><br>The three telcos - SingTel, M1 and StarHub - said they are committed to providing high-quality mobile services.<br><br>And analysts said the three telcos have no issues of meeting the requirements set by IDA.<br><br>Sachin
               Gupta, regional head of telecom research Asia ex-Japan at Nomura, said:
               "This is not a new phenomenon, the networks are getting congested. The 
              network outages are getting more and more common and telcos are looking 
              to spend more as well."<br><br>Analysts believe that telecom regulator IDA may also impose new standards later this year.<br><br>This is to cater for the upcoming faster data network or Long Term Evolution (LTE).<br><br>Bertrand
               Bidaud, managing vice president for CSP Strategy at Gartner Research, 
              said: "There will be new regulations, 3G is not going to be obsolete for
               at least another 10 years. So, there will be  period of overlap between
               the new technology, there will be a need for new regulation, in 
              particular to guarantee the quality of service with mobile data on LTE."<br><br>The telcos are expected to fork out more in investments to boost their networks and prepare for this new market requirements.<br><br>James
               R Sullivan, head of telecom research at JP Morgan, said: "The very fast
               increase in overall data usage in this market will lead to significant 
              increase in capex. And that will be the more powerful impact on 
              operators."<br><br>JP Morgan is overweight on SingTel but neutral on M1 
              and StarHub because SingTel's existing spectrum will give them an 
              advantage over its competitors.<br><br>Meanwhile, Nomura puts a "buy" call on M1 on valuation versus a neutral call for SingTel and StarHub.<br><br>Analysts said that the increased investments may not generate any incremental returns for the telcos.<br><br>Average revenue per users have been and will likely be flat going forward.<br><br>However, spending on improving coverage and capacity is necessary to retain and provide better services to existing customers.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              <p>No use on increasing the coverage if the server is too congested n overwhelming with user.. They all use the same network thus its too much for the server..</p>
