              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Apple has unveiled its latest generation of iPhone in 
              the US. </span></p>
              <p><span>But consumers in Singapore will have to wait a little longer 
              before it hits the stores here.
              <br> <br> The three telcos, M1, SingTel and StarHub say they expect to offer 
              iPhone 4 in the coming months.
              <br> <br> The device is expected to retail at 199 US dollars when it is launched 
              in the US.
              <br> <br> It is not immediately clear how much iPhone 4 would cost in Singapore.
              <br> <br> But analysts say it will be priced close to the current iPhone 3GS 
              model, which could cost up to S$658 or S$668, depending on the different
               subscription plans offered by the three telcos.
              <br> <br> Market watchers also believe Apple will offer the new iPhone to all the 
              telcos, steering away from the exclusive-deal business model.
              <br> <br> This will help the company achieve higher sales volume to regain market 
              share from Google's Android phones.
              <br> <br> Industry reports say that the Android is slowly taking over Apple's 
              position in the smartphone market.
              <br> <br> In the first quarter this year, the Android sold five million units in 
              the US compared to Apple's eight million.
              <br> <br> Analysts expect the local take-up rate of the iPhone 4 to be healthy.
              <br> <br> One in three smartphones taken up in Singapore is an iPhone.
              <br> <br> Apple will stagger the release dates of iPhone 4 in July for 18 
              countries and August for 24 countries.

              <p><strong>iPhone 4 in short supply</strong></p>
              <p>TOKYO - APPLE'S newest iPhone was in short supply just hours after 
              its global launch began in Tokyo on Thursday morning as hundreds queued 
              outside stores across the city to become among the first in the world to
               own the device.</p>
              <p>Over 300 people were lined up at the flagship store of Softbank, 
              Japan's exclusive iPhone carrier, when its doors opened in the hip 
              shopping district of Harajuku. The store ran out of phones by early 
              afternoon, said company spokesman Naoki Nakayama.</p>
              <p>'We've been selling out at each launch, it's the same conditions,' he
               said, declining to release any numbers.</p>
              <p>Hundreds more lined up across the city at Apple stores and other 
              Softbank outlets across the city. Thursday's global launch of the iPhone
               4 was being carried out at 7am in each region, so Japanese were among 
              the first in the world to get their hands on the device. The US, France,
               UK and Germany are also part of the global launch.</p>
              <p>When the initial version of the iPhone was released in Japan
               two years ago, some questioned whether it could succeed without many of
               the advanced hardware features common on Japanese models. But the 
              phone's addictive touch screen and broad selection of downloadable 
              applications have made it a runaway hit in the country.</p>
              <p>The newest model is thinner with a better-resolution screen 
              and longer battery life. It features a new operating system that can 
              also be installed on some older models. Even among Apple's most 
              faithful, some said the phone has become a victim of its own success in 
              Japan. -- AP</p>

              <p><strong>Consumer Reports will not recommend Apple iPhone 4</strong></p>
              <p>SAN FRANCISCO - Consumer Reports said it cannot recommend Apple's 
              iPhone 4 to buyers after tests confirmed the device's well-publicized 
              reception glitches.</p>
              <p>It added that that AT&amp;T Inc, the exclusive mobile phone carrier 
              for the iPhone 4, was not necessarily the main culprit.</p>
              <p>The influential nonprofit organization, which publishes guides on 
              everything from cars to TVs, said in a report released on Monday that it
               also tested other phones -- including the iPhone 3GS and Palm Pre -- 
              and found none had the signal-loss problems of Apple's latest iPhone.</p>
              <p>The report was the latest blow to the iPhone 4, which sold 1.7 
              million units in its first three days on the market but has been plagued
               by complaints of poor reception. Many of the complaints involve a 
              wraparound antenna whose signal strength is said to be affected if 
              touched in a certain way.</p>
              <p>Kaufman Bros analyst Shaw Wu said he was surprised by the stance that
               Consumer Reports took on the new iPhone. Wu noted that the group's 
              recommendations are used as a guide by many consumers.</p>
              <p>"Consumer reports is a respected publication. This could have an 
              impact on iPhone sales," Wu said.</p>
              <p>Apple shares were down 1 percent at $257.06 on Monday afternoon on 
              the Nasdaq.</p>
              <p>The company has been sued by iPhone customers in at least three 
              complaints related to antenna problems.</p>
              <p>"When your finger or hand touches a spot on the phone's lower left 
              side -- an easy thing, especially for lefties -- the signal can 
              significantly degrade enough to cause you to lose your connection 
              altogether if you're in an area with a weak signal," contributor Mike 
              Gikas said in a report on the Consumer Reports website.</p>
              <p>"Our findings call into question the recent claim by Apple that the 
              iPhone 4's signal-strength issues were largely an optical illusion 
              caused by faulty software that 'mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it 
              should for a given signal strength,'" Gikas said.</p>
              <p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
              <p>Gikas recommended covering the gap in the wraparound antenna with 
              duct tape or some other non-conductive material.</p>
              <p>Apple has said almost any cellphone will suffer a loss of signal if 
              held in certain ways. It said later it had discovered a software glitch 
              that overstates signal strength, though it did not directly address 
              concerns about the antenna with that admission.</p>
              <p>On the flip side, Consumer Reports said the iPhone scored high on 
              other testing grounds such as battery life, sharp display and 
              high-quality video camera.</p>
              <p>However, Gikas said the signal problem was the reason the iPhone 4 
              would not be classified as a "recommended" device in its smartphone 
              ratings.</p>
              <p>"Apple needs to come out with a permanent -- and free -- fix to the 
              antenna problem before we can recommend the iPhone4," said Gikas in his 
              blog post on ConsumerReports.org.</p>

              <p><strong>Apple to hold iPhone press conference Friday</strong></p>
              <p>SAN FRANCISCO - Apple Inc has called a surprise press conference for 
              Friday to talk about the iPhone 4, as the company continues to deal with
               fallout from reported reception problems on its popular smartphone.</p>
              <p>Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said late on Wednesday the company 
              would hold the event at 10 a.m. on Friday at its headquarters in 
              Cupertino, California.</p>
              <p>He declined to provide further details, or to say whether the event 
              will address the signal-strength problems that some people have reported
               having with the iPhone 4 when the device is held in a certain way.</p>
              <p>Apple has faced mounting criticism from analysts and consumers over 
              its handling of complaints about the reception issues on the newest 
              iPhone, which was launched last month.</p>
              <p>Analysts say Apple has created a public relations headache for itself
               by appearing to dismiss or ignore the problem, allowing a minor issue 
              to be turned into headline news.</p>
              <p>Although most analysts believe a recall of the device is unlikely, a 
              growing chorus have urged Apple to resolve the matter, perhaps by 
              offering free iPhone cases, which appear to solve the problem.</p>
              <p>The iPhone 4 has been an unqualified hit with consumers, and sales 
              have so far been unaffected by the controversy, analysts say. Apple sold
               1.7 million units in its first three days to become the fastest selling
               device in the company's history.</p>
              <p>But scattered reports cropped up early on from users who complained 
              about decreased signal strength when they touched certain parts of the 
              phone.</p>
              <p>The company has been sued by several consumers over the matter. 
              Still, the problem does not appear to be widespread.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, Apple issued a statement, saying the problem was 
              caused by a software glitch that overstates network signal strength. But
               some found that explanation wanting.</p>
              <p>Many who follow the company believe the problem is with the hardware 
              itself. A steel band runs along the outside of the iPhone 4 and acts as 
              the antenna.</p>
              <p>The influential publication Consumer Reports said on Monday it could 
              not recommend the iPhone 4 to buyers because of problems with its 
              signal-strength. It has called on Apple to provide a free fix to iPhone 4
               buyers.</p>
              <p>Shares of Apple closed up 0.4 percent at $252.73 on Nasdaq on 
              Wednesday.</p>
