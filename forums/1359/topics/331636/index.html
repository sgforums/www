              <h1 class="clr">Google unveils mobile phone, on sale in October</h1>
              <p>NEW YORK (AFP) - - Internet search giant Google launched its
              long-awaited mobile phone on Tuesday, unveiling a handset developed
              with telecom carrier T-Mobile to compete with rival Apple's hot-selling
              iPhone.</p>
              <p>The T-Mobile G1, the first mobile device powered by Google's
              open-source Android software, will be available in stores in the United
              States on October 22 and will cost 179 dollars, 20 dollars cheaper than
              the iPhone 3G.</p>
              <p>Cole Brodman, T-Mobile chief technology and
              innovation officer, called the G1, built by the Taiwanese firm HTC, a
              "game-changing" device for Web surfing which will "power a new mobile
              Internet of the future."</p>
              <p>The G1, which is a bit thicker but
              narrower than an iPhone and comes in three colors, black, white and
              brown, will go on sale in Britain in early November and in other
              European countries served by T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Germany's
              Deutsche Telekom AG, in early 2009.</p>
              <p>The G1 offers many of the
              features of the iPhone and Research in Motion's popular BlackBerry
              including a touch screen similar to that of the iPhone, a trackball for
              navigation, high-speed Internet browsing, Wi-Fi, e-mail, instant
              messaging and SMS texting.</p>
              <p>It also has a Global Positioning
              System (GPS), a 3.0-megapixel camera with photo-sharing capability and
              a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, a feature lacking on the iPhone. Like the
              iPhone, the G1 cannot shoot video.</p>
              <p>But in a direct challenge to
              Apple's iTunes, the entire library of Internet retail giant Amazon's
              MP3 music store is available for purchase on the G1, more than six
              million songs.</p>
              <p>The new phone has, unsurprisingly, been closely
              integrated with Google applications such as Google Maps and G-Mail and
              can play videos from YouTube, the video-sharing site purchased by
              Google in 2006.</p>
              <p>"Google is moving into the mobile devices market
              not to become yet another mobile phone manufacturer but to enable a
              large addressable market for its services and applications," said
              Carolina Milanesi, research director at Gartner Consulting.</p>
              <p>"Google's
              strategy is all about broad reach for their services," added Charles
              Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. "It's just the first step in
              a long strategic voyage for Google."</p>
              <p>Google hopes the free
              Linux-based Android software powering the G1 will eventually become the
              dominant operating system for mobile phones.</p>
              <p>"Android has the
              potential to become the de facto operating system for Linux and we
              expect sales to reach around 10 per cent of the smartphone market in
              2011," said Roberta Cozza, another Gartner analyst.</p>
              <p>The open
              source Android software and ability of outside developers to write
              applications for the device is seen as a major selling point by Google
              and its partners.</p>
              <p>Applications for the iPhone, for example, are
              tightly controlled by Apple and mobile phone operating systems such as
              those of Microsoft and global mobile phone market leader Nokia are
              proprietary.</p>
              <p>"It's very exciting for me as a computer geek to
              have a phone that I can play with and modify," said Google co-founder
              Sergey Brin, who made a surprise appearance at the launch event with
              fellow co-founder Larry Page.</p>
              <p>G1 users can access the Android Market, where they can download software applications from developers around the world.</p>
              <p>Google
              announced the formation in November 2007 of a 34-member group called
              the "Open Handset Alliance" to develop Android, including China Mobile,
              HTC, Intel, Motorola, Qualcomm, T-Mobile, Telefonica, LG and eBay.</p>
              <p>Google's
              share price soared 7.38 percent to 437.52 dollars an hour after the
              launch of the G1 but it ended the day down 0.2 percent at 429.27
              dollars.</p>
