              Hi. I'm thinking of buying a mobile phone plan, where I can use Internet on-the-go.
                  
              I am not really that obsessed with using mobile phone internet. Usually, I only use it to check Google Maps and write on forums. Sometimes update my Twitter and Instagram.
                  
              Besides, I still do not have earning capacity. Money still take from parents.
                  
              Any suggestion on what plan I can take up?
                  
              I'm looking for those that when you buy the plan, they will give you free phone (iPhone, galaxy, etc.).

              <p>Saya firefight with <a href="mailto:Wireless@SG">Wireless@SG</a> and <a href="mailto:Wireless@SGx">Wireless@SGx</a> while with the corporates over these years when on the move, detecting hotspots is a huge headache at times, however I am still positively sure that all public libraries may offer them, sometimes RCs and CCs as well.</p>
              <p>In fact come to think of it, those were the days, it was huge fun because when they equip mobile work horses with laptops and today tablets and smartphones, they expected us to move and be streetwise. Then gotta figure out which PCMCIA butterfly network cards work better and in which building the connectivity is less obscured. Initially there was only McDonalds with their proprietary wifi access, then IDA made Singapore <a href="mailto:wireless@sg">wireless@sg</a> islandwide, while everywhere like Changi Airport till Funan Centre offers adhoc-use internet workstations, even if you visit a Hotel 81 or Fragrance Hotel they also offer limited connectivities. Wah, really miss those days.</p>
              <p>So in fact, after that they made me join civil service briefly, they gave me a white, state-of-the-art Fujitsu laptop that can twist and turn the LCD screen, the condition was I had to stay within a fixed statutory compound, and everything worked on that machine basically they i.e. the Singapore government is willing to hire me to do anything but move from the chair it was many's safe haven yet it was my hell.</p>
              <p>Because everything in civil service seemed that new and expensive compared to corporate ones. Even if you wanted a new girlfriend or female colleague they hire girls fresh from campus.</p>
              <p>In the MNC/SME private sector, all the equipment I used had loads of recycling because either this Filipino used it and quit then a Burmese inherited it, or in hokkien it's called low-kar-low-chiu i.e. they gave their employees laptops but they forgot about the power supply, they gave you the internet dongle they forgot about the SIM card, wah it's very easy to learn things the hard way in private sector and charitable organisations, very difficult to learn anything in civil service or in tertiary campus.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure if this will spoil market or not, but there's something called "prepaid broadband", where some of which gives unlimited mobile internet at quite low prices. However, it is only on certain mobile applications, such as WhatsApp and Facebook.</p>
              <p>otherwise, although have internet, it's either the data is limited, or the price is quite high.</p>

              <p>well, for me, what I had was a M1 prepaid line and a Singtel prepaid line. M1 prepaid line is the one I used to call and SMS. Singtel prepaid line is the one I used for internet. I use it only for WhatsApp. It's possible, because my phone can have dual sim card.</p>
              <p>I'm exploring the idea of having a post-paid line, and possibly also change my handphone.</p>
              <p>I see so many people on-the-go using their mobile phone to surf internet, I also a bit tempted to also have. besides, it would really be useful, especially if I am outside and I suddenly want to look for something, or find directions. also, can on-the-go check and update Twitter, Instagram and Whatsapp.</p>
              <p>but ultimately, price is one factor I have to consider.</p>
              <p>anyway, it's not as if I really need the internet, that without the internet with me 24/7, I cannot survive. I have been using mainly my house wifi and my school wifi. I can continue like this.</p>
              <p>whereas for mobile phone, it's not as if I really need iphone or galaxy, or .... . I am currently using a XiaoMi phone. have been using it since June last year.</p>
              <p>okay. I know, you may begin to wonder why I suddenly create this thread. Well, firstly is because I was sort of tempted to try post-paid lines. Secondly, the target audience is parents with children, to help them decide on mobile phone broadband plans, if they want their child to have mobile phone internet.</p>
