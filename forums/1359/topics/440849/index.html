              galaxy s2 - why? based on actual usage and experience.
              
              i had an iphone but it's not chucked away somewhere never use. iphone is not that bad but the apple fanboys makes me not want to buy another iphone anymore. apple fanboys are really irritating.

              For your info, before Siri was around for many months ago, Android already have something similar and it's called Vlingo or something like that. BUT Apple did their marketing better, and with a cheer group of fanboys, Siri became their key feature... imagine this feature already available in other platforms long time and now they market this as their key feature... Also touch screen phones or tablets already available in market long time ago even before iPhone or iPad was in the market, but once again, Apple marketing powers can persuade anyone to get their products... they can even sell iShit to their fanboys for $300 and they will buy... they might complain it's shitty but they will still buy...
              
              what i didn't like about steve jobs is that apple copied other people products and they find it ok, but when android came out, they say it copied iphones... wah lao... say one thing but do another... and also steve jobs cheat his best friend's money, what kind of person will do that... your best friend leh... over a few thousand dollars... also jobs had a daughter and never acknowledge her, and leave her daughter and the poor mum to live on welfare for years... bet you guys didn't know all these...
