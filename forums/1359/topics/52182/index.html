            <div class='col-md body'>Aries in Love<br>March 21-April 19<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br>Aries is the cardinal-fire sign which translates into life loving and highly energized and this describes their needs concerning love as well. As a partner they make life exciting, albeit occasionally tiring, and you cannot help but feel rather joyful and light hearted when you're in their company. It's that blend of innocence (the lamb) with pure power (the ram) that is so captivating about an Aries mate. They don't understand the meaning of the word routine, however, and boredom is the number one killer of Aries romances. Aries loves as boldly and as strongly as it experiences life. From sports to personal challenges Aries are usually not happy unless they are moving after something. With Mars as their ruling planet oftentimes their entire lives are about channeling and putting that immense power to work for them. It's not uncommon to find an Aries firmly committed to a long term volatile arrangement that leaves those around them wondering why they would stay. The truth is they often thrive on that kind of intensity and it can do far less damage than existing within a relationship that has grown routine and stagnant.<br>When an Aries loves they LOVE. The partner is hoisted up onto a pedestal whether they want to be there or not and they become a treasure to be protected and guarded passionately. The love of an Aries life often becomes the driving motivation for their challenging goals and the phrase, "I did this for YOU" is one heard in many of the best Aries relationships.<br><br>Aries Sexuality: An Aries sexuality is driven, powerful and almost a feat of showmanship when they are truly captivated. Since Aries tend to be action/goal oriented sex can become a series of higher plateaus involving anything their fertile imaginations can conjure up. Aries are the zodiac show-off and the bedroom isn't excluded from their dramatic and captivating ability to get partners undivided attention. The more appreciated they feel the more they invest in their lovemaking and private boundaries exist only to give an Aries something to leap over. Marathons of passion, spontaneous liaisons in the most unexpected places and inexhaustible stamina are all part of the Aries basic sexual make-up.<br><br>The long term story: Lots of pampering and a lot of attention is needed with an Aries lover as they thrive on feeling they are number one in your life. They love to do the initial chasing and are usually not attracted to being chased but once their heart is given you can't ever over-do your displays of affection. While they can be jealous and possessive you cannot show the same qualities and any kind of clinging is a sure fire way to drive them into new pastures. Under all the Aries bravado and show is actually a rather innocent child who simply wants to explore the wonderful world around them and to be appreciated. The more encouraged they are in either area the more exuberant they become.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Exuberance, expressiveness, passion, generosity, adoration, protectiveness, adventuress, fun loving, creative and energized lovemaking, and devotion.<br><br>Negative traits: Temperamental, jealous, possessive, ego oriented, inconsiderate, reckless, fickle<br><br>What an Aries likes:<br>Being number one, A positive attitude, A life loving comrade, A. partner who has style or a 'look', Being Seen Getting gifts, Loyalty, Being active together. Romance and dazzle.<br><br>What an Aries Dislikes:<br>Being bored, Being chased, Sloppiness in a mate, Criticism, Anything mundane, Feeling unappreciated, Feeling inferior, Losing, Having to repeat things. Displays of insecurity.<br><br>Aries Love Keywords:<br>Dramatic, romantic, original, passionate, energized, creative, spontaneous.<br><br>Taurus in Love<br>April 20-May 20<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Taurus is a stable and earthy sign and their partnerships require an equally strong and centered base. There is a definite serious approach to life which is held by every Taurus in one degree or another and a partner who can at least understand this facet of them is important. They make generous, loyal and extremely supportive mates when they feel the relationship is true and secure but getting them to that point generally takes a great deal of time and effort. Taurus cherishes waiting, watching and being assured of something's value before they invest their heart and feelings. They will retreat at any sign of flakiness or instability and once a Taurus retreats getting them back to the point they started at is difficult, if not impossible. Although they are slow to trust and give once they do their trust is almost a magical thing and very little can shake it. Even when the generosity is not earned a Taurus deeply committed will very often hold on to the smallest shred of h ope that everything is all right. As partners they are homebodies and enjoy their surroundings and all things which they can possess and embrace. They intuitively collect and protect and their 'people' often fall into this category. A Taurus expects loyalty and support from their mate and also to be the boss in the relationship.<br><br>Taurus Sexuality: Earthy, sensual and caring are hallmarks of Taurus sexuality. For Taurus sex is a natural, healthy and all important part of their relationship and they immerse themselves in it. Love and sex are one and the same to a Taurus and it is only when firmly committed that most can truly let go and enjoy. Bedroom Olympics and exciting kinky escapades are not their cup of tea and they tend to hold onto their personal favorites. But they believe in sharing their pleasure and work diligently to make sure their partner enjoys the passion as much as they do.<br><br>The Long-term story: Keeping it together over the long term requires a thorough understanding of the Taurean ways. As a fixed earth sign they are almost immovable, especially if they feel they are being forced into something. Knowing their ways and encouraging any change ever so slowly assures the relationship of moving forward and remaining vibrant. It takes a great deal to truly anger a Taurus once it is in love but disloyalty will usually be the ultimate factor. Yet as slow as they are to attach they are equally slow to detach and break-ups tend to hang on eternally. Once a Taurus truly closes its heart, however, there is very little chance they will open back up.<br><br>The Problem Zone: In a relationship with a Taurus most of the troubles will emerge over jealousy, possessiveness and inability to change. They can be immovable forces when they so desire and if they have decided they are perfectly happy with something exactly as it is no one can force them to change. There is a tendency for them to see people they love as cherished personal objects and this can turn into a very strong jealousy factor. Letting go can also be a problem for the same reasons.<br><br>Positive traits in love: Loyal, dedicated, generous, protective, caring, doting, understanding, stability.<br><br>Negative Traits in love: Jealousy, possessiveness, control, immobility, over-seriousness.<br><br>A Taurus Likes:<br>Feeling secure, Being pampered, Kept promises, Sensibility, Being on time, Together time at home, Sharing good meals, Unhurried affection, Commitments, Stability in a mate, Getting special gifts.<br><br>A Taurus Dislikes:<br>Being hurried, Being told what to do, Flightiness in a partner, Unexpected changes in plans, Loud, noisy party scenes, Careless or unappealing environments, Forgetfulness in a mate.<br><br>Taurus Love Keywords:<br>Loyal, stable, sentimental, sexual, loving, possessive, jealous, controlling.<br><br>Gemini in Love<br>May 21-June 21<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Gemini is the mutable air sign ruled by the planet Mercury and that describes much of their lively and thought oriented approach to love. They treasure being mentally captivated, excited and dynamically active and the mates they choose tend to be friends, first and foremost, and lovers second. Being able to share and discuss new thoughts, new ideals and everything they conceive and learn is an important quality they need to have in place within a relationship. This is the talkative, communicative sign and their minds are constantly sifting through information. As such they often speak before they think and their words, usually not intended to hurt, can fall flat when they fail to carry through on an intention or promise. A lover often feels left behind and unimportant as the Gemini discovers a fascinating new subject or person to explore and words from the past become empty and hurtful. At their best, however, a Gemini lover is the most fascinating, joyful and enjoyable pa rtner of the zodiac. When that is backed up by their own feelings of wholeness and completeness (often the very thing they are seeking from a partnership) they are dynamic and loyal mates.<br><br>Gemini Sexuality: Sex is a mind voyage for most Gemini's and they experience the height of their passion through their thoughts and what the feelings mean to them. They are open minded and experimental ,yet not necessarily driven by passion to try out the new techniques and adventures, but more out of the hungry curiosity that propels them to simply...discover something. They bring their wit and laughter directly into the bedroom and can be disheartened (and even shocked) that their partners may not always go along with their ever present sense of humor. Their lust and their needs tend to come and go with speed and suddenness and they can turn off as quickly as they turn on. Gemini's seldom wait for anyone and that includes a lover who takes a little more time to feel stimulated.<br><br>The long term story: Gemini's need friendship and companionship and a partner who can share their mind explorations and journeys as deeply as they need a lover and heart mate. They generally need someone who is secure or open enough to not feel threatened by their quickly changing interests or whole hearted experiments but one who can also help them ground out to penetrate one of their intrigues in depth. Because Gemini is a dual sign they often project part of them when they are attracted to a mate and the relationship becomes an external way for them to work towards their merging of their two very different sides. This polarity creates an intriguing and exciting spark in the beginning of the relationship but can burn out once the Gemini has 'owned' up to its other half or has grown bored and retreated back within self.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Joyful, good natured, broad minded, experimental, radiant, friendly, enthusiastic, flexibility, gentleness.<br><br>Negative traits: Unreliability, fickleness, duality, insincerity, self focus, restlessness, critical and temperamental.<br><br>What a Gemini likes:<br>Intellectual stimulation.<br>Ideas and thoughts.<br>New trends to investigate.<br>Friends and socializing.<br>Talking.<br>Sharing ideals.<br>Learning.<br>Upbeat, lively mates.<br><br>What a Gemini Dislikes:<br>Routines and ruts.<br>Feeling ignored.<br>Being confined.<br>Apathy.<br>Being the one to make all the decisions.<br>Slowness.<br>Being directed.<br><br>Gemini Love Keywords:<br>Friendly, mind oriented, spontaneous,<br>verbal, joyful, experimental, open minded, enthusiastic.<br><br>Cancer in Love<br>June 22-July 22<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Cancer is the cardinal water sign indicating that strong and rushing feelings and emotions guide their actions. When they love they love forever...period. Their extremely tough outer shell makes it hard to truly get into their heart but once in the loved one becomes pampered, adored and prone to being the intense focus of their feelings and moods. A Cancer lover instinctively nourishes and dotes on the object of their heart and can be all encompassing in all ways. Being traditional and home oriented means male Cancers like to follow the proper rules and ways to court, to fall in love and to make it permanent. Likewise for females who tend to wait until the man makes his move regardless of how strongly they may want to make a move. No one can do love and give love like a Cancer can, but it is heart and maternally oriented as opposed to sexually oriented and its worse tendency is to be smothering. A Cancer who feels insecure in a relationship is apt to become demanding: eith er sulking silently hurt or verbally making it clear what is wrong and why. The outer shell protects them from giving too soon and too often but those outer claws (another Crab attribute) serve to hold onto a loved one with a tenacious grasp that is almost impossible to break. Yet their actions are always driven by the true depth of their feelings and the loved one almost always holds a cherished spot in their heart even long after the union is over. When it comes to protection...not even Leo can outdo the fierce and loyal strength that a Cancer wields in the name of protecting a loved one.<br><br>Cancers Sexuality: Sex is not definable without emotions for most Cancers and they must feel something with relative strength for their truest feelings to come out in a romantic and sexual interlude. They are tender and partner oriented lovers and more concerned with pleasing their mates and feeling the returning emotions as nurturing proof of the partners love. Sex for cancer is attached to all things which mean security and loyalty and truth of the heart. Their needs tend to fluctuate according to their moods and emotional state as does their intensity and their desire levels. In many ways sexuality is an empowered field for Cancer as they are the zodiacs maternal nurturers it is the literal act of sex which has molded their 'job'. A cancer who is in love and feels secure will intuitively understand that and will treat it as the joyful gift it is.<br><br>The long term story: In a solid, secure relationship a Cancer can easily support the nuances of a long term relationship as they naturally nourish and supplement the changing nature of the union. On a lovers part it is important to understand their emotional vulnerability and how they cope with that through their built in defense mechanisms. Cancers are, undeniably, prone to a certain moodiness and such is the way they can learn to bend and flow and give what is needed to nurture those around them. The more a partner learns to enhance a cancers ability to detach from what is going around them and to learn the truth of their own power of emotional freedom the less this natural moodiness will manifest in overt ways.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Loyal, supportive, nurturing, compassionate, caring, dedication, faithfulness of emotions, tenderness, pampering, adoration.<br><br>Negative traits: Possessiveness, jealousy, moodiness, volatility, control issues, dependency issues, depression<br><br>What Cancer likes:<br>Feeling appreciated, Sincerity, Tradition, Stability, Routine, Loyalty, Commitment, Laughing, Feeling supported.<br>What Cancer Dislikes:<br>Erratic ness, Sudden, unexpected changes, Insincerity, Being ignored, Dishonesty, Not knowing how you feel, Being uncomfortable<br><br>Cancer Love Keywords:<br>Emotional, fluid, nurturing, supportive, moody, insecure, loving, loyal, tradition oriented, modest, generous, sincere.<br><br>Leo in Love<br>July 23-August 22<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Leo is the fixed fire sign. Think contained flames. Like a campfire that needs constant attention to keep alive and warm. There is a deep love for life and all of its possibilities...including its luxuries and that love transfers over beautifully into how a Leo expresses their feelings. Love with a Leo is like a magnificent encounter with the sun. They are warm and supportive when their heart is given and their affections grow stronger the more they feel that their partners care about them and adore them in return. Leo's are dramatically romantic and not afraid to show it. They enjoy pulling their loved ones out into their world and radiate when they feel their partners compliment some quality about themselves. Love becomes a thing of luxury and the partner receives the abundance of their personal Leo's attention,. lust and emotions. Because Leo's judge themselves on what they have around them (hence their love of luxury) they can be too appearance conscious at times and t oo critical of a mates qualities, appearance or talents. Because they truly need constant input to maintain their vitality they can sometimes become self-serving...occasionally to a point that it becomes egotistical.<br>You'll find that love with a Leo is like no other love...and when they decide to give you their heart....they also give you every inch of their soul. In this lies the Leo vulnerability....when their trust is broken they crumble. They, again, base their own self judgements on those they adore. Take away the loved one...and you've taken away their own identity in many ways. When Leos feel let down (and it usually takes a great deal) they either fall into an abyss of pain and depression..or they get utterly cold and without feeling. The lion....in protective mode.<br><br>Leo Sexuality: Leo's sexuality is as light filled and life filled as their ruling planet, The Sun. They are usually full of showmanship and expressive displays of attention. They enjoy the height of all feelings in life and sexual pleasure is just another glorious field to explore the luxuries of the body through. Leo's can be aggressive, passionate and encompassing lovers with exotic tastes...remember it is the love of life that inspires Leo and they can be wonderfully creative and experimental, especially when they feel secure. They are as proud in passion as they are in any other area of life and perhaps more so. The more appreciated and cherished they feel the more expressive and passionate they become.<br><br>The long-term story: Leos being fire signs are rather high maintenance partners. They require attention, nurturing and pampering. A mate has to be personally strong in them to enhance the partnership but also willing to step occasionally into their Leo's shadow. Leos are protective to the death for those they love and they are generous and expressive in a long term union that is constantly stoked and fed. Keep the campfire metaphor in mind. Unattended it dies out...mistreated it flares into unpredictable life and burns...but kept constant and tended it turns into a life giving warmth that is undying.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Protective, adoring, playful, inventive, generous, supportive, sensual, warm, joyful.<br><br>Negative traits: Possessive, jealous, control issues, coldness, cruelty, selfishness, egotistical, self serving.<br><br>What Leo likes:<br>Feeling Pampered, Being noticed, Being appreciated, Being the boss, Dramatic unions, Mate with a love of life, Receiving gifts<br>Socializing/parties.<br><br>What Leo Dislikes:<br>Apathy, Being ignored, Being criticized, Nagging, One up-manship, Competition, Lying/deceit, Laziness<br><br>Leo Love Keywords:<br>Expressive, demonstrative, engulfing, proud, sensual, adoring, control, egotistical, self-serving, jealousy, coldness, and cruelty.<br><br>Virgo in Love<br>August 23-September 22<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Virgo is the mutable earth-sign. There is movement but it is controlled, thought oriented and grounded. Virgo is a mind ruled person and they give their love slowly and with great seriousness. They dislike overt and grand standing displays of attention or emotion and will retreat inside themselves to escape it. They are a controlled person and their emotions fall into that category. When their heart is captured their loved on becomes a receptor to all the feelings and passions that Virgo has been keeping inside. At times even more expectations and conditions can be piled onto the lover simply because they are now holding the Virgos cherished feelings and dreams. In love they are devoted, loyal and nurturing. They have high self expectations and equally high expectations of their loved ones. They adore strength especially the dignified and quiet kind. They will tend to and take care of their loved one with diligence and focus.....it has become their 'job'. Love has to make sense for the Virgo...it has to fit into their idea and ideal of what their life is about. Once a lover has managed to slip into one of their dreams or plans the Virgo will hold onto that picture forever. They will go out of their way to make the union work and will spare no sacrifice in keeping it alive.<br><br>Virgo Sexuality: Virgos needs a certain setting, a definite layer of built up trust and privacy to allow their sexual sides to come out and play. Cleanliness is always important as is the 'right' setting. Virgo is inherently shy especially about their sensual needs but don't let that shyness fool you into thinking there is no fire lurking below the surface. They can become as devoted and focused on exploring their sexuality with a trusted lover as they are about making their life work. They have a completely uninhibited (yes this word applies to Virgo) potential that is lust filled and yet still retains a sense of purity. Virgos are notorious for their high standards in selecting a sexual partner but once those standards have been met pure sensual pleasure is the reward.<br><br>The long term story: Life is orderly with a Virgo. Some may live in a messy house with overflowing laundry and unorganized shelves but within your mate there is some sense of strict control that is directed into some facet of life. They are caretakers and need to feel comfortable enough to slip into that role. They can nag and criticize but they usually have their lovers� best interests at heart. They don't mind taking on more than their share of work and once committed they stay committed. They are time oriented, schedule craving souls who cannot tolerate a late mate or a scattered life energy.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Nurturing, devoted, uninhibited, caring, loving, sacrificial, quiet, considerate, protective.<br><br>Negative traits: Coldness, inability to be demonstrative, calculating, hard edged, overly critical, judgmental, compulsive.<br><br>What Virgo likes:<br>Feeling secure.<br>Personal cleanliness.<br>Routines.<br>Loyalty<br>Being pampered when down.<br>Equality<br>Subtle displays of romance.<br>Dedication<br>Being active<br>What Virgo Dislikes:<br>Tardiness<br>Vulgarity<br>Loud displays of affection.<br>Personal untidiness.<br>Hypocrisy<br>Weakness<br>Complaining<br>Idleness<br><br>Virgo Love Keywords:<br>Loyal, loving, caring, nurturing, dedicated, devoted, cold, critical, unfeeling, and self-serving.<br><br>Libra in Love<br>September 23-October 22<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Libra is the cardinal-air sign ruled by Venus. This means heart processes through the mind. Libra is an active and sociable lover who enjoys having people around them as much as their intimacy. They are generally sensual and passionate lovers whose love of luxury and beauty penetrates the bedroom and the relationship. They are the peacekeepers of the zodiac and weigh all sides and situations equally as such they often have difficulties in making hard and fast decisions. This can be frustrating for their loved ones as they vacillate between this and that...one way and another. Libra needs attention and the company of other people and when deprived of that they can sink into a very real depression and lose their inspiration. They are people oriented and enjoy the stimulation of having their loved ones and friends an active part of their life. This often creates a problem when the lover feels no more important then their best friend. Libras are all around charming and good na tured even when they don't want to be and they can actively stifle any personal complaints until they reach the boiling point. When a Libra has allowed the scales to become unfairly tipped they often lash out explosively. Surprising their mates who have come to see only their gentle and peaceable exterior. Libras love romance and all of its finest attributes from flowers, to poetry to love songs. They like the accessories that come along with being in love and the state of being in love itself...is often their primary focus in life. Whether it is being in love with their life, their job or their person.....they want to feel the connection of their heart..to their world and their mind.<br><br>Libra Sexuality: Libras generally prefer the romantic, tender and extravagant extensions of sexuality and lust. They like the goodies, the romantic gestures, the love thoughts left in their morning mail. Love is an idealized vision to a Libra and it comes complete with setting, tone and atmosphere. They often are hesitant to speak their likes and dislikes and it is important to coax them into speaking their minds. Rough and coarse interludes are usually a no-no and the more artistically pleasing and overtly romantic the better.<br><br>The long term story: Libras need variety in the people around them. They feel most comfortable and secure in peaceful and harmonious settings and wilt when there is negativity or turmoil. The enjoy a partners receptivity to doing 'stuff' for them, running errands or taking the imitative on a 'couple' project. They have an amazing reservoir of strength behind them that can be startling and they usually have remarkable minds behind their beauty. They enjoy having a pleasing and pretty home and a lot of attention goes into the process of making life beautiful. Including ignoring some of the harsher realities and avoiding any kind of actions that can disturb the peace or status quo. They also have tempers and when they feel the scales have become to unequal can explode suddenly.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Demonstrative, affectionate, playful, sensual, easy going, gentle, fair, giving, receptive.<br><br>Negative traits: Indecisive, self centered, detached, temperamental at times, envious, dishonest.<br><br>What Libra likes:<br>Romance in all of its glory, Harmony, Beautiful things, Attention &amp; admiration, Having people around, Intelligence, Creativity &amp; imagination, Gentleness, Feeling supported<br><br>What Libra Dislikes:<br>Criticism, Loud arguments, Being forced into decisions, Coarseness/crudeness, Confusion situations, Disloyalty, Lack of enthusiasm, Apathy<br><br>Libra Love Keywords:<br>Romantic, creative, artistic, loving, generous, pleasant, sensual, indecisive, argumentative, envy and jealousy.<br><br>Scorpio in Love<br>October 23-November 21<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Scorpio is the fixed-water sign indicating still waters that run very, very deep. There is an intense and smoldering sexuality and sensuality within every Scorpio as there's is the sign that rules lust and sex. There are three very different types of Scorpio from the scorpion, to the eagle to either the phoenix or the dove (depending on which symbolism one prefers). Yet each will have a profound depth and attraction to love and what accompanies love in their life. They are passionate when they invest their feelings and life is never boring with a Scorpio lover. They thrive when they feel secure and stable within a relationship and enjoy the physical gifts of being in love as much as the emotional ones. They are mysterious...always....and you'll never know what is on your Scorpio Lovers mind....except when it is being expressed through their passion. They are watchful, quiet and dedicated mates who can be as protective of the ones they love as they are of their own vulnerab le emotions and feelings. They tend to be the dominate one in any relationship even if it is done very on inherently below the surface levels as feeling in control of a relationship is one of the ways they can invest their hearts. They have a notorious jealousy and possessiveness that has been well earned in Scorpio-Scorpios but which turns into an unequaled level of trust and faith in the eagle and the phoenix/dove.<br><br>Scorpio Sexuality: Scorpio is the sign that rules sexuality and the powers of lust. But their passion is only as deep and profound as it is because it is connected with the ultimate gift of sex.....life. And these are the beings unafraid to face either life or death and that fearlessness translates into their sexual expressions. They can reach the highest highs or the lowest lows in whatever passion they pursue and they are the most intense, uninhibited and dynamic lovers in the zodiac. It comes with deep attachment and needs and a driving urge to come to terms with the enormity of life.<br><br>The long term story: Scorpios require a solid security within a relationship without feeling that they have a doormat as a mate. This is precarious balance and is learned over time. The longer a relationship lasts with a Scorpio...the more secure it tends to become. They are naturally suspicious (remember they feel and see things the rest of us work to ignore) and with that depth comes the need for some equally powerful self protective mechanisms. Their insecurity and jealousy are by products of self preservation. Scorpios like to be in control and are very seldom found in subservient roles unless they've opted to move into that spot. They need passionate mates who can keep up with their desires and they need someone capable of both maintaining a loyalty and their own sense of individuality in order to keep the relationship balanced. They are basically homebodies feeling most comfortable when they are within their own domains. They despise being surprised, embarras sed or humiliated and retaliate with swiftness...and strength. Scorpios are capable of some amazing turn around and growth. Even a Scorpio who seems entrenched in the scorpion phase can suddenly and dramatically grow wings and sail up into the heavens. Never under estimate their powers of rejuvenation on either physical, spiritual or emotional planes.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Loyal, supportive, protective, generous with their strength and knowledge, humble, quiet, unshakable, passionate, encompassing.<br><br>Negative traits: Jealousy, possessiveness, obsessive, angry, suspicious, mistrusting, secretive and unreliable.<br><br>What Scorpio likes:<br>Mystery, Secrets, Privacy, Trust/loyalty, Sensuality/passion, Strength, Knowing where they stand, Being acknowledged Honesty/integrity<br><br>What Scorpio Dislikes:<br>Surprises, Lying and deceit, Apathy, Being analyzed/questioned, Being 'understood', Excessive compliments, Insincerity<br>Being embarrassed, Passivity<br><br>Scorpio Love Keywords:<br>Intense, compelling, magnetic, sexual, sensual, intriguing, profound, loyal, tenacious, possessive, jealous, obsessive, bad tempered, secretive.<br><br>Sagittarius in Love<br>November 22-December 21<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Sagittarius treats love like any other adventure in their lives and embraces the opportunities to discover new plateaus in the experience of love, lust and passion. They are funny, charming, gregarious and usually highly intelligent begins who make genuinely enjoyable company and are captivating in their sparkling personalities. They have big dreams and far reaching goals and they easily share what their minds are experiencing often forgetting that for some words are meant to become reality. Sagittarius is not always capable of bringing reality to their words and such is the way it is meant to be. They infuse us with inspiration and allow us to see all the possibilities in the world around us. In close personal relationships that can often cause troubles as they promise more than they can deliver....or....have changes of emotions that put them into completely different mind sets from one day to another. They are active and vibrant and expect their loved ones to enjoy the s ame kind of physical adventures. They are appearance conscious and Their wit is one of their greatest assets and they enjoy the attention of others..this makes them the natural flirts of the zodiac and most of it is harmless and meaningless.<br><br>Sagittarius Sexuality: Like the other fire signs Sagittarius has a definite sense of passion and a love of physical connections but for them it becomes almost a spiritual experience...or another occasion to have 'fun'. The more exotic the local or the setting the more inspired a Sagittarian is and an inspired Sagittarian is the consummate lover. There's is the sense of a dare devil in them and they love walking on the risqui side...playing with rules and regulations usually just nudging the line rather than crossing it. They are attracted to far away places and intriguing sexual imagery and fantasy is an important component as Sagittarius needs to be inspired to inspire.<br><br>The long term story: Feeling trusted and free to pursue their adventures is a pre-requisite to a long term encounter with a Sagittarian. They use words as both weapons and tools and can be either supportive and uplifting or remarkably sarcastic and cutting and sometimes both in the same breath. They are naturally flirtatious but usually bottom line loyal and the more they feel 'understood' the more they focus on the benefits of the relationship. Even a stay at home Sagittarius will enjoy adventures through the mind and if they are not physically taking on life challenges for adrenalin rushes they are arm chair quarterbacks or avid game players. Their sense of competition is acute and it is also one of the things that keeps them moving forward in life.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Joyful, playful, spontaneous, generous, captivating, enchanting, supportive, good-natured.<br><br>Negative traits: Unreliable, fickle, sarcastic, temperamental, unable to commit, freedom loving to the extreme, self centered, vain.<br><br>What Sagittarius likes:<br>A sense of adventure, Honesty, Freedom, Intellectual compatibility, Taking risks, Flirting, Socializing, Feeling trusted, Active partner, Daydreaming<br><br>What Sagittarius Dislikes:<br>Jealousy, Possessiveness, Routine, Being doubted, Having to explain self, Control, Being forced to make promises<br>Apathy/laziness<br><br>Sagittarius Love Keywords:<br>Exuberant, charming, funny, far sighted, adventuress, adoring, non-possessive, flighty, sarcastic, unreliable, self centered, dogmatic, judgmental.<br><br>Capricorn in Love<br>December 22-January 19<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>There is a rumor that Capricorns are the best lovers of the zodiac when they feel stable and secure and can see the long term purpose of the union they are in. The focused determination of Saturn as a guiding light brings the same unequaled force into the bedroom and into the relationship as they apply to building their life and their security. Capricorn is slow to trust and even slower to love but once their heart is given there is very little they won't do to back up and support and love their mate. The symbolism of Capricorn is the Seagoat...a useful metaphor is the ability to penetrate both environments on earth....water and land. Spiritually...they can conquer both the spirit and the body. Love is nothing less than a goal and they are capable of approaching it with the same dedication as they approach any other important endeavor in their life. They are loyal, nurturing caregivers and supporters at their best. Cold, calculating and emotionally repressed at their worst . The realm of feelings is the hardest plane for Capricorns to come to terms with as it is based on an energy that they cannot control . Once they accept and embrace their emotional beings they are human dynamos who add strength, conviction and longevity to love.<br><br>Capricorn Sexuality: When they are secure within themselves and within a partnership they can take their lover to the peaks of sexual mountaintops. They know how to apply patience and dedication to discovering how to please and their leisurely approach to getting to know a mates intimate secrets promises that they possess an almost push button control of their partners sexual desires. It is not the pure and raw driving sexuality of Scorpio...nor the romantic and enchanting passion of Libra...it is a combination of the human physical need for sex and the spirits need to experience the height of a pleasure and to merge it into one. A soul moving encounter that brings the primal...into the spiritual.<br><br>The long term story: Capricorns require patience and dedication. They are often shy and awkward in their emotions early on growing in strength and acceptance the longer they stay within a union. They need to have a purpose behind their actions and a purpose behind the relationship. They take the initial investment of heart to the building of a long term commitment with the same serious intent that they conquer all their mountains in life. They can be domineering and cold if they are not in touch with their feeling centers. Materialistic and self serving as well. Once committed most Capricorns stay committed as they are bound to a sense of responsibility. It takes a lot to sever a serious Capricorn tie but once it is severed...they can be vengeful and hateful. They are not always the best judge of character and so let downs and relationship break ups become personal mistakes that they often repress and refuse to accept. They provide one of the most secure and empowe ring bonds when they are completely in love.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Loyal, dedicated, patient, kind, generous, supportive, serious, dependable, tolerant, attentive.<br><br>Negative traits: Possessiveness, control, coldness and aloofness, lack of emotional tolerance or depth, materialistic, narrow minded, vindictive, bitter, melancholy.<br><br>What Capricorn likes:<br>Loyalty, Feeling secure, Financial/material stability, Ambitious mates, Feeling committed, Making long term relationship plans<br>Dependability, Reliability, Perseverance<br><br>What Capricorn Dislikes:<br>Flightiness, Being bossed around, Crudeness/coarseness, Dominance, Game playing, Ego displays, Extravagance<br>Being challenged by a lover, Indecisiveness<br><br>Capricorn Love Keywords:<br>Loyal, ambitious, dedicated, focused, honesty, disciplined, severe, possessive, controlling, cold, calculating<br><br>Aquarius in Love<br>January 20-February 18<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Aquarius is the fixed-air sign. They are progressive, liberal 'thinkers' who also tend to hold onto their thoughts and ideals with tenacity. (The fixed influence) They are generally more comfortable with a friendly love partnership where they feel secure enough to continue pursuing their many varied interests. They are hard to pin down and even harder to get into a solid commitment but once there that fixed influence makes them loyal and trustworthy companions. Albeit with an eclectic influence. Aquarians adore friendships of the impersonal type and usually have a revolving door of buddies. They can be completely enchanted by any one of their new acquaintances and the group they attract runs the gamut from the off-beat and 'odd' to the powerful and the wealthy. Your Aquarian doesn't judge people by 'what' they have rather by their principals and actions. Aquarians require someone pretty secure within themselves as they are inherently self motivated and need the freedom to pursue their latest ideal or whim.<br>Yet they can be focused and dedicated to a relationship, especially if they feel accepted and understood. They delight...in delighting and they regale in having a companion who is eager to explore the world of thought and possibilities with them. Freedom fighters with a shared cause build a bond that the Aquarian will guard with strength and conviction. They are also tolerant, lacking in jealousy or possessiveness and will over-look and understand all kinds of human follies and mistakes from their partner. Once they are hurt however....their emotions go off with a flip of the switch that does not ever....go back on. Coldness is the opposite of Aquarians enchanting friendship/commitment.<br><br>Aquarius Sexuality: Aquarius is the sign most likely to forget about sex entirely. It isn't that they don't enjoy it....they do when they feel comfortable and secure....but there are so many other things to explore with their minds and so little time. When caught in the 'mood' they are explorative, frisky and playful. They take obvious delight in the attention their partner gives them. They can be extremely self conscious about their bodies or their sexuality or completely uninhibited and sometimes both. The bedroom becomes a playground to further solidify the bond of friendship that the Aquarian needs in their life and they are delightful companions when they feel good about the union..and about themselves.<br><br>The long term story: Lots of open mindedness, freedom to pursue their interests and constant input to the friendship are the building blocks for maintaining a long term relationship with an Aquarian. Remember that they are the rebels of the zodiac and if they feel they are being controlled or ignored their defense can be to automatically rebel against any incoming input from their partner. Their natural instinct tells them to do the opposite of what is expected. They jump wholeheartedly into their latest cause but can do about faces so suddenly it takes ones breath away. It's important to have a 'go with the flow' system in place and gradually the Aquarian learns to be more vocal and explanatory about their thoughts, their movements and their actions. They make dedicated and genuinely sincere and warm mates once they commit and they possess the spark that can keep the friendship a dynamic and ever growing platform to journey into eternity on.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Playful, friendly, spontaneous, open minded, caring, devoted, liberal, understanding, tolerant, benevolent.<br><br>Negative traits: Erratic, undependable, self oriented, cold, aloof, mean, self centered, unable to commit, judgmental, fickle.<br><br>What an Aquarius likes:<br>Friendship, Freedom, Intellectual stimulation, Camaraderie, Surprises, Companionship, Feeling understood and Emotional safety<br><br>What an Aquarius Dislikes:<br>Jealousy, Possessiveness, Control, Ego plays, Narrow mindedness, Being ridiculed, Routines, Fighting/violence Inequality, Being taken for granted<br>Being understood (note: this makes the Likes list as well...they're unique but you already know that)<br><br>Aquarius Love Keywords:<br>Friendly, charming, open minded, liberal, accepting, non-judgmental, playful, spontaneous, erratic, eccentric, undependable, non-committal,<br>aloof.<br><br>Pisces in Love<br>February 19-March 20<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Pisces is the mutable water sign and very much exist in their own universe, tuned into the emotional, receptive qualities of life that most of us cannot see, touch nor feel. In love they are dream filled and romantic, full of enchanted visions and hopeful fantasies. They're eager to share their thoughts and reveries when they feel secure, understood and appreciated. Of all the signs Pisces needs the most encouragement to feel true within themselves and to learn the validity of their own thoughts and needs. They make the most delightful companions and are generally soft, gentle and easy going, especially if they have a role model to look up to within the relationship. This is a delicate balance that Pisces learns to control as they go through life as their projections onto their mate can be helpful if it encourages them to motivate their own lives and resources but can turn into tenacious co-dependency if the Pisces refuses to embrace their own lives, needs and thoughts. Th ey can be confusing creatures never able to define their roles within the relationship and constantly turning to sources outside of the union for definition and explanation. This can slowly erode the bond between the lovers/partners as the partner. A Pisces encouraged to find and embrace their answers within themselves and one who has learned to trust their own thoughts, feelings and perceptions make one of the most loving, sensual and devoted mates their is.<br><br>Pisces Sexuality: Pisces sexuality is always wrapped around those inner worlds they exist in and becomes an emotional experience that can take them on voyages into ecstasy and passion. But because they do exist within this world where things are nebulous, mystical and emotion oriented if they are projecting outwards to find validity of what they are seeing and feeling inside rather than combining the experience of the physical intimacy with the thoughts and dreams they can feel disappointed...or saddened. If they've learned to simply using what is inside to inspire their participation in the literal reality based world they can take their lover on their enchanted voyages with them..and create an exciting and enchanting sexual companionship.<br><br>The long term story: There is a certain amount of inner strength combined with outer strength that is needed when involved long term with a Pisces, as they must learn to become their own sources of joy, inspiration and answers. A weak mate who goes along with every Piscean whim or fantasy is as destructive as a mate who cannot see the validity of those things they are experiencing internally. One can create a union with no solidity or reality underneath of it and the other can cause the Pisces to further doubt their own truth and inner strength. At the best the Pisces brings to the relationship a touch of all that is universal and mysterious. They are dreamy, poetic and romance filled beings who make life a true sojourn through the world of feelings and passions. At worst they release any semblance of inner belief and become attached to the partner or other form of projection in an attempt to capture outside..what goes on inside.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Playful, friendly, spontaneous, open minded, caring, devoted, liberal, understanding, tolerant, benevolent.<br><br>Negative traits: Erratic, undependable, self oriented, cold, aloof, mean, self centered, unable to commit, judgmental, fickle.<br><br>What a Pisces likes:<br>Romance, Feeling appreciated, Stability, Feeling needed, Mystical settings/enchantment, Being encouraged to dream, Sharing thoughts/dreams, Having their input valued, A role model, Feeling loved<br><br>What a Pisces Dislikes:<br>Feeling vulnerable, Feeling alone/unloved, Having no goals to project towards, Feeling invalidated, Being ignored<br>Crude/harsh behavior, Noisy scenes/displays, Having no dreams, Having no sense of structure<br><br>Pisces Love Keywords:<br>Mystical, enchanting, emotional, loving, devoted, reverent, creative, confused, depressed, irresponsible, goal-less, lack of motivation or push, co-dependency issues.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Libra in Love<br>September 23-October 22<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Libra is the cardinal-air sign ruled by Venus. This means heart processes through the mind. Libra is an active and sociable lover who enjoys having people around them as much as their intimacy. They are generally sensual and passionate lovers whose love of luxury and beauty penetrates the bedroom and the relationship. They are the peacekeepers of the zodiac and weigh all sides and situations equally as such they often have difficulties in making hard and fast decisions. This can be frustrating for their loved ones as they vacillate between this and that...one way and another. Libra needs attention and the company of other people and when deprived of that they can sink into a very real depression and lose their inspiration. They are people oriented and enjoy the stimulation of having their loved ones and friends an active part of their life. This often creates a problem when the lover feels no more important then their best friend. Libras are all around charming and good na tured even when they don't want to be and they can actively stifle any personal complaints until they reach the boiling point. When a Libra has allowed the scales to become unfairly tipped they often lash out explosively. Surprising their mates who have come to see only their gentle and peaceable exterior. Libras love romance and all of its finest attributes from flowers, to poetry to love songs. They like the accessories that come along with being in love and the state of being in love itself...is often their primary focus in life. Whether it is being in love with their life, their job or their person.....they want to feel the connection of their heart..to their world and their mind.<br><br>Libra Sexuality: Libras generally prefer the romantic, tender and extravagant extensions of sexuality and lust. They like the goodies, the romantic gestures, the love thoughts left in their morning mail. Love is an idealized vision to a Libra and it comes complete with setting, tone and atmosphere. They often are hesitant to speak their likes and dislikes and it is important to coax them into speaking their minds. Rough and coarse interludes are usually a no-no and the more artistically pleasing and overtly romantic the better.<br><br>The long term story: Libras need variety in the people around them. They feel most comfortable and secure in peaceful and harmonious settings and wilt when there is negativity or turmoil.

            <div class='col-md body'>Cancer in Love<br>June 22-July 22<br>) 2001 Linda Rankin<br><br>Cancer is the cardinal water sign indicating that strong and rushing feelings and emotions guide their actions. When they love they love forever...period. Their extremely tough outer shell makes it hard to truly get into their heart but once in the loved one becomes pampered, adored and prone to being the intense focus of their feelings and moods. A Cancer lover instinctively nourishes and dotes on the object of their heart and can be all encompassing in all ways. Being traditional and home oriented means male Cancers like to follow the proper rules and ways to court, to fall in love and to make it permanent. Likewise for females who tend to wait until the man makes his move regardless of how strongly they may want to make a move. <strong>No one can do love and give love like a Cancer can</strong>, but it is heart and maternally oriented as opposed to sexually oriented and its worse tendency is to be smothering. A Cancer who feels insecure in a relationship is apt to become demanding: eith er sulking silently hurt or verbally making it clear what is wrong and why. The outer shell protects them from giving too soon and too often but those outer claws (another Crab attribute) serve to hold onto a loved one with a tenacious grasp that is almost impossible to break. Yet their actions are always driven by the true depth of their feelings and the loved one almost always holds a cherished spot in their heart even long after the union is over. When it comes to protection...not even Leo can outdo the fierce and loyal strength that a Cancer wields in the name of protecting a loved one.<br><br>Cancers Sexuality: Sex is not definable without emotions for most Cancers and they must feel something with relative strength for their truest feelings to come out in a romantic and sexual interlude. They are tender and partner oriented lovers and more concerned with pleasing their mates and feeling the returning emotions as nurturing proof of the partners love. Sex for cancer is attached to all things which mean security and loyalty and truth of the heart. Their needs tend to fluctuate according to their moods and emotional state as does their intensity and their desire levels. In many ways sexuality is an empowered field for Cancer as they are the zodiacs maternal nurturers it is the literal act of sex which has molded their 'job'. A cancer who is in love and feels secure will intuitively understand that and will treat it as the joyful gift it is.<br><br>The long term story: In a solid, secure relationship a Cancer can easily support the nuances of a long term relationship as they naturally nourish and supplement the changing nature of the union. On a lovers part it is important to understand their emotional vulnerability and how they cope with that through their built in defense mechanisms. Cancers are, undeniably, prone to a certain moodiness and such is the way they can learn to bend and flow and give what is needed to nurture those around them. The more a partner learns to enhance a cancers ability to detach from what is going around them and to learn the truth of their own power of emotional freedom the less this natural moodiness will manifest in overt ways.<br><br>Positive Traits in Love: Loyal, supportive, nurturing, compassionate, caring, dedication, faithfulness of emotions, tenderness, pampering, adoration.<br><br>Negative traits: Possessiveness, jealousy, moodiness, volatility, control issues, dependency issues, depression<br><br>What Cancer likes:<br>Feeling appreciated, Sincerity, Tradition, Stability, Routine, Loyalty, Commitment, Laughing, Feeling supported.<br>What Cancer Dislikes:<br>Erratic ness, Sudden, unexpected changes, Insincerity, Being ignored, Dishonesty, Not knowing how you feel, Being uncomfortable<br><br>Cancer Love Keywords:<br>Emotional, fluid, nurturing, supportive, moody, insecure, loving, loyal, tradition oriented, modest, generous, sincere.<br><br></div>
