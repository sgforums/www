              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>I have unlimited plan for sms and calls from m1 and paying $200 per month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently I have receive call from  m1 staff  to take away my unlimited sms and change the content of my plan. She explained that i have violated terms and condition of my plan.<br><br>I would like to make my stand that the sales person whom i took up this plan did not explain the terms and condition to me at all, simply just ask to sign. Now it is totally unfair for me to pay for something that i did not sign up for. If i am explained clearly before i sign up for this plan, i will not take up this plan at all. It will affects my decision. <br><br>Now the problem arise after 1 year + . They said that i cannot send high volume sms but they offer the unlimited plan to me. They did not tell me that i cannot send mass sms to others. If i knew this i will not go for it for sure. <br><br>Well.. Now m1 said that my sms will reduce to 2000 sms per month. So i do not sign up for this hence M1 should give me the option to be freed from the agreement or to continue. But i wasnt given any option at all but to FORCED to ACCEPT what is arrange for me and pay $200 per month for this plan i did not sign up for. If i am to terminate the plan, i am going to pay a penalty.<br><br><br>1st: Salesman trick me to sign the agreement without explaining the terms and condition<br><br>2nd: After 1 Year or so, Company Manager call me and said that decision have been made and you are to accept what is arrange for you.<br><br>3rd: No Option to Choose but to pay for something you didnt sign up for? <br><br><br> I am really struck into something that is not what i pay for. I am recommended by shop sales to take up this plan for unlimited sms and calls and nobody explained to me at all and just ask me to sign the agreement. How can M1 do such a thing to a loyal consumer... I have been supporting m1 but such a thing happen to me. I have really lost faith and trust on M1. <br><br> <br>im been struck and who should i look for help? They ask me to send feedback in website but it will go to nowhere i believe, I wish to talk to higher position for appeal but they wont give me any contact. I was told that i cannot appeal as DECISION HAVE BEEN MADE. Anyone pls advise me.</p>
