With all this happening, you are not only paying an extra price but also queuing up at relevant telecom outlets to make necessary purchases and micro sim is definately one of them. Personally, I had to make 3 trips to my telecom provider, queing up for hours and end up paying extra....Not just this, you have to set up a new itunes account and then back up all stuff from your old phone or set up all together   </p></div>

              <p><strong>Iphone4 shouldn't have a micro sim which makes us spend more even without willing to do so....</strong></p>
              <p>Iphone4 has been a fantastic phone with all its applications,
                                      efficiency, multitasking, 5mp camera with HDR/video option and even

                                      3G as well...I simply loved it but at the same time when I had to
                                      transit to Iphone4, it wasn't a very pleasant experience....Imagine
                                      with every iphone 4, you have to get a new micro sim which you had

              <p> </p>
              <p>I am now wondering was it worth transiting from Iphone 3G to 4G? Why did I pay for the new phone, extra for the sim and wasted a lot of time? Wasn't I satisfied earlier and could have waited for a year or so to actually cover the cost of Iphone 3G?....Afterall, these are all brilliant but expensive toys......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tell me how was your experience if you were also one of like me?</p>

              <p>the alarm got bug oso<br><strong><br>iPhone 4 users, did your alarm go off today?<br></strong><em><span class="update">By Hoe Yeen Nie | </span><span class="update">Posted: 01 January 2011 1450 hrs </span></em> <br><br><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Some 
              iPhone 4 users got off to a bad start in the New Year when the alarm 
              function of their phones failed to go off, apparently due to a bug in 
              the smart phone's operating system.<br><br>One affected user is Alex Lam, who called the Channel NewsAsia hotline.<br><br>"I
               set my alarm last night for 6.30 this morning. I only received a call 
              from my colleague at 8am, and that was when I realised I was already 
              late for work," Mr Lam said. <br><br>"I immediately went to work and noticed my colleagues were also late because their iPhone alarms also didn't go off." <br><br>The problem was first reported in Australia and New Zealand, which were the first countries to ring in the New Year.<br><br>And complaints have been coming fast and furious on social networking sites such as Twitter.<br><br>According to tech websites, users can avoid the problem by setting the alarm to the "repeat" mode.<br><br>iPhone maker Apple has not yet made an official comment.<br><br>But
               it had promised an upgrade of the operating system soon, following 
              similar glitches in November when the phone's clock failed to register 
              the switch from daylight savings time.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
