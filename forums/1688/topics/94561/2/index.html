That's not possible,' he said.<br><br>Instead, parents need to judge the extent to which their children can master Chinese. As children have different language backgrounds, abilities and interests, schools need to be flexible in customising Chinese lessons.<br><br>'Most important is, don't turn the student off, which is what we have succeeded in doing. By forcing them to achieve the standard, we have turned off one generation, which is a great pity.<br><br>'They are fed up. They are forced by their parents, forced by their school. They have bad results, they hate it, they want nothing more to do with it, which I think is a tragedy.'<br><br>To cater to the different abilities of students, a modular approach will allow those with a weak foundation in Chinese to take bridging modules, while those who are strong can take advanced modules.<br><br>Parents can choose how much Chinese exposure they want their children to have. While few parents may want Chinese as a master language for their children today, this may change in 10 to 20 years.<br><br>Some parents, including English-speaking ones, may want their children to enjoy more exposure to Chinese in their early years.<br><br>If there is demand, a few schools should be allowed to use Chinese as the dominant language of instruction in the early primary school years.<br><br>There can be different outcomes for each child depending on his interest and ability.<br><br>Those who have interest in the language and culture may want to read Chinese studies at university to become journalists and teachers. These future language workers will play a key role in regenerating the language and culture and preserving bilingual education in schools.<br><br>A group of top students will also be nurtured to become bicultural, with the new Bicultural Studies Programme receiving much interest from parents.<br><br>Most will be equipped with a basic working capacity which they can build on to do business with the Chinese in China or Singapore, and to keep the cultural identity alive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Time to loosen up - this is an order </strong><br>By Koh Buck Song<br><br>IN THE study of leadership, one discovers endless links between quite separate things. Research shows that people tend to be more motivated to work harder if bosses relate to them like key persons from their past, usually parents.<br><br>Sigmund Freud's perspective on psychoanalysis helps explain why Starbucks has a low staff turnover (four times below industry average) and high performance. Younger Starbucks staff, more used to getting room to manoeuvre at home, respond well in a workplace that includes them as 'partners' in decision-making.<br><br>This is 'transference' - projecting organisational expectations based on personal relationships.<br><br>In a Harvard Business Review article last month, Michael Maccoby, an American psychoanalyst, anthropologist and management consultant, observed that Westerners typically saw fathers and bosses as 'people who were helpful when needed but generally encouraged followers to be independent'.<br><br>Of course, there are strict Western parents too, but the generalisation is true: Western parents spare the rod and bring up children to be independent by age 18, if not earlier. So, Western employees appreciate getting the autonomy they are accustomed to at home.<br><br>Maccoby also found, with significant personal relationships extending beyond parents to others such as siblings, a team culture was more conducive.<br><br>By contrast, Asians - particularly ethnic Chinese in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore - 'wanted a father-manager who protected them and taught them. In return, they were willing to give the leader complete loyalty and obedience'. This follows from how the older generation raised offspring - to be seen, not heard. Thus, Asians are 'programmed' not to challenge authority whether in the office or society.<br><br>But there is a generational change happening now.<br><br>Maccoby found a new Asian trend: 'Young managers from Beijing, where the Cultural Revolution broke traditional family patterns, responded somewhat like the Westerners. They described the ideal leader as a good basketball coach who put people into the right roles, promoted teamwork, and knew how to adapt strategy to changing competition'.<br><br>The rise of Chinese individualism is personified in figures like American basketball star Yao Ming, a blend of Asian discipline and Western inventiveness. China's culture of family life has changed drastically, from a mix of control and benign neglect in large families previously, to today's liberation and close pampering of 'little emperors' in one-child families.<br><br>A similar shift has happened in Singapore. Children are being brought up differently now: Many parents want to give their children what they never had growing up: Asking awkward questions and making up their own minds.<br><br>How does this apply to the workplace? The many surveys showing high employee disengagement here suggest that leadership expectations are not being met. Employees who prefer less hierarchy and more peer teamwork feel hampered by old-style management. Over time, they lose the drive to show initiative, and also disengage.<br><br>These workings of 'transference' could explain why Singapore lacks entrepreneurial drive. Previously, following Dad's lead was instinctive and ingrained. Hence, the gravitation towards safe jobs. Now, young people are more adventurous but are still accustomed to rely on Dad for the good things in life.<br><br>Herein lies a fallacy in earlier thinking: Westerners are not 'genetically' more entrepreneurial or creative, so there is no reason to rely overly on foreign talent, or, worse still, stifle our own potential. It may just boil down to how we were brought up - much more nurture than nature.<br><br>This suggests the handicap can be overcome, although perhaps not entirely or easily, as we learn from Freud how deep and durable is the psyche, once formed. Still, what can be done to adapt Singapore's leadership culture to spur more entrepreneurship and the spirit of asking 'why not'?<br><br>One place to start is the effect of 'counter-transference' - opposite of 'transference' - when those in authority project their expectations as parents onto workplace subordinates. So, 'old-school' supervisors who expect staff to be like obedient children need to change their mindsets: Respect now has to be earned, not demanded.<br><br>This is relevant to the extent it is true that the current national desire to nurture more initiative may well be blocked at middle management levels.<br><br>But a solution may be at hand. If these 'old mindset' managers respond best to Freudian stimuli like top-down motivation, their bosses can try leading change by commanding them to loosen up. Why not?<br><br>The writer studied leadership at Harvard University.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">The way to creativity </span></strong><br><br>It is precisely because we want pupils to be able to think more critically that out-of-syllabus questions are necessary. It will be unrealistic to set routine questions and expect pupils to turn out to be creative individuals.<br><br>In complaining that the increasing number of out-of-syllabus questions have rendered the exams unfair, we have missed the point of the exams and reduced them to nothing more than grades. Should grades and not education be the fundamental aim of studying, we will be in dire straits.<br><br>Poor results may lower the self-esteem of pupils, but they can equally be a good learning experience - that life is never smooth sailing. Even the very best students will falter, and it is a good way to train them to be robust and resilient. If they are unable to take a little setback, the young will have indeed gone 'soft' and we will have much to worry about our future.<br><br>KELVIN LIM HOCK SEONG<br><br>HARD WORK DOESN'T GUARANTEE RESULTS: I refer to Ms Grace Yong Fui Han's letter, 'A testing experience for pupils' (ST, Oct 13). Ms Yong commented that the PSLE was 'unfair to both the teachers and the students'. This is hardly the case. The PSLE aims to stream pupils into different bands. This would be achieved only if the papers set were challenging. The true test of ability lies in the application of contextual knowledge. This being so, sheer drilling and 'hard and incredibly boring work' do not guarantee results.<br><br>WONG ZI WEI<br><br>HOW IS MOE UNFAIR?: While I agree with Ms Grace Yong that the PSLE is not age appropriate and children will not learn best, I do not see how the test has become increasingly unfair.<br><br>The Ministry of Education did not instruct pupils to attempt top schools' prelim papers, nor was it stated that the questions would be similar to those from the PSLE Examination Questions 1999-2003. Instead, it has been emphasised repeatedly by MOE that the syllabus is not absolute. I am sure that it would be more meaningful reading an encyclopaedia or reference book than working incredibly hard on boring past-year papers from top schools.<br><br>We have always called for innovation, thinking out of the box, and this is precisely the direction MOE is moving towards. We should encourage our kids to read beyond the syllabus, encourage them if they do not do well and, most importantly, inculcate the point that scoring As is not everything.<br><br>TAN KUANG SHING<br><br>WHAT'S ANSWER TO $6M QUESTION?: I am really interested in finding out the solution to a question in the PSLE Science paper. A rod made of half iron and half wood was balanced in the centre. What will be the effect when the iron part is heated up?<br><br>Iron, when heated, will expand. Thus, the iron portion will now be longer and, using moments, it will move down. On the other hand, heating up the iron portion will cause a convention current in the surround-ing air, resulting in a force pushing the metal upwards.<br><br>The metal rod could go either way, or remain in its original position. It seems like there can be no correct answer, though there will be creative answers. I wonder how they will be graded.<br><br>CHUA CHIN SHENG<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Charities handle millions, so transparency vital </strong></span><br><br>New proposals place no undue burden on smaller charities, says NCSS chief. Public confidence crucial for the sector to grow<br><br>By Theresa Tan<br><br>THE millions that Singapore charities collect and the growing number of such agencies asking the public for financial help prompted the proposals to make these bodies more transparent about their affairs, The Straits Times was told in an exclusive interview.<br><br>Explaining the thinking behind the recommendations made by a government- appointed panel of experts, Mr Gerard Ee, who is part of the group, pointed out that the 'standard must-have operating rules' charities have to abide by have not 'evolved' or kept up with the times.<br><br>Those were drawn up 'decades ago', said the president of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), the umbrella body for social service organisations here.<br><br>Then, there were fewer Institutions of Public Character (IPC), the official term used to describe charities like the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) as well as the Singapore Academy of Law. Donations made to an IPC can be deducted from the donor's taxes.<br><br>There are now 898 such bodies, and last year they received a record $512 million in donations.<br><br>Yet, there is no single body to look into issues which confront these institutions in a 'systematic and holistic' manner, said Mr Ee.<br><br>There are also no clear rules on what needs to be disclosed. Mr Ee said: 'It's time to come up with guidelines, benchmarks and best practices. The principle here is to show accountability to the stakeholders.' It was with this in mind that his 10-member council drew up the recommendations released on Sept 23. These include the controversial proposal that charities' top brass disclose their pay cheques.<br><br>A significant number of the recommendations focus on giving donors more information on how their donations are used, something that few of these institutions do, Mr Ee pointed out.<br><br>The recommendations have elicited a slew of protests from the institutions and the public.<br><br>Their basic argument against the suggestions, which include telling people how their donations are spent and standardising accounting and reporting requirements, is that compliance would raise administrative costs, leaving less for charity.<br><br>But Mr Ee countered: 'The principle here is to show accountability.'<br><br>For the sector to continue growing, maintaining public confidence is crucial, he argued.<br><br>He explained that the agencies are being asked to disclose only their top three executives' annual remuneration, and to indicate this in just salary bands, with the first band from $0 to $100,000, followed by subsequent increments of $50,000.<br><br>Listed companies have to submit to a similar practice, he added.<br><br>He stressed that the recommendations would not place undue burden on the smaller charities, as under the suggested three-tier approach, they would be subject to less rigorous requirements.<br><br>Some of the smaller charities were overwhelmed by the recommendations, he said, because they failed to realise that what they have to do to comply is minimal.<br><br>On the other hand, larger charities worry that donors may back off if they 'tell people they have so much money'.<br><br>But Mr Ee maintained: 'When you go out and ask for money, you have a responsibility to tell your donors how their money is spent and how the organisation is run, regardless of how much is given<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Chinese as you like it </strong></span><br><br>FOREIGNERS often speak admiringly of Singaporeans' language ability. They are charmed by workaday speech that is switched from English to Mandarin or Malay and back again, and dazzled by formal communication in different languages used by the same speakers. Most Singaporeans have a sober view of their accomplishments: The English they use for work, commerce and play is passable, whereas the mother tongue or second language is just intelligible. For the Chinese-conversant, it is the other way around, although their Chinese tends to be stronger than is the English for the English-educated. Over the decades, bilingualism has served Singapore well despite the middling standards and the angst induced in one's school days. In response to social change and the clamour of some parents and educators, changes are now in store to make the teaching of Chinese more flexible. Any change can be accommodated, but it is important to stick to the bedrock principle that a working knowledge of two languages be not diminished. The rationale for the changes, to go before Parliament as a White Paper, is that Chinese has been shown to be hard to master, as a parallel language to English, so it needs to be customised for students of differing abilities. If this is not done, more will become less proficient in it, out of either disinterest or inability to cope.<br><br>Is this trend inevitable? The crucial social statistic to note is that a lot more Chinese households are using English for everyday communication. Education Ministry data show that in 1988, the families of 20 per cent of Chinese Primary 1 pupils spoke mainly English at home. The percentage has risen to 50 per cent. For such a short period, the increase has been startling. The presumption that the percentage will keep rising will be hard to disprove in a country which has English as the working language. It should be noted that young people in China are studying English with a vengeance, for its utilitarian value. On this basis, adjusting teaching methods to cater to cohorts of different aptitudes should be seen as a necessary correction, not a concession to a loud lobby. Chinese language specialists and community elders are sensitive to any suggestion that the teaching would be watered down to a point where students end up with superficial knowledge after formal school.<br><br>Aside from the modular approach, two other features of the recommendations command attention. Speech, reading and listening skills will be emphasised more than writing and the memorising of characters. This is a revolutionary change, but it has the cachet of successful experimentation in China. The change should have been brought in sooner, as writing skills in working life are far less of a requirement than reading and speech proficiency. Students should be encouraged to practise speaking Chinese outside of school. The second point is that examinations will be based on the new pedagogy. This is delicate ground: The Education Ministry has to set aside the teaching resources and effect a cultural change in classrooms, before exams can reflect faithfully the new model. On balance, students from English-speaking Chinese families should gain most from the changes proposed. Most of these households want their young to possess more than a nodding acquaintance with the language, for reasons of heritage and practicality. For the tiny minority who cling to English solely, like they would an inheritance, it is time to be realistic. Climate change is imminent. Their children are going to feel very exposed if they can handle only English.<br><br></div>
