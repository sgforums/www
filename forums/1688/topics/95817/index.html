            <div class='col-md body'>I think youger ppl will bring new ideas and different pespective in viewing the problems.<br><br><a href="http://&lt;strong&gt;How%20about%20having%20younger%20NMPs,%20and%20'average%20Joe'?%20&lt;/strong&gt;" rel="nofollow"><strong>How about having younger NMPs, and 'average Joe'? </strong></a><br><br>MORE young blood in the Government? Well, here's a thought. Bring in some younger Nominated MPs - late 20s, early 30s - who could be representative of the younger population that the Government is trying to reach.<br><br>Up till now, it seems that the ones picked are generally all very well-established individuals and tend to be over the age of 35.<br><br>In my opinion, the reason many young people are somewhat disillusioned with the Government is largely attributable to the fact that they don't know the office-holders in person. They have never met the Prime Minister, they have never talked to a minister. They see them only on TV or at official openings, giving speeches, and that is their perception of them.<br><br>Unfortunately, the fact that there are also many in the civil service who are still rather 'old fashioned' in both their management and PR skills makes matters worse, as these are the 'bosses' of the younger generation.<br><br>I count myself fortunate to have had the chance to interact with some ministers and officials. And, well, let's just say that there is quite a big difference among them.<br><br>I find it harder to relate to the more seasoned minsters. They seem set in their ways and not very open to new ideas.<br><br>On the other hand, the younger ministers I have met are willing to talk to you as a person, no hierarchy involved, much like the way modern CEOs interact with their staff. I can relate to them and I see passion in what they are doing.<br><br>This is not to say that the older ministers are not passionate, but they just don't seem to show it. This could be due to our culture, and their upbringing.<br><br>But had I never met any of them and merely read or heard what they said, I would have simply brushed it aside as propaganda.<br><br>Having said that, I think we should allow for some diversity and not just bring the scholars and the high-flying entrepreneurs into the scheme of things.<br><br>Get the 'average Joe' into the picture too. You just might be surprised at his point of view.<br><br>STEVEN CHIA OON SEET<br></div>
