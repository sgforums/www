            <div class='col-md body'>Will ONE casino be enough to attract the large scale investment that is needed to attract tourist? In time we will argue that we can support 2 and then 3. Soon it is the "Strip" we are talking about.<br><br>Our image of a safe and clean financial, electronics, bio-science and whatever hub will now include gambling. Soon we will boast of our economy brought by gambling. Imagine GDP growth of 9%because the gambling sector is booming as the cry of the day! 60,000 jobs created because of it!<br><br>But some say, casino is not all about gambling. It is also about high class attractions that will draw in the tourists. If one has been to Las Vegas, you will see that beyond the lights, smoke and sounds the illusions given by the casino kingpings are just that, an illusion. The city practically sleeps in the daytime. As without the camouflage of the lights, smoke and sounds, it appears that Vegas in nothing but a piece of desert with no soul.<br><br>OK so we cannot be so single-minded and just talk about social aspects of this proposal but consider the higher consideration of "are we mature enough to decide and handle" the issue. Question is what has to do with a Casino? I do not think my maturity and ability to handle such issues has any relations to Casino when I would rather spend time on School Pocket Money Fund, NKF charities, etc.<br><br>We should spend time to learn from places like Dubai which is able to turn a barren place into such a desired place to be! To be candid, most western civilisation are on their decline. Mirroring and aping their success is not the solution. We are at our creative bankrupt! We need new blood that can create new ideas and not re-hash old western concepts. Just because a casino is the easiest to create wealth, create jobs, etc does not mean it is the one and the better idea.<br><br>That was like 2 dollars worth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

Put some news is to get u mentally prepared. Who said anything about getting the citizens' agreement? U disagree oso no use.
