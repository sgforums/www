            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Medical body to issue MLM guidelines </strong></span><br>By Li Xueying<br><br>THE Singapore Medical Association (SMA) is introducing guidelines on multi-level marketing (MLM) in its advisory for doctor members.<br><br>Its stand is that recruiting patients as MLM members within clinic premises - whether during or outside consultations - is a definite no-no, association spokesman Tan Sze Wee told The Sunday Times.<br><br>The move comes after this paper reported last week that some doctors were asking their patients to buy MLM health products.<br><br>Two days ago, the Ministry of Health (MOH) also sent a circular to all 6,500 registered medical practitioners here, reminding them of the sacrosanct nature of the doctor-patient relationship, a ministry spokesman said yesterday.<br><br>The SMA's advisory, to be amended by year-end, will spell out guidelines on the promotion of such products.<br><br>Said Dr Tan: 'Doctors must disclose their financial interest to the patients, and ensure that the products are backed by scientific evidence.'<br><br>Currently, its advisory refers to only the sale of non-medicinal products in clinics. It does not touch specifically on the subject of health products sold via MLM, which is a form of direct selling that rewards members not only for their own sales but also those generated by members they recruit.<br><br>The association is a voluntary professional body comprising 68 per cent of all doctors in Singapore, and does not have legal teeth to enforce its regulations.<br><br>However, Dr Tan said doctors who do not toe the line will have to be prepared to 'justify' their actions to their peers in the Singapore Medical Council.<br><br>The association can and does refer cases to the council, an MOH statutory board that governs the professional conduct of Singapore's doctors.<br><br>The council told The Sunday Times last week that doctors may promote vitamins, tonics, health and nutritional supplements that are supported by 'good-quality scientific evidence'. But they must disclose their interest to the patient before making a referral.<br><br>Its spokesman added that 'doctors should not participate in the promotion of MLM per se, meaning the recruiting of people into the MLM structure'.<br><br>Last week, the MOH said in a letter to the Forum page that it had referred some doctors mentioned in The Sunday Times article to the council for investigation.<br><br>Speaking yesterday at a charity function, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan noted that MLM is not illegal in Singapore, and added that 'it's very hard to codify what is right and what is wrong'.<br><br>He said: 'The same action may be ethical in one circumstance, but unethical in another.<br></div>
