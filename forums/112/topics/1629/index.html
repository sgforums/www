            <div class='col-md body'>From:  MSAPRILIA  Jan-26 9:42 pm<br>To:  ALL  (1 of 9)<br>755.1<br><br>I refer to the recent case of involvement in arguements between some bikers in IRC.<br>I have personally went thru this offended some bengsters and got so pissed off by some of these pple. Becos of my over promoting of 'go track then play, on the road dun play'. Being branded by some pple who dun even know me well enough as 'posers' 'haolian' etc.<br>Randy, I understand the kinda problems you went thru. But just to remind you that these pple dun deserve your countless helps. Just ignore them. I believe many other pple here also went thru this. At first I thot you were the one creating trouble using the 'revstar' as a shield. But after a while, I saw that those pple who were railing at you on the net were the real trouble makers. Thats why i spoke up for you.<br>Until now, I feel that Revstar have been a very good forum where bikers come here to buy/sell products, exchange pointers, introduce bike news, promote new products and also organising activities.<br><br>Basically what I can categorise different riders are pple who like to 'pit skills on the road' and 'pit skills on the track'.<br><br>Roads - meant for pple to use daily. Filled with innocent pedestrains, innocent road users who just want to go to work or school.<br>Therefore:<br>Those who pit skills on the road are senseless people who can't even think about the basic considerations of other road users. Can't wait to return their licence from where they got it from (TrafficPolice) Irresponsible posers (Can't wait to show how fast they were at anytime of the day anywhere. These are the real posers. But they won't admit) who don't even have a basic respect for the law. Brainless guts for some of them. Or some of them simply have no guts.<br><br>Track - built for pple to race or practice or just have a day's fun with automotives. No innocent road users; all are willing parties who've been briefed that motor racing is dangerous and no one is responsible for any mishaps except for the rider/driver himself/herself. More safer than road cos no need to care abt stop line, traffic lites, pedestrains etc.<br>Therefore:<br>Lesser tendencies to find posers on the track. More responsible and considerate. Smart to maintain their licence survivability. Respect for the Legal systems on road discipline. Gutsy brains. Shrewd brains (see how they plan their strategies to defend their positions or attack other tracksters on the track)!!<br><br>Therefore you see those 'road racers' how they behave and how they speak. Irrresponsible and dun care abt how others feel. They can say anything abt you, make up any kinda stories abt you and go around spreading. cos they dun bother abt how other bystanders are affected. All they want is to satisfy their selfish wants of bringing you down with senseless gutless words. They prefer to hide behind and flame you. Then ask you out to 'talk' when they've already prepared some 'ambush' for you. What you can do is to ignore such pple. If pple prefer to believe them then that person is not worth your friendship. Why bother abt these pple? these pple will have their retribution. 2 of them I know have lost their licences. I enjoy what you are here in Revstar, Randy, I respect all those who confine the wild fun on biking on the track even you ride a small scooter. Bcos these are the most worthy opponents you can ever find.)<br><br>Me got this from their so call revstar forum...Maybe it's time to do something abt these revstar ppl aready...<br><br>------------------<br>4Stokes rules the world.....Mess with best and die like the rest....................This is a computer generated letter,no signature is required.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I post this MSG here is to "REVSTAR" member who happen to see this msg. ESP ZEN..<br>we did not try to find trouble with Revstar as i know some of the Revstar's Member also. esp Zen who been veri nice to me.<br><br>well. this problem is started coz of NC_29 (Randy) so if u r ard see for urself..<br><br>u already leave us (arai) and join revstar. so stop complainning that we bo jio u out at all.<br><br>Ask urself lar.Hw many times me and alvin ask u out and u say u working. and u say after ur WORK u will CALL us?? but in the end u always nv.. and u went out with Revstar pple or others ... so STOP complaining we BO JIO U. Stop being an IDIOT and dunno wat is going on..<br><br>u urself choose this way. so after a few times we started to get tired of calling u out that why we stop. and we seldom see u online also. maybe u busy with ur "NEW" friend and forgotten abt us. And get this into ur Fxxking Brain... this is not the first time.. i myself already been through a few times coz of "New" friend u bo chap us liao. no point i have to keep remind u not to forget abt us. this thing keep on REPEAT and REPEAT&gt;. go back and ask ur fxxking brain is it TRUE. We are tired of u that why no point keep asking u out knowing that u got lot of funny excuse. so STOP UR COMPLAINS<br><br>and to MSAPRILIA or watever.. i dun give a damn. this got nothing to do with u and u juz DIAM LAR. dun kaypo too much. spent more time with ur FAMILY lar they need ur care than others!!!<br><br>and to explain to ZEN actually it happen when randy show this type of attidue to us already as i mention above and still KPKB that why we sian of him and that day he use REVSTAR as NICK to enter our channel to tok cock. we did ask him to reveal himself but he refuse that. He himself make a fool of the name "REVSTAR" and he make us find that revstar is juz a idiot coz he CAUSE everything. if he dun use the nick to enter and disturb us . all these will not happen...<br><br>Lastly to RANDY. Get this into ur head ok. stop KB n say tat wat no bro liao etc.. u choose to LEAVE us and join OTHERS than why KB. PUI look down on u. I know their side got more bikes and powerful bikes but if i will u and if i still got the Brothership i will not leave . and worst is join others. u wanna play track cant u join them as friends. need to leave us and be a member huh. and take them as idol and USE THEIR NICK than ur own nick?? use "revstar" as nick u will gain wat? SEOW BO.. wake up ur fucking idea lar. And ps: stop disturb DONNY abt the xs thing. got nothing to do with u at all. xs is decide not by him alone. get this clear.. it us (member of arai) to decide. since u seldom in and seldom take part. wat the use of leaving an IDIOT with high xs there? for who to see?? nobody know u...<br><br>we are already used without u ard. so it does not matter to us at ALL..... nobody will disagree with this for sure.<br><br>------------------<br>Wu Di Shi Ji Mo De<br><br>[This message has been edited by nsr_250 (edited 31 January 2002).]</div>
