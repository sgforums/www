            <div class='col-md body'>a few days ago a good fren of mine called me in the morning...asking me for my ex-gf's number...i was astounded as to why suddenly she asked me for her number...it didn't really bother me and i passed it off as she was just updating her contacts (she knows my ex as well)...a few moments later she called me again and i noticed she was sobbing...i asked why wat happened and she replied that she wasn't in a sound state and said she'd explain to me later...i went thru the rest of the day trying to figure out wat was wrong...<br><br>to be honest, previously her bf and my ex had been contacting each other via sms and she got wound of that when her bf left his phone on the table one day. she took a peek at his sent messages and realised they have been sending each other sms...frankly it was all platonic smses and nothing intimate was exchanged between the two, but it was rather the bf's behaviour that made her suspicious. so she confronted him and a heated argument ensued. it was finally resolved as a misunderstanding and that the 2 were purely platonic frens. and he made it a point to her that he won't msg her again.<br><br>so now back to the present, cos my fren had been on overseas business training trips recently and havent been free to contact us, as such with her bf. when she returned she realised he had been getting frequent sms and knowing her bf doesn't have a lot of sms previously began to grow suspicious. so one day she caught him off guard and realised....haiz...it's my ex and her bf smsing each other again.<br><br>when she told me all this i was so disappointed at both of them. one my ex (who is still my fren) and her bf is a good fren of mine as well. they jolly well know they shldn't be doing wat they were doing cos they know my fren cannot tolerate their "r'ship" be it platonic or not. although its perfectly fine for 2 frens to be keeping in touch for each other but...there are so many complications when its between a single and an attached...so when my fren called me and told me "sorry but i think ur ex is a SL*T..."....i couldn't blame her for her angst and hatred...cos i know how it feels...<br><br>i didn't know wat to think...i'm stuck in the middle...it queries my judgement of ppl...and i start to fathom whether who is right and wrong when i know no one's wrong and no one's right...haiz...<br>that day i whole day low productivity... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
