I'm from 93/10(Larry, do I know u?) Enjoyed my first three months in AJ. Still reminiscence about my time there. Especially the ODAC nite hike(cemetery walk), Carom competition, the orientation(had a great OG <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ), eating at AJ ice-stall and many other fond memories of the school. Was in the basketball team too. Still remember the orientation theme song Friends are friends forever. The friends that you made during ur AJ years is of the upmost importance. They may be the friends you grow old with so treasure each other will you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>Everyday is a special day, do something special b4 u end this day!!!</div>

They either listen to all those crappy chinese pop or freakish boy band songs. What the hell man...i wonder have they got any music sense.<br>Its so plain to see that most pop singers have got no talent in music. Whats worse is their xenophobic attitude towards loud music. Their ignorance make they think that loud bands are satanic and unwholesome.<br>Its real hard to find a single soul who shares the common interest. Not to say, most ajcians are lame indeed.<br>I think you are very right about aj 'intellectuals' are in fact only hardworking students. Seriously, they are not the sort of people who impress me.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like many of you peeps, I never had much fun in AJC....<br><br>coz firstly, i was fr Arts, and having a less than competent arts teaching staff, we were often scorned and treated like third class citizens...quite weird actually coz my class was split into 3 grps for chinese lessons and my grp had to take with a Bio class. The teacher was quite horrid and she blatantly humiliate the arts students..but u noe wod, i kinda respect her coz she had the guts to say that she didnt like arts students and she didnt think much of us.  In the end, when results came, the majority of the arts peeps got As and how did her pet class do? She was quite mad but she acknowledged she had to eat her words.<br><br>Secondly the council..i had half a foot in the council before i wormed out. Basically it's quite a loserish ECA. sorry to say that. But everybody noes that we have the tiniest council body in singapore(in my yr at least). So u cant really blame them when nothing is done coz each councillor is actually shouldering responsibilities which are meant for 3 pple. And all that the council teachers did were to whine, whine, and look reproachful.<br><br>I didnt really hate AJ though i did occasionally remind my frens that AJ sucks every few hrs when i was studying there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>I just didnt quite believe I was in it.  Looking back now, I can hardly remember that two years of my life. Sad person i am, but hey i cant help it.<br><br>So to those who still are whining away...keep whining, grin and bear with it. The 'A's will be over before the principal can twitch his ears.<br><br>Chill.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I feel AJ does not bring back fond memories for me. Btw, I was from the 91 batch. My first year there was really really terrible. Over-worked by tutorials, common tests, and exams. Second year was like ORD mood, so everything also bo-chap, until final exams which I gathered myself for the final sprint to the finish.<br><br>I agree this school no family spirit at all. Even though every year they invite alumnis back for Family Day or some other events, I dare to say 90% won't go back. And what AJ Ice ? WTF, it's still ice-kachang what! Nothing special!<br><br>And of coz I had to sign off mentioning our "dearest" TKS (think he left already lah, but nonetheless the most notorious guy during our era). ALL OF US knows about him and his wife(ex-student). It's a disgrace to the education service (Opps, I mean him). PE lessons always talk cock. Somemore, talk so long machiam he giving rally speeches. Think he more suitable running for opposition party esp during polling period.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have to say that the renovations done to the sch are weird... the repainted blocks beside the road look like army camps in that green color...<br>anyway... if aj so sucky, then go over nyp and relax... go throw bits of food at the koi in the ponds... sounds crazy but it's very fun... hehe...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm kinda new to this so bear with me...<br><br>I dunno if it was that bad in the past but now, I think things are getting better. At least I want to say that for the non-academic areas... Heh, for one, the SC is not the smallest amongst all the councils in SG. And I think that the council does try to come up with new things and all. In fact, they're even going to try out a DJ-ing thing in the morning! But like many people have said, the success of the council(or any other body trying to bring up the spirit), its more dependant on the support of the students. If everyone is just stuck with the mindset that AJ is a dead place...then sadly, that's how its going to be for a long time. Probably its just the first step that is most difficult to take. After that, hopefully things get better...</div>
