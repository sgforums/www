            <div class='col-md body'>hi! im also a senior, from class of 95 (we donated the benches near the pond..hee..)<br><br>me in NUS, graduating in half a year's time...NUS is fine, but i miss my days in AJC more.  U are rather much alone in NUS, and u dun get to see the same faces so often...u have to find r own clique or else u are pretty much alone.  I miss the days in AJ, when we have AJ carnival, sports day, swimming carnival, cross country..etc...yes, we may moan and grumble when we had to participate, but thinking back, i really miss those times...<br><br>Its true that there is really nothing great abt AJC, neither excelling in sports or studies, somewhere always stuck in the middle...but i thk wat i miss most abt my JC days were the friends...they really made a difference to my time in school. its diff now, in the Uni, where people go about doing their own stuff, not much of 'comrade-ship', we are all rather individualistic now, quite difficult to find a group of kakis to have fun after school or even during school time.<br><br>No matter how bad school was, my friends' presence always made school bearable   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The 2 years in AJC was gone so, so fast...its really up to each person to appreciate what u have now...i thk watever JC u go to, there is aways something sucky abt it...bt try to stop the grumbling and appreciate the moment now...it will be gone forever once u grad, and believe me...2 years is very very short a time...<br><br>So, those still studying in AJC...enjoy youselves..wish i was in ur shoes man... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup! I remember ODAC fondly. The nite hike and solo walk was a nice experience. Normally from Boon Lay I will take the MRT or Bus 852 to get to AJ. Takes around 2 1/2hr to n fro. This is one of the main reason I went to HCJC.<br><br>------------------<br>Everyday is a special day, do something special b4 u end this day!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ding (edited 09 January 2001).]</div>
