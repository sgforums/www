              <p>New Zealand Highlights Geothermal Leadership at World Geothermal Congress 2010</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2010-04-26 11:20</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    BALI, Indonesia, April 26 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- New Zealand showcases its geothermal leadership at the World Geothermal Congress (WGC) 2010 which opens today at the Bali International Convention Centre. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    The New Zealand Geothermal Association (NZGA) and a large delegation of scientists, engineers, consultants and investors, and major companies will be demonstrating a full spectrum of professional services and expertise in geothermal development with the support of the New Zealand Government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Participating exhibitors include Auckland University and the Institute of Earth Science &amp; Engineering (booth GC14), the New Zealand Engineering (booth GC7) including Maskell Production Ltd, Allied Industrial Engineering, Robt Stone and Parsons Brinckerhoff Power, New Zealand's Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences /GNS Science (booth HC9), PT AECOM Indonesia (booth HC8), Sinclair Knight Merz (booth HC6) and Tiger Energy (booth HB4).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "The significant presence at WGC 2010 globally reinforces New Zealand's solid track record in this industry and gives us the opportunity to forge deeper partnerships with other leading geothermal markets in Asia Pacific such as Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines. It is also a fitting launch pad for our joint hosting with Australia of the World Geothermal Congress in 2015," said Alan Koziarski, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise's Regional Director for South and South East Asia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Blessed with rich geothermal fields, New Zealand is a pioneer in developing large-scale geothermal electricity generation as early as the 1950s.  Today, it combines experience with cutting-edge geosciences research and innovation to harness the potential of geothermal to deliver cost-competitive, sustainable energy not just in New Zealand but across the region.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "The geothermal industry is the place to be, with a lot of development over the last few years and much more to come in the near term.  Geothermal energy is now getting the profile it deserves as a reliable, clean and renewable form of energy. It is independent of weather and can deliver energy at some of the most competitive unit rates of any energy option for heat or electricity generation," said Spence McClintock, President of the New Zealand Geothermal Association. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Geothermal energy provides approximately 0.4% of the world global power generation. As of 2008, global installed capacity of geothermal energy for power generation was more than10GW. The International Geothermal Association has predicted this to reach 11 GW by 2010, and dramatically grow in the next few years as the world shifts to cleaner fuel. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    In New Zealand, geothermal energy is currently the second-most used renewable fuel for electricity generation, after hydro, currently generating around 14% of all New Zealand electricity. And with government's aim to generate 90 percent of its electricity requirements from renewable sources by 2025, research, exploration and infrastructure investments into geothermal energy development in New Zealand are expected to further escalate. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    New Zealand already has one of the fastest growing rates of geothermal development in the world, recently jumping from No.8 to No.5 in ranking. "We have seen a steep upward growth for geothermal power generation domestically, proving the commercial viability of this clean energy resource to fuel our industries and homes," McClintock added.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Overseas, New Zealand companies are consulting for and supplying to various partners in countries such as Indonesia, Philippines, Australia, Papua New Guinea and a range of countries through the western Pacific and Asia in particular, but with interests spreading through Chile and other parts of South America, as well as east African Rift countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    In Indonesia, New Zealand built the Kamojang 1 Project, the first geothermal power station in the country.  It funded and provided technical engineering support for the facility which opened in 1982.  Companies like PB, PT AECOM, and SKM remain heavily involved in active geothermal projects including Kamojang, Darajat, Dieng, Gunung Salak, Wayang Windu, Lahendong and Ulumbu.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    New Zealand continues to be one of the few countries to offer broad geothermal post-graduate training, as it has done for the last 30 years.  Many of the leading national engineers and scientists in Indonesia or the Philippines have had training in New Zealand, and the relationships formed are valued by all those involved.</p>
