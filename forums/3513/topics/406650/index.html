              <p>Beijing Capital Airport Marks Second Anniversary of Terminal 3 with New Hilton Property Serving Key Business and Industrial Center</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BEIJING, and MCLEAN, Va., July 29 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Hilton Hotels, the brand that invented the airport hotel concept, again sets a new standard with the opening of the first-ever luxury airport hotel in China. The grand opening of Hilton Beijing Capital Airport hotel and conference facility today highlights the two-year anniversary of Beijing Capital Airport’s Terminal 3 and continues to expand the services connected to the world’s second busiest passenger airport.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Opening China’s first luxury international airport hotel generations after our founder pioneered the airport hotel concept is more than a noteworthy milestone. Hilton Beijing Capital Airport reflects the innovation, refreshing hospitality and contemporary relevance that enable us to deliver an exceptional experience for our guests and set Hilton as a leader in the eyes of today’s savvy global travelers,” said Dave Horton, Global Head, Hilton Hotels brand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beijing Capital Airport is the nerve center for international travelers in China as well as burgeoning business and industrial community that rings the airport. The airport has an average of 1,400 domestic and international flights daily and serviced more than 65 million travelers last year. The local business community surrounding the airport features a growing and vibrant mix of Chinese and multinational companies, which use Beijing for their global or regional headquarters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hilton Beijing Capital Airport, located right at Terminal 3, features more than 320 guest rooms, seven restaurants and bars with 32 private dining rooms, two ballrooms and 21 meeting rooms with more than 3,000 square meters of meeting space, executive concierge services, a luxury spa and state-of-the-art fitness center. The facility is 72,000 square-meters in size and built on more than 28,000 square meters of space that provides ample room for on-site event parking as well as pleasant gardens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“The Beijing Capital Airport Authority has invested tremendous resources in new facilities and transportation infrastructure to make Terminal 3 a world-class service center for business and leisure travelers into and around China. With Hilton Hotels as our newest partner we are adding to the mix; international standards for meetings and conference facilities, top class restaurants and spacious rooms with a service brand that is well known and trusted around the world,” said Gang Wu, the General Manager of owning company, Beijing Capital Airport Tourism Co., Ltd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the concept of a luxury international airport hotel is new to China, such properties have been a standing part of the Hilton portfolio, with several new projects in development. In 2010, Hilton plans to open Hilton Rosemont/O’Hare, in the United States near Chicago O’Hare International Airport, while a new build Hilton property featuring a stylish horizontal skyscraper design at Frankfurt International Airport is scheduled to open in 2011.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Hilton Beijing Capital Airport is a dynamic property that will become a top gateway to China, with international travelers staying overnight after long-haul flights before connecting to their final destinations. The hotel will host leisure guests and business travelers from top companies that want the convenience of Terminal 3 and Hilton standards for events, business, dining and guest services. Hilton continues rapid growth across Asia and this hotel brings a new dimension to our growing portfolio in Beijing, which already includes the world’s top lifestyle hotel and another of the city’s top metropolitan hotels,” said Martin Rinck, Area President – Asia Pacific, Hilton Worldwide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition to balancing the needs of both international travelers and meeting planners, designing this unique hotel required striking a balance of international and Asian influences. The restaurant mix, for example, includes a wide range of offerings that run from fine Cantonese, served in all private dining rooms for the local business community, to prime aged steaks, to 24-hour convenient service for late-night travelers. Each location within the new Hilton has a unique profile with menus created by chefs specializing in that specific cuisine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meeting facilities were designed to balance the needs of different types of functions, as each ballroom has a private entrance, check-in and networking or entertaining areas.  The meeting rooms, which are directly connected to the ballrooms to make for easy and convenient breakout sessions, include a mix of conference table and seating styles that are popular with both Asian and Western executive meetings. All meeting room areas are equipped with state-of-the-art technology.</p>
