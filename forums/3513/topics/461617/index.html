              SINGAPORE, Nov. 16, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- TripAdvisor( http://www.tripadvisor.com )(TM), the world's largest travel site*, today announced a new app that gives hospitality business owners a quick and easy way to enhance their Facebook Pages with reviews, awards and other TripAdvisor content.

              The TripAdvisor App for Facebook, which is available immediately, is designed to help businesses attract more guests with traveller feedback and is an expansion of the popular TripAdvisor widgets. 
              
              Using the new app, owners can create a TripAdvisor tab for their business's Facebook Page with the option to display their TripAdvisor ratings, recent reviews, awards, photos and ranking on the site. The tab also encourages fans to read and write more reviews about the establishment on TripAdvisor. 
              
              "The TripAdvisor App for Facebook helps businesses showcase their reviews and accolades in front of Facebook's massive community of one billion monthly active users (Note 1)," said Christine Petersen, president, TripAdvisor for Business. "According to a recent PhoCusWright study commissioned by TripAdvisor (Note 2), 87 percent of users agree that TripAdvisor hotel reviews help them feel more confident in their booking decisions. When traveller feedback matters this much, it is important for brands to make traveller reviews and opinions as accessible to their fans as possible to encourage more bookings." 
              
              To install the TripAdvisor app, hotel, restaurant and attraction owners may visit the TripAdvisor Widget Centre, enter their property name, follow the prompts and select the TripAdvisor App for Facebook - www.tripadvisor.com/widgets. 
              
              The TripAdvisor App for Facebook is available in a wide range of languages, including English, Bahasa Indonesia, Japanese, Korean and Thai.
