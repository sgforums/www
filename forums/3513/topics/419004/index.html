These positive attributes have allowed us to grow steadily and profitably over time and become the global leader in technology distribution. <br><br>"We sincerely thank each of our talented employees who make our company so great, our innovative customers and technology suppliers who have placed their trust in us to accelerate their success, our shareholders who invest in us, as well as our business and community partners who join with us to help make the world a better place to live and work. <br><br>"We are proud of this milestone and our accomplishments thus far, and look forward with excitement to building on our leadership position to achieve far more in the next 50 years than anyone can possibly imagine today," he concluded. <br><br>Award-winning film and Broadway producer Jon Avnet, grandson of Avnet founder Charles Avnet, added: "Almost 50 years ago, a prominent New York paper scoffed when my father Lester Avnet, said, 'We, Avnet Inc., are going to the top, to 100 million in sales, maybe even a billion.' Roy Vallee and his talented executive team have taken Avnet, Inc. to almost 20 billion dollars in sales, fifty years later. Congratulations to all who have made this possible." <br><br>At the time the company was initially listed on the NYSE, Avnet's market capitalization was US$37 million and today Avnet's market capitalization is approx.
