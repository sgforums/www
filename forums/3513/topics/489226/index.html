              <div id="dvContent" style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 23.7999992370605px; font-size: 14px;">
              <p style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 0.825em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">AURORA, Ontario</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <strong style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">Magna International Inc. (TSX: MG, NYSE: MGA)</strong> today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire the Getrag Group of Companies ("Getrag"), one of the world's largest suppliers of automotive transmissions.</p>
              <p style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 0.825em;">Getrag has an 80-year history in transmissions and is a technology leader, offering a range of transmission systems which include manual, automated-manual, dual-clutch, hybrid and other advanced systems. We believe the architecture of Getrag's product line is well-positioned to support current and future automotive powertrain configurations. In particular, Getrag is a leader in the growing market for dual-clutch transmissions ("DCTs"), which is expected to be one of the highest growth segments globally over the next decade.</p>
              <p style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 0.825em;">In addition to its wholly-owned operations, Getrag has significant joint-venture relationships with Ford, as well as Chinese auto makers Jiangling and Dongfeng. Other Getrag customers include BMW, Daimler, Renault, Volvo and Great Wall. Including joint-venture locations, Getrag has approximately 13,500 employees and operates 13 manufacturing and 10 engineering centres in nine countries in <span class="xn-location" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">Europe</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">Asia</span> and <span class="xn-location" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">North America</span>. Getrag's 2014 consolidated sales were approximately €1.7 billion, which excludes approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">EUR1.6 billion</span> in sales generated in its non-consolidated joint-ventures.</p>
              <p style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 0.825em;"><span class="xn-person" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">Don Walker</span>, Magna's Chief Executive Officer, commented: "As part of our ongoing product portfolio review, we have identified the expansion of our powertrain business as a strategic priority. Getrag is an excellent fit with this strategy. Getrag is a technology leader in a product area that we believe is <br style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">well-positioned to benefit from industry trends that are driving increased vehicle fuel-efficiency and reduced emissions. Getrag's joint venture relationships also provide significant growth potential in <span class="xn-location" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">China</span>, the world's largest automotive market and the fastest growing market for DCTs. Lastly, Getrag has a highly capable and experienced workforce, including deep powertrain engineering expertise."</p>
              <p style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 0.825em;">The purchase price for 100% of the equity of Getrag is approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">EUR1.75 billion</span>. This represents an enterprise value of approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">EUR2.45 billion</span> less proportionate net debt and proportionate pension liabilities, which together are estimated to be approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">EUR700 million</span> at closing. The purchase price is subject to working capital and other customary purchase price adjustments.</p>
              <p style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 0.825em;">The transaction is expected to close near the end of 2015, subject to a number of conditions including obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals.</p>
              <p style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 0.825em;"><strong style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">We will hold a conference call for interested analysts and shareholders to review the acquisition on<span class="xn-chron" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">Thursday, July 16, 2015</span> at <span class="xn-chron" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.7;">8:30 a.m. EDT</span>.
