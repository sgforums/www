              <p>HONG KONG, March. 3, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- (ISC)2( <a href="https://www.isc2.org/">https://www.isc2.org</a> )(R) 
              ("ISC-squared"), the world's largest information security professional body and 
              administrators of the CISSP( <a href="https://www.isc2.org/cissp/default.aspx">https://www.isc2.org/cissp/default.aspx</a> )(R), announced the 
              opening of nominations for its fifth annual Asia-Pacific Information Security 
              Leadership Achievements (ISLA( <a href="http://www.isc2.org/isla">http://www.isc2.org/isla</a> )) Program. Since its inception, ISLA 
              has recognized over 80 outstanding information security leaders in over 10 
              Asia-Pacific economies. To nominate a deserving executive or information 
              security professional, please visit www.isc2.org/isla. <br><br>The ISLA Program, 
              begun in 2007 as part of (ISC)2's Global Awards Program, recognizes the ongoing 
              commitment by information security leaders in Asia-Pacific to build a highly 
              qualified and ethical information security workforce. ISLA recognition is 
              independent of professional certification, and nominations are accepted in three 
              distinct categories: <br><br>-- Senior Information Security Professional 
              (examples include: <br>Chief Security Officer, Chief Information Security 
              Officer, <br>IT Security Manager or Senior Security Manager with significant 
              <br>IT security management responsibilities) who has significantly 
              <br>contributed to the enhancement of the IT security workforce by 
              <br>demonstrating a leadership role in any IT security workforce <br>improvement 
              initiative, program or project. Candidates in this <br>category should have at 
              least ten years of work experience, <br>seven of which are directly related to 
              IT security. <br><br>-- Managerial Professional for an Information Security 
              Project <br>(non-information security management or executive, examples 
              <br>include: Chief Information Officer, Chief Financial Officer, 
              <br>Program/Project Manager, etc.) who has significantly contributed <br>to the 
              enhancement of the IT security workforce by demonstrating <br>a leadership role 
              in any IT security workforce improvement <br>initiative, program or project 
              within the last 12 months. <br>Candidates in this category should have at least 
              ten years of <br>work experience and occupy a senior-level position within their 
              <br>organization. <br><br>-- Information Security Practitioner who has 
              distinguished <br>him/herself for implementing and/or managing the

              <br>managing a security awareness and training program, conducting 
              <br>difficult, complex security evaluations, etc.). Candidates in <br>this 
              category should have at least six years of work experience, <br>three of which 
              should be directly related to IT security. <br><br>In 2010, (ISC)2 added a

              Nomination Review Committee (NRC), comprised of members from the (ISC)2 Asian 
              Advisory Board (AAB), will review and select honorees from the three categories 
              based upon selection criteria and eligibility requirements. For a list of NRC
