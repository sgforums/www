              <p>Tony Blair to head an all star speaker line-up at the 2010 National Achievers Congress in Malaysia &amp; Singapore in April</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    SINGAPORE, Jan. 11 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Tony Blair, Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1997-2007, will travel to Malaysia &amp; Singapore in April 2010 to head-up an impressive global speaker line-up at the 2010 National Achievers Congress. Now in its 18th year, the Congress is a platform for learning and development that over the years has presented former US President Bill Clinton, Robert Kiyosaki, Michael Porter and many others to thousands of Malaysians and Singaporeans. The Congress, which takes place in Kuala Lumpur and then in Singapore several days later, generally attracts 6000-7000 delegates who spend three days learning from, and being inspired by, some of the world's greatest leaders and entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>    Tony Blair will first speak at the National Achievers Congress in Kuala Lumpur (23-25th April) and then travel south for the Singapore National Achievers Congress (27-29th April). He no doubt has fond memories of Singapore - being the country that he travelled to in July 2005, to hear the news that London had been selected by the International Olympic Committee to be the host of the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
              <p>    Blair will be taking time away from his current role in the Middle East, where he is working for the USA, UN, Russia and EU as the Quartet Representative, helping the Palestinians to prepare for statehood as part of the international community's effort to secure peace.</p>
              <p>    Tony Blair served as Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from May 1997 to June 2007. He was also the leader of Britain's Labour Party from 1994 to 2007. He continues to be active in public life, with many interests. He launched the Tony Blair Faith Foundation to promote respect and understanding of and between the major religions and to make the case for faith as a force for good in the modern world. The foundation works with Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jews, and Hindus. Blair believes that faith will have great influence in how the challenges that globalisation presents will be met. Part of the Foundation's role is to mobilise faith communities to work together in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals to tackle global poverty and conflict.</p>
              <p>    Blair is also a keen supporter of issues around Africa and climate change. He is a member of the Africa Progress Panel and eighteen months ago launched the 'Breaking the Climate Deadlock Initiative' through which he is working with world leaders to set the world on a new path to a low carbon future.</p>
              <p>    Richard Tan, Chief Executive Officer, Success Resources, is responsible for bringing Tony Blair to Malaysia and Singapore "Tony Blair is respected as a great leader, a great visionary and a man with significant purpose in his life. During his ten years as Prime Minister, he transformed Britain's public services through a programme of investment and reform in schools and hospitals, resulting in more children achieving better school results and more people receiving faster access to health care, with improved survival rates for cancer and coronary heart disease. His achievements are outstanding and we know that what he has to say at the National Achievers Congress will be of significant interest to thousands of Malaysians and Singaporeans".</p>
