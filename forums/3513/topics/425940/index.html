              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The acquisition will allow Meinhardt to consolidate its presence in India and reinforce its lead as a multidisciplinary firm with a full suite of high-end, cutting-edge design solutions such as Building Information Modelling (BIM). Eigen complements Meinhardt with its wide range of capabilities that serve multiple sectors, including healthcare, aviation and rail, across various geographies including Australia, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, the United States and India.

Eigen will become part of the Meinhardt group of companies and will retain its existing brand and current team of designers in New Delhi and Mumbai.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"India has always been a key market for Meinhardt. With the acquisition of Eigen, a company that has developed a sound reputation and excellent credentials serving top-notch clients, we will be better able to leverage our set-up in India to service both local and international clients," said Dr. S. Nasim, Meinhardt's Global Chief Executive Officer.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Mr. Rajesh Srivastava, Meinhardt's India country director, will be responsible for the integration of Eigen with Meinhardt's India operations. "With Eigen on board, Meinhardt has cemented its position as India's leading integrated engineering company, with an unmatched delivery platform to serve our clients across India and globally," said Mr. Srivastava.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Commenting on the announcement, Mr Bernard Dempsey, Deputy Chairman of Laing O'Rourke said: "We believe that under Meinhardt, Eigen will be able to enhance its standing as a leading technical services provider. The deal will enable Laing O'Rourke to focus its resources and commitment exclusively on providing engineering solutions to our clients in key markets."</p>
