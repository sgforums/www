              MUNICH and ABU DHABI, UAE, Feb. 19, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --
              Contactless payments via Near Field Communication (NFC) technology
              Smartphones used as payment terminals for credit card acceptance
              Etisalat, the largest tele-communications operator in the Middle East and Africa, and Wirecard, a global leader in payment innovations, will present a range of mobile payment solutions at the Mobile Word Congress 2013 in Barcelona.
              One solution to be shown at the event is a fast and efficient method of making payments that utilises Wirecard`s Payment Processing platform and a Near Field Communication (NFC) interface to make contactless payments via Smartphone, leveraging MasterCardÂ®PayPassâ„¢ technology.
              In another solution, Etisalat enables its customers to accept credit card payments with mobile card readers that plug directly into mobile phones.
              Etisalat is a multinational telecommunications organization with operations in fifteen countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, including some markets with a low penetration of credit card terminals, such as Nigeria, Egypt and Afghanistan.
              "We are proud to join Etisalat in presenting the future of mobile payments at the Mobile World Congress," said Christian von Hammel-Bonten, Executive Vice President of telecommunications at Wirecard. "The next years will be a transformative period in the payments industry with mobile operators emerging as major forces in the payments space."
              Khalifa Alforah, Chief Digital Service Officer at the Etisalat Group said: "Etisalat is committed to harnessing the power of mobile connectivity through innovation to develop services that change people's lives for the better. Etisalat's commitment solutions that enable people, businesses and governments to take charge of their future will, in turn, lead to accelerated social and economic development."
              In the near future all, NFC-enabled smartphones sold by Etisalat will come with a NFC-enabled SIM card. Existing customers will be able to update their cards in stores. Etisalat is aiming to extend its future mobile wallet service beyond payments to include couponing and loyalty solutions.
