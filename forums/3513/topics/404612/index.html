              <p>Cable&amp;Wireless Worldwide is Positioned as a "Challenger" in Magic Quadrant for Asia Pacific Network Service Providers</p>
              <p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>    SINGAPORE, July 7 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Cable&amp;Wireless Worldwide today announced that it is positioned as "Challenger" in Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for Asia Pacific Network Service Providers for the year 2010 published on June 28. The evaluation is based on Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "When selecting a provider, network managers need to pay attention to its Ability to Execute. The large size of the Asia Pacific region and its fragmented geography makes it more challenging to deliver consistently high-quality network services here than in other regions," said Gartner. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Nick Lambert, Managing Director, Global Markets, Cable&amp;Wireless Worldwide said: "We are very proud that Gartner has positioned us in the Challenger position in the Magic Quadrant. We consider this as an endorsement of our focused approach in Asia and excellence in execution. We continue to move from strength to strength in our service excellence and delivering high levels of customer satisfaction, as well as in our improved product/solutions offering and price competitiveness." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "We are particularly pleased to be recognised for our flexible approach towards meeting non-standard requirements for our customers. As a nimble and flexible organisation, our DNA enables us to scale service and support, as well as our solutions offer to customer needs, with good response times," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    The research house gives high marks to providers that exceed competitors on Service Quality based on high network reliability and performance, good service and support and strong service level commitments, local service and support in development and remote markets -- especially China and India.</p>
