              <p> </p>
              <p>2010-04-09 19:29</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    PARSIPPANY, N.J., April 9 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Following the recent addition of three luxury hotels in the key markets of Shanghai, Changsha and Hangzhou, Wyndham Hotel Group, part of the Wyndham Worldwide family of companies (NYSE: WYN), today announced its continued expansion in China with agreements to open four additional new luxury Wyndham(R) hotels in the cities of Chengdu, Suzhou, Shanghai and Kunming.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Soon to join the brand's prestigious Wyndham Grand Collection are the 420-room Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale Palace Chengdu, the 311-room Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale Jingsi Garden Suzhou and the 374-room Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale Colorful Kunming. Also joining the brand is the 321-room Wyndham Shanghai Bund East. All four hotels, which are currently under construction, will be managed by Greater China Hospitality (H.K.) Limited. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "We are delighted to continue our long time relationship with veteran hotelier Wilburt Chang and especially proud to welcome several outstanding properties to the Wyndham Grand Collection, our most distinguished ensemble of hotels," said Eric Danziger, Wyndham Hotel Group president and chief executive officer. "The addition of these hotels strengthens our position as the largest U.S.-based hotel company in China."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Wyndham Hotel Group's 207 hotels in China represent 33,336 rooms in primary and secondary cities under the Wyndham, Ramada(R), Howard Johnson(R), Days Inn(R) and Super 8(R) brands. The Wyndham brand debuted in China in 2009 with the opening of the 588-room Wyndham Xiamen.  The 337-room Wyndham Baolian Hotel is scheduled to open next year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "Our hotels and the Wyndham Grand Collection are setting new expectations for luxury accommodations in China," said Wilburt Chang, chairman and chief executive officer of Greater China Hospitality (H.K.) Limited. "It is exciting to be at the leading edge of our country's lodging industry at a time of incredible growth in our national economy."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    The 420-room Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale Palace Chengdu, now under construction in Sichuan Province, will feature 12 meeting rooms to accommodate groups up to 800 including a 430 square-meter multiple-function hall and 880 square-meter banquet hall, business center, three restaurants, six private dining rooms, cigar and wine bar, executive club lounge and lobby lounge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Designed to be the only five-star hotel in Western Chengdu, the hotel will offer free Internet access, parking and guest rooms 36 square meters and larger, all equipped with 42-inch, flat-panel televisions. The hotel is scheduled to open in late spring this year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    The 311-room Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale Jingsi Garden Suzhou will specialize in meetings, incentive, conventions and exhibitions with 1,300 square meters of function space including 14 VIP rooms and a 1,100 square-meter banquet room.  Hotel facilities will include three restaurants, lobby bar and business center.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    The 374-room Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale Colorful Kunming, commanding a view of the entire southern part of Kunming, will feature two restaurants, VIP dining rooms, lobby bar, business center and meeting rooms including a ballroom.  A key asset will be its proximity to Kunming's airport, just 7 kilometers away, and city center, just a 5-kilometer drive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    The 321-room Wyndham Shanghai Bund East, in the city's South Bund neighborhood, will feature two restaurants, seven VIP dining rooms, lobby bar, business center, and 10 meeting rooms including an 870 square-meter banquet hall and 440 square-meter divisible multifunction room.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Guests of the new hotels will be able to take advantage of the brand's guest recognition program when they join Wyndham ByRequest(R) which offers complimentary benefits including high-speed Internet access and choice of favorite welcome snack and beverage. Members also earn Wyndham Rewards(R) points, which can be redeemed for complimentary hotel stays, airline tickets, name-brand merchandise and dining and shopping gift cards, among other options.
