            <div class='col-md body'><p>Independent Study Commissioned by Digital Realty Focuses on Data Centre Trends in Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong <br><br>SINGAPORE, March 5, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: DLR), a leading global data centre solution provider, has released the results of a study of Asia Pacific data centre trends based on a detailed survey of senior decision makers at large corporations in Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong who are responsible for shaping their companies' data centre strategies. The research was conducted for Digital Realty by the research firm Campos Research &amp; Analysis. <br><br>Highlights of the survey results: <br><br>-- 76 percent of respondents will definitely or <br>probably expand their data centre infrastructure <br>in 2012. <br>-- 17 percent of respondents report no plans for data <br>centre projects in 2012 or 2013. <br>-- 48 percent of respondents considering new data <br>centre projects would expand in more than one <br>location. <br>-- 64 percent of respondents also reported having <br>built a new data centre in the previous 24 months. <br><br>"The results of this independent study verify the strong demand for data centre space that we are seeing in our Asia Pacific markets," said Kris Kumar, Regional Head, Asia Pacific at Digital Realty. "We believe this growth is primarily being driven by global enterprises seeking to establish or expand their technical operations in the Asia Pacific region, as well as by companies based in the region with expanding computing requirements to support their rapid growth. While not yet in Hong Kong, our assets in Singapore, Sydney and Melbourne are well-positioned to capture a significant portion of this demand expected in the coming 24 months." <br><br>-- Of those participants with plans to expand their <br>data centres: 82 percent plan to use a partner <br>(wholesale data centre provider or design/build <br>partner) for their data centre project. <br>-- 22 percent plan to use a Do-It-Yourself approach <br>for their data centre project. <br>-- 14 percent plan to use a containerized solution <br>as part of their data centre project. <br>-- The locations mentioned most often for upcoming <br>data centre projects are Hong Kong, Singapore, <br>Tokyo and Sydney. <br><br>Digital Realty has also published the results of similar studies of the North American and European data centre markets. For information about those studies, please visit www.digitalrealty.com. <br><br>About the Methodology <br><br>Results of this study are based on surveys of more than 300 IT decision makers at large corporations in Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong with annual revenues of at least US$500 million and/or at least 500 employees. All survey participants are directly involved in the process of managing, executing contracts for, implementing or expanding data centres. Data centre internal customers also participated. All participants were senior level executives and management, including CxOs, in IT, MIS, IS or Finance. The survey was conducted in January 2012. <br><br>About Campos Research &amp; Analysis <br><br>Campos Research &amp; Analysis conducts consumer research and business-to-business research, using qualitative and quantitative methodologies, to address the business issues of client companies.
