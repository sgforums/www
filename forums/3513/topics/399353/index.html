              <p>Expansion Continues on Macau's Cotai Strip, Driving Gaming Trends Across Asia</p>
              <p>    HONG KONG, May 12 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Held in Asia's gaming capital -- Macau -- where industry expansion is roaring ahead, Global Gaming Expo Asia (G2E Asia) puts exhibitors at the center of global gaming growth with leading edge products on its show floor, top-notch conference programs, and an unrivaled assembly of industry leaders. G2E Asia 2010 takes place June 8-10 at the Cotai Strip(R) CotaiExpo(TM) at the Venetian Macao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    G2E Asia 2010 features a full-day Global Markets Forum designed to provide a comprehensive look at the issues and opportunities in current and emerging markets throughout the pan-Asian region, from India and Vietnam to Singapore and Japan, with a keynote address from Mr. Francis Lui, deputy chairman of Galaxy Entertainment Group. Other highlights include the G2E Asia Visionary Award presentation to pioneering gaming machine innovator Len Ainsworth, the Slot Operators Roundtable and Networking Reception, the iGaming Pavilion on the show floor, and a Game Protection Seminar tailored to keep industry professionals ahead of cheats. These unique events are focused on helping gaming professionals find the business and professional development opportunities they need to succeed in the global gaming marketplace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "While many areas around the world continue to feel the impact of economic uncertainty, the center of gaming industry growth has shifted decisively to Asia. Gaming in Asia is back on pace for record growth in terms of revenue and expansion, with Macau leading the charge and setting the pace that other jurisdictions are striving to match," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr., president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. "G2E Asia brings the gaming industry together in this exciting and important destination, enabling manufacturers, service providers and other vendors to meet key decision makers in an atmosphere made for success, at a moment when business opportunities are abundant."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Following record gaming receipts in 2009, Macau's explosive growth has continued, and to help meet soaring demand, construction is going ahead at full speed on new projects in Cotai. Directly adjacent to the Venetian Macao, the home of G2E Asia, new casino hotels are being built on the Cotai Strip, and with these projects due to open next year, G2E Asia is the ideal time and place to present products to the developers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Projects beyond Macau in established and emerging destinations also are fueling Asia's gaming boom. Major resort developments are underway in the Philippines and Vietnam, while two of the world's largest casino resorts opened their doors earlier this year in Singapore. Events over the past year have a positive impact on the gaming outlook in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, Japan and Taiwan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Information and insights gained from the industry's best and brightest at G2E Asia can help gaming professionals identify the issues and trends that are gaining momentum and likely to impact the gaming business in Asia and beyond. Attendees of G2E Asia will be exposed to cutting edge developments and equipped to face new challenges and opportunities as the industry moves ahead.</p>
