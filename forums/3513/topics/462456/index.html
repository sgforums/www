              Investor Central(R) "Dog or Darling" reports win in Asian Publishing Awards
              
              Hard-hitting review of prospectuses of companies going for stock market listing wins
              
              Best Example of Content Leadership Award
              
              Follows recent win in the Financial Journalist of the Year Awards
              
              SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 3, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Investor Central(R), the news service for retail investors in Singapore and Malaysia which dares to ask the questions that need to be asked(TM), is proud to announce that its ongoing series of reports on IPOs has won the Asian Publishing Award for Best Example of Content Leadership in Kuala Lumpur tonight.
              
              Mark Laudi, Executive Editor of Investor Central(R), said "Investor Central prides itself on asking the questions that need to be asked.
              
              "All companies going for IPO must publish a prospectus, but these are complicated documents running over hundreds of pages, filled with legal language and accounting jargon.
              
              "This means they are inaccessible to most retail investors.
              
              "In our 'Dog or Darling' reports, Investor Central's specialist reporters go through each prospectus meticulously, to reveal the 'skeletons in the closet'.
              
              "Tens of billions of US Dollars are raised each year from the investing public in Singapore and Malaysia, so investors must be aware of the downsides before they commit their money."
              
              Financial Journalist of the Year Award
              
              The Asian Publishing Award win follows another recent success at the annual Financial Journalist of the Year Awards in Singapore.
              
              Stock Market Reporter/Editor Ashish Saxena was bestowed the Merit Award as Promising Young Journalist by the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) on October 3.
              
              The Association noted in its citation, at the 13th annual Investors' Choice Dinner at the Raffles City Convention Centre, Singapore: "Ashish is always ready to look beyond the press release to explore hidden motivations and agendas. He has an excellent understanding of financial statements and frequently points out inconsistencies for readers. Ashish also nails issues with unflinching candour and drills for answers."
              
              "We are thrilled that Ashish has been recognised for his outstanding work, and this award is a strong endorsement of our approach to reporting company disclosures in Singapore and Malaysia," Laudi said.
              
              "News organisations tend to report faithfully what companies disclose. We take this a step further by questioning the assumptions behind these disclosures.
              
              "Even if the stock exchange's continuous disclosure obligations have been met, investors frequently require more information to make an informed investing decision. That's what our questions are designed to attain.
              
              "All companies we cover are offered the opportunity to respond, before the report is published," Laudi concluded.
