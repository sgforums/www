              </span></p><p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SHANGHAI, Sept. 14, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- ECO LIFESTYLES 2011 is already described as the "largest and most comprehensive eco exhibition in China".</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">To be held at the Shanghai World Expo Theme Pavilion from 15 to 17 September 2011, the event will bring together eco-friendly companies and LOHAS brands. It also aims to grow China’s LOHAS (Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability) market, by educating consumers on the benefits of eco-friendly and green products, as well as encouraging green and eco-friendly lifestyles.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">ECO LIFESTYLES 2011 will showcase Eco/LOHAS products, including Food, Design, Home, Fashion, Health, Beauty and Transportation. It will be a full three day event, inspiring healthy ecological lifestyles for China.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The three-day exhibition will be held alongside two major events, namely the ECO LIFESTYLES DESIGN FAIR, and the Eco Industry and LOHAS Forum.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The ECO LIFESTYLES DESIGN FAIR, a component of ECO LIFESTYLES 2011, will showcase innovative sustainable designs in China, using eco-friendly materials. Categories include home design, furniture, household arts, product and fashion. A premiere sustainable Design Competition has been organized and well-received, with a larger than expected number of entries. Finalists' works will be showcased and judged at the three-day event, which will include a fashion show featuring works from the competition and well-established fashion brands, like Liliming Design and Yi Hui Fashion.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">For the Eco Industry and LOHAS Forum, many of China's senior government officials from the environmental and agriculture sector will attend. They will be joined by green investors, industry experts and top executives from China's growing eco and LOHAS industry. To be held from 15 to 16 September 2011, the forum will serve as a platform for networking and learning the latest developments in the eco and LOHAS industry.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">There will also be concurrent activities and special pavilions for the consumers and the public. These include the Green Transportation Hub, LOHAS One-stop Eco Home, the Nostalgia Theme Pavilion, the Healthy and Organic Food Pavilion, the Family Leisure Experience Centre, Green Kitchen, Designing Healthy Lifestyles Pavilion and the One Million Signature LOHAS Day Event.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">In the GREEN KITCHEN, visitors can learn about eating healthily, with great tasting foods, beverages, and organic desserts. They can also pick up a few tips on city farming and grow their own vegetables, which guides at the GREEN KITCHEN will share.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The Healthy and Organic Food Pavilion, co-organized by the Hangzhou Organic Promotion Centre, will showcase nutritious foods, as well as provide talks on ways to eat healthily and avoiding harmful foods.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The Family Leisure Experience Centre will feature DIY activities for visitors to learn about eco-living, such as crafting toys from bamboo and making a bag using old clothes.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The Designing Healthy Lifestyles Pavilion, designed with its own unique and organic style, will have workshops for visitors, and educate consumers on healthy and sustainable living in China. Exhibitors will also demonstrate how to equip homes with proper insulation, non-toxic and sustainable materials, and ways to live a more eco-friendly life.    </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">In the One Million Signature LOHAS DAY event, more residents in Shanghai will get a chance to sign up and pledge their affirmation to live a LOHAS Day. In one of the earlier signature collection drives, 500 students and academics from Shanghai University pledged their commitment to live a day of health and sustainability. This signature drive will be held at shopping centres, universities and residents' communities in the future, and will continue into the ECO LIFESTYLES 2011 event.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Local Chinese exhibitors at ECO LIFESTYLES 2011 include ECOH, China's largest chain of natural organic products stores; Sailaiya, well-known in China for its eco-friendly accessories and organic garments for children; and Shanghai Forever, one of the biggest bicycle companies in the world and an established household brand in China, with a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">International exhibitors include Lekue, one of the world's leading producers in innovative silicone home products; Dethlefsen &amp; Balk (D&amp;B), one of the world's oldest suppliers of high-quality teas; and OSIM, a global leader in healthy lifestyles products, with a listing on Singapore's Stock Exchange.  </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Not to be left out are over 80 small and medium-sized enterprises and eco-start-ups, producing niche eco-friendly products and crafts. These niche eco-friendly items may appeal to consumers, who are looking for more down-to-earth and unique, but eco-friendly fare.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Overall, ECO LIFESTYLES 2011 will feature exhibitors from countries and regions, including: China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, USA, Malaysia, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, UK and France.</p>
