              <p>Dr Lui Che Woo, Founder and Chairman, Galaxy Entertainment Group (GEG, SEHK stock code: 00027), said, "Galaxy Entertainment Group is committed to the local economy by helping transform Macau into a diversified global tourism and entertainment hub. By integrating traditional Asian culture with Western management style, we have created a business model with 'World Class, Asian Heart' that will drive the success of our signature property, Galaxy Macau, and help realize Macau's vast potential as a tourism destination.</p>
              <p>"Galaxy Macau brings together three internationally renowned hotel brands - Banyan Tree Hotels &amp; Resorts, Okura Hotels &amp; Resorts and Galaxy Hotel - for a world-class, truly integrated destination resort in Macau( <a href="http://www.galaxymacau.com/en">http://www.galaxymacau.com/en</a> ) with the type of holiday features that have not previously been offered in the market. We believe this will help attract more visitors from different countries, extend their staying period in the city and create a more diversified destination choice for local, Asian and international travellers."</p>
              <p>The Grand Opening ceremony was attended by hundreds of VIPs, including His Honorable Dr Fernando Chui Sai On, Chief Executive of the Macau SAR; Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Mr Mao Xi Wei, Deputy Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Macau SAR; and Mr. Chang Yuxing. Following the program of traditional lion dances, firecrackers and a spectacular Asian dance procession, Dr Lui, GEG Vice Chairman Mr Francis Lui and officiating VIPs cut the ribbon signalling the official opening of Galaxy Macau. The doors then opened as senior Galaxy executives welcomed members of the public as the property's very first official guests.</p>
              <p>Banyan Tree Macau( <a href="http://www.galaxymacau.com/en/hotel/banyantreehotel">http://www.galaxymacau.com/en/hotel/banyantreehotel</a> ), Hotel Okura Macau( <a href="http://www.galaxymacau.com/en/hotel/hotelokura">http://www.galaxymacau.com/en/hotel/hotelokura</a> ) and Galaxy Hotel( <a href="http://www.galaxymacau.com/en/hotel/galaxyhotel">http://www.galaxymacau.com/en/hotel/galaxyhotel</a> )(TM) offer a total of 2,200 five-star rooms, suites and villas, accounting for nearly 12% of Macau's current room total and nearly 20% of its five-star capacity. The spectacular resort features of the HK$14.9 billion property are concentrated in its Grand Resort Deck, where a 350-ton white sand beach frames the 4,000-square-meter skytop wave pool, the world's largest of its kind. Several pools, gardens and private cabanas dot the area, making it perfect for private and corporate functions. The Grand Resort Deck also features the first Banyan Tree Spa in the Pearl River Delta, which at 3,400 square meters is also the biggest in the Banyan Tree group.</p>

True to its focus on providing an authentic Asian resort experience, more than half of them serve Asian cuisines, making it the widest such selection in Macau under one roof. The selection makes it possible for visitors to eat at Galaxy Macau once a week for a year and never eat at the same restaurant twice.</p>
              <p>Rounding out Galaxy Macau's resort offering is extensive in-house entertainment across multiple venues, including the soon-to-open, ultra-exclusive China Rouge, a hybrid private membership club, performance theatre, bar and restaurant conceptualized by renowned Hong Kong designer Alan Chan to evoke a modern vision of 1930s Shanghai. It is anticipated that China Rouge will instantly become one of the trendiest nightspots in Macau, drawing discerning clientele from around the region. Of particular note, Galaxy Macau is proud to announce its plans for a 9-screen, 3D, multi-function cinema theatre to follow later this year. Open to the local community and Galaxy Macau guests, the theatre will be state-of-the-art and the first of its kind in Macau. The property also features retail boulevards offering a unique shopping experience of Asian as well as international brands.</p>
