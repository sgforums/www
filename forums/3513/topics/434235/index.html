              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SINGAPORE, July 11, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Overseas Union Enterprise Limited (OUE) announced a landmark partnership with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) to provide SIT hospitality students with scholarships worth a total of S$2 million. The official signing ceremony for the scholarship deal was held at Mandarin Orchard Singapore.</p>

              </div>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The scholarships aim to reward outstanding SIT hospitality students, in keeping with the institution's commitment to remain strongly industry-relevant. OUE will grant SIT S$200,000 per annum over a period of 10 years with committed scholarship grants totalling S$2 million.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Professor Tan Chin Tiong, President, SIT said, "OUE's commitment to sponsor deserving SIT hospitality students is a great encouragement to us. We have consistently said that being with SIT promises an industry-relevant education and we reinforce this by actively seeking industry support for our students. The SIT-Overseas Union Enterprise Limited Scholarship is testament to the belief that our industry partners have in the quality of our students."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">OUE is a key prime property developer in strategic locations in Singapore's commercial, hospitality, retail and residential sectors. Recent projects by OUE include an extensive makeover of Mandarin Gallery, the launch of Twin Peaks -- Singapore's first luxury residential development that is fully furnished with designer pieces, and the redevelopment of iconic One Raffles Place and OUE Bayfront (including auxiliary properties -- OUE Tower and OUE Link) on historic Collyer Quay. Landmark acquisitions include DBS Building Towers One and Two, and Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Hotel.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"We are privileged to partner with an esteemed institution such as SIT in elevating Singapore's hospitality and culinary excellence through this long-running scholarship programme," said Dr Stephen Riady, Executive Chairman of OUE. "Travel and tourism continue to be an integral part of Singapore's economy, and we at OUE are committed to nurturing this exciting growth by equipping deserving hospitality students with the educational development they need to become tomorrow's industry leaders."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Meritus Hotels &amp; Resorts, whose portfolio includes the flagship property Mandarin Orchard Singapore where the signing ceremony was held, is the hospitality division of OUE. Key executives from the iconic hospitality brand will take part in the screening and selection of scholars, and also pledge to provide training and employment opportunities to graduates under the scholarship programme as the group expands globally. Meritus' current portfolio also includes Marina Mandarin Singapore, Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort &amp; Spa Langkawi in Malaysia, and in China-Shanghai JC Mandarin, Meritus Mandarin Haikou, and Meritus Shantou China.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">New developments being eyed by the hospitality group span fast-growing business and tourism hubs in Southeast Asia, China, and Europe.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Meritus Hotels &amp; Resorts CEO, Mr Michael Sengol said, "Raising the bar higher for industry standards in Singapore would require that we address the shortage of high-calibre talent in the local arena. It is only then that Singapore can optimise opportunities from what continues to be amongst the world's largest, most dynamic, fastest-growing industries. It is a responsibility that we at Meritus Hotels &amp; Resorts are proud to share, being the forerunners of world-class Asian hospitality in Singapore."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The SIT-Overseas Union Enterprise Limited Scholarship is open to all of SIT's current and future hospitality degree programmes. To date, SIT offers two hospitality degree programmes: the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' (UNLV) Bachelor of Science in Hotel Administration, and The Culinary Institute of America's (CIA) Bachelor of Professional Studies in Culinary Arts Management. Future hospitality degrees are in the pipeline as SIT continues discussions with potential overseas university partners.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">UNLV Chief Academic Officer, Dr. Nicholas J. Thomas said, "UNLV would like to acknowledge and thank Overseas Union Enterprise Limited for their commitment to educating future leaders of Singapore's hospitality and tourism industry. Through UNLV Singapore's partnership with the Singapore Institute of Technology, we look forward to having the best and brightest apply to our undergraduate program as part of this new scholarship framework."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Looking forward to the availability of the hospitality scholarship, CIA Managing Director Chef, Eve Felder said, "The support offered by our industry partners, through scholarships, provides a valuable conduit for qualified and passionate students to realize their career goals as well as for the industry to ultimately have educated professionals as employees. The Culinary Institute of America is thrilled to be the college of choice for students who will be the leaders in the food and beverage industry. We appreciate OUE's support of the students in fulfilling their dreams."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Applications for SIT-OUE Hospitality Scholarships are open to Citizens and Permanent Residents of Singapore who are pursuing a full-time hospitality degree programme with SIT.

              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>About Singapore Institute of Technology</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SIT was established by the Ministry of Education in 2009 to provide upgrading opportunities primarily for polytechnic graduates. In consultation with various government agencies, SIT has brought to Singapore some of the best degree programmes in the world by partnering reputable overseas universities. These programmes are highly industry-focused and targeted at key growth sectors of the economy.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SIT is committed to a unique tri-partite collaborative model with the overseas university partners and the five local polytechnics to offer polytechnic graduates more opportunities for learning at tertiary level. Additionally, SIT's unique 'distributed campus' model means that programmes are conducted at SIT facilities within each polytechnic, allowing for greater synergy and efficiency with regards to infrastructure and facilities.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SIT students are assessed holistically for both academic excellence and passion. All students are conferred the exact same degree as their counterparts at the home universities and are required to undergo an overseas immersion programme at their respective overseas university's home campus.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">At steady state, SIT aims to take in at least 2000 full-time students per academic year. There are plans to eventually offer part-time degree programmes to cater to full-time working professionals.</p>
