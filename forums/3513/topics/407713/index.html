              <p>Over US$125,000 in School Supplies Donated to New York City School <br><br>PASADENA, Calif., Aug. 9 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Avery Dennison set the Guinness World Record for largest amount of school supplies donated in a 24-hour period in New York City on August 4. Avery Dennison donated more than 8,500 pounds of school supplies to an in-need New York City school, shattering the record requirement of 1,102 lbs, 5 oz. <br><br>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2009/09/21/20090921459735.jpg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2009/09/21/20090921459735.jpg</span></span></a> ) <br><br>To establish the record, students from Adolph S Ochs School and Academy lined up at about 9 a.m. on August 4 morning to stuff a full-size school bus with the donated school supplies as part of the celebration. The feat was witnessed by an official Guinness World Record Adjudicator, who verified that the attempt adhered to the strict guidelines of the record category and presented Avery Dennison with a certificate documenting the new world record. <br><br>"I am so proud of what we accomplished here: setting a new record that enables us not only to support a very deserving school, but also to help draw attention to the needs of schools throughout the country," said Tim Bond, Group Vice President, Avery Dennison Office Products North America. "Avery Dennison is committed to helping parents and teachers across America provide students with the highest-quality education possible, and the school supplies are vital to that success." <br><br>Guidelines for the record category stipulate that three elements must be present in all Guinness World Record proposals: an idea that is measurable, breakable and verifiable. <br><br>"We are very excited about Avery Dennison Guinness World Records attempt for Largest Amount of School Supplies Donated in 24 Hours. This is an entirely new record category that was inspired by Avery Dennison's unique proposal," said Danny Girton, Corporate Adjudications Manager, Guinness World Records. "This record attempt is a story with a heart, which is what Guinness World Records is all about: ordinary people striving to achieve extraordinary things." <br><br>The record setting event is a part of the Avery Dennison Give Back to Schools program that was created in celebration of the company's 75th anniversary as a way to give back to the communities that have made the company's success possible. The program will provide 10 very deserving U.S. schools with Avery(R) premium school supplies. To enter to win, students, families and supporters (ages 18 and older) can vote for their local K-8 school now at http://www.AveryDennisonGiveBacktoSchools.com . At the conclusion of the contest on September 3, the 10 schools with the highest number of votes will each win Avery-brand school supplies valued at approximately US$10,000. <br><br>About Avery Dennison: <br><br>Avery Dennison (NYSE: AVY) helps make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent.
