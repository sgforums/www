            <div class='col-md body'><p>Final call for nominations <br><br>HONG KONG, Nov. 12, 2010 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Corporate figures, NGO heads, the media and members of the public are today invited to nominate their candidate as the PublicAffairsAsia Gold Standard Political Communicator of the Year, which is sponsored by eBay. <br><br>The nominations process is open to any political figure who is seen to be breaking new ground in effective communications in Asia or in a role related to Asia. PublicAffairsAsia and eBay will honour a politician or public figure in Asia who is achieving "gold standard excellence" in their engagement with business, civil society or stakeholder groups. <br><br>Members of the public, corporations, trade groups and politicians themselves can nominate in this category by submitting a supporting statement of no more than 300 words to goldstandard@publicaffairsasia.com no later than November 22, 2010. <br><br>The award was, last year, won by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono whose historic second election victory persuaded the senior-level panel of judges that he was breaking new ground in political communications. <br><br>The award is judged by a panel of over 40 senior figures from corporations, consultancies, governmental bodies, NGOs and the media, and forms one of the centrepieces of The Gold Standard Awards programme. <br><br>There is no charge to make a nomination for The Gold Standard Award for Political Communications and the category is open to nominations from both senior PA practitioners and members of civil society, the media, NGO groups and others. <br><br>Commenting on the award and the engagement with eBay, PublicAffairsAsia's vice president, Mark O'Brien, said: "Regardless of their systems of government, politicians in all countries in Asia Pacific need to effectively deploy modern communications techniques and strategies to make the case for their programmes. We are proud that eBay is to sponsor this year's award and look forward to receiving nominations over the coming weeks." <br><br>Steven Liew, eBay Senior Director for Asia Pacific Government Relations and Legal Counsel, said: "Effective communications often go both ways, through the recognition of mutual benefits. For example, as the largest ecommerce platform with access to over 90 million users worldwide, eBay work closely with many politicians and public figures to share information and discuss regulatory undertakings to support entrepreneurship and drive sustainable ecommerce in many parts of Asia." <br><br>The nominations process for The Gold Standard Award for Political Communications runs until November 22 and the award itself will be announced at a gala cocktail reception in Hong Kong on January 20, 2011. <br><br>For more information on this award, and the wider Gold Standard Awards programme, please visit http://www.goldstandardawards2010.com <br><br>About PublicAffairsAsia: <br><br>PublicAffairsAsia is the network for senior government relations, public affairs and corporate communications professionals operating across the Asia Pacific region.
