            <div class='col-md body'><p>HONG KONG, April 1 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- With a specially engineered solution, Avery Dennison has helped Moet Hennessy to solve one of the most difficult challenges in wine labeling. The result is an attractive and yet truly functional neck label that secures the foil cap wrappings on the companyï¼Šs leading champagne brand, Moet &amp; Chandon, and all its premium champagnes. <br><br>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/03/19/20100319595649.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/03/19/20100319595649.html</span></span></a> ) <br><br>Neck labels for champagne bottles make stringent technical demands on self-adhesive labelstock because they must provide exceptional holding power round the tight mandrel and compound curves of the bottle neck, along with adhesive properties that will enable the label to hold to the foil wrap, and at the same time 'tie' itself to the glass without creasing. They must also complement the premier champagne image, allowing a superior printing and converting treatment. This is especially true of Moet Hennessy wines. Established in 1743, Moet Hennessy is globally appreciated as one of the most accomplished and largest champagne houses. <br><br>The key differentiator: superior aesthetic qualities <br><br>For the Moet Hennessy bottles, achieving a smooth and elegant result is particularly difficult. According to Moet Hennessy Process Engineer Gilles Cateau: "The shape of the Moet &amp; Chandon "cravate" is very special. It is extremely precisely and finely cut out, with two sharp black points facing downwards. Itï¼Šs a unique expression of the marquee." <br><br>Solving the technical challenges <br><br>A special Fasson(R) self-adhesive labelstock was proposed by Avery Dennison for the task, offering the dual benefits of a strong film facestock and a high-performance adhesive. It combines Fasson PE150, a top-coated 150 micron white polyethylene film, with a solvent acrylic adhesive, Fasson S700, carried on a white glassine release liner. This laminate gives Moet Hennessyï¼Šs printers the opportunity to demonstrate their skill at printing and converting film labelstock, and at the same time provides stable, accurately positioned high-speed label dispensing on the packaging line. All the Moet wines are labeled in France for global distribution. <br><br>"A real qualitative improvement" <br><br>Says M Cateau: "The Fasson labelstock we are using for our champagne bottle 'cravates' is perfectly suited for use on our production line and also delivers the high quality of presentation which we strive for with our champagnes." <br><br>"The Fasson adhesive gives a finish that is much superior to the wet-glue solution we used before, which left visible traces of glue on the glassware. We have experienced a real qualitative improvement since we have been using the Fasson solution. Our 'cravates' remain intact, and stick fast, on our bottles - a critical requirement, since they are the primary symbol, and key identifier, of the Moet &amp; Chandon brand around the world." <br><br>The Fasson wine labeling portfolio <br><br>Avery Dennison Roll Materials offers an extensive range of dedicated self-adhesive labelstocks for wines and spirits labeling in its Fasson(R) portfolio. It also provides technical support to assist wine producers and their label converters and creative teams in selecting the right material for the task at hand.
