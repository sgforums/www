              Over 100 Enterprise partner executives gathered from all of APAC to hear more about ALUE direction for 2013, "How to be an essential player in the Cloud Era". 
              
              Alcatel-Lucent OpenTouch Suite brings more visual conversations to mid and large enterprises that enables businesses to make the experience of the many new faces of conversations available to customers, partners and employees 
              
              The reach of consumer technology into the workplace has changed the conversation and caused businesses to examine the next steps in deploying flexible and performance enabling communications tools that support the day to day routine of employees. 
              
              The OpenTouch Suite 1.2 offers more visual collaboration and mobility experiences with flexible deployment to meet the needs of today's businesses. 
              
              Alcatel-Lucent OpenTouch Suite 1.2 revolutionizes visual communications, providing new user experiences. With OpenTouch, conversations are naturally continuous and persistent over time. The latest update OpenTouch Suite 1.2 enriches communication before, during and after the conversation, so that employees can plan, record, store, share conversations and "socialize" them afterwards. 
              
              "The explosion of applications is changing how we work, lending to more collaborative and visual conversations both in our personal and professional lives. As a result, our devices are becoming remote controls of our lives. The Alcatel-Lucent OpenTouch Suite and applications are making it possible for enterprises to maximize this new way of working and reduce costs, while improving the ability to make changes without difficulty," said Michel Emilienoff -- Head of Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise. 
              
              "The new visual features on OpenTouch go beyond basic video conferencing to bring in collaboration, before, during and after the meeting. Its solutions like these that will help Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise become an essential player in enterprise communications globally and a brand that sets the standard for the user experience," said Jan Zuubier -- Head of Global SALUEs &amp; Marketing of Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise. 
              
              The technology of OpenTouch is also driving the shift to the Personal Cloud, as more customers and Business Partners' recognize the benefits of a service based offer: 
              
              -- OpenTouch is VMware certified enabling virtualization of all elements of the OpenTouch architecture deployment and helping create new business models which are more flexible to suit the needs of mid and large enterprises. The virtualization capabilities reduce costs while improving the ability to make changes without headaches. The OpenTouch Suite is hardware agnostic, and deployable in data centers running VmWare 5.0, ESXi 5.0 or the complete vSphere solution. 
              -- New pricing of the OpenTouch Multimedia system software enables existing customers to "taste" and adopt the new user experience. 
              
              "Alcatel Lucent is key cloud enabler from both Opex and Capex solutions and go-to-market partner perspective in ACE Cloud Business Model: Opex for true XaaS cloud services from Capgemini and Capex for building enterprise private cloud solutions and the two solutions can be mixed per customer needs," said Dr. HAN Jun -- General Manager of New Technology Business, Capgemini China. 
              
              Key trends and new challenges in Enterprise Network Infrastructure 
              
              However, new devices and new visual/multimedia collaboration applications such as OpenTouch Suites are putting tremendous pressure on current network infrastructure. While the world is talking about Software Defined Network (SDN) to optimize delivery of real-time multimedia applications over network infrastructure, Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise has been winning customers and delivering SDN with the Application Fluent Network (AFN) approach to converged LAN campus and Cloud- ready Datacenter especially in Government and Large Enterprises. 
              
              "Customers can embrace Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) and transform Data center with a fraction of the cost they used to pay. All Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise AFN features are available now on entry-level switches instead of just the high-end LAN switches. Alcatel Lucent's customers do not need to pay premium to derive maximum productivity in a converged voice, video and data infrastructure, but this may not be the case for Alcatel Lucent's competitors," said BG Poon -- Vice President of Enterprise Network, Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise APAC. "In a converged Voice and Data environment for example, our switch will automatically configure itself when a desktop phone is connected to the network, saving manual and time consuming configuration by the IT administrator. We called this network configuration -- ZERO-TOUCH. Alcatel-Lucent switches has saved our customers at least one million dollar in operational cost over a five-year period with the lowest power consumption and little rack spaces," he added. 
              
              "Alcatel-Lucent was the fastest growing Data Center Switching vendor in Q3'2012[1], fastest growing Ethernet LAN vendor in port shipments[2], and fastest growing vendor in WLAN-Dependent Access Point revenue[3]. The worldwide growth we have seen in Q3 in data center and cloud categories indicates that our solutions are important for our customers as they continue to build and expand their networks," said FL Leow -- Senior Vice President of Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise APAC, at the conference.
