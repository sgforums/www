            <div class='col-md body'><p>LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- 7 For All Mankind, the world's premier brand of denim-lifestyle products, unveils a groundbreaking new Spring 2012 marketing campaign. Born from an art film imagined and created by James Franco in collaboration with the brand's creative agency, LIPMAN, the unorthodox campaign is an innovative multimedia experience that embodies the brand's California roots and 'forever cool' aesthetic. The campaign debuts with a short teaser video, which was shot from behind the point of view of James Franco. The campaign will feature a number of cutting-edge print and digital assets and will culminate with a full-length feature film to be released in May. <br><br>(PHOTO: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120209/LA48617) <br><br>The new campaign brings the brand to life through the eyes of Franco, resulting in a stimulating visual journey. "This marks an important evolution for 7 For All Mankind. The campaign is the perfect platform for us to tell our brand story of a modern, elevated California lifestyle," said Barry Miguel, President of 7 For All Mankind. "It takes the brand to a new level and communicates both our image and product in a new and compelling way." <br><br>Shadowing a cast of actors, artists, models and musicians that embody the Los Angeles way of life, including Lily Donaldson, Henry Hopper and Amber Anderson, the campaign depicts the story of a hedonistic house party that takes place over a warm December weekend in Malibu. Evoking the causal California lifestyle interspersed with fashion and sexuality, the resulting imagery and film communicates the brands' values with a realism that is entirely unique. <br><br>While Franco is known for his exceptional work in the arts, this was his first time shooting an advertising campaign. "Working with 7 For All Mankind was an amazing experience. I was able to work in ways that were similar to what I do in the film world but in this case we had a tremendous amount of freedom. We were liberated from the conventional film apparatus and were able to create something both classic and new," said James Franco. "The campaign was born out of a desire to do something that has never been done before," said David Lipman, Founder and CCO of LIPMAN. "With James helming the camera, you connect so strongly to the narrative and yearn to be a part of it." <br><br>The campaign launch includes a dedicated 7 For All Mankind YouTube channel debuting on February 15th (youtube.com/7forallmankindjeans( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/7forallmankindjeans"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.youtube.com/7forallmankindjeans</span></span></a> )). The print and digital assets will live on the YouTube channel including curated episodes, which delve into the key cast members' journey throughout the shoot. The episodes, all edited and directed by Franco, showcase the unique interpretation and expression of the brand. The channel will have a global phasing in of local market translations. <br><br>www.7forallmankind.com www.lipman-nyc.com <br><br>For press inquiries within the US, please contact: <br>Angela DeCasperis <br>angela_decasperis@vfc.com <br>646 839 5427 <br><br>Jamie Williams <br>Jamie@lipman-nyc.com <br>212 929 7211 <br><br>For international press inquiries, please contact your local PR representative. <br><br><br>SOURCEï¹›7 For All Mankind <br></p></div>
