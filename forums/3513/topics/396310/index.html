              <p>NanoMaterials Technology Signs Exclusive Licensing Agreement for Hyperlipidemia-controlling Drug with Beijing Winsunny Pharmaceutical</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p>2010-04-09 09:00</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    SINGAPORE, April 8 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- NanoMaterials Technology Private Limited ("NMT") announced today that it has signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Beijing Winsunny Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Winsunny Pharma") for the use of its proprietary High Gravity Controlled Precipitation ("HGCP") Technology to manufacture, market and distribute a generic version of a world-wide blockbuster hyperlipidemia-controlling drug in China with a potential market size of over US$900 million. Currently, there are 90 million patients in China undergoing long-term treatment for hyperlipidemia. The annual growth rate of the patients is about 15 million and it is estimated that the number of patients required the treatment will reach 200 million in the next 10 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Under the terms of the agreement, Winsunny Pharma will pay an undisclosed upfront fee as well as milestones and royalty payments based on future sales of the drug. NMT will provide a new formulation that will increase efficacy, lower drug dosage and provide better patient compliance. Winsunny Pharma will assume all the costs of development, regulatory and commercialization of the solid oral dosage formed drug including clinical trials. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "Today's announcement is an important milestone for NMT in deploying our HGCP technology in one of the fastest growing and most important markets in the world for the pharmaceutical sector," said Dr. Jimmy Yun, CEO of NMT. "Previously, we had demonstrated the use of HGCP Technology in mass production of specialty chemicals. This is our first collaboration with Winsunny Pharma and it provides an opportunity to extend the product range of their hyperlipidemia-controlling drugs. We believe that this is the beginning of a series of drugs using our technology to be made available in the market. We look forward to having more collaboration with Winsunny Pharma in future."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "We have various late stage developments which have the potential to reach commercialization in the near future. Currently, we are in talks with pharmaceutical companies in the US, Europe and China to commercialise several compounds using HGCP technology," continued Dr. Yun. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    The HGCP Technology allows production of active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") at both low micron and nano-sized range. NMT has demonstrated the suitability of the technology for processing APIs of both small and macro molecules to be formulated for solid oral dosage and inhalation forms. The HGCP Technology is also being used for designing drug particles with good aerodynamic properties and specific particle size distribution for pulmonary inhalation. It consolidates the current conventional "crystallization, micronization and conditioning" manufacturing processes into one-step, which is cost and time-saving.</p>
