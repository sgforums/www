              <p>Said Dr. Bou-Wen Lin, Director-General of STPI, "Our collaboration with Thomson Reuters reflects our long-term observation of Taiwan's academic competitiveness and our dedication to developing consistent methodologies to measure scientific output. At STPI, we hope to use these methodologies to implement long-term, systematic analysis to provide government bodies with relevant information in order to promote technological resource-planning and utilisation. This report aims to provide domestic and foreign industries, governments, academics and research communities with a deeper understanding of Taiwan's research capabilities." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Taiwan Research Report is a result of the MOU signing between the STPI and Thomson Reuters on 22 June 2009.
