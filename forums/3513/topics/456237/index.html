              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Infrastructure testing services to assure business readiness and optimal IT performance <br><br>BANGALORE, India, NEW YORK, LONDON and SYDNEY, July 25, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Infosys,( <a href="http://www.infosys.com/pages/index.aspx">http://www.infosys.com/pages/index.aspx</a> ) a global leader in consulting and technology, today launched a new offering for infrastructure testing. The offering comprises a range of services that span the entire infrastructure life cycle - from new hardware deployment and integration to migration and operations. Companies can use these services to comprehensively test and assure the business readiness and performance of their IT infrastructure during major changes such as datacenter consolidation, virtualization, and technology upgrades. <br><br>Speaking on the need for such an offering, Rona Shuchat, Director, Application Development, Testing and Management Services, IDC, said: "As enterprises are challenged by deployment of increasingly diverse technologies including virtualization, collaboration and cloud, there is a growing urgency to validate, streamline and optimize underlying infrastructure being transformed within the datacenters. End-to-end infrastructure testing services, with related program governance, risk assessment, configuration, security, interface and performance testing will help enterprises scale up to meet the multi-dimensional complexity of their growing infrastructure and application portfolios." <br><br>Said Chandrashekar Kakal, Senior Vice President and Global head of Business IT Services, "Infrastructure Testing is an innovation at the intersection of two of our core offerings - Infrastructure Management and Testing. This is an excellent example of how we are innovating across services to help our clients drive greater IT infrastructure reliability. We are already seeing a positive response from many clients for this offering and have also started assisting several organizations across geographies and industries." <br><br>According to various industry estimates, the cost of data center downtime can range between $80,000 and $500,000 an hour for large enterprises. Infrastructure Testing from Infosys will significantly help reduce downtime and resulting costs.
