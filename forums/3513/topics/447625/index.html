            <div class='col-md body'><p>The Singapore Business Federation in collaboration Janus Corporate Solutions recently held a seminar on business incorporation options for Representative Offices in Singapore that are nearing the maximum 3-year period allowed for Representative Offices. <br><br>SINGAPORE, Feb. 20, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- On February 10, Singapore Business Federation( <a href="http://www.sbf.org.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.sbf.org.sg</span></span></a> ) (SBF) in collaboration with Janus Corporate Solutions( <a href="http://www.guidemesingapore.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.guidemesingapore.com</span></span></a> ) hosted a seminar on "Next Steps for Representative Offices" at the SBF headquarters. The seminar was attended by top executives and senior managers of 26 foreign companies with Representative Offices in Singapore. The attendees came from a variety of industries including manufacturing, transport, logistics, and F&amp;B. The event was part of SBFs and Janus's collaborative efforts in positioning the country as an operational base for foreign companies that want to enter or expand in the South East Asian market. <br><br>Mr. Lauw Kok Keen, SBF Global-Asia Hub Dept. said that SBF is organising the RO Briefing as part of its role in helping and facilitating foreign companies to set up a base in Singapore in order to expand into the Asian region. <br><br>Subsequent to the welcome address, attendees were given a comprehensive presentation by the Janus Team headed by Ms. Jacqueline Low, Director of Janus Corporate Solutions. The presentation provided first-hand, relevant, practical, and actionable information about the benefits, ease and process of setting up a permanent establishment in Singapore. Participants were briefed on the process for establishing a permanent presence in the country by either setting up a Singapore subsidiary( <a href="http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-subsidiary-registration-guide"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-subsidiary-registration-guide</span></span></a> ) or a Singapore branch office( <a href="http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-branch-office-registration-guide"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-branch-office-registration-guide</span></span></a> ). The seminar covered several relevant topics including comparison between the two options, their incorporation procedures, their respective tax benefits, compliance requirements, and the Singapore Employment Pass( <a href="http://www.guidemesingapore.com/relocation/work-pass/singapore-employment-pass-guide"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.guidemesingapore.com/relocation/work-pass/singapore-employment-pass-guide</span></span></a> ) work visa scheme for the foreign staff. <br><br>Commenting on the timeliness of the seminar, Ms. Jacqueline Low said, "With the ascendancy of Asia in the global economic order, Singapore has been gaining prominence as a destination to do business. This is the reason why many foreign companies have established a Representative Office here. Since a Singapore representative office( <a href="http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-representative-office-registration-guide"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-representative-office-registration-guide</span></span></a> ) is a temporary arrangement and can only exist for a maximum of three years, we wanted the existing representative offices to gain a good understanding about setting up a permanent establishment in Singapore as the next logical step. As an incorporation and compliance services firm, Janus is committed to helping businesses establish and grow their presence in Singapore and we are pleased to partner with SBF for this cause. We look forward to collaborating on more such events with professional bodies such as the SBF." <br><br>The seminar not only proved to be an invaluable platform where participants received strategic guidance on how they can leverage Singapore's strengths as a business destination but also helped them engage in an active dialogue with Janus professionals to gain clarity about setting up a permanent establishment in Singapore. The event was very well received by the attendees who engaged in a lively Q&amp;A session at the conclusion of the seminar. <br><br>About Singapore Business Federation <br><br>The Singapore Business Federation is the apex business chamber that champions the interests of the Singapore business community in trade, investment and industrial relations.
