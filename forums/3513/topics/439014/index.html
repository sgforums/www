The 15-storey hostel, one of the largest to be built by a private education institution in Singapore, can accommodate up to 1,700 students. <br><br>His Excellency S R Nathan, President of the Republic of Singapore, officially opened the hostel on 8 July, 2011. <br><br>The hostel is part of MDIS' overall development to expand and upgrade its existing Campus as it targets to have 20,000 local and foreign students by 2015. <br><br>The hostel is not only notable in its size but also its design and facilities - and very importantly - its green focus. <br><br>MDIS Residences@Stirling, as it is officially called, comes with innovative features to ensure secure and homely comfort for international students. It is the first hostel in Singapore to win the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Green Mark Gold Plus Award for its green features. <br><br>"After I have done my research, MDIS emerged as the front runner. I can now stay at hostel and study right at the place next to it. I can go to school and do everything conveniently,§ said Ms Carmen Ng Kar Mun, a Malaysian student. <br><br>Besides the brand new hostel, MDIS is also investing another S$40 million to upgrade its facilities by adding three new buildings on its existing campus to provide more office space, lecture rooms, technical studios and car park lots. <br><br>A new academic-focused postgraduate center will also be built in the new integrated campus. <br><br>"This centre is aimed at bringing in overseas lecturers and teaching fellows from our reputed university partners to teach our students in Singapore. That this will further raise our standards of educational excellence and provide better interaction between our overseas university partners and our students. This will also further enhance the globalisation of the MDIS learning experience which is key to the success of our students and graduates in an increasingly globalised world," said Dr Theyvendran, MDIS Secretary-General. <br><br>On 19 May 2011, MDIS received the Reader's Digest Trusted Brands 2011 Gold Award based on six key attributes of trustworthiness and credibility, quality, value, understanding of customer needs, innovation and corporate social responsibility. <br><br>In 2010, MDIS was awarded the 4-year Edutrust certification by the Council of Private Education (CPE). This certification is awarded to private education institutions (PEIs) that have met the stringent standards set by CPE. <br><br>These standards include management commitment and responsibilities, corporate governance and administration, external recruitment, student protection and support services, academic processes and assessment of students, and quality assurance. <br><br>About Management Development Institute of Singapore (MDIS) <br><br>MDIS, founded in 1956, is Singapore's oldest not-for-profit professional institute for lifelong learning. MDIS has two subsidiaries: MDIS Pte Ltd to oversee its Singapore academic operations, and MDIS International Pte Ltd to further its globalisation strategy. <br><br>MDIS provides well-accredited courses, seminars and management services and opportunities for individuals to develop professionally through academic programmes in Business and Management, Engineering, Fashion and Design, Information Technology, Life Sciences, Mass Communications, Psychology and Travel, Tourism and Hospitality Management. They are offered in collaboration with highly acclaimed universities in Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. <br><br>In September 2008, MDIS set up its first overseas campus in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan in Central Asia, to offer world-class tertiary education to students from the Central Asia region. <br><br>MDIS inked a landmark deal with EduCity@Iskandar in June 2010 and is the first Singapore private tertiary institution to make its foray into Malaysia. The new 30-acre campus will be funded internally by MDIS and is expected to take in its first batch of students in 2013. <br><br>MDIS has representative offices in China, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. <br><br>Media Enquires <br>On behalf of MDIS, please contact: <br>Tham Moon Yee Stratagem Consultants Pte Ltd <br><a style="color: #003366;" href="mailto:tmy@stratagemconsultants.com">tmy@stratagemconsultants.com</a> <br>Tel: +65-6227-0502 <br>Fax: +65-6227-5663 <br><br>SOURCEï¹› Management Development Institute of Singapore (MDIS) <br><br></span></p>
