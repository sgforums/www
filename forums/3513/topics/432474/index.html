              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SINGAPORE, June 9, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- PwC announced that Dr. Ronald Ling has joined the firm as a Managing Director, Healthcare and as the East Asia/Southeast Asia Healthcare Leader, based in Singapore.

He will be a tremendous asset to our clients throughout Asia and to PwC as we expand our leadership in the territory."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Dr. Ling recently concluded 10 years with Symphony Asia (formerly Schroder Capital Partners), a private equity firm which has makes long-term investments in several sectors, notably healthcare. As a Principal then Partner, Dr. Ling held leadership roles with responsibilities across the lifespan of deals, including origination, evaluation, closing, post-investment monitoring and exit. He also served on the boards of several listed investee companies, including Singapore-based Parkway Holdings, which he helped transform into SE Asia's premier private hospital group.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Previously, Dr. Ling served as General Manager, Strategic Planning and New Business Development, for Parkway Group Healthcare, evaluating healthcare investments and expansion opportunities throughout East Asia and coordinating performance enhancement initiatives across the group.

              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Across East and Southeast Asia, a convergence of economic trends, government policies, and greater awareness among the general population of healthcare issues has created an environment that is poised for dramatic growth and change. The opportunities for Asia's healthcare organisations to forge new partnerships and collaborations, both inside and outside of traditional boundaries, are vast as countries search for the best way to finance, organise and deliver healthcare with the right balance of quality, cost and access.  </p>
