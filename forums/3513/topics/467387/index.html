              <p>Spring Professional opens in key regional markets -- providing IT &amp; engineering recruitment services</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, March 20, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Spring Professional, the wholly-owned professional recruitment arm of the Adecco Group in Asia, has today announced the launch of a network of information technology and engineering specialty recruitment offices across the Asia region -- establishing a presence in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand, whilst expanding its existing Singapore offering to complement its regional expansion plans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Under the brand names of Spring Information Technology and Spring Engineering, the company will focus exclusively on the recruitment of middle to senior level management and specialists in the areas of IT and engineering. The Adecco Group is already the global leader in professional recruitment with an extensive network of offices across Europe, North America and other locations, including Spring Technology in the UK. The company is also the global market leader in general staffing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The launch of Spring Professional across Asia is timely, with an increasing demand from organisations seeking to identify experienced talent in the areas of information technology and engineering. With talent shortages existing in IT &amp; engineering in many countries in Asia, leveraging on our vast experience and network will be critical to how we support organisations with their IT &amp; engineering recruitment needs. We have built incredibly strong regional teams with multiple years recruitment experience," commented Christophe Duchatellier, CEO, Adecco Asia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spring Professional has opened offices across Asia in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Taipei, whilst expanding its existing Singapore office. In Japan, the Adecco Group already offers technical professional staffing services through VSN Inc -- a company that it acquired in the first quarter of 2012 and which at the time of the acquisition doubled the group's exposure to professional staffing in Japan -- the world's second largest staffing market.</p>
              <p>Two experienced recruitment professionals will oversee Spring's expansion plans across Asia, with Bradley Miller directing the company's North East Asia operations from Hong Kong, and Serge Shine assuming responsibility for the South East Asia region, based out of Singapore.</p>
