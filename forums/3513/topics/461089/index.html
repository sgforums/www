              SINGAPORE, Nov. 5, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading Singapore business information portal GuideMeSingapore has published a series of in-depth guides to provide advice for entrepreneurs looking to engage in the import of medicine or medical devices into Singapore.
              
              The first guide in the series provides a general overview of the environment for importing healthcare products into Singapore. This includes an introduction to the relevant government authorities, such as the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and its various branches. It also provides a brief background on the state of the health care product legislation and regulatory framework in Singapore.
              
              This introductory section is complemented by three other comprehensive guides. The first, Importing Western Medicine into Singapore, describes the product and import licenses that are required for importing western medicines, as well as a step-by-step explanation of the application procedures for obtaining them. The second guide, Importing Chinese Medicine into Singapore, gives related information on the import and approval of Chinese Proprietary Medicine (CPM).
              
              Finally, the third guide, Importing Medical Devices into Singapore, offers a description of the different steps that need to be carried out in order to import and sell any type of medical device in Singapore. This process includes the application of a Registrant's Account with the HSA, the submission of the required documents for registration of the medical device, and the acquisition of an importation license.
              
              "Health care is one of the largest and fastest growing industries in the world. As Singapore looks to advance itself as the leading medical and biotechnology hub in Asia, there will be plenty of opportunities for businesses that import Western medicine, recognized traditional Chinese remedies, and high-standard medical devices," said Ms. Jacqueline Low, Chief Operating Officer of Janus Corporate Solutions, a leading Singapore business formation services firm and the parent company of GuideMeSingapore.
              
              "In 2000, Singapore's healthcare system was ranked by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the best in Asia - ahead of Hong Kong and Japan. In 2003, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) ranked Singapore healthcare as third best in the world," she continued. "With its recognized healthcare facilities and infrastructure, the government is looking to attract one million foreign patients every year to Singapore which will lead to an additional S$ 2.6 billion from health care tourism."
              
              "As the industry grows, and the demand for world-class medical products increases here in Singapore, opportunities for business will be plentiful. Thus, we published these comprehensive guides to provide information for those looking to import these products," explained Ms. Low. "We believe that entrepreneurs can leverage the excellent business environment here to set up a successful healthcare related venture."
