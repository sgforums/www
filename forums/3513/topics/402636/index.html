              <p> </p>
              <p>    SEOUL, South Korea, June 15 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Draeger, a Germany-based company with over 120 years of experiences in medical and safety technology, today announced that it has appointed Kim, Byung-do as the General Manager of Draeger Medical Korea. The appointment demonstrates Draeger's commitment to the local healthcare market and underlines the company's ambition to become a leading healthcare solutions provider in South Korea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Working closely with the local team, Kim, Byung-do will lead the company's efforts to develop the growing healthcare market, to forge new partnerships and to provide customers with innovative solutions and consultancy services. He reports to Andreas Frahm, President for the region Asia-Pacific.  Kim was previously at GE Healthcare Korea, where he had been the General Manager of several divisions including Education, marketing, Ultrasound and Clinical Systems since 2000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Andreas Frahm said, "Draeger has made significant contributions to the South Korea healthcare market in a number of areas in the past two decades, such as in supporting hospitals with innovative solutions. Kim, Byung-do's appointment is timely given the increasing demand for proven, high quality healthcare services and products.  With his business acumen and market knowledge, we aim to build even closer relationships with our Korean customers."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Kim said, "Customers play a central role at Draeger. I look forward to being part of Draeger's team to develop closer relationships with our customers in this key growth market." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    According to research from Frost &amp; Sullivan, the South Korean healthcare industry will continue to experience fast growth, with opportunities in the areas of healthcare services and consulting, medical tourism, healthcare outsourcing, and medical devices and equipment. Factors affecting the increase spending on healthcare include the rising popularity of the healthcare sector, a rapidly aging population and increasing healthcare needs of the people, and strong government support. "To support this growth, Draeger will continue to invest in the local market, reflecting the company's commitment and leadership as a healthcare provider that cares about customer needs," added Frahm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Draeger Medical Korea was founded in August 1990. Since then, the company has supported the South Korean public and private hospitals by offering a suite of services and products including ventilators, anesthesia devices, OR lights and ceiling supply units for intensive care units, operation theaters and emergency care.  </p>
