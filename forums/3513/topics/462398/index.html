                  HONG KONG, Dec. 3, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- PR Newswire has released its comprehensive new report on content marketing and new media adoption in China. The report reveals that many Chinese companies now consider content marketing a critical component of their communications strategies, and the greatest challenges they face are content production and ROI. The report further found that new media usage will rise sharply in the next 12 months. 
                  
                  The survey, the largest ever held in China on this topic, was conducted from August to October 2012 and collected 1,387 questionnaires from marketing, branding and communications personnel, as well as C-suite executives. 
                  
                  The full report on China's Content Marketing Trends( http://misc.prnasia.com/atd/custeventreg.php?event_id=32 ) is available for download in both English and Chinese, below are some of the key findings from the survey:
