              SINGAPORE, Dec. 14, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- TripAdvisorâ„¢, the world's largest travel site, today reveals the results of its Cities Survey, which looks at how international and local travellers view forty key tourist cities around the world.

              Cancun topped the list for having the friendliest locals and in Asia, Tokyo (second) and Bangkok (seventh) were both featured in the top 10.
              
              In terms of the friendliest taxi drivers, Tokyo and Singapore came in first and third places respectively.

              1	Cancun	1	Tokyo

              Shopping Paradise
              
              According to respondents, New York City was the ultimate paradise when it comes to shopping, coming in first place. In Asia, Bangkok was the other shopping heaven as a runner up, while Tokyo (fifth), Hong Kong (sixth), Kuala Lumpur (eighth) made up the rest of the Asian destinations in the top ten.
              
              Get your money's worth
              
              To get your money's worth, respondents said Lisbon is the best place. In Asia, Bangkok (third), Hanoi (fourth) and Kuala Lumpur (ninth) also featured strongly in the list.
              
              "Whilst the greatness of a city isn't defined by just these factors, cleanliness, safety, value-for-money, ease of using local transport and even the friendliness of locals can be important when it comes to the rating of a city," said Jean Ow-Yeong, TripAdvisor spokesperson. "It is therefore encouraging to see that Asian cities like Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur have ranked favourably on the world stage for many of these categories."
              
              Note to Editors: 
              
              The survey was sent to those that have written a review on either a hotel, restaurant or attraction in the featured cities in during 2012, with the majority of surveys sent to travellers and the remainder to locals.  To be included in the results a city had a minimum of 300 completed responses, with the ranking based on average scores for each question.  All analysis was conducted by Brainbox Research.  The selection of featured cities is based on the key cities from countries which receive the largest number of international visitor arrivals (data compiled by the UNWTO 2010).
