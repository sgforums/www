              <p>Singapore first country in South East Asia to bring next generation lighting to public housing</p>
              <p>    SINGAPORE, June 4 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- LED lighting solutions provider Optiled Lighting has announced it is the supplier for a major LED lighting installation project at Jurong Town (JT), one of Singapore's oldest housing estates. The project was called for by the Jurong Town Council (JTC) to help save costs, improve quality of life, and to help JT "green up" and reduce its environmental footprint. The project also marks the first time a country in South East Asia has ever implemented LED lighting in a public housing complex. The first phase will be completed in June 2010.</p>
              <p>    Following a successful LED lighting pilot program that kicked off in December 2008, JTC awarded this project to a consortium that includes Optiled, UGL Premas and Smart Energy, which is tasked with upgrading HDB buildings managed by JTC to more energy efficient LED lighting in over 400 of the town's 588 buildings; altogether 64,000 Optiled LED lighting fixtures with CREE LED chips are to be installed. The new fixtures offer a number of benefits, including much greater energy efficiency, longer life spans, superior light quality, and greener technology that contains no mercury, lowers CO2 emissions, and produces no harmful IR or UV rays.</p>
              <p>    "We chose Optiled LED fixtures with CREE LED chips not only because they meet our stringent technical requirements, but also because of the tremendous benefits brought to our residents and the environment," said Mr. Chan Wee Lee, senior manager of JTC. "We have wanted to reduce our environmental impact for awhile, but it was only with Optiled we were able 'go green', save on costs, and keep our residents happy."</p>
              <p>    During the pilot program JTC found they were able to save 52% on energy consumption compared with conventional fluorescent tube lighting. And, since the response from the residents was very positive during the trial run, JTC is confident that their service quality will not be affected by the upgrade. The council now estimates that electricity consumption will be reduced by 30%, after the installation is completed in December 2010.</p>
              <p>    Mr. Hiroyuki Ochi, chairman of Smart Energy, said, "In addition to fulfilling JTC's dream, we have proven that public housing in Singapore can go green and eco-friendly. We look forward to working with other town councils on this green concept."</p>
              <p>    CJ Neoh, general manager of OPTILED Lighting (S.E.A.) Pte Ltd., added, "Optiled LED lighting is proven to deliver substantial cost and energy savings with minimal environmental impact, and improves the ambiance of any location. It is an honor to help Singapore become the first country in South East Asia to bring LED lighting to public housing, and we hope to have more opportunities like this in the future."</p>
