            <div class='col-md body'><p>Experian Marketing Services' CheetahMail earns top ratings in customer service, global footprint, market presence, management team, executive vision, mobile, social and more <br> -- Experian(R) CheetahMail(R), the leading global technology services provider of integrated email, social, mobile and display marketing, today announced that Forrester Research deemed it among the leaders in the January 2012 report, "The Forrester Wave(TM): Email Marketing Vendors, Q1 2012," most notably recognizing CheetahMail's customer satisfaction scores and rave client reviews <br><br>As reported by Forrester, "We count on high services and customer satisfaction scores from Experian CheetahMail and it did not disappoint. Its large support teams -- which are staffed and operated independently of the larger Experian organisation -- win customer kudos particularly for their availability, operational expertise, collaboration and practical, proactive advice. Retailers love this firm because of its experience managing promotional emails although it suits any marketer who needs some extra hands on his email program." They continued, "Experian CheetahMail shines on services. Experian CheetahMail, the study's largest vendor, lands as our third Leader because of its well-staffed, capable professional services teams, tenured management, 14-country international footprint, and near-perfect customer satisfaction scores. Rave client reviews of this vendor's social and data security solutions..." <br><br>"I was gladly a reference for Experian CheetahMail for this year's Forrester Wave and gave them top marks across the board," remarked Jenn McClain, vice president of online marketing for Chico's. "I've worked with a number of email service providers referenced in the report and have never worked with an email services provider who has made as significant of an impact on our business." <br><br>"We thrive on being a trusted advisor to our clients, and we value receiving recognition for the service we provide them," said John Merakovsky, Managing Director of Marketing Services, Experian Asia Pacific. "Our continued global growth; 97 percent client retention rate; and investment in emerging mobile, social and display technologies are just some of the things that illustrate our dedication to our clients' success. We were very proud to receive the second-highest marks in the Wave for 'Current Offering' and the highest scores for 'Market Presence,' highlighting the fact that we continue to be the largest email services provider in the world. We agree with Forrester that email marketers are only getting more mature, and we believe we have the technology and services to make any company more successful tomorrow than they are today." <br><br>The Forrester Wave: Email Marketing Vendors, Q1 2012, evaluated six Email Service Providers (ESPs) based on a variety of 37 weighted criteria, including current offering, strategy and market presence. Ratings also were based on Forrester Research's opinion of each ESP's corporate strategy, product road map, vertical strategy and revenue. Technology demonstrations and in-depth interviews with a number of customer references and top executives also were included in the evaluation process. <br><br>About Experian CheetahMail <br><br>Experian CheetahMail is the trusted service provider of email marketing and customer intelligence technologies for top enterprises worldwide.
