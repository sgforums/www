            <div class='col-md body'><p><br>It Provides Industry's Best Non-Line-of-Sight WiFi Coverage for 3G Data Offload <br><br>HONG KONG, June 10 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Leveraging A8's patented long range wireless technology, Altai Technologies today announced it is going to launch the A8-Ei Super WiFi Base Station at the CommunicAsia 2010, Singapore Expo (Jun 15-18). The A8-Ei is an all-in-one multi-beam antenna array super WiFi base station that has integrated the base unit, antennas and external cables into one panel. With the continuous roll-out of new bandwidth-hungry application on iPhone and other smartphones, Altai A8-Ei's superior long range coverage allows immediate WiFi provisioning for 3G operators to offload data traffic from their 3G networks. <br><br>The Altai A8-Ei has adopted the multi-beam smart antenna technology to provide superior signal strength and link budget in dense urban environment deployments. The Altai's A8-Ei can typically achieve a non-line-of-sight range of up to 800m and near line-of-sight range of 1.7 km; it provides the industry's best non-line-of-sight WiFi coverage. <br><br>Equipped with multiple antennas in a single panel, the A8-Ei provides up to 5 times the range and 20 times the per site coverage as traditional access point. Therefore, by using up to 95% fewer installation sites than other WiFi systems to cover the same area, the A8-Ei provides an ideal and quick 3G data offload solution for mobile operators. <br><br>The compact design of the A8-Ei enables 3G operators to quickly expand their data network capacity at a much lower acquisition and operating costs by co-locating with their existing 3G cell sites. "The Altai Super WiFi equipments has been deployed around the world for delivering high quality wireless broadband services," said Chi-hung Lin, President &amp; CEO of Altai Technologies. "By adding the A8-Ei to our growing Super WiFi series, Altai gives carriers and service providers the industry's most cost-effective solution for deploying and expanding their wireless networks." <br><br>Mr. Lin will speak at the CommunicAsia 2010 Summit on Jun 15 about "How WiFi Technology is Helping Redefine the Mobile Operator Business Model". Meanwhile, the full series of Altai Super WiFi products and the latest wireless products will be exhibiting at its booth 4B1-08, Hall 4 in CommunicAsia 2010 (Jun 15-18), Singapore. <br><br>About Altai Technologies <br><br>Altai Technologies is a high technology company focused on the design, development and marketing of carrier-grade, innovative wireless broadband solutions.
