I'm proud of the strategic contribution we make to the industry and the recognition from our peers this award represents. We will continuously work to develop innovative solutions and deliver operational excellence to maintain the position of provider of choice for our customers," said Paul Graham, Chief Executive Officer, DHL Supply Chain, Asia Pacific. <br><br>"Innovation can't be a one-off, we have worked hard to replicate solutions like the Direct to Market model in all our markets and even across different sectors, leveraging the experience and insight of our regional and global teams," said David Christmas, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Strategy, DHL Supply Chain, Asia Pacific. He was a panelist at a supply chain symposium by SCM Logistics World and received the award on behalf of DHL at the awards ceremony held at Marina Bay Sands. <br><br>The SCM Logistics Excellence Awards is into its seventh year and is an important part of the SCM Logistics World conference that gathers global supply chain and logistics professionals every year for conferences, workshops and seminars. <br><br><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>- End - <br><br>DHL æ¯� The Logistics company for the world <br><br>DHL is the global market leader in the logistics industry and "The Logistics company for the world".
