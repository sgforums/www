              <p>Iconic Hotel Stands for Design and Service Excellence for an Experience Unlike Any Other</p>
              <p>HONG KONG, June 14, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Hotel ICON, an upscale Hong Kong hotel in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui East, announced its soft opening. Offering exceptional Asian hospitality, Hotel ICON represents the combined efforts of Hong Kong's most creative talents.</p>
              <p>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/06/14/20110614880917.html">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/06/14/20110614880917.html</a> )</p>
              <p>With 262 guest rooms ranging in size from 36 to 80m2, Hotel ICON will rank among Hong Kong's most symbolic landmarks. Standing as a stylish testament to Hong Kong's creative energy and vibrant arts scene, Hotel ICON showcases work from the city's celebrated designers and visionaries.</p>
              <p>Rocco Yim of the Hong Kong-based Rocco Design Architects Ltd oversaw the hotel's architectural design. William Lim, Managing Director of Hong Kong's CL3 Architects, designed the contemporary interiors, including the guestrooms, the Silverbox ballroom and the lobby's grand sweeping staircase.</p>
              <p>Fusing innovative design and classic style, Lim's goal was to create spaces of ultimate comfort. "Comfort is always my priority when designing guestrooms," explains Mr. Lim. "We wanted to create a sense of richness and elegance, then let the spectacular views complete the story."</p>
              <p>Fashion doyenne Vivienne Tam also contributed to the project. A graduate of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Tam designed ICON's exclusive VT Suite, which reflects the artist's signature look of unforced elegance and chic simplicity.</p>
              <p>Hotel ICON's commitment to local creativity and innovation extends to the staff uniforms. Award-winning Hong Kong designer Barney Cheng fashioned the stylishly clean-cut outfits.</p>
              <p>Tommy Li, one of Hong Kong's most prominent graphic designers, created Hotel ICON's eye-catching logo. Fluid and evolving, the logo signifies the hotel's central location as well as its outreach and commitment to the community.</p>
              <p>The confluence of art and design is also evident in the artwork. Renowned Hong Kong designer Freeman Lau curated the hotel's eclectic collection. Hotel ICON currently houses works of art by some of Asia's best talents, including Cheung Yee, Kan Tai-Keung, Nancy Chu Woo, Hung Keung, Pauline Lam, William Furniss, John Fung, Chow Chun Fai, Tsang Chui Mei and Terence Lee.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to give a comprehensive picture of the creative industry here in Hong Kong," says Mr. Lau. "The aim is to show a diverse group of art works so that guests can get a taste of the different elements in the creative sector."</p>
              <p>As well as highlighting Hong Kong's most in-demand artists, Hotel ICON also features the iconic work of international designers, including Conran &amp; Partners and Patrick Blanc.</p>
              <p>Conran &amp; Partners designed Hotel ICON's restaurants, including 'Above &amp; Beyond', the sleek-and-chic private members' facility on Level 28, and The Market, an open-plan restaurant offering a tempting selection of pan-Asian and Western favourites.</p>
              <p>French botanist and artist Patrick Blanc created and installed the lavish 18-meter vertical garden in the Hotel ICON lobby. Measuring 230m2, the verdant garden wall is the largest of its kind in Asia.</p>
              <p>Exceptional Eateries</p>
              <p>Hotel ICON houses three restaurants: Above &amp; Beyond Chineserestaurant, The Market and GREEN. Located on the top floor of the hotel and featuring panoramic views of Victoria Harbour, Above &amp; Beyond provides gourmet lovers with traditional dim sum and the best of seasonal Cantonese cuisine.</p>
              <p>Designed by Conran &amp; Partners, Above &amp; Beyond evokes the mood of a private club. Hand-picked books and eclectic Asian artifacts line the library shelves, creating an intimate, relaxed space while the spectacular floor-to-ceiling views add to the allure. Three ultra-stylish private dining rooms, one with a functioning kitchen, are also available for guests to invite a private chef to serve customised meals.</p>
              <p>The Market on the second floor adds extra spice with a dash of variety. Inspired by the Hong Kong's iconic wet-markets, The Market offers a wide range of top-quality Asian and international delicacies. A foodie haven, the market-style eatery features open kitchens and a buzzy, vibrant atmosphere. The restaurant accommodates up to 160 diners and includes an open-air garden terrace for those who prefer al fresco dining.</p>
              <p>GREEN, situated on the lobby level, provides guests with a neighbourhood cafe by day and tapas bar by night. GREEN is the perfect venue to casually meet, unwind or simply enjoy great comfort food in an elegant setting.</p>
              <p>Uncompromising Levels of Comfort</p>
              <p>Offering the ultimate in comfort, Hotel ICON guestrooms comprise seductive extras, Vogue-worthy interiors and thoughtful surprises. Standard features include a complimentary mini-bar, iPhone/iPod docking station, complimentary wired and Wi-Fi internet connections and an ultra-slim 40" Ultra High Definition LED TV.</p>
              <p>Hotel ICON's Angsana Spa is a tranquil oasis devoted to indulgence and pampering. Within this private retreat, professional therapists from the world-famous Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts</p>
              <p>offer a range of relaxing and rejuvenating treatments.</p>
              <p>Located on Level 9, the harbor-facing outdoor swimming pool, gym and fitness centre allow guests to exercise while enjoying the spectacular view of the city.</p>
              <p>Hotel ICON's grand Silverbox ballroom is the ideal venue for a celebration or theatre-style conference. With a maximum capacity of 480 persons, the main hall can be divided into smaller spaces for more intimate gatherings or private corporate events.</p>
              <p>"Hotel ICON is the first of its kind in Asia," said Richard Hatter, General Manager of Hotel ICON. "We are proud of the hotel and its link to local culture, which can be seen through various features of the hotel. Our aim is to further develop excellence in the hospitality industry and to celebrate local and international cuisine and creative design."</p>
