              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto;">As Corous360 prepares to scale up in Southeast Asia and further enhance its cloud-based gaming platform offerings <br><br>SINGAPORE, July 3, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Corous360 Pte. Ltd.("Corous360§), the leading independent online games cloud service provider in Southeast Asia, announced today that it has completed a SGD$1 million round of equity funding led by Gobi Partners – a venture capital firm that has funded more than forty early to traction stage companies since its establishment in 2002. Corous360 is a subsidiary of DeClout Pte. Ltd, a holding company that comprises a group of leading IT and cloud service providers in Southeast Asia. <br><br>Mr Kay-Mok Ku, general partner of Gobi Partners Singapore, will be joining the board of Corous360. "Gobi Partners has always stayed ahead of the technology curve by investing in and grooming many successful technology and media startups over the last decade. We are excited to have such a strategic partner on board with invaluable experience and know-how in the Interactive Digital Media industry in Asia. Gobiï¼Šs strong network in China can complement Corous360ï¼Šs efforts in enabling online game publishers and developers to self-publish games in Southeast Asia,§ said Winston Koh, CEO of Corous360. "This round of financing will enable us to accelerate our regional expansion plans as well as enhance our service offerings to publishers, developers and gamers." <br><br>Corous360ï¼Šs core offering is a cloud-based gaming deployment platform that will consist of three major components: the Games Cloud infrastructure that provides a highly scalable platform for direct deployment of game titles into the Southeast Asian markets; a Unified Payment Infrastructure that offers a one-stop solution for game publishers to access different payment methods and distribution channels; and a Gamers Community Portal that serves as a one-stop platform for gamers to interact with one another and access relevant services and games content. <br><br>"We believe we are one of the first in the industry to offer a unique platform which marries the business needs of publishers and developers with the gaming and interactive needs of core and casual gamers," said Kelvin Tay, Corous360ï¼Šs Business Development Director in Asia-Pacific. "With a well-rounded team comprised of experienced top management, IT veterans and creative and innovative gaming talent, our company has both the dexterity to adapt in the fast-changing online games industry as well as strong execution capabilities to deliver on our business plans.§ <br><br>"The online game market in Southeast Asia is under-penetrated compared to China. Although the total population of Southeast Asia is almost half of China, its game market is less than one-tenth of China," said Kay-Mok. "This is probably due to the fragmented and heterogeneous markets in Southeast Asia. With the advent of casual online and mobile games, which are more universally appealing in nature, we believe that there will be room for a unified, cloud-based game publishing platform to allow publishers and developers to deliver their games directly to Southeast Asia, and we believe Corous360 is well-positioned to take advantage of this emerging trend." <br><br>About Corous360 Pte Ltd <br><br>Corous360 is the leading independent online games cloud service provider in Southeast Asia that offers an integrated suite of end-to-end services to enable game developers, publishers and gamers to converge on a common platform and interact in a single community. <br><br>Leveraging on its wealth of experience in deploying enterprise IT, and supported by a professional team of industry experts, Corous360 offers its partners and customers a new dimension of value and support in the growing and dynamic industry of online gaming. By revolutionising the way online games are being operated, Corous360 helps lower operation costs and minimise business risks for game developers and publishers while enhancing gamersï¼Š experience through its regional connectivity set-up across Southeast Asia. Additionally, Corous360 serves as a one-stop shop for game publishers and developers looking for a platform which can effectively help them expand into Southeast Asia. <br><br>About DeClout Pte Ltd <br><br>Established in 2011, DeCloutï¼Šs vision is to nurture a successional generation of high growth domain clouds through leveraging on its existing complementary IT infrastructure businesses.
