Broadcasting these to their online social networks invites whoever's free to "come join", saving time pinging back and forth, inviting people individually, and the rejection of a "no" if they're unavailable. <br><br>Users can also discover and join hangouts happening around them, and search them by tags to find hangouts that match their interests to meet and socialize with other likeminded people. <br><br>Following the UK launch of their API, web and mobile app, the company has seen growing interest globally with people using uberlife to find others to grab a meal with as well as to go to upcoming gigs, conferences, festivals and happy hours with. <br><br>uberlife is also attracting interest from DJs and bands( <a href="http://uberlife.com/influencers"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://uberlife.com/influencers</span></span></a> ) - as a fun, easy way to engage offline with their fans and connect them with each other in the process - with international DJs Gabriel &amp; Dresden, electronica indie rock band Shiny Toy Guns and rock new wave band Metric the first with confirmed fan "meet &amp; greet" hangouts at SxSW. <br><br>SanchitaSaha explained: <br><br>"While social apps today are for sharing moments of our lives with our network, uberlife is about making those moments happen. <br><br>"SxSW provides an invaluable first opportunity to tap into the U.S. digital community, it's the perfect environment, where thousands will be attending alone, to meet and hang out with new people. <br><br>"uberlife is also the ideal tool for speakers, brands and bands considering hosting 'tweetups' to bring their fans and followers together at SxSW." <br><br>Additional uberlife features include: <br><br>-- A hangout creates an "umbrella" capturing guestlist, <br>comments, check-ins and photos that act as a beautiful <br>digital memory capture afterwards. <br>-- Users can import their Facebook Likes, connect their Last.fm <br>account and follow interest tags to receive nearby hangout <br>recommendations. <br>-- Users earn a Connector Score when people who meet at their <br>hangout start following each other. Like Klout for real world <br>connectors. <br>-- uberlife members can follow others to receive notifications <br>when they create hangouts nearby and become "friends" only <br>once they've hung out. <br><br>For more information, visit http://uberlife.com. <br>For SxSW hangouts, visit: http://bit.ly/sxsw-hangouts <br><br>Contact: <br><br>Lucy Cullen <br>shout@uberlife.com <br><br><br>SOURCEï¹›uberlife <br><br></p></div>
