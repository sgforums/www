            <div class='col-md body'><p>- iDigi provides industry leading cloud platform for wireless M2M - <br><br>MINNETONKA, Minn., April 28 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Digi International (Nasdaq: DGII) today announced that all Digi and Rabbit embedded products will be configured to easily connect to the iDigi(TM) "cloud" out of the box. Cloud computing is Internet-based computing that allows organizations to increase IT capacity or add capabilities on the fly without investing in new infrastructure, training new personnel or licensing new software. iDigi is the embedded industry's first ready-to-use cloud computing platform for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) network management. It enables secure remote access, control and management of network-connected devices and complete cloud-based application development. Customers can now easily develop cloud-connected devices that create new revenue streams for device manufacturers and their customers such as ongoing service contracts and value-added services. iDigi allows OEMs to deliver a premium product with enhanced customer service and enables device end users to enjoy increased uptime with reduced installation and ongoing maintenance costs. <br><br>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/xprn/sa/200706131247.jpg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/xprn/sa/200706131247.jpg</span></span></a> ) <br><br>"iDigi is the easiest way for device manufacturers to differentiate their products while improving customer service and creating new revenue streams," said Joel Young, CTO and senior vice president of research and development, Digi International. "It enables a variety of new device features like centralized device management and remote configuration right out of the box. It is extremely easy to connect directly to iDigi; no gateway is needed. Only Digi can provide a complete solution - from device to cloud - out of the box." <br><br>iDigi allows manufacturers to configure, upgrade and diagnose problems with their products remotely via the iDigi cloud and provide ongoing performance monitoring. This can reduce warranty repair costs and improve customer satisfaction. It also allows OEMs to deliver products with advanced features such as proactive supply replenishment, remote configuration services and sale of downloadable premium product features. This enables manufacturers to offer a differentiated product and increase revenue. <br><br>iDigi-ready devices reduce costs for end users because ongoing preventative maintenance via the iDigi cloud results in higher reliability and reduced downtime and repair costs. Additionally, no travel is required for device configuration and maintenance. iDigi can also increase an organization's revenue by providing more uptime for sales, new advertising revenue streams and increasing availability of customer product information to drive purchases. <br><br>With more than 70 years of engineering hours invested in its development, iDigi is less than one fifth the cost of a typical licensed software solution. It integrates easily with Digi's comprehensive family of wired, wireless, embedded and non-embedded communication products, and Digi's portfolio of embedded operating environments including, Digi NET+OS 7, Digi Plug-and-Play with Python, Digi Embedded Linux, Digi's BSP for Microsoft Windows Embedded CE 6.0 R3 and Rabbit Dynamic C. <br><br>For more information about iDigi for embedded products, visit http://www.idigi.com . <br><br>About Digi International <br><br>Digi International is making wireless M2M easy by developing reliable products and solutions to connect and securely manage local or remote electronic devices over the network or via the Web.
