              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">SHANGHAI</span>/PRNewswire/ -- GLP, the leading global provider of modern logistics facilities, today announced the establishment of the largest <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span>-focused logistics infrastructure fund, CLF II ("the Fund"). Seven leading global institutions, including some of the world's largest national pension and sovereign wealth funds, are investing alongside GLP to develop modern logistics facilities in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span>. <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$3.7 billion</span> of equity has been committed to the Fund by GLP and investors, with leverage allowing for an investment capacity of <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$7 billion</span> to develop 13 million square meters ("sqm") (140 million square feet ("sq ft")) over four years. GLP China is the manager and holds a 56% stake in CLF II.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span> is GLP's primary market for development with development starts growing at 30% per annum. CLF II is more than double the size of CLF I (<span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$3 billion</span>) given the size of the market opportunity and strong demand from investors. The offering was significantly oversubscribed and provides long-term capital that enables GLP to strengthen its network effect, better serve customers and de-risk its development pipeline. Fees and promotes earned on partners' capital enhance GLP's returns by 400-500 basis points[1].</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Mr. <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Ming Z. Mei</span>, Chief Executive Officer of GLP said, "Building on the strong performance of CLF I, the successful closing of CLF II reflects the confidence of institutional investors in GLP's proven track record as an operator, developer and fund manager. <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span> remains our primary market for development. The fund management platform is an important source of capital for GLP and we remain focused on leveraging it to scale our business effectively while driving higher risk-adjusted returns."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">CLF II will be GLP's exclusive vehicle for new, wholly owned logistics development projects in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span>. The Fund expects to start acquiring land later this year and commence construction of new developments in <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">April 2016</span>. CLF II carries a similar investment mandate as CLF I, GLP's first <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span> development fund which was launched in<span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">November 2013</span> and has reached its investment capacity.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Both CLF I and CLF II seek to capture the significant opportunities arising from the shortage of modern logistics infrastructure in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span>. Demand for modern warehouse facilities is driven by growing domestic consumption, urbanization and the growth in e-commerce. GLP has a strong track record of developing in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span>. Its portfolio has grown at a 61% compound annual growth rate over the last decade, and today encompasses 11.8 million sqm (127 million sq ft) of completed facilities. This transaction will build upon the company's market-leading position, with on-the-ground execution by one of the best teams in the industry.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">With CLF II, GLP's fund management platform expands 36% to <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$27.1 billion</span>. Five of the Fund investors are from<span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia</span>, one from <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">North America</span> and one from the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Middle East</span>. Of the seven, four investors are partners in CLF I and two are new to GLP's fund management platform. GLP's fund management platform is scalable and has grown at an annual rate of 95% since FY12.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">M3 Capital Partners (HK) Limited served as exclusive financial advisor to GLP in connection with the formation of the Fund.</p>
