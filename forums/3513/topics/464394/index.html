              Panasonic Chooses Leading Singapore Consumer Electronics Retailer as a Distributor of its Business-Ruggedized Laptops in the ASEAN Region
              
              Panasonic taps on Newstead Technologies' experience and strong network to reach out to consumers
              
              SINGAPORE, Jan. 11, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading Singapore-based consumer electronics retailer, Newstead Technologies, has been selected by Panasonic Toughbook( http://toughbook.panasonic.com.sg ), an industry leader in rugged, reliable handheld and tablet computers since 1996, as a distributor of its business-ruggedized laptops in the ASEAN region. Newstead Technologies was chosen for its strength and vast experience in the consumer retail market, with a strong network of retail outlets and expertise in marketing of consumer devices.
              
              "We believe this would be a mutually beneficial partnership, which enables both parties to grow our respective brands in the region," said Mindy Tan, Chief Executive Officer of Newstead Technologies.
              
              Panasonic's brand reputation and marketing channels across ASEAN will provide Newstead Technologies with a platform to grow their brand and widen its channel network in the region, especially in major markets like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Concurrently, Newstead's strong local presence and knowledge of the retail industry will help to maximise brand awareness of Panasonic's business-rugged series of computing devices in Singapore -- a regional hub for many businesses in Asia.
              
              Speaking of this partnership, Satoshi Mizobata, Director, Toughbook Asia Pacific Group, said, "We chose Newstead Technologies as a distributor of our business ruggedised laptops in ASEAN because of their strong presence in the Singapore retail market, which provides us with more customer touch points.
              
              "Their vast knowledge of IT-related products will provide value-added services to our partners and customers in the region."
              
              Newstead Technologies manages over 40 retail outlets and concept stores islandwide, including outlets in Singapore's two major IT malls, Sim Lim Square and Funan DigitaLife Mall. While providing a wide range of consumer electronics from an array of global brands, Newstead Technologies also offers related accessories and hardware, making it a complete, one-stop shopping experience for its customers.
              
              Recently, Newstead Technologies was awarded the Singapore Enterprise 50 Award for their contribution to the economic development in Singapore. They were also awarded the Promising SME 500 Award-Top 12 by the Small Medium Business Association, Singapore in 2012.
              
              "We look forward to growing our partnership with Panasonic to enhance their local and regional presence while expanding our reach in the regional consumer market," added Mindy Tan.
