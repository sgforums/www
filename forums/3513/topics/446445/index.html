            <div class='col-md body'><p>BOSTON, Jan. 31, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Attendees at Global AgInvesting(SM) 2012, to be held at the Waldorf=Astoria in New York City, April 23-25, will be privy to an exclusive presentation from world-renowned international investor, author, and financial commentator Jim Rogers, who will be the keynote speaker at this premier agricultural investing conference. <br><br>Global AgInvesting will offer a comprehensive overview of agriculture investment opportunities, risks and return profiles, and strategies for diversified ag portfolios, bringing together more ag investors than any conference in the world. <br><br>Rogers has been a source for investment advice and financial strategy for decades and is frequently featured in The New York Times, Fortune, The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and other prominent news outlets, and also has been a regular commentator and columnist in various media. He will present "How I See the World Today and What I Am Doing About It," on April 24 and remain at the conference that day, providing an unparalleled opportunity for networking with this investment expert. <br><br>"Global AgInvesting draws more senior-level decision makers than any agriculture investment series in the world, providing the perfect audience to receive Rogers' thought and action-provoking messages about the future of agricultural investment," said Greg Mellinger, CEO of HighQuest Partners, host of the event. "Access to the vision from this global investment authority is another way we are providing our partners with the most current, cutting-edge knowledge in the industry and unrivaled networking opportunities in the sector." <br><br>Rogers, who graduated from Yale and Oxford Universities, co-founded his first global-investment partnership, Quantum Fund, in 1973, which was so successful that he was able to retire at age 37. His newest index fund, The Rogers Global Resource Equity Index, focuses on the top companies in agriculture, mining, metals and energy sectors and those in the alternative energy space. <br><br>"The trend of investing in agriculture has already started. I can foresee that more and more farmers will become rich and agricultural commodity prices will continue to rise in the long-term," said Rogers. "I think ag will be a great place for the next 10-20 years. This conference is a reflection of the real money at work in the space, as well as the increased interest from new allocators." <br><br>For more information about Global AgInvesting in N.Y., Singapore and London, visit www.globalaginvesting.com.
