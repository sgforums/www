              <p>FREMONT, Calif. and MELBOURNE, Australia, Feb. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Velos, Inc., the trusted leader in clinical research management software, is pleased to announce its largest international multi-site deployment of Velos eResearch through a partnership with Cancer Trials Australia (CTA). Currently, eight sites are operating on the Velos platform, and the results thus far have been extremely positive. These sites include the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Austin Health, and the Royal Melbourne Hospital. <br><br>"It has met our expectations in what we see as a complex logistics environment," said Marcus Clark, CEO of CTA. By the end of first quarter 2012, fourteen oncology clinical trial centers in the states of Victoria and New South Wales are scheduled to use Velos eResearch to provide integrated administrative management of their trial portfolios. <br><br>CTA is a non-profit, member-driven organization that works on behalf of both public and private hospitals to perform research governance, administration, and financial services, allowing the staff at these oncology trial centers to focus on patient care. In 2009, CTA and six of its members investigated a more efficient way to track and manage research information. CTA sites had been operating on a variety of decentralized processes that stifled the flow of timely information, which resulted in insufficient data analysis and impinged on resource priorities. CTA examined a number of different software products and encouraged users, such as research nurse managers, to engage in the selection of the product that would work best for them. "CTA members wanted a thoroughly proven product," recalled Mr. Clark. <br><br>CTA engaged Velos and both organizations worked with the research nurses to evaluate the product. "We believed that Velos eResearch's adaptability, as well as its advanced research administration and financial capabilities, would provide CTA and its sites with the perfect solution," explained Kamar Aulakh, Velos Chief Operating Officer. "Velos is excited to bring its innovative technology and clinical research expertise to Australia, and it looks forward to a successful partnership with CTA." <br><br>After examining a number of different systems, CTA selected Velos eResearch. "As the application has been implemented across CTA sites, the results have been meeting our milestones, especially with the collection of patient visit data and streamlining of financial data flow. We are able to leverage the Velos eResearch platform to provide consolidated information across our sites, including visit monitoring, financial tracking, sponsor billing, budgeting, and customized reporting. CTA initiates over forty commercial studies at multiple sites every year, so it's important to invoice accurately and promptly. With Velos eResearch, we can achieve this position consistently, preventing build-up of data for invoicing," commented Mr. Clark. <br><br>About Cancer Trials Australia: <br><br>CTA is a Melbourne-based not-for-profit service organization that conducts cancer clinical trials on behalf of investigators and sponsors, namely biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. As a member-based organization comprised of sixteen research institutes and hospitals, CTA has access to a diverse range of expertise and technology. <br><br>About Velos: <br><br>Velos is the trusted clinical trial management resource for investigators, sponsors, and academic leaders throughout the world. Velos eResearch is deployed for clinical research in all parts of the healthcare enterprise and supports a broad diversity of clinical departments and functional needs. Velos integrates the clinical, administrative, and financial information needs of research management, with an emphasis on flexibility, workflow, and empowering clinical innovation. Founded in 1996, Velos, Inc. is privately held with headquarters in Fremont, California. <br><br>*This press release may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. <br><br><br>SOURCEï¹›Velos, Inc. <br></p>
