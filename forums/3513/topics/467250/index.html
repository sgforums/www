              GuideMeSingapore.com Report Identifies Top Reasons Why Singapore is Becoming the Preferred Gateway to Asia
                  
                  Singapore's leading business information portal has released a comprehensive study exploring reasons behind the increase in the number of foreign companies relocating to Singapore.
                  
                  SINGAPORE, March 18, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Singapore's premier business information portal, GuideMeSingapore.com, has published a new research paper outlining the driving factors that attract foreign companies to Singapore( http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/why-foreign-companies-relocate-to-singapore ) to headquarter their Asian operations.
                  
                  The paper identifies a number of factors that attract foreign firms to use Singapore as a gateway for entering into Asia. These include the country's favourable tax regime, its extensive network of double-tax treaties, its trusted legal system, excellent intellectual property regime, large pool of talented multilingual workforce, and the country's uniquely strategic location. Singapore has consistently topped the World Bank's rankings as the World's Easiest Place to Do Business. Singapore's advanced infrastructure, education system and high quality of life, are also compelling factors for attracting ambitious families from all over the world.
                  
                  "We see an increase in the number of foreign companies anxious to move into the developing markets of India and the Southeast Asian countries. In most cases, Singapore is their preferred option for regional headquarters," said Ms. Jacqueline Low, Chief Operating Officer of Janus Corporate Solutions, a leading Singapore incorporation services firm( http://www.guidemesingapore.com ) and the parent company of GuideMeSingapore.com. "The country has advanced at a rapid pace over the years. In addition to its attractive location within Asia, Singapore also owes its appeal to the successful integration of its business-friendly policies with a family-friendly environment."
                  
                  "Singapore allows 100% foreign ownership in most sectors of the economy; therefore a foreign company may establish a limited liability company also known as a Subsidiary Company( http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-subsidiary-registration-guide ) in Singapore and retain 100% of the shareholding. Such local subsidiary companies are entitled to most of the tax concessions and privileges that are available to a local company. Foreign companies can also establish Branch Offices( http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-branch-office-registration-guide ) andRepresentative Offices( http://www.guidemesingapore.com/incorporation/foreign-company/singapore-representative-office-registration-guide ) depending upon what suits them better for their expansion plans," concluded Ms. Low.
