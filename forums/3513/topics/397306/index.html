            <div class='col-md body'><p>HONG KONG, April 22 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Famous Bollywood actor, film producer and television host, the multi-talented Shahrukh Khan, or rather his wax likeness, is making a special appearance at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong, while Khan himself is on location in India filming his latest movie RA One. <br><br>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/04/22/20100422356332.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/04/22/20100422356332.html</span></span></a> ) <br>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/04/22/20100422879860.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/04/22/20100422879860.html</span></span></a> ) <br><br>Local actor Gill Mohinderpaul Singh and his family were one of the first visitors to get up close and personal with the actor's favourite Bollywood star. Gill commented that he was excited to meet the celebrity's wax figure face-to-face and was amazed with the likeness of the figure. Gill also expressed that Khan was his role model and is the inspiration for his acting career. <br><br>On loan for three months from London, Shahrukh Khan will take his place at the attraction alongside other movie stars and film producers such as Jackie Chan, Harrison Ford and Johnny Depp. <br><br>Bret Pidgeon, General Manager of Madame Tussauds Hong Kong and Shanghai said, "Madame Tussauds Hong Kong has been receiving many more tourists from India in the last two years. While these guests enjoy meeting our unique collection of over 100 international celebrities and world leaders, we are delighted to have Khan join our attraction. We will continue to look for other opportunities in bringing celebrities from other backgrounds to enhance the experience at the attraction for our international guests." <br><br>"Following the success of displaying Amitabh Bachchan's wax figure at the attraction last year, we anticipate that Khan will be as popular with the Indian community in Hong Kong and guests visiting from abroad." <br><br>Khan made his acting debut in 1988 in the television series, Fauji and later made his film debut in Deewana in 1992. Since then, he has been part of numerous commercially successful films such as Baazigar, Dil To Pagal Hai, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Devdas and Chak de India, led him to earn critical acclaim for many of his performances. In his career of over 20 years, Khan has won thirteen Filmfare Awards for his work in Indian films, seven of which were in the Best Actor category. <br><br>Shahrukh Khan's wax figure will be on display at the World Premiere section at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong until July 21, 2010. <br><br>Madame Tussauds Hong Kong welcomes guests from 10am to 10pm daily.
