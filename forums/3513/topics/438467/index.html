              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia, Sept. 22, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ --The Terengganu State Government in Malaysia is embracing the country's drive towards a sustainable environment by launching the inaugural <strong>2011 Eco Terengganu Conference</strong> to debate the issues and development plans for a more sustainable nation, in particular Terengganu. The event will be staged alongside one of the country's biggest sporting occasions, the Monsoon Cup, which itself has strong ecological and commercial links to the State. </p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/09/22/20110922143946797556-org.jpg" alt="Shafique Iqbal, Operations Mgr Monsoon Cup and Yasmin Ras, founder of EcoKnights with YB Dato' Toh Chin Yaw" width="1157" height="768"></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The four key pillars of the Malaysian government's Green Technology policy - energy, environmental, social and economic sustainability - is the inspiration behind Eco Terengganu's three conference themes -- Business, Environment and Social. The sustainability conference aims to increase the awareness of environmental issues and educate the public and relevant state and private agencies on the gaps, opportunities and challenges in developing a sustainable state. The conference will also highlight renewable energy and green technology options that need to be urgently pursued to achieve sustainable development.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Spearheaded by EcoKnights and T-Best Events with the support of the Terengganu State Government and 1Malaysia PROGRES (Program Green Solutions), the conference will be staged on the 23rd and 24th November 2011 at the Ri-Yaz Heritage Marina Resort and Spa in Terengganu, Malaysia.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The main focus of this year's conference is to alert all relevant stakeholders on the situation of the current environment and the various initiatives and technology available that can be optimised for local businesses and enterprises to grow towards balancing the economy, the environment and the people.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">YB Dato' Toh Chin Yaw, Terengganu Chairman of Industry, Trade and Environment Committee said, "<em>Terengganu provides the perfect backdrop for an amazing programme that will examine the best green practices that support local businesses to operate in a sustainable environment. Eco Terengganu 2011 is important because it will showcase green innovations, community programmes and research that can benefit the lives and livelihoods of people nationwide and in particular Terengganu</em>." </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Each theme will be presented by notable speakers. The Business Case will demonstrate green business tools, opportunities and technology that will enhance the economic future of Terengganu without further stress on its natural resources. The Environment Case will inculcate awareness of environmental degradation, deficient sanitation services and poor urban conditions to encourage the proper planning and management of its natural resources for the future of sustainable development.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"<em>Corporations with</em> <em>green technology, solutions or initiatives can get involved in Eco Terengganu in various ways. This is a great opportunity for them to exhibit and promote their products, services or expertise</em>," added YB Dato' Toh. Support for Eco Terengganu can be made via monetary or product contributions.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Dato' Seri Dr. Izmee Che Ismail, Group President of Avenion Group of Companies and head of 1Malaysia PROGRES said that "<em>In line with the Malaysian government's commitment to ensuring sustainable development and conserving the environment for future generations, steps must be taken now to ensure the safeguarding of the environment of Terengganu. This conference is unique and a good first step for states to adopt and practice sustainable living. I am happy to be involved with Eco Terengganu 2011 and congratulate Terengganu for their efforts in creating awareness and promoting a green agenda</em>."</p>
