              <p>PRNewswire-Asia/ -- The largest Asian independent public relations network, Strategic Public Relations Group ("SPRG" or the "Group"), is pleased to receive two grand awards at the Agency of the Year 2011 gala presented by Marketing magazine, highlighting its excellence and professionalism in providing PR services to clients.</p>

              <p>Local Hero - PR Agency of the Year in Hong Kong</p>
              <p>Adding yet another award in its trophy case, SPRG was named "Local Hero æ¯� Public Relations Agency of the Year" in Hong Kong. The distinctive cube trophy attests to the Group's firm position in the PR industry, being the largest public relations consultancy in Hong Kong. SPRG has managed many first IPO communications campaigns in recent years, including the listings of companies from Russia, Mongolia, Brazil and Canada. Growing from its financial roots, the Group has expanded its clientele by tapping into consumer PR, event marketing, and brand marketing and communications, resulting in a solid yet diverse portfolio.</p>
              <p>Best PR Campaign - Media Relations</p>
              <p>The communications programme SPRG developed for United Company RUSAL Plc. (HKEx: 486) was also named "Best PR Campaign - Media Relations" under the MARKies awards, a new award launched by Marketing magazine this year. SPRG executed the PR communications programme for the very first Russian enterprise to list in Hong Kong, and in the process brought the best of Russia to Greater China. With the communications programme reaching out to a wide audience, the Russian listing has become a case study used by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited to promote Hong Kong as a leading global fundraising platform.</p>
              <p>SPRG has already been bestowed with numerous distinctions over the past few years. Chairman and Managing Director of SPRG, Richard Tsang, remarked, "The last eight months have been phenomenal for the Group. We are very proud to be named 'Local Hero - PR Agency of the Year 2011 in Hong Kong' by Marketing magazine, repeating our success in 2010. We have also been named 'Financial Consultancy of the Year' in 2011 by The Holmes Report and were crowned 'Asia Pacific Network of the Year' by Campaign Asia-Pacific PR Awards 2010. All of these accolades underscore SPRG's success in Hong Kong and Asia. The awards are also an acknowledgement of our professionalism in delivering diverse services to our clients. We will continue to expand beyond our home base across the Asia Pacific region, maintain growth momentum and build on our achievements as we uphold our commitment to being the preferred PR partner of our clients."</p>
