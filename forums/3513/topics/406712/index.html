              <p>ARTSingapore 2010 to Feature Award-Winning Multimedia Artist Tan Kai Syng in ARTSingapore's SONY New Media Space</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>2010-07-28 09:00</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, July 28 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Asia's longest running contemporary art fair will feature its first ever New Media Installation[1] this October at SUNTEC Singapore as part of its 10th year celebrations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Titled A Rough Guide To (The Meaning Of A) Life 3.0: Moving Images and Meeting Kaidie (A)Live in Singapore!, the multimedia presentation will feature artist Tan Kai Syng's online alter-ego Kaidie in her epic quest to find the meaning of life. The installation will include a short film as well as "live" sessions which will allow visitors to interact with Kaidie in Nondon via web-chat. Prior to this special upcoming appearance, Kaidie has also made appearances as a 3rd-Lifer-In-Residency in Villa Straeuli, Winterthur, Switzerland and at the Slade Centre of Research in London (http://3rdlifekaidie.com/2010/06/phd-show-5/ ).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Born in Singapore, Kai Syng has won many awards and grants throughout her career: at age 18, she was named "The Most Promising Young Artist" at the UOB Painting of the Year; and in 1998, the San Francisco International Film Festival Golden Gates Award New Visions Video Merit Award. Her work has been exhibited in more than 40 cities such as the Guangzhou Triennale 2009, Asia Art Biennale 2009 and ICA London 2005. Currently a scholarship MPhil/PhD student in Fine Media Art at the prestigious Slade School of Fine Art in London, the artist has also worked as an art educator and consultant to numerous digital art projects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kai Syng currently has a permanent video installation, The Amazing Neverending Underwater Adventures at the Bras Basah MRT station on the Circle Line in Singapore. Commissioned by the Land Transport Authority, this is the only station with a video artwork. (Mayo Martin of the Today newspaper named this his favourite artwork of the Circle Line.) [2]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fair Director of ARTSingapore 2010, Chen Shen Po, said, "This is the first time that ARTSingapore will be featuring a New Media exhibit by a Singapore artist. Artworks utilising multimedia technologies which engage multiple senses have been gaining in momentum in the art world, and Kai Syng's installation will give visitors to ARTSingapore an introduction to this growing medium. We are also very happy that SONY Singapore has agreed to be our sponsor for this very special exhibit."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sponsored by SONY Singapore, the New Media installation will utilise a combination of projectors, speakers, TV monitors and an internet collection. The advanced monitors and projectors used will produce vibrant images to bring to life the colourful images of Kaidie. Limited editions of the artist's photography will also be on sale at the fair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since its inception in 2000, ARTSingapore has regularly introduced exciting new features to its fair. Last year's edition saw the introduction of the Asian International Photography Fair -- the region's only international platform for contemporary photography -- as well as NEW FINDS dedicated to emerging artists and galleries from the region. Previous years also saw Special Collectors' Showcases featuring artworks from the personal collections of the region's most prolific collectors. Exciting fringe activities bringing art to the public have included established artists producing works on the dance floor of the then Ministry of Sound in 2007.</p>
