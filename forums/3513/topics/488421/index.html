              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">MANILA, Philippines </span> /PRNewswire/ -- PepsiCo, Inc., one of the world's largest food and beverage companies, and Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines Inc. (PCPPI) the company's beverage bottling partner in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the Philippines</span>, today announced an agreement for PCPPI to also manufacture one of PepsiCo' s world-famous snacks brands locally in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the Philippines</span>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Under the terms of the agreement, PCPPI will manufacture and distribute a range of PepsiCo's popular Cheetos® snack products and flavors to <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the Philippines'</span> 100 million consumers.  PCPPI is expected to commence manufacturing later this year. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The creation of the joint snacks-and-beverage franchise operations in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the Philippines</span> reflects PepsiCo's ongoing drive to ensure the integration of its food and beverage portfolio across multiple platforms, including manufacturing and go-to-market execution. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"<span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The Philippines</span> is a highly attractive market where both PepsiCo and its partners have a long track record of success with our beverages and foods brands," said <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Maricelle Narciso</span>, General Manager, PepsiCo Philippines. "The establishment of a snacks franchise operation reflects our commitment to bring more locally-made products to our consumers and customers, and to drive synergies in the manufacturing and distribution of our delicious food and beverage products wherever possible." </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"This development presents an exciting opportunity for PCPPI to further its vision of becoming a premier food and beverage company in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the Philippines</span>," said <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Furqan Ahmed Syed</span>, President of PCPPI. "Leveraging PepsiCo's established line of snacks is an exciting and strategic step in our first foray into the foods business."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The first Pepsi plant was established in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the Philippines</span> in 1946. PCPPI, which has been PepsiCo's beverage partner since 1989, now has 12 plants across the country, manufacturing and distributing a range of leading PepsiCo beverages including Pepsi-Cola®, Tropicana® juice drinks, Gatorade®, and Mountain Dew®. PepsiCo's oats brand, Quaker®, is also a market leader in the Philippines. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The agreement also marks another milestone in PepsiCo's longstanding business relationship with the LOTTE group, a multinational food and retail conglomerate based in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">South Korea</span> that is PCPPI's largest shareholder. PepsiCo has worked closely with LOTTE in Korea since 1976 and in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the Philippines</span> since 2010. The LOTTE group is also PepsiCo's beverage partner in Myanmar. </p>
