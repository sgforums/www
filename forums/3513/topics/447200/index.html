            <div class='col-md body'><p>Acision wins Acision Broadband Messaging Service Centre contract with Tier 1 operator <br><br>READING, England, Feb. 13, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Acision, the global leader in mobile messaging, today announced the availability of its complete Rich Communication Suite-enhanced (RCS-e) implementation on its latest version of Acision Broadband Messaging Service Centre (BMSC). As a single integrated IP communications solution, the Acision BMSC builds on the company's expertise in SMS and IP messaging and enables mobile operators to differentiate through rich, IP based messaging services which provide seamless interaction across messaging platforms and existing global mobile and internet communities. Acision has also contracted a commercial deployment of its RCS-e solution with a major mobile operator, serving over 50 million subscribers <br><br>Marco Wanders, EVP Product Division, at Acision, commented: "The take-up of over-the-top (OTT) services, alongside consumers' demand for an increasingly enhanced communications experience, have drastically changed the mobile messaging landscape. Mobile operators are well positioned to harness consumer requirements and increase their relevance by introducing rich communication services with the same Quality of Experience (QoE), reach and reliability that users have become accustomed to with SMS, while leveraging the capabilities of their broadband IP networks. The RCS-e initiative, endorsed by the mobile industry and designed to deliver a more personalised and relevant communications experience, offers subscribers greater service capability, discovery (including status and location), as well as enhanced voice and messaging services." <br><br>Acision's end-to-end RCS-e solution includes a basic IMS core, RCS-e application server and RCS-e clients, and provides seamless messaging through interconnect of RCS-e with the global SMS community and social network chat services such as Facebook Messenger and Google Talk. The solution will enable operators to support the core services of the RCS-e initiative, including instant messaging, group chat, file transfer and video sharing, as well as a store and forward functionality in the event that the destination device is off-line. It extends the existing SMS user experience to RCS-e, while reducing CAPEX requirements by re-using existing messaging investments and monetising these assets. <br><br>"Faced with an increasingly competitive market landscape, RCS-e will enable operators to innovate their services portfolio with IP-based messaging services with the reach of SMS, and keep pace with the evolution of both the industry and individual subscribers' demands. Consumers, meanwhile, will benefit from a wealth of new messaging capabilities and the ability to customise their communications experience through the creation of their own personal community through which they can interact with each member in real-time," continued Wanders. <br><br>Jorgen Nilsson, Chief Executive at Acision, said: "As the global market leader in SMS, our heritage lies in the delivery and support of carrier grade messaging infrastructure. The Acision BMSC represents a core part of our messaging portfolio and complements the industry's migration towards all-IP communications, providing operators with a unique service proposition to consumers which includes the best in SMS and IP. With our solution, operators will be able to seamlessly deploy richer, value-added communications capabilities and interaction with the global mobile community of 5 billion users from day one of RCS-e introduction." <br><br>To find out more about Acision BMSC and its RCS-e capability, please visit Acision on stand A93 in Hall 8 or visit the GSMA's RCS Showcase on stand C118 in Hall 8. <br><br>NOTES TO EDITORS <br><br>About Acision <br><br>As the pioneer of mobile messaging, Acision enables customers worldwide to drive new revenues with innovative services while monetising traffic.For more information, visit Acision at http://www.acision.com <br><br><br>SOURCEï¹›Acision UK Ltd <br><br></p></div>
