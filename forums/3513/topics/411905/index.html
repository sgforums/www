              <ul>
              <li>Practical do's and don'ts for localising corporate affairs strategies in Asia Pacific; </li>
              <li>Understanding the nuances of developing corporate public affairs and government relations programmes; </li>
              <li>Greater understanding about the development, scope and impact of coalition groups in Asia Pacific; </li>
              <li>Mid-term analysis on the development of ASEAN+ and its likely impact on the corporate affairs practice in the region; </li>
              <li>Insight into practical ways to defend and develop corporate reputation across diverse developing markets; and </li>
              <li>Greater understanding of the impact of corruption and the approaches in place to remove the problem. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>PublicAffairsAsia restricts numbers at its events and conferences to ensure interactivity and exclusivity.  PAA is offering offer partner rates (AmCham, EuroCham, Business Software Alliance, Weber Shandwick and IMA) from just US$1200 and full delegate rates from US$1600 for this full-day, executive level conference.
