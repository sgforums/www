              Konica Minolta's New Bizhub C554/C454/C364/C284/C224 Series Offers Users Simple and Efficient Business Solutions with Intelligence at Their Fingertips
              
              State-of-the-art features dramatically increase work efficiency and reduce cost
              
              SINGAPORE, Nov. 9, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Optimal office efficiency can now be achieved with a simple touch of the fingertip with Konica Minolta's new bizhub C554/C454/C364/C284/C224 series. Engineered with the latest Japanese technology, but designed intuitively, the Multi-Function Printers (MFPs) provides surprisingly simple and uncompromisingly efficient solutions to today's office requirements. They are built to be easy for everyone in the office to operate and comprise features that enable today's office workers to do much more in less time.
              
              "Intelligence at Your Fingertips" - Print Mobility and Ease of Operation
              In addition to being an all-in-one system that prints, copies, faxes and scans, the series of MFPs features Konica Minolta INFO-Palette design - a 9" electrostatic screen interface that provides users with the "flick &amp; drag" operation, which is common in today's mobile devices. The feature, coupled with a large screen, allows users to control and operate the MFPs with simple touches and flicks of the fingertip.
              
              Recognising the proliferation of smart mobile devices today, the new bizhub series connects with PageScope Mobile, an application that allows the MFPs to sync with iPhones, iPads and other smart mobile devices. Users are thus able to print documents or pictures from their mobile devices by simply connecting to the MFPs by wireless connection.
              
              Increased Work Efficiency
              
              Work efficiency is greatly enhanced with the bizhub series' high-speed duplex printing feature that has the capability to produce colour print at a rate of up to 55ppm (pages per minute). In addition, the MFPs feature duplex scanning, and scanned paper documents can be easily converted to PowerPoint format by adding text information through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing, together with diagrams and images. The capability to scan documents and convert them to PowerPoint format can be widely used for creating presentation documents, especially for documents that are only available in hardcopies, thus saving both time and energy.
              
              Proactive Cost Savings
              
              As offices around the world grapple with the issue of increasing cost, the new bizhub series makes it easy for both management and staff to take the proactive stance to save cost through the control of the usage of paper and power.
              
              Firstly, default duplex printing can be set to encourage paper-saving. Secondly, to reduce misprints, the new bizhub series employs a printer driver that offers a precise preview function. The Print Preview function displays a faithful image of the printed material on the computer screen before printing. With print preview, text placements, and hole punch and staple positions on the paper can be confirmed without test prints. Furthermore, warning functions for pages with deleted or overflowed text, and blank pages, along with a function to select pages that do not need to be printed are available to substantially reduce paper waste. There is also a print savings meter that displays the approximate ratio of reduced paper in order to measure job efficiency and Total Cost of Operations (TCO) reductions to easily realise eco-consciousness.
              
              Additionally, the bizhub series allows users to monitor the savings of toner and paper through an Eco Indicator so that users can confirm their savings on three different levels - the entire device, department and individual user. Furthermore, cumulative power usage can also be monitored.
              
              Environmentally-friendly Features
              
              In line with Konica Minolta's commitment to environmental causes, plant-based resources and recycled materials are used in the fabrication of the MFPs' units. Through the use of an advanced chemical processing technology, the construction of the bizhub units utilises two environmentally-friendly plastics - Konica Minolta's proprietary-developed recycled PC/PET and plant-based bioplastic.
              
              In addition, state-of-the-art energy-saving technologies such as the Konica Minolta-developed Induction Heating (IH) low temperature fixing system and LEDs for the scanner's light reduce power consumption. The usage of the company's next-generation Simitri toner also means that toner consumption can be reduced by 30%.
              
              Apart from the revolutionary features that enhance work efficiency and reduce environmental impact, the bizhub series is also designed to protect document confidentiality through the prevention of unwarranted re-printing and copying. The series of MFPs gives customers the option to install Copy Security software, which prevents unauthorized printing by adding an embedded copy protection code and faint security pattern on copies, and through the usage of a password.
              
              To contribute to a stress-free and conducive office environment, revisions have been made to various structures within the MFPs and improvements to individual parts to drastically reduced fan, paper feeding and finisher noise. Through comprehensive research, noises that bring discomfort to people have been identified and eliminated one by one to achieve a high level of quietness.
              
              Combining innovative functionality and smart features, Konica Minolta's new bizhub series is ideal for businesses that require fast, high-quality output and secured printing options. Coupled with excellent after-sales services from Konica Minolta, customers can count on the company to deliver reliable, fast and secured printing solutions that optimise print and document workflow efficiency.
