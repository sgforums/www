              The Executive Centre Opens New Centre in Singapore at Six Battery Road
              
              SINGAPORE, March 6, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The Executive Centre( http://www.executivecentre.com ), Asia Pacific's leading premium serviced office provider, is pleased to announce the opening of its new centre on Level 42, 6 Battery Road in Raffles Place, Singapore. The stellar centre is a deserving addition to The Executive Centre's extensive network in 18 cities across 10 countries.
              
              The Executive Centre - renowned for its premium fit-outs, client-oriented services and state-of-the-art infrastructure - has operated in Singapore for more than a decade.
              
              Sitting atop the uppermost level of the prestigious Six Battery Road, the penthouse office enjoys unrivalled views of Singapore skyline and Marina Bay. Strategically located at the financial hub of Raffles Place with direct covered access to Raffles Place MRT station, the 42-storey Grade 'A' office building has recently undergone a S$92 million enhancement, and offers F&amp;B outlets and various sustainable environmental features including the iconic "Rainforest Rhapsody" vertical gardens on the ground floor.
              
              Inheriting The Executive Centre's tradition of providing premium and professional working environment, the opulent office space is graced with state-of-the-art technology and refined office fit-outs. Professional and dedicated on-site management teams are ready to offer immediate assistance to meet clients' workplace needs. The open-plan offices can be malleably adjusted to maximise versatility for businesses in different sizes and scales. The centre also provides virtual offices, meeting rooms, video conferencing facilities and a wide range of business concierge services.
              
              According to the recent market report released by Colliers International, the office space demand in Singapore remains strong and healthy. The average occupancy rate of Grade A offices in the Central Business District further strengthened by one-percentage point from 93.1 per cent in 3Q 2012 to 94.1 per cent in 4Q 2012 - the highest level in almost two years.
              
              "Singapore has seen a recovery from its overcast last year with 3.3 per cent annual GPD growth thanks to the invigorating measures implemented by the Singapore government to expedite economic growth. We are assertive that our new centre will be an opportunity for us to benefit from the rebound and respond to the robust market demand for office space," commented Yvonne Lim, Regional Head - Singapore, Brisbane and Perth of The Executive Centre.
