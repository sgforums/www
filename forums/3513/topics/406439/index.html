The Gold Standard Award for Excellence in Diplomatic Engagement will identify achievement by an ambassador or embassy in their work with business, governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). <br><br>The award, which will formally be launched on August 2, is open to ambassadors and embassies operating in Asia as well as to ambassadors and embassies from countries in Asia operating globally. <br><br>Nominations are sought from businesses, parent foreign ministries and directly from the ambassadors and embassies themselves and will be judged by a senior panel of leaders from business, the political arena and the professional public affairs industry. The award is a centerpiece of The Gold Standard Awards, which is the only program celebrating excellence in engagement amongst business, government and NGOs in Asia. <br><br>Commenting on the award, PublicAffairsAsiaï¼Šs vice-president, Mark Oï¼ŠBrien, said: "Diplomatic Missions -- ambassadors and embassies -- play a frontline role in furthering bilateral relations between countries and supporting increased investment into the markets in which they work. This award will recognize the work of the ambassadors and embassies in this regard, enhancing engagement and fostering increased cross border trade." <br><br>News Corporationï¼Šs Senior Vice President of Government Relations (Asia) Joe Welch said: "News Corporation respects the role ambassadors and embassies play globally and in Asia. This award will recognize the highly skilled commercial and public affairs work they do, often as catalysts, connecting stakeholders and setting events in motion that lead to new opportunities and significant economic expansion. We are pleased to support this new and important Gold Standard Award." <br><br>Nominations for the 2010 Gold Standard Awards open on September 1 and close on October 15, 2010.
