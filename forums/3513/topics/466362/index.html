              Acision Hosts RCS in the Cloud, Enabling Operators to Introduce Rich Messaging Services Without Deploying an IMS Core 
              
              READING, England, Feb. 26, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --
              
              Acision, the global leader in mobile messaging, today announced the availability of its leading Rich Communication Suite (RCS) services, as a hosted solution from the Acision Cloud environment. First launched in October 2011, the Acision Cloud model enables mobile operators to quickly and cost effectively respond to rapidly changing technology developments and end user preferences, by having the ability to access and offer customers new rich services while maximising their revenue-generating potential. By delivering RCS from the cloud, Acision is enabling operators to launch Rich Messaging quickly and with limited up-front cost, without the need to deploy an IMS Core. Since the beginning of 2012, RCS has been offered as a key service on Acision's consolidated messaging platform, Acision Broadband Messaging Service Centre (BMSC).
              
              In today's IP-centric world, where time to market and enriching user experience is everything, mobile operators around the globe are investing in rich and superior services to enhance the user experience, based on platforms such as IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) - which can be a costly and complex infrastructure implementation. By offering mobile operators easy access to Acision's hosted RCS solution, operators can bring richer services to market faster with easy connectivity, flexibility and delivery models, including:
              
              RCS5, including SMS and MMS interworking
              Social Networks integration
              Triggering for consumer services
              Open APIs for enterprise content and services
              All this is the basis for new revenue streams through new value added consumer services and enterprise applications.
              
              "Acision offers a high level of flexibility in its delivery options and business models for RCS. For operators that require in-network delivery, we can deploy our hardware independent RCS solution either on their dedicated hardware or in the operator's private cloud environment. For operators that are looking to minimise time to market and investments, and launch RCS without having to deploy an IMS Core, we can deliver RCS as a service from the Acision cloud environment. A quick, easy and cost effective option to RCS delivery without the added complexity of IMS," said Jorgen Nilsson, Chief Executive Officer at Acision. "By virtualising our solutions operators can access and deploy the latest rich services, and scale these easily without the hefty costs traditionally associated with deployment, which also enables greater economies of scale across operator groups and alliances. RCS from the cloud enhances our proposition to rapidly deliver IP-based, rich messaging services in 2013, and builds on our 20 years of messaging expertise in evolving the  messaging ecosystem."
              
              Now available in Acision's cloud or as a virtualised offering, mobile operators can access Acision's RCS solutions from virtually any location in the world. Acision's data centres will deliver scalable, reliable connectivity to multiple domestic and international sites underpinned by fibre backbone networks and undersea cabling. This will ensure that operators can take advantage of easily monetised rich messaging services with cost effective expenditure and investment in bandwidth costs. Furthermore, the data centres will be backed up by 24/7 support, complimented with Acision's complete KPI and service intelligence reporting, to test and gauge usage results of the services delivered in the cloud.
