              <p> </p>
              <p>HONG KONG, Sept. 28 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Trade bodies, national pavillions and exhibitors at the 2010 Shanghai Expo are being invited to take part in the 2010 PublicAffairsAsia Gold Standard Award for Country and Trade Promotion.</p>
              <p>The scope of the award, operated by PublicAffairsAsia and sponsored by UPS, has been extended this year to include exhibitors operating at the Shanghai Expo in addition to the variety of national and regional bodies, chambers of commerce and other government agencies involved in global trade promotion related to Asia Pacific.</p>
              <p>The award will honour excellence by a body or agency in promoting their national or regional economic interests and entries from those involved at the 2010 Shanghai Expo are being actively welcomed this year. The accolade was secured in 2009 by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise for their campaign "New Zealand Unlimited" to raise New Zealand's profile in South Korea among business leaders, government and the media. The award is judged by a panel of over 40 senior figures from corporations, consultancies, governmental bodies, NGOs and the media and is a key recognition of the increasing importance of promotional initiatives to country, regional and global trade, tourism and cultural exchange.</p>
              <p>Commenting on the award, and the partnership with UPS, PublicAffairsAsia's vice-president, Mark O'Brien, said: "Many countries are actively involved in promoting themselves as places to trade with and to invest in -- citing technology, infrastructure, the labour force and their business-friendly policies. The Shanghai Expo is a great example of the enormous talent and energy that countries are investing in promoting themselves at a time when the competition has never been greater. We are delighted that UPS has come on board to sponsor this category and we look forward to receiving nominations from Expo pavillions and exhibitors in addition to country and trade promotion groups operating in Asia Pacific or promoting the region globally."</p>
              <p>The nominations process for the Gold Standard Award in Country and Trade Promotion runs until October 15, 2010 -- with pre-confirmed late entries accepted from Shanghai Expo exhibitors until October 22, 2010.
