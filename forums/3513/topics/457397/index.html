With traction already established in China's biggest cities, RS Components is expanding its footprint by heading west, and the Chengdu Electronics Fair on 16 August is one of the key platforms for the company to engage customers in that region. <br><br>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/05/04/20110504368830.jpg">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/05/04/20110504368830.jpg</a> ) <br><br>"We are beginning to see more customer demands in the western areas of China. China's growth is no longer limited to the big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. With more and more companies relocating their production bases into the inland provinces, we foresee an exciting avenue for growth and demand for our products in the cities in those areas," said Clement Zheng, China Country Manager for RS Components. <br><br>RS Components' extension into second and third tier cities comes at a time when recent social and economic reforms have transformed the manufacturing, commercial, and regulatory landscapes of China's developing regions. According to a 2012 Economic Intelligence Unit report, western provinces outperformed the rest of the country in 2011 as aggregate GDP growth reached 14.1%, compared with the average on the eastern seaboard of 10.5% (Note 1). Central provinces have also benefited from large infrastructure investments and favourable policies aimed at attracting businesses. <br><br>Against this backdrop, RS Components will be showcasing its wide range of electronics, maintenance and automation and control products at the Chengdu Electronics Fair from 16-18 August 2012. The company will also take the opportunity to introduce its award-winning eCommerce website that enables customers to search and browse over 550,000 products online. <br><br>Visitors to the RS Components booth will be able to test-drive DesignSpark PCB, the company's free professional standard PCB design software. On-site live demonstrations of Raspberry Pi, a credit card sized computer board that has seen high levels of demand, will also be held at regular intervals. As an added bonus, visitors that register their details at the RS Components booth stand to win an iPad. <br><br>"RS Components grew 9% in Asia in the last financial year (Note 2), and China has been a key driver of this growth. As such we are constantly finding ways to help manufacturing communities all across China to gain access to the latest technologies and products faster. We look forward to meeting new customers in Chengdu and sharing how RS Components can help raise the quality of their work through initiatives such as our next-day delivery to 200 Chinese cities and 135,000 locally stocked products, along with our technical support and quality assurance," added Zheng. <br><br>Notes: <br><br>1.
