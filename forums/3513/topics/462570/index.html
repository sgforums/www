              Readers of the Financial Times and Investors Chronicle name OANDA as "Best Forex Provider" in annual questionnaire
              
              SINGAPORE, Dec. 7, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- OANDA, a global provider of innovative foreign exchange trading services, has been named the "Best Forex Provider" by readers of the Financial Times and Investors Chronicle at the prestigious Investors Chronicle Investment Awards.
              
              The award recognizes OANDA as one of the industry's best forex brokers, providing an innovative forex trading platform and comprehensive trade decision support tools designed to help investors make informed trading decisions.
              
              "As the world's largest, most liquid market, forex offers interesting opportunities for retail investors. We are proud to win this award as it demonstrates that traders trust OANDA -- they appreciate our continuous efforts to support clients and provide innovative tools that help them become more informed traders," said K Duker, CEO of OANDA.
              
              Duker added, "This caps an award-winning year for OANDA. In addition to being recognized by the Financial Times and Investors Chronicle, we were honored recently at the Forex Magnates Summit with the Forex Magnates Award for 'Best Forex Broker'. Likewise, we received two awards from Investment Trends as investors in Singapore rated OANDA as the No. 1 forex broker for the third year running for 'Highest Overall Client Satisfaction', and for providing best 'Value for Money' in forex."
              
              The Financial Times is one of the world's leading business news and information organizations, recognized internationally for its authority, integrity and accuracy. Readers of the Financial Times and its sister publication, Investors Chronicle, were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire in which they gave their views of the forex providers they use. Responses were used to score forex providers on a range of issues including ease-of-contact, commissions and charges, administration, financial security, the quality of their research, and the range of services offered. The scores were collated by an independent research house and are used to identify the winners in each category.
