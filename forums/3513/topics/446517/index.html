            <div class='col-md body'><p>ZURICH, Feb. 1, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- <br><br>New trend: Multilingualism <br><br>For young people today, it's more and more common to study multiple languages, as many careers require not just one foreign language, but two or even more. In an increasingly difficult job market, speaking two foreign languages may not only get you a job, but can alsosubstantially increase your salary.EF Education First is responding to this multilingual trend by opening four new language schools across Europe and EF is also offering a special study program for accelerated multilingual learning. <br><br>To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: <br><br>http://www.multivu.com/mnr/53751-ef-education <br><br>The EU has recognized multilingualism as such an important factor in the competitiveness of European employees and companies, that in 2007 they appointed an EU Commissioner devoted to promoting multilingualism in Europe. EF Education First( <a href="http://www.ef.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.ef.com</span></span></a> ), the world's largest private language education company, has also taken note: "In Europe, employers often ask for English plus either Spanish, French, German or Italian, and we see more and more companies asking for Chinese," explains Mats Ulenius, Vice President at EF. "Young people realize what becoming multilingual will do for their careers and their salary potential. As a result, we see a higher demand from students for courses in all the popular third languages." <br><br>EF has responded to the multilingual trend by opening four new language schools in Europe: Paris, Madrid, Rome and Munich. Their doors will be open by February 2012 and students can apply online at www.ef.com/centers. <br><br>The company's new flagship French school, EF Paris, is in its own palace-like building just steps from the Opera and the fashionable boutiques of the 9th arrondissement. "EF offers a wider range of special interest classes than any other French school in Paris, including a popular French Cuisine course taught in the schoolï¼Šs custom-built professional kitchen," says Alix Lallement, the director of the school. <br><br>Like Paris, EF's other new continental schools are also opening in the heart of exciting cities. "Students want to experience the sights and sounds of the local culture after class, so the location of the school is important," says Jurgen Oehler, director of EF Munich, which is based in a stunning glass building in the hip Lehel district. Similarly, the EF Madrid school is in a landmark building in the vibrant Salamanca neighborhood, and EF Rome, perhaps the most impressive, is housed in a patrician mansion with frescoed ceilings, just around the corner from the famous Piazza Navona. <br><br>EF has also introduced a special program, called the EF Multi-LanguageYear( <a href="http://www.ef.com/multilanguage"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.ef.com/multilanguage</span></span></a> ), for students determined to become multilingual quickly. Participants choose two or three of EF's 41 International Language Centers worldwide to create their own tailor-made, nine-month study tour, learning up to three languages plus the invaluable experience of cultural immersion in multiple countries. <br><br>Photos of the new EF schools on their Facebook pages: <br><br>-- EFParis: <br>http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150626120428084.473629.195151008083&amp;type=3 <br>-- EF Rome: <br>http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150716719533902.498099.197815713901&amp;type=3 <br>-- EF Madrid: <br>http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.349875875024757.94219.295991390413206&amp;type=3 <br>-- EF Munich: <br>http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150510786681716.357607.173995931715&amp;type=3 <br><br>About EF <br><br>Established in 1965 with the mission to â€»break down barriers in language, culture, and geography§, EF Education First (EF) is the worldï¼Šs leading international education company.
