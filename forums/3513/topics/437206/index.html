              <p>i.Tech's New aptX(TM) SPLASH Bluetooth Headset Delivers CD-Like Streaming Audio</p>
              <p>SPLASH Android™ App adds fun, on-screen features, including battery-level indicator and some headset functions</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Aug. 31, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- i.Tech Dynamic today introduced SPLASH, its new Bluetooth headset with aptX™ technology. aptX™ has quickly become the standard for enabling the delivery of clear, CD-like streaming audio for wireless audio products. When SPLASH is used with aptX™-enabled smartphones, the audio is virtually indistinguishable from that of wired devices.</p>

              <p>"CSR enjoys a strong business relationship with i.Tech Dynamic," said CSR's Senior Director of aptX, Noel McKenna, "and we are really excited about the launch of their sleek new aptX SPLASH Bluetooth headset. Now, thanks to aptX technology, SPLASH users can enjoy wire-free CD-quality stereo audio with Bluetooth."</p>
              <p>"This unique Bluetooth headset is perfect for consumers with active lifestyles who love listening to music, having fun and using the latest technology," said Ka Wong, Chief Technology Officer, i.Tech Dynamic Global Distribution Limited, "SPLASH lets them enjoy high-quality audio that they would expect only from wired headsets. Plus, they'll have the first Bluetooth headset that lets them see the headset's battery level on their Android screens, as well as be able to see the battery level on their iPhones. SPLASH's fun, smart functions add up to an extremely enjoyable streaming audio experience."</p>
              <p>SPLASH has a range of features that deliver enhanced functionality on the user's smartphone.</p>
              <p>Fun Features for Android Users</p>
              <p>Users with Android-based smartphones can download the SPLASH Android™ App for added functions on their devices. In addition to the on-screen battery-level icon, the SPLASH app lets users control some headset functions from their Android screens, including volume control (separate settings enable different volume levels for the headset, music and radio), FM radio channel presets and FM radio settings. Finally, users can see what station they are listening to -- no more guessing!</p>
              <p>The SPLASH App also boasts a Voice SMS that lets users hear their SMS messages automatically read aloud on the connected i.Tech device.</p>
              <p>Colorful, creative, beach-inspired graphics in the app add to the user experience. A jet-skier indicates the battery level, and a shark appears when the battery is running low. Other beach-based characters having fun in the sun let users set the volume levels.</p>
              <p>The SPLASH Android™ App is available to download for free at Android Market. The SPLASH video is also available on YouTube at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v51v1Co5UEk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v51v1Co5UEk</a></p>
              <p>Enhancements for iPhone Users</p>
              <p>For iPhone users, the SPLASH Bluetooth headset includes TalkApp and BatteryApp developed by i.Tech exclusively for its headsets. TalkApp minimizes distortion and ensures voice capture replicates the speaker's original voice level. BatteryApp utilizes a software feature in the iPhone's operating system to automatically display a battery-level indicator beside the Bluetooth logo on the phone's screen once the devices are paired. (No App download is required.)</p>
              <p>SPLASH Features, Specifications and Availability</p>

There's also a pairing status indicator and a 3.5 mm audio socket.</p>
