              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SHANGHAI, May 24, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Porsche China celebrates its tenth anniversary in 2011, looking back on a decade in which it has made history, broken records and led the automotive industry in bringing sports cars that are 'Made in Faith' to the Porsche enthusiasts of China. Since the opening of Porsche Centre Beijing Central in 2001, China has grown to become the second largest market for Porsche worldwide, achieving stunning growth over the past decade: from 27 cars sold in 2002, to 13,856 in 2010 in Mainland China.</p>
              <div>
              <div style="width: 410px; margin: 5px;"><a style="color: #3062b9; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/05/24/20110524506624-org.jpg"><img style="margin-bottom: 5px;" src="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/05/24/20110524506624.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="400px"></a><br><span>911 10 Year Anniversary Edition</span></div>
              </div>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The sports car maker's illustrious legacy has been built with faith in its ability to meet the needs of the world's most dynamic automotive market. By becoming an official subsidiary of Porsche AG in 2008, Porsche marked the beginning of a new era in its China history. The new subsidiary allowed Porsche greater flexibility to successfully satisfy the demands of the Chinese market. To date, the company has opened 31 Porsche Centres in China, with September 2010 seeing Porsche China open its first directly-operated Porsche Centre at Shanghai Pudong. This flagship facility is now a vital component of future Porsche operations in China, setting a benchmark for innovative new strategies and initiatives and making Porsche China even more responsive to the needs of customers.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Further landmark events are scheduled for 2011, as Porsche China continues its programme of expansion with grand opening ceremonies at Porsche Centres Taizhou, Zhengzhou, Haikou and Chengdu Airport. As a symbol of its phenomenal growth over the last decade, Porsche China welcomed its 50,000<sup>th</sup> customer this year, demonstrating the rising popularity of the marque as it moves forward into a second decade in the China market.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Mr. Bernhard Maier, Vice President Sales and Marketing of Porsche AG said, "The achievements of Porsche in Mainland China have been a significant factor in the success of Porsche across the world in the last ten years. With an on-going commitment to this market, we will continue to expand our network of Porsche Centres, bringing our Chinese customers ultimate sports cars that are instilled with Porsche DNA and provide the standards of performance, style and agility that are derived from Porsche Intelligent Performance."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Throughout its first decade in China, Porsche has nurtured an automotive culture that values intelligent sports car engineering. Since Porsche first thrilled crowds at Auto Shanghai 2005 with the Carrera GT super sports car, Chinese enthusiasts have enjoyed yet more magnificent model premieres from the RS Spyder at Auto Shanghai 2007 and the Cayenne Turbo S at Auto China 2008 in Beijing. The World Premiere of the Porsche Panamera in 2009 – notably held on the 94th Floor of the Shanghai World Financial Centre – also underlined the great faith that Porsche has invested in the China market. More recently, Chinese crowds were treated to a glimpse of the mid-engine 918 Spyder at Auto China 2010 and the innovative new racing lab, the 918 RSR, at this year's Auto Shanghai.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">In supporting this enthusiasm for its unique sports cars, Porsche China has welcomed events that celebrate the faith of Porsche in its past, present and future. From 2002, the Porsche World Roadshow has toured China, proving to fans nationwide that there is no more exciting way to experience Porsche than on the racetrack. This sentiment is undoubtedly supported by the aspiring racers and customers that have made the Porsche Sport Driving School so hugely popular. Enthusiasts have also had a chance to take their passion for Porsche on the road with the Porsche Drive to Excellence. A fully comprehensive range of driving activities has been provided by Fascination Porsche since 2009, with a selection of famous sports cars from the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart and current model lines bringing unforgettable driving experiences to cities across China.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">With popular acclaim has come significant praise, as China's best automotive publications have continued to recognise the brilliance of Porsche Intelligent Performance. Close to 70 awards have been bestowed on the Porsche range, including 'Best Imported Sports Car' for the 911 Carrera from Auto Magazine, Auto World Magazine's 'People's Choice Award' for the Cayenne SUV and the title of 'Luxury Car of the Year' from Orient Auto for the Panamera. Porsche has also been honoured with the ultimate accolade from Auto Motor und Sport for two consecutive years, as 'Best Sport Brand' in 2010 and 'Best Brand' in 2011.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Highlighting its legendary racing history, Porsche has continued to bring the excitement of motor sports to new audiences in China. From 2001, the marque has triumphed throughout Asia, bringing its unique motorsport legacy to events from the Transsyberia Rally of 2008 to the Intercontinental Le Mans Series at Zhuhai in 2010. Since roaring off the grid in 2003, the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia (PCCA) has become China's most popular one-make series, contesting rounds each year on racetracks across China. The success of the series has proved inspirational to Chinese teams, with PCCA legends such as Darryl O'Young and Christian Menzel taking to the track alongside mainland Chinese racers such as Wang Jianwei and Rose Tan with the support of thousands of Chinese fans. The success of teams from Mainland China, such as Team Jebsen, Team StarChase, Team BetterLife, Team Kangshun and Team C&amp;D, point to a bright future for the series, which has now been under the management of Porsche China since January 2011.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">As Porsche celebrates the many milestones of its first decade in China, it continues to demonstrate its commitment to China's social development through the 'Empowering the Future' initiative. Conceived after Porsche contributed an initial RMB 5 million in the aftermath of the Wenchuan earthquake of 2008, the collaboration with UNICEF has supplied educational resources and training to schools that were affected by the natural disaster. Through direct donations and fund raising programmes such as the 'Empowering the Future' Art Contest with Sichuan Fine Arts Institute, Porsche has now contributed more than RMB 10.2 million and four modified Cayennes to the initiative, improving the lives of over 55,000 students in 260 schools throughout the region and affirming the strength of its confidence in China's future.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">In tribute to a first decade of achievement for Porsche China, customers, media and Porsche representatives from across the country were invited to the Grand Hyatt Beijing on May 20-22 for an evening of gala celebrations. Guest of honour Dr. Wolfgang Porsche, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Porsche Automobil Holding SE and grandson of company founder Ferdinand Porsche, was joined by Mr. Bernhard Maier, Vice President Sales and Marketing Porsche AG, in addressing the VIP audience. Both expressed their excitement at the success of Porsche China while underlining the continued importance of this market to worldwide Porsche operations. Renowned singer Na Ying also joined the event, presented by celebrity hosts Tsai Kang Yong and Wang Youjia.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The ten year anniversary celebration was complemented by the third annual Fascination Porsche event at Beijing Goldenport Circuit from May 21-22, as invited guests enjoyed a dazzling array of Porsche sports cars and activities within an authentic motor sport setting. Arriving from all corners of the world, the event features a showcase of some of the most famous cars in the history of Porsche. The award-winning line-up of Museum cars included championship racers such as the Porsche RS Spyder and Porsche 935, and models such as the Porsche 356 Speedster. Attendees were also treated to the sight of the Porsche 917 KH – originally sponsored by mineral oil producer Gulf and winner of classic races such as Daytona and Le Mans. Throughout the Fascination Porsche event, a range of track driving activities brought Porsche Intelligent Performance to life behind the wheel of contemporary models such the Boxster S, Cayman S and Panamera.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Mr. Helmut Broeker, Chief Executive Officer of Porsche China, said, "For the tenth anniversary of Porsche China, I am proud of the many milestones we have achieved so far. The successful expansion of our Porsche Centre network has brought flawless and consistent service closer to our customers across China. As a result of these great efforts, we welcomed the 50,000<sup>th</sup> Porsche customer in this market this year. With this growing community of Porsche enthusiasts, Porsche has been credited with bringing sports car culture to this emerging market. I would like to offer my thanks to our Porsche Centre dealers, customers, partners and media friends who have made this past decade a triumph. Together we have shared in China's great prosperity, and together we look forward to many more decades of outstanding accomplishment for Porsche in China."</p>
