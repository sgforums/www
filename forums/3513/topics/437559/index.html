              </p><p class="MsoNormal">SINGAPORE, Sep. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ --RS Components
              (RS), the world's leading high service distributor of electronics and
              maintenance products and the trading brand of Electrocomponents plc (LSE:ECM),
              has unveiled a transformation of its websites (www.rs-components.com) that
              significantly enhances the online experience for its Asia Pacific customers.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Similar to the launch of its new China website in August, RS
              Components' new Asia Pacific websites encompass new intelligent product search
              feature and superior browsing capability, giving customers faster and easier
              access to over 550,000 products.<span>  </span>The new
              websites have now been implemented across the region including Australia,
              Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The new websites (www.rs-components.com) represent the
              latest step in a plan to put eCommerce firmly at the heart of the company's
              business, ensuring that RS customers enjoy the best and most relevant online
              experience, regardless of location or browsing device. The launch follows
              extensive research by RS into its customers' use of the website and takes the
              best examples offered by consumer websites from around the world.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The new functionality enables customers to more easily
              search the products that they want and to access an array of 3D CAD models. The
              website's enhanced search algorithm delivers more relevant content and allows
              customers to tailor their results in their own way. Best practice layout and
              navigation is used throughout the revamped website and customers are able to
              choose from three different views:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">List view - a large set of search results with limited
              technical information (default view);</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Gallery view - a large set of search results without
              technical information to allow users to quickly scan available products;</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Compare view - a small set of search results with full
              technical information.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">All three viewing options allow customers to choose the way
              they want to experience RS Components' website: the way they want to review
              available products, technical information, pricing and stock availability.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Additional major enhancements include clearer pricing,
              instant stock availability and 'Compare View', which delivers a more intuitive
              product comparison.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"The enhancements made to RS China's website have
              greatly helped our buying processes. Searching for products online is now
              faster and more efficient for both engineers and procurement specialists,
              making the online buying experience more comprehensive. We are very happy with
              the changes and fully support RS Components' online initiatives," said Liu
              Jin Xia, Purchasing Engineer, Skyray Instrument Inc.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">RS Components has consistently invested in eCommerce
              initiatives, both in Asia Pacific and globally. Some of these initiatives
              include the introduction of a fully integrated and seamless transactional
              website for China customers, offering Alipay's advanced escrow-based system for
              online payments.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm very impressed with the layout of the new RS
              website as it's now much easier to find products, both using the improved
              search facility and through the clearer page layouts. The addition of the comparative
              viewing tool is especially helpful as I can evaluate several products in one go
              which will be an invaluable time saver for my business. The improved browsing
              capability means that I am now more aware of all the services on offer. It's
              obvious to me that RS has really understood what its customers require and is
              committed to delivering a superior online experience," stated Steve Hyman,
              Armourer, Armoury Services.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">eCommerce is fundamental to the RS business. Alongside its
              website, RS offers market-leading web-based procurement solutions for small and
              large companies. In the financial year ended March 2011, these channels
              delivered sales worth £575m having grown by 37%. Over 53% of the Group's
              revenues are now being generated via online channels and this is set to rise
              further as the company delivers on its eCommerce strategy, building a £1Bn+
              eCommerce business at its heart.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Marcelo Wesseler, Head of eCommerce, Asia Pacific said:
              "Our customers told us that they wanted better search capabilities with minimum
              fuss. We want to go beyond that requirement and transform their entire online
              experience with us. The delivery of this strategic milestone dramatically
              reduces the number of clicks required for customers to find new products, and
              enhances the look and feel of the site. We are pioneers and a global force in
              B2B eCommerce, having developed our first website in 1998, and are continuing
              in the same vein with this launch of the most advanced transactional website in
              our industry sector. It represents a cornerstone of our e-centric vision and an
              important step in delivering our eCommerce strategy."</p>
