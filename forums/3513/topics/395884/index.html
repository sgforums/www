              <p>Enhanced Convenience and Security Augments Candidates' Exam Experience and Meets Demand for Information Security Professionals <br><br>HONG KONG, April 8 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- (ISC)2(R) ("ISC-squared"), the not-for-profit global leader in educating and certifying information security professionals throughout their careers with more than 66,000 certified members worldwide, today announced the availability of computer-based testing for its Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) credential. <br><br>The first (ISC)2 certification exam to make the transition from paper-and-pencil delivery, the CSSLP exam will be available at nearly 500 Pearson VUE test centers around the world. Pearson VUE, (ISC)2's computer-based test delivery provider, is the global leader in computer-based testing for information technology, academic, government and professional testing programs. <br><br>The benefits of (ISC)2 computer-based testing through Pearson VUE include: <br><br>-- Increased convenience -- In addition to offering more exam centers <br>around the world, computer-based testing through Pearson VUE also <br>increases the number of exam scheduling opportunities. Upon <br>application approval by (ISC)2 to take the exam, the candidate can <br>schedule an exam online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for any <br>time a testing center is open. Also, candidates will receive <br>notification of their test results immediately after completing the <br>exam. <br>-- A consistent testing environment -- The testing experience is <br>exactly the same for each Pearson Professional Center; all <br>facilities are equipped with an identical layout, materials and <br>process to ensure a consistent experience for all candidates that <br>enables a fair and precise evaluation of a candidate's competency. <br>-- Reduced travel costs -- By offering more testing location options, <br>computer-based testing through Pearson VUE reduces the cost of <br>travel and overnight stays for individuals and organizations. <br>-- Enhanced security measures -- Pearson VUE testing centers include <br>certified proctors, advanced biometric verification to confirm the <br>identity of the exam candidates, video and audio monitoring, <br>encryption of all test packages and results, anomaly detection and <br>other forensic safeguards. <br><br>"We believe computer-based testing through Pearson VUE offers CSSLP certification candidates the most professional and convenient testing experience possible," said W. Hord Tipton, CISSP-ISSEP, CAP, CISA, executive director for (ISC)2. "And as it does for premier organizations around the world, Pearson VUE is providing a highly secure testing process overseen by CISSPs in their organization." <br><br>(ISC)2 will gradually phase in computer-based testing for all of its credential exams over the next three years in part to meet the projected growth for the profession worldwide. The most recent (ISC)2 Global Information Security Workforce Study ("GISWS") found that the number of information security professionals is expected to increase to almost 2.7 million by 2012, displaying a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 percent. <br><br>The CSSLP aims to stem the proliferation of software vulnerabilities by establishing best practices and validating an individual's competency in addressing security issues throughout the software lifecycle. Code-language neutral, it is applicable to analysts, developers, software engineers, software architects, project managers, software quality assurance testers, programmers and others involved in the software lifecycle. <br><br>CSSLP candidates must demonstrate four years of professional experience in the software development lifecycle process or three years of experience and a bachelor's degree (or regional equivalent) in an IT discipline to be approved to take the exam. If they pass the rigorous exam, and following a potential audit of their experience, candidates must be endorsed by a current (ISC)2 member, subscribe to the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics and obtain annual Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits to maintain their certification. <br><br>(ISC)2 requires that all CSSLP candidates apply to take the examination on its Web site prior to registering with Pearson VUE for a testing appointment. (ISC)2 will review each application and determine if the candidate is qualified to take the exam. If approved, (ISC)2 will notify Pearson VUE that the candidate will be eligible to test. Once the candidate receives notification of authorization to test, he or she must schedule and take the CSSLP examination within 90 days. If the candidate does not test within 90 days, then the candidate must re-apply on the (ISC)2 Website for a new authorization. <br><br>The CSSLP computer-based exam's content is identical to the paper-based exam, as only the delivery mechanism is different. The cost to take the CSSLP computer-based exam is US$549 and is offered in English at this time. <br><br>CSSLP exam candidates can choose to take the exam at a Pearson Professional Center, Pearson VUE Authorized Test Center Select or Pearson VUE Authorized Test Center located on US military installations around the world. <br><br>To register for the CSSLP computer-based exam, please visit http://www.isc2.org/certification-register-now.aspx .
