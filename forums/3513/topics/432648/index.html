              <p>Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur will be part of an iconic, mixed use complex. The hotel, occupying floors 17 through 39 of the property, will feature 412 guest rooms, including 42 suites and will offer over 33,000 square feet of meeting and event space, a 228-seat cafe, a 298-seat specialty restaurant with multiple cuisines, a 74-seat Sky Lobby Lounge, a 102-seat poolside restaurant and bar, a spa with 11 treatment rooms, and a swimming pool.</p>
              <p>There are currently 51 Hyatt-branded hotels in Asia Pacific and Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur will join the two existing Hyatt-branded hotels in Malaysia: Hyatt Regency Kinabalu and Hyatt Regency Kuantan Resort. There are 16 other Grand Hyatt hotels in the region's key gateway cities and destination resorts, including Bali, Bangkok, Beijing, Jakarta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo.</p>
              <p>Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur will be located in the Golden Triangle area of Kuala Lumpur, in a prime location on Jalan Pinang road close to the Kuala Lumpur City Centre ("KLCC") and the iconic Petronas Towers.</p>
              <p>Kuala Lumpur is an internationally recognized tourist and business destination. With a metropolitan population of approximately 7.2 million, it is the largest city in Malaysia and a key leisure location. Many of Malaysia's major commercial banks and financial institutions are headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, as are many Malaysian companies, making it an international gateway city.</p>
              <p>"In 2010, Malaysia attracted over 24.5 million tourists æ¯� rivaling that of countries such as Mexico, Germany and Turkey," said Willi Martin, area vice president, Southeast Asia, Hyatt Hotels and Resorts. "We see Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur as a remarkable opportunity to expand the presence of the Hyatt brand into a principal city in the rapidly emerging Southeast Asia market."</p>
              <p>Given its central location, Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur will serve visitors to nearby offices and leisure attractions. Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur will be located in close proximity to fashion hubs and business centers, museums, memorials and galleries, and within driving distance of natural preserves. Kuala Lumpur boasts the best of many cultures and an immersive experience for travelers from all corners of the world.</p>
              <p>In addition to Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur, twelve other Grand Hyatt properties are currently under development around the world. Grand Hyatt hotels feature spectacular, distinctive properties in mixed-use developments or stand alone buildings in major gateway cities and resort locales around the world. Signature elements include dramatic lobbies, innovative dining options, state of the art technology, distinctive spa and fitness centers, and comprehensive business and meeting facilities. Across all Hyatt brands, more than 30 new properties opened in 2010, and 140 contracts for new properties were executed.</p>
