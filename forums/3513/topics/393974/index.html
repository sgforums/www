(are) not seeing a clear difference between brands," the award citation stated. "Bausch + Lomb wins this award for taking a new approach in developing a transparent contemporary bottle design that has changed the way A.S. Watson and its customers 'see' eye care." <br><br>The transparent bottle design of ReNu MultiPlus(R) multi-purpose solution is the first of its kind in the eye care industry to combine enhanced consumer convenience with a fresher and cleaner design. Consumers feel more comfortable as they can clearly see what they are using for their eyes. The clear bottle allows users to examine purity of the solution from outside and see how much is left with a "run out" indicator. The bottle uses PET, a recyclable plastic material that provides consumers with an environmental friendly choice. <br><br>"The award recognizes our continued efforts in providing consumers with the best eye care experience," said David Kirby, VP Sales Development Asia Pacific, "We will continue to work with our trade and eye care professional partners to provide the best segment-based insight-driven innovations to consumers. We look forward to making more announcements in the coming months regarding our lens care products." <br><br>ReNu MultiPlus(R) multi-purpose solution is specially formulated to deliver a fresh lens feeling everyday, providing exceptional disinfection, effective cleaning and removal of irritating protein deposits, and sustained wettability for soft contact lenses. <br><br>Visit http://www.bausch.com to learn more about our products. <br><br>About A.S.
