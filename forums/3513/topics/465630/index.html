              Offering 10 mobile banking technology traineeships for talented young technopreneurs
              
              SINGAPORE, Feb. 7, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard Chartered Bank today signaled its ongoing commitment to talent development in financial services technology by announcing the 2013 Mobile Ventures Fellowship (MoVe) programme.
              
              Now in its second year, the MoVe programme was initiated as a part of the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore's (IDA) Company-Led Training Programme (CLT). It aims to train new infocomm graduates and professionals in emerging and critical technologies. In calling for new applicants today, Standard Chartered announced another 10 traineeships for young Singaporean technopreneurs (MoVeRs) in mobile banking technology.
              
              Simon McNamara, Chief Information Officer, Consumer Banking, at Standard Chartered Bank, said: "The Mobile Ventures Fellowship programme at Standard Chartered has already been hugely successful with 10 MoVeRs due to complete their traineeships mid-year. We are pleased that with the support of the IDA, the Bank is able to be the launchpad for the careers of Singapore's emerging talent in mobile banking technology. This programme offers talented individuals the opportunity to harness the power of digital technology to create revolutionary mobile banking experiences that are more intuitive and personalised for the Bank's customers both in Singapore and internationally."
              
              Standard Chartered's Move programme will expose MoVeRs to the financial services industry and spur their creativity in designing and developing next generation mobile banking services for the Bank's customers. MoVeRs will be embedded within talented specialist teams at the Bank's multi-award winning global internet and mobile banking unit in Singapore. They will have the opportunity to work on the Bank's suite of mobile banking and lifestyle applications, including Breeze Banking, Breeze Trade, Breeze Good Life, Breeze Places and Breeze Home.
              
              Standard Chartered was the first financial institution in Singapore to partner with the IDA in 2012 to offer a programme geared towards building a new generation of MoVers and shakers in mobile banking. These young minds will innovate in Singapore to harness the power of the global mobile revolution for the rest of the world. Applications will close on 28 April 2013.
