              <p> </p>
              <p>HONG KONG, Aug. 30 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Ipreo, a leading global provider of market intelligence and productivity solutions to corporations and investment banks, and the Hong Kong Investor Relations Association (HKIRA), announced that they have entered into an agreement whereby Ipreo will provide tools, content, and support for HKIRA's IR community initiatives, with particular focus on its educational programming.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Education - on the markets, on the investment community, on the vital function of IR in public companies - is extremely important to the growth and development of the field of Investor Relations in Hong Kong," said Justin Reynolds, Managing Director of Asia-Pacific for Ipreo. "We are very pleased to be able to help HKIRA to drive that educational process."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ipreo's Corporate offering includes a suite of market intelligence tools for Asian listed companies (Shareholder Identification, Surveillance, Shareholder Meeting Proxy Solicitation Services, Targeting, Perception and Corporate Governance Analytics), as well as workflow tools and buy-side investor data (BD Corporate, iPlanner, and buy-side communication tools). Ipreo is one of the fastest-growing IR service providers in the Greater China region, with over 70 new corporate issue clients coming to rely on Ipreo services so far in 2010 alone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eva Chan, Chairman of HKIRA, said, "The level of support we are garnering from important industry players validates HKIRA's assertion that there is a real need for a well-established investor relations community and high-quality services to support Hong Kong listed companies. We're extremely pleased to have Ipreo's partnership in our continued efforts to foster investor relations best practices in Hong Kong."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HKIRA's activities include educational programming in the areas of investor relations and corporate communications, professional development support, publishing relevant industry information and research, acting as an advocate for members to regulatory bodies, and facilitating networking opportunities for investor relations professionals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ipreo will be contributing to HKIRA's efforts in a variety of ways throughout the year, including active participation in HKIRA events and educational programming, data and analytical support of HKIRA's initiatives, and the provision of services beneficial to HKIRA's issuer members. The agreement is exclusive in nature, making Ipreo the only market intelligence provider to be working jointly with HKIRA in this capacity.</p>
