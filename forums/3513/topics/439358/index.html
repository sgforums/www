              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">PULAU DUYONG, Malaysia, Oct. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Ri-Yaz Heritage Marina Resort &amp; Spa will be the centre of attention when it becomes the host venue for the sixth edition of the Malaysian Match Racing Championship (MMRC) from the 7th - 10th October 2011. The annual championship will see eight local sailing teams vying for the sole chance to represent Malaysia at the Monsoon Cup, which will take place from 22nd - 27th November 2011 at the same venue in Terengganu.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">
              </span></p><p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;"><img src="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/10/06/20111006102118937593-org.jpg" alt="Preparations underway at the Malaysian Match Racing Championships.

              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">Defending MMRC champion, Jeremy Koo, leads the line-up with high hopes of retaining his title with yet another coup. Having skippered his team to victory last year, Koo is confident that his past experience will come in handy in improving his performance this year. He said, "Everyone is a potential match for us. We do not take anyone for granted."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">After losing his title to Koo and dropping to 3<sup>rd</sup> place last year, 2009 MMRC champion, Hazwan Hazim is back with a vengeance with a new sponsor and a new tactician. He said, "Our main strategy is to lead from the start, apply some tactics and cover our opponents." He hoped that his new teammate, Nik Ashraf Qaedi, who is well-versed in tactical planning, would give him the advantage he needs.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">Winner of the 2008 MMRC, Nurul Ain Md. Isa, is also back by popular demand. Three years ago, Nurul won the MMRC together with Hazwan Hazim and has not competed in the event since her last victory. But a new sponsorship from Ri-Yaz Heritage Marina Resort &amp; Spa, spearheaded by the General Manager, Abdul Shaheed Yusof, saw her jumping at the chance to outshine her male rivals.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">The Malaysian Armed Forces are also confident that their two teams, MAF1 and MAF2 will do well as they have been consistently showing up in full force since the inception of the MMRC in 2006. The two teams have taken to sparring with each other to rack up practice hours and boost their confidence.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">Mohd Affendy, who is also the General Manager of the Malaysian Yachting Association, leads family team, Team Affendy. The experienced skipper has participated in many matches including the Malaysia Challenge, Raja Muda Regatta, Royal International Regatta, King Cup, Top of the Gulf, Sail the Gulf, Straits Singapore Regatta, and many more. According to Affendy, the key to success is not in winning only but bringing up the sport of sailing.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">Another family team, Melaka Negeriku Sayang, sees Ahmad Khairulhafiz Ahmad Khmbali and his children hoping for an opportunity to qualify for the Monsoon Cup. No stranger to match racing, Ahmad previously raced in last year’s MMRC but didn’t qualify for a placing. He hoped that his over 10 years experience in sailing and competing will help him clinch the championship and bring pride to his beloved hometown.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">For Mohd Romzi Muhamad, good teamwork and consistent technical practices are the key factors for competitive success. His obsession towards sailing began when he was still in primary school and led him to compete globally in Japan, Korea, China, France, Doha and USA in the dinghy classes. His team of national sailors is all set to conquer the MMRC for the very first time.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">All the action begins tomorrow, with remaining teams arriving at Pulau Duyong for registration and training.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em; margin-left: 0in;">The Asian Match Racing Championship will follow the Malaysian Match Racing Championship from 12th -15th October, with both winners automatically securing a spot at the Monsoon Cup, which is the final leg of the ISAF World Match Racing Tour circuit held from 22nd - 27th November, at the same venue in Terengganu.</p>
