              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Sept. 6, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- The Malaysian Yachting Association (MYA) has been successful in its bid to gain endorsement for the Malaysian Match Racing Circuit from the World Match Racing Tour (WMRT) after a series of meetings with The WMRT Development Council.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;"><img src="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/09/06/20110906527159-org.jpg" alt="A handshake to seal the endorsement" width="3791" height="2759"></p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The MYA, represented by Hj. Lukman B. Abu Bakar, Deputy President and Dato' Wan Hisham Wan Salleh, Vice President, had two days of intensive meetings with The WMRT Development Council over two days at the St. Moritz Match Race, Switzerland. During this time, they presented Malaysia's proposal for the sanctioning of a Malaysian Match Racing Circuit by The WMRT Development Council.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"We are very excited to have received this endorsement for the Malaysian Match Racing Circuit from the WMRT. We are at the start of a journey that will see the Malaysian sailors elevated beyond a point not previously possible," said Hj. Lukman, Deputy President of Malaysian Yachting Association.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The WMRT Development Council has provided strict guidelines for the MYA to adhere to, ensuring the standards of the Malaysian Match Racing Circuit measure up to the WMRT's World Championship standards. This strategic alliance will see the WMRT share its technical and sporting knowledge, commercial strategies and development framework for officials and umpires with the MYA.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Jim O' Toole, CEO of WMRT, commented: "The World Match Racing Tour Development Council was set up to help develop new sailing talents and we hope to realise that vision by partnering with proactive governing bodies. After reviewing the detailed submissions and presentations we are delighted to formally endorse the MYA and its plans for the Malaysian Match Racing Circuit as we believe their competition framework will nurture the future growth in sailing across Malaysia. We look forward to working closely with the M YA to ensure the success of the Malaysian Match Racing Circuit which we hope will become a pathway for Malaysian sailors aspiring to compete on the Tour."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Among key areas highlighted and discussed were the commercial aspects of a match racing circuit. Sailing provides a unique platform for businesses to come together and associate their brand with a healthy and challenging sport that is not solely focused on physical strength, but also on skill and tactical thinking.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The Malaysian Match Racing Circuit will also open doors for the development and training of race officials and umpires locally. Currently, international sailing events like the Monsoon Cup depend on race officials and umpires from neighbouring countries like Australia and New Zealand due to the lack of ISAF certified officials within the country. With a local circuit that is active for most of the year, the officials will now accumulate enough hours of on-water training needed to receive ISAF's certification.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">The Circuit will be incorporated within the already successful KFC Regatta in Langkawi, Lumut Perak and Selangor, culminating in the Malaysian Match Racing Championship, the qualifiers for the Monsoon Cup, in Pulau Duyong, Terengganu.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Hj. Lukman commented "A keelboat class circuit will provide local sailors with the avenue and opportunities to continuously train and compete professionally in the match racing discipline, harnessing their full potential and preparing them for international events."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">He added: "We have our work cut out between now and February 2012 when we plan to launch the first event of the Malaysian Match Racing Circuit. We are hopeful of garnering the support of our partners KFC, the Ministry of Youth and Sports and T-Best Events to ensure the success of this Circuit."</p>
