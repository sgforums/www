              <p>PRNewswire-Asia/ -- DHL, the world's leading logistics company, today announced its second consecutive win by its Supply Chain division as 'Aerospace Logistics Company of the Year' at the 2011 Frost &amp; Sullivan Asia Pacific Aerospace &amp; Defense Awards.</p>
              <p>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/09/02/20100902467742-l.jpg">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/09/02/20100902467742-l.jpg</a> )</p>
              <p>The win comes shortly after the company clinched a landmark three-year deal worth euro10.6 million with KPMG for Aero Inventory, a company that up until November 2009 offered airlines and MROs (maintenance, repair and overhaul) a unique service involving buying, storing, leasing and maintaining an inventory of various consumables and expendables for aircraft components. The innovative solution developed by DHL Supply Chain, tracks and consolidates almost 25 million parts and their associated trace documents scattered over 100 locations, enabling KPMG (as administrators of Aero) the option of managing insolvent UK firm Aero Inventory out of administration.</p>
              <p>"As part of the Aero Inventory solution, we recently expanded the DHL Aerospace Hub in Singapore by 55% to 70,000 sq ft. This is a timely move as Singapore is recognized as the number one center in Asia for Aerospace MRO(1) and is expected to capture a significant market share from the MRO sector with estimated total cumulative revenue of S$372 billion from 2010 to 2030(2). The aerospace sector is a key area of focus for us and winning the award is proof once again that we have the right industry expertise, enabling us to develop innovative solutions," said Paul Graham, Chief Executive Officer, DHL Supply Chain Asia Pacific.</p>
              <p>The DHL Aerospace Hub, certified AS9120 and ISO, provides 24/7 urgent parts dispatch, warehousing, transport and inventory optimization systems.</p>
              <p>About the Aero Inventory deal</p>
              <p>DHL Supply Chain's solution to uncover, recover and consolidate inventory from places as diverse as El Salvador and China, plus the development of a proper ongoing sales channel, will enable KPMG to maximize the sales value of the inventory as well as give them the option of rebuilding Aero Inventory into a viable business.</p>
              <p>To achieve this, DHL has created three gateways in Canada, Hong Kong and Japan to consolidate parts and then ship them to Aero Inventory's single, global hub which DHL runs out of its Aerospace Hub in Singapore to supply airline clients all over the world. The solution, which will require the services of DHL's Global Forwarding and Express divisions, leverages the company's vast global network and experience, to withdraw all parts from customer locations worldwide -- including Australia, Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan and the USA -- and have them distributed out of a global hub in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Oscar de Bok, Chief Executive Officer of DHL Supply Chain for South and Southeast Asia said: "Since the Aerospace Hub was established four years ago, we have successfully helped our customers improve internal performance and maintain compliance in the Aerospace industry. Today, our one-stop hub provides the broadest end-to-end supply chain services, from having a dedicated aerospace warehouse, to delivering critical spare parts around the world, and having a devoted Aircraft on Ground (AOG) Asia Pacific call centre that operates 24/7."</p>
              <p>About the Award</p>
              <p>The annual Frost &amp; Sullivan Asia Pacific Aerospace &amp; Defense Awards are the industry's most coveted titles for the best performing companies in the airlines, airports, manufacturing, MRO, aviation training, defense, general aviation and homeland security segments of the Aerospace and Defense industry.
