              <p>The new facility is part of Pacnet's strategic plan to increase investments into its Singapore operations and enhance regional connectivity <br><br>SINGAPORE, Nov. 23 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Pacnet today announced the launch of its Singapore Data Landing Station (DLS), the first data center facility in Singapore with direct high speed connectivity into Pacnet's pan-Asian subsea cable network, and part of the company's plans to increase investments into Singapore. <br><br>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/xprn/sa/200803051036.jpg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/xprn/sa/200803051036.jpg</span></span></a> ) <br><br>"With Singapore already a regional hub for many multinationals and a growing infocomm industry that is worth some S$63 billion in 2009, we are increasing our planned investments into Singapore to grow our operations here to tap the regional telecommunications market," said Bill Barney, Chief Executive Officer of Pacnet. "Besides our new Singapore DLS that is being launched today, we are also looking at Singapore as a possible location for the development of a larger 'Asia Gravity Center' data center facility in the near future." <br><br>"We are also investing into our Singapore operations ahead of the planned construction of our West Asia Crossing subsea cable, which will deliver additional connectivity between India and Singapore and bring more network traffic through Singapore," added Mr Barney. Facilities in Singapore that will be upgraded include Pacnet's Network Operations Centre, which currently oversees its global network infrastructure. <br><br>Pacnet's newly launched Singapore DLS is part of the company's growth strategy to tap the growing demand for data center services which are coupled with the highest speed, lowest latency network connections available. According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, the Singapore data center services market is expected to grow from US$180.2 million to US$263.8 million in 2011, at a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. <br><br>The Singapore DLS, the first in the country and part of a regional network of DLSs, is located at Pacnet's cable landing station in Changi. The facility is a 3,300 square feet Tier III data center and is the latest addition to the more than 96,200 square feet of data center space that Pacnet has globally. As a carrier neutral facility, the Singapore DLS also offers customers the flexibility of choosing the domestic carrier of their choice to deliver domestic connectivity to and from the DLS. <br><br>Pacnet's DLSs are unique in that they are the only data center facilities that offer direct access to Pacnet's EAC-C2C subsea cable, Asia's largest privately owned subsea network. The DLSs leverage the power, space and network connectivity of existing cable landing facilities to offer state-of-the-art data center facilities including a high power density of up to 8 KVA per cabinet, fully redundant power and cooling systems, advanced fire detection and suppression systems as well as 24 x 7 security access systems. <br><br>Through the Pacnet DLSs in Singapore and Hong Kong, Pacnet is able to deliver the lowest latency connection between a data center in Singapore and a data center in Hong Kong. Additionally, customers are also able to get high capacity, low latency connectivity across Asia and the United States, with multiple resiliency options, through Pacnet's EAC-C2C and EAC Pacific cable systems. <br><br>Pacnet's full ownership of both the DLSs and EAC-C2C also guarantees rapid network and hosting scalability to meet the rapidly growing business requirements of today's enterprises, whilst providing customers the added convenience of a single point of contact. <br><br>About Pacnet <br><br>Named "Company of the Year for Excellence in Growth" by Frost &amp; Sullivan in 2009 and "Best Wholesale Carrier" at the Telecom Asia Awards 2009, Pacnet is Asia's leading independent telecommunications service provider, formed from the operational merger of Asia Netcom and Pacific Internet. Pacnet owns and operates EAC-C2C, Asia's largest privately-owned submarine cable network at 36,800 km, with a design capacity of 17.92 Tbps to 30.72 Tbps to and from each of the landing countries, as well as EAC Pacific, which spans 9,620 km across the Pacific Ocean and delivers up to 1.92 Tbps of capacity between Asia and North America. The company offers a comprehensive portfolio of industry leading IP-based solutions for carriers, large enterprises and SMEs.
