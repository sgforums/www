              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"I feel extremely honored to be recognized and trusted by so many well-known investment firms and entrepreneurs. China has an enormous potential for a business like ours and we are poised to double our growth over the next one year. Whilst doing so, we simultaneously strive to perfect our food and services, and endeavor to continuously improve on our management and efficiency. Ultimately, we aim to build a multi-brand F&amp;B platform in China by bringing in more brands with the help from our investors," said YPX Cayman Chief Executive Officer Chris Tay.  </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Mr. Hans Tung, Managing Director of Qiming Ventures, said: "Qiming Ventures was the sole investor of YPX Cayman's in its first round of financing. We have been supporting the company since the day one. I am very proud of the team's professionalism and execution skills. I strongly believe that with a great team, a F&amp;B platform can be just as successful as an internet company’s platform."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Ms. Jennifer Huang, President of Hotung Investment, which led the second round of financing, said: “In China, Chinese-style casual F&amp;B is a more attractive option for consumers than western-style casual F&amp;B. The key of establishing a strong footprint in the market is to provide products and services with a higher price/performance ratio as well as standardization of production and management. YPX Cayman is definitely working towards this direction.”</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Mr. Shunsuke Masaki, Head of Consumer Investment, Mitsui Global Investment, added: “We're glad that YPX Cayman is striving to achieve the strategic goal of building a casual F&amp;B chain platform. We believe that under the leadership of existing executives, the company will meet the goal. Mitsui Global Investment has invested in more than 15 F&amp;B companies in Japan and we hope to make more brands available in China through YPX Cayman.”</p>
