Adjacent to sister resort Wynn Macau, Encore is a unique destination with its own repertoire of suites, dining and shopping. <br><br>"Our goal with Encore was to broaden the appeal of Macau as a tourist destination and open the most beautiful hotel in the world. I am grateful to the People's Republic of China and the Government of Macau who gave us this opportunity. As a result, the loveliest hotel in the world is not in London, Paris, Tokyo, New York or San Francisco. It is here in Macau. Encore at Wynn will bring the highest level of service and accommodations to the hospitality industry and will be enjoyed by our employees and guests forever," said Steve Wynn, Chairman of the Board &amp; Chief Executive Officer - Wynn Resorts, Limited. <br><br>Accommodations at Encore include 414 suites and villas that offer tasteful elegance in a comfortable, residential setting. Encore introduces two new restaurants to the Wynn dining family, and Bar Cristal's jewel-box dè°·cor turns a classic lobby bar into a work of art. The serene Spa at Encore offers treatments in eight private therapy suites, each with its own steam room, sauna and aroma-hydrotherapy bath and shower. The Shopping Esplanade is home to three signature stores-Cartier, Chanel and Piaget-showcasing the finest selections, including limited-edition pieces unique to Encore. <br><br>Encore suite reservations may be made by calling (853) 8986 9966. <br><br>As the nation mourns the victims of the earthquake in Yushu county, Qinghai province, China, Wynn Macau expresses its deepest condolences.
