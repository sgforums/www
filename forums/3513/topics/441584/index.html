              <p>i.Tech Introduces MyVoice 615, the Sleek Stereo for Mono Headset of Choice for Style-conscious Trend Setters</p>
              <p>Now users on the road can enjoy music and online media with crystal clear audio quality.</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Nov. 14, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Today i.Tech Dynamic introduced the MyVoice 615, a lightweight stereo for mono headset that utilizes Bluetooth's Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) for superior audio quality with a variety of multimedia.</p>
              <p>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2009/09/02/200909021619.jpg">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2009/09/02/200909021619.jpg</a> )<br>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/11/07/20111107160209767518.html">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/11/07/20111107160209767518.html</a> )<br>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/11/07/20111107160323669724.html">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2011/11/07/20111107160323669724.html</a> )</p>
              <p>MyVoice 615 is specifically designed to complement the needs of fashionable smart phone and tablet users by letting them seamlessly switch between music, online media and phone calls. Unlike full stereo headphones, this mono headset enhances a user's ability to multi-task while remaining fully aware of their surroundings. In addition, the headset allows streaming of audio, songs, movies and YouTube videos from A2DP-compatible Bluetooth smart phones, tablets or multimedia devices.</p>
              <p>By using Clear Voice Capture (CVC) technology for noise suppression and echo cancellation, MyVoice 615 delivers exceptional sound quality that will exceed users' expectations. What's more, up to two mobile phones can be connected simultaneously through multipoint technology. Users on the go will appreciate the headset's quick charge function that provides 1.5 hours talk time with a mere 15-minute charge.</p>
              <p>A convenient voice dialing feature lets the user make hands-free calls simply by dictating the desired name stored in the contact list (this feature is phone-dependent). The headset also offers voice prompt messages to indicate low battery, successful pairing or connection, and call reject, redial and call terminated actions. A handy key lock button prevents calls from being made unintentionally.</p>
              <p>"With the launch of the MyVoice 615, we are not only expanding our product range but also satisfying market demand for a high-quality, functional and fashion-focused headset," said Ka Wong, Chief Technology Officer, i.Tech Dynamic Global Distribution Limited. "The A2DP and CVC technology gives users the pleasure of experiencing superior audio quality that they would only expect from full stereo headsets. Importantly, this headset can promote multi-tasking as a way to be more productive by allowing the user to easily stay in full control of their busy lifestyle."</p>
              <p>MyVoice 615 is not just a multi-functional Bluetooth headset -- it is also a fashion accessory. Inspired by different themes of modern urban lifestyles, a selection of eight chic finishes will be available to reflect the user's unique personality. From Civilized and Zen (peace of mind), Dazzle and Flirt (colorful life) to Soar and Zoom (racing pedigree) and Seduce and Tempt (fashion trend setter), there is a design to satisfy every person's style.</p>
              <p>Each unit will come with a number of handy accessories including USB charging cable, ergonomic ear hook, ear cushion, three extra ear buds and smart lanyard.</p>
              <p>MyVoice 615 is available in stores from mid-November and the suggested retail price is USD 58.</p>
