              <p>PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Global reputation strategist Leslie Gaines Ross and Standard Chartered Bank's global corporate affairs chief Mark Devadason are to lead a high profile group of speakers at the 2011 PublicAffairsAsia Corporate Affairs Forum.</p>
              <p>The theme of the interactive full-day forum is "The Reputation Agenda: Building - Safeguarding - Defending". The timely event, which is designed for senior corporate communications, public affairs and government relations practitioners, will examine how to develop and implement effective corporate reputation strategies in Asia Pacific.</p>
              <p>The forum comes as multinational corporations, governments, SOEs and NGOs come under intense scrutiny as they seek to develop, and maintain, their wider license to operate among regulators, the media, employees, governments and the public at large.</p>
              <p>Commenting on the 2011 Forum, PublicAffairsAsia's vice president Mark O'Brien said: "Corporate reputation is vital to the development of multinational corporations in the rapidly developing markets of Asia Pacific. But in an age of social media, diffuse stakeholder relationships and complex governmental and regulatory systems, building and defending reputation requires top-level engagement and significant corporate resources. This forum will equip managers with the insight and case studies to set about this task."</p>
              <p>The high-level conference -- which is limited to just 85 participants to ensure seniority and interactivity -- takes place on October 6, 2011 at The Marina Mandarin Hotel in Singapore and is supported by lead sponsor Weber Shandwick and lead partner AmCham Singapore.</p>
              <p>Gaines Ross, the Chief Global Reputation Strategist at Weber Shandwick, will open the forum by examining the key drivers and threats to corporate reputation: setting out how multinationals can build, maintain and defend their all-important reputation in Asia Pacific's diverse markets.</p>
              <p>Devadason, the Group Head of Regions Corporate Affairs at Standard Chartered Bank, leads the company's worldwide public and corporate affairs and was formerly CEO for the bank in both Japan and Thailand. He will examine how as reputational ambassadors, CEOs can utilise corporate affairs strategies to enhance their firm's reputation among influential stakeholder groups.</p>
              <p>Issues to be addressed at the 2011 Corporate Affairs Forum include building and defending corporate reputation among key influencers, internal stakeholder relations, the impact of social media, CSR, crisis communications, reputation and the law. Case studies will be presented by executives from multinationals including The Ford Motor Company and BASF.</p>

Okun, Director of Asia Pacific Public Affairs, KKR, Craig Hoy, Executive Director, PublicAffairsAsia, Evan Lewis, Vice President of Communications, Accor and Junie Del Mundo, CEO of EON, The Stakeholder Relations Firm.</p>
