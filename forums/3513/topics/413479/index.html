              TIEE 2010: Boundless Opportunities in Every Avenue of Learning
              
              BANGKOK, Oct. 19 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Thailand's policy on the liberalization of education in the 1990s has encouraged rapid development and expansion in the number of international education institutions in the Kingdom. Today, there are more than 400 international schools and higher education institutions in Bangkok and other major cities across the country, in addition to the English-based study programs currently available in the majority of state and private schools and colleges throughout the country.
              
              The choice of study courses is thus almost limitless, making it simple for students and concerned parents to select the desired course. Also, the comfortable standard of living and modern amenities available have attracted more and more students from overseas to study in this country, as the cost of study here is much lower than in most other parts of the world.
              
              The Thailand International Education Expo 2010 (TIEE 2010) taking place at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center in Bangkok from November 19-21, 2010 will be the country's biggest and most comprehensive event on international education in Thailand. Organized by the Department of Export Promotion (DEP), Ministry of Commerce under the theme, "ASEAN's Hub of Learning, The Heart of Global Network," the event will feature more than 200 exhibition booths offering the widest possible choice of education from primary to university level. This includes a selection of some 900 study programs, vocational courses and popular short courses such as Thai boxing, Thai cooking, traditional massage, and even aviation training. Specific language courses such as Mandarin, Japanese, French, German and Spanish are also highlighted, along with the many education-related spheres including computer software, educational toys and materials.
              
              Last year's event attracted more than 9,000 local and foreign visitors. The upcoming three-day educational funfest is almost certain to draw more than 10,000 people, especially the target group of students, parents and academic representatives.
              
              TIEE 2010 also presents great opportunities for scholarships and student loans, guidance and counselling as well as full information on insurance coverage, boarding and lodging. In addition, there will be workshops, seminars and discussions relating to education. With plentiful games and contests, prizes, gifts and souvenirs galore, TIEE 2010 promises to be an educational experience unlike any other in all of Southeast Asia.
