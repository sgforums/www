            <div class='col-md body'><p><br>First authorized distributor in Asia to launch an electronic components e-commerce site with an integrated China payment capability <br><br>HONG KONG, July 8 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Avnet Express, part of the Avnet Electronics Marketing operating group of Avnet, Inc. (NYSE: AVT), has launched a comprehensive e-commerce website in Asia. The site http://www.avnetexpress.com/asia represents the first distributor website in Asia to offer a China payment capability. <br><br>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/xprn/sa/200703010917.jpg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/xprn/sa/200703010917.jpg</span></span></a> ) <br><br>Known as Avnet Express, Asia, the new site provides design and purchasing executives at OEM and EMS firms with rapid access to inventory held across Asia. They can also enjoy online access to Avnet Electronics Marketing's global component menu, which now includes more than four million different parts. <br><br>"Right now about 15 percent of our web customers are shopping from Asia -- and having their parts shipped from the warehouse in the U.S. The ability to access and purchase inventory within Asia will provide Asia customers reduced cycle time and logistics costs, enabling them to order products from the location closest to their operation," said Beth Ely, senior vice president of new channel development for Avnet Electronics Marketing (EM). <br><br>"Local payment options and local customer service support from within the region will also make it easier for them to do business. Avnet Express is the first distributor to launch a website which will provide a consistent global platform with localized content and functionality," Ely added. <br><br>Avnet Express, Asia is a sophisticated e-commerce platform that enables a comprehensive end-to-end online service -- from part and inventory searches, price checking, ordering to online payment. The site has been designed with a host of powerful functions such as parametric part searches, Bill of Material (BOM) optimization and parts cross-referencing. It can be viewed in 13 currencies and nine languages, including simplified Chinese and Japanese and payments can be settled via AliPay, UnionPay, Visa and MasterCard. <br><br>With a rich library of information on 140 different franchised lines, Avnet Express, Asia offers engineers a fast and efficient resource to search Avnet EM's Asia inventory in real time to check on availability and pricing. The site also supports searches and ordering across different regions as well as worldwide, allowing customers to buy products from much further afield if necessary. <br><br>"Avnet Express Asia complements our existing business extremely well and is an integral part of the Avnet EM supply chain," said Stephen Wong, president of Avnet Electronics Marketing Asia. "We are well known for our design services and supply chain solutions. Now, leveraging the power of the Internet, Avnet Express, Asia extends our offering still further, giving customers the option of choosing different searching, ordering and purchasing models to suit their needs." <br><br>"Our regional teams can also provide field sales and application support if necessary to meet special customer requirements. This adds real value for customers and differentiates Avnet Express, Asia from typical e-commerce websites and is a further demonstration of our commitment to customer service," added Wong. <br><br>Follow us on Twitter @ http://twitter.com/AvnetDesignWire <br>Contribute to our technical forums @: http://community.em.avnet.com <br>View product and company videos @ <br>http://www.avnetondemand.com/components/channel/7/ <br>Buy our components @ http://www.avnetexpress.com/asia <br><br>About Avnet Electronics Marketing <br><br>Avnet Electronics Marketing is an operating group of Phoenix-based Avnet, Inc. that serves electronic original equipment manufacturers (EOEMs) and electronic manufacturing services (EMS) providers in more than 70 countries, distributing electronic components from leading manufacturers and providing associated design-chain and supply-chain services.
