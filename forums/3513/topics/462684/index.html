              Healthcare for Everyone -- DoctorPage.sg Leads the e-Health Industry in Singapore
              
              SINGAPORE, Dec. 6, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- DoctorPage.sg( https://www.doctorpage.sg ), a specialized healthcare portal that aims to connect patients and doctors across Asia, is now the number one e-health portal in Singapore, according to Alexa, the leading provider of global web metrics.
              
              Barely two months into its operation, DoctorPage has more than 300 doctors on its database with an active real-time appointment booking system. The e-health portal is created to bring convenience to users. It is a free portal for patients with clean pages that are extremely easy to navigate, whether they are looking for doctors by specialty or by location.
              
              Once a selection has been made, the website responds quickly and at a glance, users are able to see the doctor's experience, affiliations, the location of his/her clinic and even concise directions to get there. Patients can then make real-time appointment bookings with their preferred doctors and will be able to see a doctor as early as the following day.
              
              In addition, patients will also be prompted when there is an available slot that was cancelled last minute to decrease the waiting time to see a doctor. With DoctorPage, securing a doctor's appointment is as easy as a few clicks on the mouse.
              
              "The result is extremely encouraging. We set out two months ago to bring patients the best healthcare solution, and doctors, a value-added service to improve healthcare access in Asia," said Dr Dawn Soo, Co-Founder and Chief Information Officer (CIO) of DoctorPage. "We worked with our excellent online marketing team to create a cohesive and transparent touch-point for both doctors and patients. To be the market leader in the e-health industry in Singapore shows that what we are doing is right," she added.
              
              With a deep understanding of what the Singapore healthcare system is lacking and top-notch online marketing experience, DoctorPage improves the quality of the local healthcare experience and is set to expand its reach to the rest of Asia.
              
              "Having a physician and online marketing experts as founding entrepreneurs, DoctorPage combines patients' and doctors' needs with the advantages of internet technology. Now that we are positioned as the market leader in e-health in Singapore, we are confident of delivering more improvements to build the largest e-health platform in Asia," added Max-F. Scheichenost, Founder and Chief-Executive Officer (CEO) of DoctorPage.
              
              DoctorPage has just launched its mobile website so patients will have an even more user friendly mobile access. It launched the updated version of then iOS and iPad apps this month, which is available for download on iTunes( https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/doctorpage/id556796996?mt=8 ).
