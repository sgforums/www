              Companies to Gain Speed, Performance of Web Presence in China
              
              HONG KONG, Nov. 27, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Savvis, a CenturyLink company (NYSE: CTL) and leader in global cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions for enterprises, today expanded its website hosting capabilities for global brands that need a web presence in China.
              
              (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20111122/CG10879LOGO )
              
              Companies that host their web content using cloud computing, managed hosting or colocation at one of Savvis' data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore or Tokyo can now take advantage of virtual hosting services that simplify the process of getting web content into China while also achieving the end-user experience benefits of a local web presence.
              
              Complex local rules, poor interconnectivity and latency issues at international gateways plague foreign websites directed at China, impacting page loads and speed for consumers throughout the country. In addition, many global brands with online businesses face difficulty obtaining licenses for hosting content within China.
              
              "Chief marketing officers know that China is one of the most desirable markets in the world, but complicated regulations and other issues prevent their e-commerce sites, online product promotions and other web content from reaching this coveted audience," said Mark Smith, managing director, Asia, at Savvis. "Savvis' new virtual hosting service expands our array of enterprise-class offerings, making it easy for companies to enter the Chinese market and satisfy the consumer appetite for websites of foreign brands."
              
              A website-acceleration solution enables the virtual hosting services, using caching and dynamic delivery technologies to distribute web content to end-users in China through a widespread network of in-country content delivery network (CDN) nodes.
