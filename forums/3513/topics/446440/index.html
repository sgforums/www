            <div class='col-md body'><p>SINGAPORE, Jan. 31, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) announces the creation of its Asia-Pacific regional organization that includes Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, South Korea, South East Asia, Taiwan and Turkey. The Company believes this pan-Asia business model will help drive growth by leveraging best practices in the region, accessing the strong pool of local talent, and collaborating with healthcare professionals and regulatory agencies throughout the region. <br><br>"During the past year, we have laid a solid foundation for consistent growth in the key emerging markets of China and India. Our strategic investments in these countries have already begun to generate results and expand our regional footprint," said Hank Kucheman, Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. "We will now work to leverage these results to streamline our organization and strengthen our market position across Asia, the world's fastest growing region, by creating Boston Scientific Asia-Pacific." <br><br>The organization will be led by Supratim Bose, Executive Vice President and President, Asia-Pacific for Boston Scientific. Before joining Boston Scientific in January 2012, Mr. Bose was Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Singapore-based Bose Consulting Group, which specialized in strategic management consulting services for the healthcare industry. Previously, he worked for nearly 30 years at Johnson &amp; Johnson, where he concluded his tenure as the Company Group Chairman of its Medical Devices and Diagnostics (MD&amp;D) business in 2009. In this role, he managed Johnson &amp; Johnson's MD&amp;D companies throughout Asia-Pacific, including Japan, having pioneered its entry in all emerging markets in Asia, including China, India and Vietnam. <br><br>"I am honored to take on a leadership role in this newly created organization for such a well-recognized company and leader in the medical device industry," said Bose. "Our mission is to serve more patients in every market in this region. We have an incredible opportunity for growth, and I am excited to lead this team in establishing a greater presence for Boston Scientific in Asia-Pacific." <br><br>"Last year, Boston Scientific announced its plan to invest $150 million in China to build a facility for medical device manufacturing and healthcare provider training. Additional significant investments in India and other key markets in the region are planned," added Bose. "A major emphasis for growth will be in our drug-eluting stent (DES) business where our current market share in much of Asia-Pacific is far eclipsed by the Company's DES share in the U.S. and worldwide. We anticipate numerous planned product launches in the region in 2012, including the platinum chromium PROMUS Element(TM) Stent platform, which is expected to launch in Japan by mid-year." <br><br>About Boston Scientific Boston Scientific is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties.
