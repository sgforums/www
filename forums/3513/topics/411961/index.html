              <p>The Red Flag Group's Global Director of Due Diligence, Martin Jungclaus, said: "We recognise that our clients face the enormously challenging task of screening potential customers and third parties against international sanctions and watch lists. In addition to our enhanced due diligence services, our clients can now access screening and watchlist services themselves online, 24/7. The addition of the Dow Jones Risk &amp; Compliance databases to our product portfolio allows us to better provide corporate counsels and compliance officers the full range of services they need to build and maintain the culture of integrity so vitally important in business today."</p>
              <p>Mr Jungclaus added that, with the Dow Jones Risk &amp; Compliance databases, clients can now:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Confirm the identities of public officials, their families, and associates </li>
              <li>Identify sanctioned individuals and entities </li>
              <li>Identify companies or individuals with connection to state-owned entities </li>
              <li>Verify individuals convicted of corruption or linked to high-profile crimes and corruption </li>
              <li>Check hundreds of government sanction lists </li>
              <li>Access accurate global lists of politically exposed persons, their associates, and relatives. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Dow Jones' Head of Risk &amp; Compliance, Rupert de Ruig added: "Dow Jones Risk &amp; Compliance is quickly becoming the global standard for anti-corruption risk identification and our agreement with The Red Flag Group is a further extension of our global partner network.
