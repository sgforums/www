              </p><div class="xn-content" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">
              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct. 5, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for public and private clients in more than 130 countries around the world, announced today that it has completed its merger with KPK, a construction cost, contract and project management consultancy firm with operations across Asia. KPK joins AECOM's Davis Langdon operations and will go to market as "Davis Langdon KPK, an AECOM company". In Malaysia, KPK will continue to go to market as KPK Quantity Surveyors.</p>
              <p>KPK, which services clients in both the public and private sectors, was established in 1973 and has more than 600 people in Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Its established portfolio includes clients across a wide range of facilities such as commercial, residential, industrial and health care.&amp;nbsp;</p>
              <p>The company has worked on large-scale projects such as the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre in Malaysia, Watertown mixed-use development at Punggol in Singapore, The Met in Thailand, International Tech Park, Chennai in India, West Kowloon Cultural District in Hong Kong (Design Competition) and competition venues and a media centre for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in Mainland China.</p>
              <p>"The merger with KPK demonstrates AECOM's continued commitment to invest in new and emerging geographies. KPK's 39-year track record of providing construction cost, contract and project management consultancy services in Asia will add to the portfolio of our Davis Langdon cost and project consultancy business in the region," said AECOM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John M. Dionisio. "With 3,400 Davis Langdon employees located in more than 90 offices globally after the merger, we are well positioned to offer our clients comprehensive, global construction cost management services across Asia."</p>
              <p>"Asia's share of global construction spending has been forecasted to increase from 31 percent in 2005 to 46 percent by 2020, according to Davis Langdon's data," said Tony Shum, AECOM president for Asia Pacific. "KPK has been involved in some of the most notable projects in the region and AECOM will continue to build on these established relationships and in-depth understanding of the local cultures, and work together with KPK to expand our construction consultancy services in Asia."</p>
              <p>With the closing of the transaction, AECOM will have offices in nearly 60 cities with approximately 12,000 employees in the Asia-Pacific region. It offers local service excellence blended with global expertise and an integrated suite of services to address complex project challenges across various markets, ranging from building and construction services for commercial and residential facilities, to sport and healthcare infrastructure and large-scale transportation, water, energy and mining projects.</p>
              <p>"Davis Langdon and AECOM have gained recognition in many parts of the world for their success in challenging and complex projects such as the Abu Dhabi International Airport and The Shard in London," said KPK Chairman Dato' Sri Kandan. "We are delighted about the merger and believe it is also great news for our clients as KPK will provide more global service offerings. At the same time, we also are excited about the new professional-development opportunities the merger will bring for our employees."</p>
