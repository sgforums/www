Sierra Ma (left), General Manager, International Business Development of Letv, and Oyovwe Okorodudu (right), Assistant Vice President, EMEA of Hutchison Global Communications Limited receive the honour on behalf of Letv and HGC.</span></div>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The winning package comprises content from Letv -- the world's first video website and Internet video company to launch an IPO -- and superior broadband service delivered by Hutchison Global Communications Limited (HGC), a leading international fixed-line telecoms operator.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Run by the<em> Global Telecoms Business </em>magazine, the Global Telecoms Business Innovation Awards scheme recognises and rewards innovation and excellence throughout the international telecoms industry.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">After identifying huge consumer demand for online videos, Letv decided to collaborate with HGC's 3Home broadband to launch <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Hong Kong's</span> first bundling of 4K home broadband and entertainment content.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">A dedicated Letv broadband channel enables 3Home Broadband users to stream or download Letv's 4K ultra-HD videos, so they can enjoy a smoother and faster home entertainment experience. The bundle plan enables HGC to attract new customers seeking online video services, then delight them by going the extra mile to provide a high-definition entertainment experience. This strategic collaboration with HGC demonstrates Letv's vision for OTT industry development and enhances the company's ecosystem, while opening up opportunities for a greater share of the international market.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">HGC has become well known in industry circles for co-operating with OTT content providers and serving their needs. Last year, for example, HGC provided Letv with data centre hosting and colocation facilities, as well as international and local networking, plus customer and marketing services.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Letv's localised video content and smart devices then became part of <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Hong Kong's</span> first bundled offer comprising 4K home broadband service and entertainment programming. HGC's extensive fibre-optic local network and abundance of bandwidth enable HGC to identify and prioritise Letv's 4K ultra-HD content during transmission.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">What's more, the fact that this 4K content is stored in HGC's world-class data centres means latency -- or delay in transmission -- is absolutely minimal, ensuring a superb 4K TV picture. In fact, HGC's Application and Content Provider Solution has been helping world-renowned OTT service operators to expand their business footprints.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><em>Global Telecoms Business</em> Editor <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Alan Burkitt-Gray</span>, one of the awards scheme's judges, said: "The telecoms industry is increasingly looking to deal with content providers and content services to increase the quality of their offer to customers. This project between HGC and Letv is an imaginative collaboration between innovative companies to offer ultra-high definition entertainment services in the home, with excellent quality of performance."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Tin Mok, Vice President &amp; Executive Director, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia Pacific</span>, Letv Holdings (<span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Beijing</span>) Co Ltd, said: "Our co-operation with HGC is a milestone development for us because it enriches the Internet video content experience enjoyed by<span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Hong Kong</span> people, while giving rise to a new win-win collaboration model between telecoms operators and OTT companies. This serves as a breakthrough when compared with the traditional market business model. Our success in the GTB Awards represents recognition and endorsement of Letv's new collaborative model. We have been devoted to creating an Letv ecosystem as an Internet engine vertically-integrated to offer an online platform complete with content, terminals and applications. This collaboration leads the market and serves as an industry role model, taking such a mode of operation and user experience to a new level"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Jennifer Tan</span>, Chief Operating Officer of Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong Holdings Limited, said: "We are delighted to win this award alongside Letv because it demonstrates market and industry recognition of our innovative 4K home broadband and entertainment bundle. HGC's comprehensive optic-fibre network synergises with Letv's HD video programming to offer customers a fresh entertainment experience, while facilitating development of high-quality 4K TV entertainment."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">She added: "As well as providing network services, HGC has earned a glowing reputation for offering superior value-added services and one-stop solutions. We will continue to lead market development -- and keep up to speed with ever-rising customer demand -- by focusing on innovation."</p>
