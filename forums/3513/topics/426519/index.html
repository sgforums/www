              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SINGAPORE, March 29, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ --</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>Film meets Music</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Tuesday 29th March 2011, M2B World Asia Pacific Private Limited announced that its long standing cooperation with Qtrax is made manifest in a Strategic Co-operation Agreement for WOWtv and QTRAX sites, by last week's event of the Global music launch of QTRAX.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">M2B, a fully owned subsidiary of Amaru Inc, is a major Media Content owner and distributor, and a niche TV Broadcaster in Singapore, is proud to have combined film contents with Qtrax's downloadable music which is accessible worldwide.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Qtrax, the world's first major free legal music download finally hits the world market on March 2011. Media sources understands that the notoriously difficult legal copyrights issues has been resolved and this paves way for way music to be downloaded and enjoyed by the by millions of music-hungry internet users globally.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>Combination of 2 legal sites</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Speaking of the long and arduous road of music licensing rights, QTRAX's CEO, Mr Allan Klepfish chuckles, "this launch is long time in its gestation, and finally we are going to take the world by first by stealth, then by storm… it defines a new way in which the whole world is going to listen to music." He added with some satisfaction that "3 major labels, Universal, Sony and EMI will be featured in this launch, and with other major labels coming on stream this year."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">M2B's CEO Mr Percy Chua, said, "the concept of having music on its WOWtv Player has been in the company's wish list for a long time, but putting both film and music together legally across all countries is a major coup. Not many of the world's media players have the luxury of a vast content-base with perpetual rights across all platforms. Hence the meeting of WOWtv and QTRAX is a major accomplishment for both Companies who had inked a Strategic Co-operation Agreement earlier."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">These two sites work by complementing each other by directing traffic to each other. In addition the WOWtv player (www.wowtv.com ) has a special console button for which Qtrax Music Site (www.qtrax.com) is linked. So this massive music download  complements WOWtv's library of 5,000 film titles, 1500 hours of Video Fashion, i-Concerts (Geneva), Mr PAPARAZZI (UK), and a massive premium Chinese Content Channel also to be rolled out this year.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">This combination takes advantage of the synergy as both companies have contents with cross country rights. With QTRAX music legally downloadable globally, M2B is a natural partner as it has expanded on its global content rights and actively pursued the Asian Pacific market. It has also established for itself a vast distribution network right across Asia Pacific, China and Europe.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">With the combination of Music and Media entertainment online, M2B sees its revenue coming in from both Contents and Program sales, as well as the increased revenue from corporate and local advertisers, due to its increased global footprints and increasing eyeballs.  So, QTRAX Company and M2B/Amaru makes two interesting Internet Companies to watch this year, as the sound of music fills the digital globe.</p>
