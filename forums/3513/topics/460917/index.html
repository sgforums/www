              Children Speak up to Shape the Future at 'Be the Change' Exposition 2012
              45 projects shine at Singapore's largest showcase of social initiatives by children
              
              SINGAPORE, Oct. 31, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Be the Change Exposition 2012, Singapore's largest showcase of social initiatives by children, is back for the third time this year. Taking place on 8th November at The Pit Building, Republic Boulevard, from 9am to 12:30pm, the event expects to draw more than 350 children and guests, and welcomes theatre actress Karen Tan as SoCh ambassador.
              
              BTC exposition is the culminating activity for the annual Design for Change Singapore School Challenge, an international program that gives children an opportunity to design and implement solutions on issues that they feel are important.
              
              "Our vision is to put children in the driver's seat of social change initiatives. We have great faith in their ability to think, feel and do -- to change the world and shape the future," says Madhu Verma, Founder of SoCh in Action, the social enterprise that runs the DFC program in Singapore.
              
              Themed "I CAN Shape the Future", BTC exposition is a platform for children's ideas to shine and their voices to be heard. Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) will take the opportunity to gather views from children on a wide range of future-defining topics. OSC recognises BTC as one of many ground-up initiatives worth leveraging, and commends how the program encourages and empowers children to be one of the key change-agents of society.
              
              BTC exposition will showcase projects conceived and developed by children over guided workshops facilitated by SoCh in Action across primary and secondary schools nationwide. Children offer solutions that address a variety of issues such as underage smoking, integration of autistic adults, challenges of being visually impaired, and lack of courtesy on public transport.
              
              "The projects touch on issues that are close to children's hearts and are very local. We've seen a few which focus on caring for the elderly; such as designing products like massage slippers and key finders that make like easier for the elderly," adds Verma.
              
              Kylicia Soo, Character and Citizenship Education Officer, Ministry of Education, shares: "I was heartened to see the innovative ways in which students helped to improve the lives of people in the community. As part of the judging panel, I felt that the students had lived up to the theme of believing that 'I CAN Shape the Future'."
              
              BTC exposition promises to be a fun-filled event with an exciting line-up of interactive games and activities using different media like forum theatre, cartooning, multimedia collage, and many more that will inspire children to think and express their views about on social challenges. 
              
              Be The Change Exposition 2012 is proudly supported by POSB PAssion Kids Fund and Central Singapore Community Development Council's Mayor's Imagine Fund, which aims to promote active citizenry among today's youth.
