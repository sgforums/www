              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SINGAPORE, Sept. 26, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- DHL’s innovative investment and operational strategy across Africa has won it international recognition at the prestigious Africa investor CEO Investment Climate Summit 2011, organized by Africa investor in association with the World Bank Group.

              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Mr. Diallo said: “Africa is one of DHL’s fastest growing regions in the network markets. We have the finest team in Africa and this year we have focussed on investing and growing our human resources and infrastructure to ensure African businesses have access to the logistics excellence they need.
