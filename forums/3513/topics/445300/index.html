The text mentioned in paragraph two has been corrected, from "most" to "the other", and from "up to 18mbps, and up to 30mbps for their premium plans " to "15mbps regardless of users' subscription plans " and "by 2012" in paragraph three has been removed. <br><br>The complete, corrected release follows: <br><br>Viewqwest Launches Residential Next Generation National Broadband Network in Singapore <br><br>The first OpCo that will not implement a cap on International bandwidth <br><br>SINGAPORE, Jan. 10, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Viewqwest, a leading provider of next generation connectivity,has announced that they will be rolling out their residential Next Generation Nation Broadband Network (NGNBN) in Singapore through their Fibernet service in the first quarter of 2012. Home owners will now be able to gain access to cost effective next-generation fiber optic connectivity with ultra high speeds. <br><br>Viewqwest is the first OpCo that will not implement a cap on International bandwidth. Currently most connectivity providers are capping International bandwidth at up to 18mbps, and up to 30mbps for their premium plans. Viewqwest's customers' will get optimal connectivity and will be able to experience up to the subscribed bandwidth for International connectivity. <br><br>As part of its phased out launch approach, the residential roll outs will take place in seven out of the nine exchanges in Singapore, specifically in the Orchard, Ayer Rajah, East, Jurong West, Tuas, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok exchanges. This comes in line with the government's plans to connect homes and offices nationwide to Singapore's ultra high-speed NGNBN Network. <br><br>"Consumers these days are more informed and demand much more in what they want." said Vignesa Moorthy, Chief Executive Officer, Viewqwest. "At Viewqwest, we take pride in providing only the best to our customers in terms of 24/7 service and unparalleled connectivity." <br><br>Viewqwest NGBN services for residents will also be based on a pure L2 core, unlike the current players in the market, who offer their fiber solutions on a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) core. These services are implemented using Virtual private network (VPN) services which add needless complexity and delays to the network. Without the overhead of MPLS, Viewqwest is able to deliver a lower latency network that is both robust and reliable. <br><br>By partnering with Force10 and Zhone, Viewqwest is also able to deliver best of breed Gigabit Passive Optics Network (GPON) and Active Ethernet services. Viewqwest also does not believe in the use of web proxies or caches to save on bandwidth. The use of web proxies or caches sometimes has undesirable effects in relation to dynamic content on the Internet where the wrong or outdated information is displayed. It may also result in a less than optimal experience for consumers and avid gamers. <br><br>Viewqwest also provides Next Generation National Broadband Network solutions for organizations and plan to be active in all nine Singapore exchanges before April this year. <br><br>About Viewqwest <br><br>Viewqwest, a member of the Comcraft global group, provides best-of-breed business communications services to the Top 500 Small &amp; Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Fortune 500 companies. <br><br>As a pioneer business communications company in Singapore, Viewqwest has one of the most innovative suite of business class services that range from Internet Connectivity, IT Managed Services and Outsourced Telephony Business Services.
