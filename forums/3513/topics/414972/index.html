              <p>Social Change by Children fosters children's role in creating better societies now and for the future <br><br>SINGAPORE, Nov. 9, 2010 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- A children's social exposition dubbed "Social Change by Children" is happening in Singapore for the first time on November 20, 2010, in conjunction with the United Nation's Universal Children's Day. <br><br>Driven by a group of Singapore-based volunteers and supported by Maybank and Shell, Social Change by Children (SoCh) aims to nurture the role of children in bringing about meaningful social change. It is an extension arm of the Singapore chapter of the Design for Change Contest, an international program reaching out to 50,000 schools in 25 countries. <br><br>"Design for Change is an innovative and exciting competition for 9 to 14 year-olds that was launched this year in Singapore. SoCh basically builds on the vision of Design for Change by providing a creative and inspiring platform for children to interact and share their ideas for social change programmes, and for adults from all walks of life to learn about the children's efforts," says Madhu Verma, head of the SoCh organizing committee. <br><br>The SoCh expo will take place at the Raffles Girls' Campus, and is open to all free of charge. Visitors will get to see this year's Design for Change entries and a collection of creative social projects by Singapore school children. The exposition will begin at 10:30 am, with various interactive workshops and hands-on activities happening in the sidelines. <br><br>"SoCh unequivocally believes in children and is committed to empowering them. Being young is a strength; not a weakness. Young minds spark bright, spontaneous ideas for social change and we would like to encourage them to celebrate that ability and to nurture it," she adds. <br><br>Although the call for entries under Design for Change has passed, SoCh remains open to receiving project submissions from primary and secondary schools and children's communities until the 10th of November 2010. <br><br>Parents, teachers and independent groups who want to highlight the projects of their children are encouraged to visit the SoCh website and sign up as a SoCh exhibitor. If they miss the opportunity this year, interested parties can join the Design for Change in 2011 and the years to come.

The Design for Change Contest is an attempt to change how we relate to our society, people and environment. Soch, in Hindi, translated means "thought", because before any creation takes birth in the world, it takes birth in the mind, as a thought. <br><br>For more information on Design for Change Contest, see: http://www.designforchangecontest.com/ <br><br>Media Contacts <br><br>Madhu Verma <br>Head of SoCh <br>Email: madhuverma29@gmail.com <br><br>Donna Garcia/Rasyida Samsudin <br>Rice Communications for SoCh <br>Email: donna.garcia@ricecomms.com / rasyida.samsudin@ricecomms.com <br><br><br>SOURCE Social Change by Children (SoCh) <br><br></p>
