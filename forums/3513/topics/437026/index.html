              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Following a purchase agreement signed yesterday, a TPG Capital affiliate will acquire a 30% stake in the Company (along with an option to increase its stake to 40%) from existing investors, including General Atlantic, a global growth investor and Banco Espirito Santo, a leading Portuguese bank, amongst others. The founders, Kim Fournais and Lars Seier Christensen will retain majority ownership and continue in their roles as CEOs, also in the event that TPG Capital exercises its option to acquire 40%. TPG Capital's investment is subject to customary regulatory and competition authority approvals.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"We are delighted to welcome one of the world's leading investment firms as a major shareholder and business partner. This new phase in Saxo Bank's growth stems from the strong foundation built with the support from our selling shareholders, who have shared in our success to date.  We remain enthusiastic about Saxo Bank's future and look forward to working with TPG Capital to capitalise on the many opportunities ahead."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Asiff Hirji, Partner at TPG Capital said:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"Saxo Bank has achieved impressive growth and we look forward to supporting the future diversification strategy.

              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Bill Ford, CEO of General Atlantic and Ricardo Salgado, CEO of Banco Espirito said in a joint statement: </p>
