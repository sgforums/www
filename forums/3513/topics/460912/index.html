              Leverages strategic partnership with Blue Jeans Network in Asia Pacific
              
              Cloud-based Service Makes Video Conferencing as Accessible, Easy-to-Use as Audio
              
              SINGAPORE, Oct. 25, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- InterCall, a subsidiary of West Corporation and the world's largest conferencing and collaboration services provider announced today the availability of the Blue Jeans service in Asia Pacific, supplementing InterCall's leading portfolio of audio and web conferencing portfolio with Blue Jeans' robust multi-party video conferencing.
              
              By leveraging the partnership with Blue Jeans Network, the leader in interoperable video conferencing services, InterCall, allows users to engage in easy-to-use, interoperable video collaboration using a variety of leading devices and applications from Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Polycom, Skype, and even common web browsers. The platform is cloud-based, and customers familiar with InterCall's audio conferencing solutions will find it just as accessible and easy to use.
              
              "The Blue Jeans offering eliminates the challenges that make video conferencing difficult," said Jon Bratsis, Director of Unified Communications for InterCall in Asia Pacific. "By allowing users to join a meeting from various devices and applications, video conferencing is now a more viable meeting choice than ever before."
              
              The Blue Jeans platform provides a cost-effective, scalable solution that enables workers to collaborate within the enterprise and beyond. The secure service extends the reach of video conferencing beyond specialized rooms so colleagues and clients can connect without worrying about location or device, including any video-enabled tool or a standard phone line. As a cloud-based offering, Blue Jeans allows customers to avoid the high costs and complexities associated with traditional on-premise bridging solutions (commonly known as multipoint control units, or MCUs).
              
              "Partnering with InterCall allows us to serve more customers who are in need of easy-to-use and accessible video conferencing solutions," said Imran Moin, Director of Business Development at Blue Jeans Network. "Since the Blue Jeans platform is cloud-based, there is no new hardware to deploy or software to download. A few clicks is all it takes to schedule, host, join and run video-enabled meetings."
              
              This new offering marks yet another significant business milestone for InterCall, which works with the top companies in the conferencing and collaboration field, including Adobe, Cisco, Microsoft and Polycom. The broad range of offerings, coupled with the high standards of service delivery helped InterCall maintain industry leadership in the region, evidenced by receipt of the Frost &amp; Sullivan Asia Pacific Conferencing Provider of the Year award for the fifth consecutive year in 2012.
