              1,000 Signed Doctors Now Using DocDoc's Medical Appointment Portal
              
              Asia's leading medical specialist appointment portal, now has the largest group of doctors in Singapore and South Korea using its online system to acquire new patients.
              
              SINGAPORE, Jan. 16, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- DocDoc Pte. Ltd. (http://docdoc.com), the fastest and most convenient way for patients to find the right doctor and book an appointment online, has announced they've reached a sales milestone within the healthcare industry, with 1,000 signed doctors in Singapore and South Korea now utilizing its appointment booking platform to acquire new patients. DocDoc is growing rapidly. In fact, the company reached this sales triumph just five months after launching its service.

              The mark firmly establishes DocDoc as the go-to medical specialist portal in Asia and underscores the company's commitment to bringing marketing expertise to the underserved medical specialist market.
              
              "Building Asia's largest coalition of top physicians and connecting them with patients is an exciting accomplishment for our entire company," said Grace Park, CEO at DocDoc. "Our skilled sales team has done a first-rate job getting doctors onboard, which has given us the opportunity to clearly demonstrate our expertise in sourcing new customers."
              
              "Hands down, DocDoc is the best patient empowerment platform in Asia because we've made the process fast, easy and free," claims Jon Samsel, CMO at DocDoc. "Patients using DocDoc can quickly find the best medical specialist to meet their needs, such as an ophthalmologist, plastic surgeon, dermatologist or dentist, freeing up time to have more meaningful conversations with their physicians about appropriate care."
              
              Waiting for weeks and sometimes months to find a specialist is becoming all too common for patients in Singapore and South Korea. Many are forced to wait up to three weeks to get an appointment with a specialist. Patients can easily look for doctors by searching through doctor profiles and once they find the right one, viewing the exact time slots the doctor has available and then make an appointment.
              
              On the physicians' side, filling empty appointments and efficiently managing various marketing campaigns is a tough task. DocDoc helps doctors source new patients by filling appointments that are rescheduled or cancelled at the last moment.
              
              To support Asia's diverse population and cultural backgrounds, DocDoc is available in multiple languages including English, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Bahasa Indonesia. The company's website and mobile site, as well as its mobile app for iPhone, are free for patients.
