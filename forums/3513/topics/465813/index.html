              Routes Americas Officially Handed over to El Salvador 
              2013/02/14 10:51
              CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, Colombia, Feb. 13, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --
              
              After a record breaking event in Cartagena, which saw over 400 delegates in attendance Sociedad Aeroportuaria de la Costa S.A (SACSA) have handed the event over to El Salvador the host destination of the 7th Routes Americas event which will take place in early 2014.
              
              The Honourable Minister of Tourism Mr. Jose Napoleon Duarte Duran was instrumental in securing the hosting of the 2014 event which will welcome the region's aviation industry leaders to El Salvador and show what the country can offer as a tourist destination as well as its great potential for business.
              
              Speaking during the handover ceremony which took place today in Cartagena at the 6th Routes Americas event, Ms. Sandra Trujillo Velez, Honorary Consul to El Salvador said:  "For El Salvador it will be an honour to host this great event in 2014, and we expect to see all of you next year in our country so you can experience the warmth of our people."
              
              "After such a successful event here in Cartagena we are eagerly awaiting next year's event," said Nigel Mayes, VP &amp; Commercial for Routes.  Mayes continued:  "Routes Americas has potential for even more growth and we are again expecting record numbers to come to El Salvador.  We are delighted to be taking Routes Americas to this fast emerging tourist destination with its impressive record of adding a new international air service every year since 2009.  Our delegates will be able to see all that El Salvador has to offer and come to one event and discuss market opportunities for the entire Americas region."
              
              El Salvador is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America and transfer time from place to place does not exceed 30 minutes.  It is a versatile country which combines ancient culture with modern life and mixes business with nature.  Since El Salvador adopted the US Dollar as its legal currency in 2001 it has become an international tourist destination for more than 1.6 million travellers due to the economic stability provided by this change in currency.  
              
              El Salvador Airport's location, at only 27m above sea level makes it one of the safest airports in the region with one of the longest runways in Central America.  A renovation project costing $32 million has been approved and works will be ongoing until January 2014, just prior to Routes Americas which will take place in February.  This project will significantly improve passenger experience and assist airlines to improve their operational performance.
              
              Every year since 2009 the airport has attracted a new international airline including Iberia, Spirit, Air Transat and, more recently, Aeromexico. The airport is also a Hub for one of the fastest growing airlines in Latin America; Avianca-Taca connecting passengers to South, Central and North America with more than 10 non-stop flights.
