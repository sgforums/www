            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">SINGAPORE, Oct. 17, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- As a volatile global economy continues to create uncertainty for investors, fund managers are becoming increasingly concerned about potential claims by their clients of mismanagement and negligence, repeating a trend that emerged in the wake of the global financial crisis. <br><br>To help the large number of Notified Fund Management Companies ("Notified FMCs") in Singapore manage their risk exposures Marsh, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, today launched the Investment Management Insurance Scheme. The offering combines directors' and officers' liability insurance, professional indemnity insurance and crime insurance into a single customised package. <br><br>"Singapore has been tipped to overtake Switzerland as the world's top wealth management centre within the next two years, as the city-state benefits from growth in neighbouring emerging markets, a supportive regulator and a stable political climate," said Gary Chua, Marsh's Financial and Professional Risks Practice Leader for ASEAN. <br><br>"Risk management is a critical factor for investors when deciding who to entrust with their capital. In fact, institutional investors often require the fund managers they engage with to have Professional Indemnity insurance." <br><br>As part of the Capital Market Services (CMS) licensing requirements, representatives may be required to purchase professional indemnity insurance. However, this requirement does not apply to Notified FMCs, or those fund managers with up to 30 qualified investors or less than S$250 million in Assets Under Management. <br><br>"All fund managers, regardless of license status, size or type, are equally exposed to the risk of investor lawsuits or regulatory action. The Investment Management Insurance Scheme will help this important segment of the Singapore financial services sector to manage its risk more effectively," said Mr Chua. <br><br>About the Investment Management Insurance Scheme <br><br>The Investment Management Insurance Scheme is underwritten by ACE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd and is customised for Notified Fund Management Companies in Singapore. <br><br>The Investment Management Insurance Scheme is designed for fund managers who have: <br><br>-- Assets under management of less than S$250 million, or <br>-- Up to 30 qualified investors, or <br>-- Manage less than 15 funds <br><br>The Investment Management Insurance Scheme offers the following insurance coverage highlights: <br><br>-- Directors' &amp; Officers' Liability Insurance (D&amp;O): protecting <br>individuals for specific management and personal liabilities <br>-- Professional Indemnity Insurance (PI): covering investment <br>services offered by investment managers and advisors <br>-- Crime Insurance: protecting investment managers and funds from <br>theft by employees <br><br>The Investment Management Insurance Scheme is meant for the following types of fund managers: <br><br>-- Listed Equity <br>-- Hedge Fund <br>-- REITs <br>-- Private Equity <br>-- Venture Capital <br>-- Fund of Fund <br>-- Fund of Hedge Fund <br>-- Hybrid of any of the above <br><br>For More Information <br><br>For more information, please visit www.marsh.com.sg/finpro_scheme.html where fund managers are able to obtain a no-obligation quote within 48 hours by completing an online form. <br><br>Free Seminar <br><br>Marsh is hosting a free breakfast seminar on the issue of professional liability for fund managers during market volatility on 28 October 2011.
