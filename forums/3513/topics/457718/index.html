              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">SINGAPORE, Aug. 23, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- RMIT University Vietnam has entered a strategic partnership with leading international testing, instrumentation and measurement technology company National Instruments (NI).</span></p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">
              <p>The deal will see National Instruments support RMIT Vietnam's technology and engineering programs through joint training and educational activities, as well as providing internship opportunities for students.</p>
              <p>In addition, the company will provide US$16,000 over the next two years to further develop the Master of Engineering (Electronic and Computer Engineering) program and RMIT Vietnam's purpose built electronic engineering laboratory facilities. National Instruments will also continue providing input and advice on the engineering courses offered at RMIT Vietnam by participating in the Industry Engagement Committee of the Centre of Technology.</p>
              <p>RMIT University Vietnam President Professor Merilyn Liddell said the agreement further cemented the Centre of Technology's links with major industry players.</p>
              <p>"National Instruments is a world-renowned organisation and it is this kind of cooperation that helps prepare our students to take up roles with major international companies," she said.</p>
              <p>"Because of the particular skills and knowledge our Master of Engineering graduates acquire, they really do have a passport to the world in terms of the career options available to them."</p>
              <p>Professor Liddell said the input of National Instruments into the development of the program would ensure it continued to be relevant to industry and at the leading edge of technical development.</p>
              <p>Mr. Chandran Nair, Managing Director of National Instruments Southeast Asia said, "RMIT is focused on industry relevant education through a comprehensive curriculum. Modern laboratory facilities, software and hardware tools including those from NI for hands-on and project based learning will help RMIT graduates be better placed to contribute immediately to the companies that hire them.</p>
              <p>"National Instruments is proud to partner with RMIT both in Australia and in Vietnam. We work extensively with leading universities worldwide to train engineers in the latest technologies through our global academic programs and this partnership with RMIT will help graduate very good engineers with industry relevant skills," he added.</p>
              <p>The Memorandum of Understanding between RMIT Vietnam and National Instruments was signed at a ceremony at the Caravelle Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City on Tuesday evening, 21 August.</p>
