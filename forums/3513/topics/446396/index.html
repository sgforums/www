            <div class='col-md body'><p>SYDNEY, Jan. 30, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Saxo Capital Markets (Australia) Pty Ltd ('SCM Australia') , the online trading and investment specialist, today announced the launch of its retail operations in Australia, offering investors the opportunity to trade thousands of asset classes across award-winning online platforms. <br><br>Saxo Capital Markets (Australia) Pty Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saxo Bank A/S. It holds an Australian Financial Services Licence 280372 and is regulated by the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission. <br><br>The move extends Saxo Bank Group's reach in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific, and is consistent with its goal of being the premier multi-asset online trading platform in the world. <br><br>SCM Australia offers local traders sophisticated trading platforms such as SaxoTrader and SaxoWebTrader, permitting the trading of foreign exchange, CFDs and stocks with live streaming prices and lightning-fast stock trades. SCM Australia provides clients with access to over 160 foreign exchange crosses, more than 13,000 stocks from 25 major exchanges and over 140 Futures contracts on live market prices from over 19 exchanges. SCM Australia's CEO Anthony Griffin said the company believed it had the services and competitive offering to transform the online trading market in Australia. <br><br>Mr Griffin states, "In Australia, we will be adopting the standard Saxo business model that has been successfully implemented in over 20 countries and bringing our award-winning platforms to the market." <br><br>Further, he states, "It was critical to ensure that investors were educated as much as possible on the asset classes they were trading in and the risks involved. As a result, SCM has a number of online educational tools available to ensure investors are informed." <br><br>SCM Australia recently completed the acquisition of Logos Commodities Pty Ltd, the holding company of Commodity Broking Services Pty Ltd, bringing with it an excellent client base and broadening its suite of services. <br><br>Kim Fournais and Lars Seier Christensen, co-founders and CEOs of Saxo Bank, said in a joint statement: <br><br>"While opening an office in Sydney is a strategic decision to support our Asia-Pacific expansion and growth strategy, it has always been a priority for Saxo Bank. The acquisition has brought with it both tremendous staff as well as a great range of clients. That has given us the critical mass for doing business here. This is a good time for us to prove our commitment to the Australian market." <br><br>Saxo Bank was founded in 1992. Saxo Bank's trading platforms have defined the company's success in the online trading space for over a decade. Since introducing the SaxoTrader in 1998, Saxo Bank has enhanced and improved its platforms to meet the evolving needs of traders and investors in a continuously changing industry. The Group has expanded overseas since 2006 and now has operations in more than 20 countries including major financial centres such as Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, London, Zurich, Dubai, and Paris. <br><br>Disclaimer: <br><br>Saxo Capital Markets (Australia) Pty Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saxo Bank A/S, the Copenhagen-headquartered online trading and investment specialist.
