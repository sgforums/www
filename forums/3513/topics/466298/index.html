              MWC 2013
              
              BARCELONA, Spain, Feb. 25, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --
              
              Acision supports customers through evolving mobile messaging ecosystem, creating service value with expertise in Deployment, Support and Professional Services
              Acision deploys first virtualised MMSC, leading the way in future service delivery
              As the global leader in mobile messaging and experts in deploying messaging solutions to customers for over 20 years, Acision today announced the launch of its new Global Services Portfolio. Designed in line with the changing dynamics of the mobile messaging and service delivery landscape, Acision's new Global Services Portfolio focuses on 'Value Creation', providing products and services to support its customers throughout the entire messaging lifecycle - from early design phases through to end-of-life management and migration towards next generation technology.  With a new structure developed across its Deployment, Professional Services and Support teams, Acision provides its customers with a range of services for todays, tomorrows and future networks.
              
              "Over the past few years the dynamics of the mobile messaging ecosystem have changed radically, with a profusion of new IP, over-the-top (OTT) and social network messaging services penetrating the industry and taking both mind and market share.  With researchers forecasting that global mobile messaging revenues could grow to $195.9 billion by 2016, messaging traffic from the expanse of services are likely to double over the next three years," said Rob Bellis, EVP Global Services, Acision. "Remaining relevant in today's fast-paced, services-orientated world is a challenge for all players, and to survive means to carve out a unique role, which means delivering services and solutions which are a step ahead of the rest, can efficiently and effectively be deployed, maintained and managed, and can be successfully monetised by gaining insights into performance and traffic flows.  Because of our enduring legacy in messaging, Acision has now developed a solid portfolio of services to help our customers do just that - bring services to market faster and get full value from them."
              
              Acision's Global Services portfolio across Deployment, Support and Professional Services are very much tailored to create value and better utilise Acision platforms deployed at the customer network or in the cloud. Acision's approach ensures it can deliver best in class services at lower costs and with maximum return for the customer, while also supporting them through the transition from in-network based services to IP and cloud delivery models. For all stages of the lifecycle, Acision offers competitive value-based services, modular service packages and premium Professional Services delivered by Acision's Global Services experts.
              
              "With a team of comprehensive experts covering all areas of messaging technology and understanding the end-to-end customer lifecycle, Acision takes care of its customers' needs and enables them to focus on their core business. With our new Global Services Portfolio we can help our customers achieve service stability, availability, operational efficiency, service continuity, service packaging as well the fast delivery of new services.  Success is based on providing invaluable services and Acision helps our customers achieve this," continued Bellis.
              
              A recent example of Acision's outstanding capability is the deployment, management and maintenance of the first software-only MMS infrastructure in a live network.  This not only increased cost savings and faster return on investment (ROI) for the customer involved but reduced hardware investment, deployment time and rack space, while ensuring the high quality of experience expected by end users. Acision's virtualised MMSC is leading multimedia messaging market delivery by enabling automatic provisioning for first-time users, applying media adaptation to match the retrieving phone's capabilities, and providing proven MMSC interoperability in order to deliver messages to other operator networks.
              
              "The success of this deployment is a testament to our Global Services team and the stability of our MMSC platform, which is the most advanced in the market. As part of this changeover to virtualised, software-only platforms, we are witnessing exciting progress in driving the next phase of messaging delivery and we are well equipped to help our customers in this transition. I am proud to be part of this first for Acision and a first globally," Bellis concluded.
