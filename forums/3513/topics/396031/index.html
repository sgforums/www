He served as Chief Executive Officer from 2000 to 2009 and as Chairman of the Board from 2002 to 2009. <br><br>As CEO, Mr. Lafley led a dramatic transformation of P&amp;G, which included re-focusing the company on: core businesses and brands; faster-growing and higher-margin beauty, grooming and health care segments; and building market share in developing countries. Under his leadership the number of P&amp;G billion-dollar brands grew from 10 to 24, and the company more than doubled sales from US$38 billion in 1999 to US$79 billion in 2009.

"His experience building strong business operations, promoting innovation, and spurring growth across global markets enhances our value creation capabilities." <br><br>"Private equity can be a powerful agent of constructive change and corporate renewal," said Mr. Lafley. "CD&amp;R's successful history of building long-term value by improving the operational performance of its portfolio businesses exemplifies the positive role that private equity can play in the economy and is what attracted me to the firm." <br><br>Mr. Lafley has been honored with some of the highest recognitions in business.
