Using Web 2.0 technology, Compare Clinic facilitates three-way communication among patients and between healthcare manufacturers, medical doctors and dentists. We help people make informed decisions as to what dental and medical treatment they should receive and where they can go for that," commented Henrik Petersen, a founder of Compare Clinic. <br><br>"Our ultimate goal is to connect patients with trusted healthcare professionals. In turn, healthcare service providers can reach out to more patients and build reputation. Together, these help optimize healthcare resources and capacity in society at large.

Asia's population is expected to grow to 4.5 billion or 60% of the world's population, by 2050. Technology adopted by Compare Clinic will revolutionize how healthcare services will be offered and marketed," commented Virginia Chan, Director of Compare Clinic. <br><br>The rise of medical tourism and mobility of people <br><br>Medical tourism is becoming a major push factor for economic development in APAC. Frost &amp; Sullivan reported that the Asian medical tourism market is estimated to reach US$4.4 billion in 2012 with a projected CAGR of 15% for the next 5 years. Increasingly, the market sees a clientele shift of medical tourists from westerners to affluent Asians.
