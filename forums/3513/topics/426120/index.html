              <p>G2E Asia 2011 Links Exhibitors With World's Fastest Growing Markets</p>
              <p>Products and Services Showcasing Opportunities Amongst Asia's Booming Gaming Industry Leaders</p>
              <p>MACAU, March 24, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Building on its record of success in recent years, Global Gaming Expo Asia (G2E Asia) 2011 will be held June 7-9 at the Cotai Stip CotaiExpo at the Venetian Macao. The region's top gaming event, G2E Asia combines leading-edge exhibitions, trend-setting conference programs, and an unmatched group of industry leaders and offers exceptional business platforms and networking opportunities for equipment suppliers, service providers and operators to tap the booming Asian gaming market.</p>
              <p>G2E Asia 2011 features a revamped exhibit floor and multi-faceted promotional support to connect exhibitors with customers and new buyers. The Security and Surveillance Pavilion and the Green/Lighting Pavilion showcase these leading product categories in response to growing regional demand. The newly developed My G2E Asia Show Planner helps buyers customize exhibit floor visits for maximum efficiency, including contacting exhibitors to set up appointments during the show and submitting requests for product information. This year's enhanced exhibitor promotion offerings also include outreach to potential customers through social networking and exhibitor highlights in industry e-newsletters and other online publications -- all designed to ensure exhibitors comprehensive exposure to the dramatic growth opportunities in Asia.</p>
              <p>"Asia is increasingly where the growth is in global gaming, and research indicates the trend has only just begun," said Brian Thomas, vice president gaming of Reed Exhibitions. "G2E Asia 2011 gathers the gaming industry together at the epicenter of new opportunities at the time when major projects in Macau and beyond are moving rapidly toward completion phase. It's the right event, in the right place, at the right time to benefit from the growth sweeping the gaming industry in Asia."</p>
              <p>In close proximity of the G2E Asia 2011 venue, Sands China and Galaxy Entertainment Group are enhancing their footprint in Cotai - Macau's new gaming hub. Every other Macau gaming concessionaire also is planning new projects in Cotai. The city's gaming revenue growth has been remarkable, reaching $22.4 billion last year, an increase of 58 percent, and confirming its place as the world's top gaming market with more than twice the gaming revenue of the entire state of Nevada.</p>
              <p>Beyond Macau, multi-billion dollar gaming projects are due for completion within the next two years across Asia. The openings of the first phase of Bagong Nayong Pilipino Manila Bay Entertainment City in the Philippines and the MGM Grand Ho Tram in Vietnam will put those countries on the world's travel map as global gaming destinations and drive further development in both markets. In Cambodia and Laos, gaming is expanding to record levels, while legalization will be implemented next year in Sri Lanka, tipped by The New York Times as the latest trendy tourism spot.</p>
              <p>Leading accounting and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts a compound annual growth of 23.6 percent for Asia-Pacific gaming markets in the five years to 2014.  G2E Asia 2011 puts exhibitors in prime position to share in this surge of expansion across the region.</p>
