            <div class='col-md body'><p>Accessing capital, Building Brands, Crossing Borders <br><br>NEW YORK, Nov. 3, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- What role should the retail real estate industry play in communities and economies around the world? The International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) 2012 Retail Real Estate World Summit will explore this very question. Retail property development opens the door to a variety of benefits to local communities including creating jobs and providing much needed sales tax revenues, which fund important services like schools and hospitals, as well as fire and police departments. Continuing to make these important economic and social contributions takes a concerted effort, which is why ICSC hosts the World Summit every five years, providing a platform to analyze the industry's effectiveness in providing these contributions, as well as the opportunity to implement positive changes in the years to come. <br><br>"It's important for the industry to gather every few years to take stock of how retail real estate has become a catalyst for continued growth on both a social and economic level," said Michael P. Kercheval, president and CEO of ICSC. "By identifying the proper roles for the industry, we can maximize its growth potential and, ultimately, its reach." <br><br>Taking place on September 12-14, 2012, the World Summit will be held in Shanghai, China and will include attendees from over forty countries. <br><br>Due to its rapid development over the last two decades, Shanghai has once again become a leading global city. Its significant influence in commerce, culture, finance, media, fashion, technology and transport makes it an ideal spot for the World Summit. After all, when the topic of discussion is the position of shopping centers within a community and economy, what better place to act as host than a burgeoning metropolis with its finger on the pulse of the future? <br><br>The 2012 World Summit's Exhibition is one of the event's many highlights. Featuring a full day of deal making, the exhibition will offer attendees the chance to discuss business opportunities throughout the world. Additionally, the Exhibition will include over sixty booths, showcasing the most important companies around the world. <br><br>Another significant attraction that will be featured in the World Summit is a tour of shopping centers in Shanghai. Hitting four local shopping centers, the study tour will provide participants with exposure to fresh ideas and innovations that could potentially be implemented into their own centers. Through meeting with management teams of each center, sharing experiences, and discussing architectural and design concepts, attendees are sure to leave with more than just a brochure. <br><br>The 2012 ICSC World Summit will be hosted in conjunction with ICSC RECon Asia. For more information please visit www.icsc.org/2012RWS . <br><br>Founded in 1957, ICSC is the premier global trade association of the shopping center industry. Its more than 55,000 members in over 90 countries include shopping center owners, developers, managers, marketing specialists, investors, retailers and brokers, as well as academics and public officials.
