It is the second consecutive year that Birlasoft has received this recognition. <br><br>The IAOP also named Birlasoft to the key sub-list, Best 20 Leaders by Industry Focus in Insurance. <br><br>The Global Outsourcing 100 is an independently judged, opt-in ranking of the World's best outsourcing service providers and advisors. It is annually published by the International Association of Outsourcing Providers' Global Outsourcing 100 (2010). <br><br>Mouli Ganguly, Geo Head for APAC for Birlasoft, accepts the recognition on behalf of the team and says, "This honor by IAOP is a tribute to the intense focus our people have on delivering value to our customers in the region. The Australia and New Zealand region is rated high for its infrastructure, educational system, cultural compatibility, global and legal maturity and data and intellectual-property security. We are delighted to serve the region. This recognition comes as a testimony that our investments in the development of people, processes, and technologies are reflecting in management systems that are ensuring outsourcing success. We thank our customers who have made this recognition possible." <br><br>The application process of the survey is designed to mirror a typical customer's request for proposal (RFP) process. The evaluation team is an august panel of industry thought leaders comprising Michael F. Corbett, Chairman, IAOP, Jagdish Dalal, Divyesh Dalal, Teresa Harris, William Hefley, Kurt Kohorst, William P. Metz, Manish K. Sahai, Kristin H. Weitz Rammer and Vera Marques. <br><br>The final published list (service providers) contains both Leaders and Rising Stars. The participants are assessed on their demonstrated strength in several areas including parameters like company size, growth, global presence, customer references, company recognitions, company certifications, employee management and executive leadership. <br><br>The 2009 Global Outsourcing 100 rankings are featured in a special advertising feature of FORTUNE(R) magazine in May 2010.
