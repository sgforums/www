              Soli Reaffirms Acision Partnership and Outlines Strategic Focus for 2013 
              MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS
              
              BARCELONA, Spain, Feb. 27, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --
              
              Soli Interactive, a trusted messaging and direct marketing partner to brands and operators worldwide, and Acision, the global leader in mobile messaging, today announced the success of the Soli - Acision strategic partnership launched last year at Mobile World Congress while outlining their joint strategic vision for 2013.
              
              In 2012, Soli and Acision announced the formation of a strategic alliance that would enable the joint creation of a new innovative mobile engagement model, providing global corporations the broadest and most direct reach to consumers through mobile messaging. During 2012, Soli and Acision's relationship evolved significantly and together they have refined a new mobile marketing ecosystem - driving new standards to directly connect mobile operators, brands and consumers.
              
              Building on the partnership foundation, Soli has created a new private, multi-channel consumer engagement ecosystem. Soli Platform is a place where enterprises, operators, merchants and consumers can converge to engage in meaningful, permission-based marketing. Soli's global ecosystem consists of certified direct connections to mobile, social and web-based messaging channels. Through the establishment of a secure and centralized platform for these connections, Soli consolidates data and synchronizes cross-channel user interactions to improve user experience and marketer relevancy.
              
              In 2013, Soli and Acision expect to publicly roll out a number of enterprise and operator engagement models, to leverage the ubiquity and reach of their messaging ecosystem. Operators will be able to generate new revenues, increase service relevance and reliability, while improving how they market their services to consumers. In turn, Enterprises will leverage these operator partnerships to vastly and efficiently expand marketing reach to engage global audiences.  By utilizing Soli, enterprises and operators can benefit from simple reach, data transparency, and cost efficiency on both a global and local scale. The solution provides marketers the opportunity to develop campaigns that are dynamic and relevant to their target consumer audience no matter the location or channel.
              
              When discussing the strategic partnership, Mark Kaplan, CEO at Soli, said, "Our mission has focused on creating this global ecosystem and to make this mission a reality, we have worked hard to create a solid and trusted network of commercial partnerships, such as with Acision, to allow marketers to target their audience in a trusted, streamlined and measurable way. While Soli has focused on our brand relationships and developing innovative ways they can further engage, Acision has leveraged its operator relationships to enable intelligent subscriber interactions with full reporting and segmentation that function across multiple channels with carrier grade assurance. With Acision's help, we have already successfully delivered campaigns with well known FMCG brands and are excited about the momentum we can drive in 2013."
              
              "There has been much work behind the scenes to validate the enterprise and operator engagement model and ensure we maintain the same high standard of service that is expected by our customers," said, JF Sullivan, CMO, Acision. "We are now in a position to offer full integration with the Soli platform - allowing marketers to utilise multiple communication channels for targeted mobile marketing campaigns, offering operators new revenue opportunities through increased usage of messaging, while protecting the operator-consumer relationship."
              
              Ken Hart, Chief Revenue Officer at Soli, said: "Alongside ensuring a positive mobile marketing experience for the consumer, Soli's proposition is also committed to delivering return on investment for both our enterprise and operator customers. Acision's market leadership in mobile messaging and proven global operator network provides a single point of entry to connect operators, enterprises and consumers, to deliver effective, reliable and measured campaigns via the mobile."
              
              Jorgen Nilsson, Chief Executive at Acision, concluded by saying: "Together, our strategic partnership with Soli allows us to provide a truly united mobile engagement model to connect consumers to enterprises and enrich their experience, and we look forward to extending our relationship in 2013 to drive further success."
