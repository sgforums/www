              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">SINGAPORE</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Asia Plantation Capital is proud to announce the opening of its new, purpose-built Agarwood (gaharu) factory and research centre, located in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Johor, Malaysia</span>.</p>
              <div id="prni_dvprnejpgf5a8left" style="text-align: center; width: 614px;"><a style="margin: 0px; color: #6099e9; outline: none;" href="http://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20150309/8521501472"><img id="prnejpgf5a8left" title="Asia Plantation Capital’s new Agarwood (Gaharu) factory and Research Centre" src="http://photos.prnasia.com/prnvar/20150309/8521501472" border="0" alt="Asia Plantation Capital’s new Agarwood (Gaharu) factory and Research Centre" align="middle"></a> <br><span style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia Plantation Capital’s new Agarwood (Gaharu) factory and Research Centre</span></div>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">A mere 20 minutes drive from the Causeway link to <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore</span>, the town of <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Seri Alam</span> is now host to the state of the art facility that incorporates an Oud oil distillery, a wood chip processing centre, and a fragrance stick factory. Also situated within the complex is a visitor centre, along with a wholesale factory shop stocked with the ever-growing range of Agarwood products produced by Asia Plantation Capital (APC).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Occupying a brand new 44,000 ft2 unit in the Masai Industrial Park, the multi-million US dollar investment is integral to the company's strategic expansion of its Malaysian plantations and production capacity. The location -- close to a railway hub and deep sea port facilities -- was carefully and painstakingly selected, with logistics very much at the forefront of the decision making process. Access to the company's plantations in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Thailand</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">India</span> and<span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Myanmar</span> were key factors, as well as the company's ongoing factory expansion in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Shenzhen</span>, China.  Also planned Oud factories opening in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Middle East</span> located in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Abu Dhabi</span> in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">United Arab Emirates</span> and <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Jeddah</span>in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</span> are being developed by the company over the next 18 months.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The facility is also strategically and conveniently located in close proximity to Singapore -- a country currently ranked as one of <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia's</span> biggest Agarwood import and export centres -- with more than <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$1.2 billion</span> in estimated trade per annum (according to official reports). This presents APC with a leading competitive edge in terms of its access to a significant market on its very 'doorstep.'  This is a further key aspect of the planning and location of all the groups factories with <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Northern Asia</span> and the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Middle East</span> between them accounting for a substantial bulk of current world trade in Agarwood products.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The factory has been equipped with the latest heat exchange steam distillation units using purified water, and a clean energy solar power system is being installed to ensure maximum economic efficiency. Sustainable, environmentally friendly energy systems are utilised throughout.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">As part of a forward supply agreement with <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China's</span> largest retailer of fragrance sticks, a 300 tonne per annum production line is also being installed, and this will expand in due course to 600 tonnes per annum, to incorporate the company's other locations. The facility also houses a laboratory for perfumes and essential oils, APC inoculation systems production, and MSDS analysis systems.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"We are very excited to finally be able to take the wraps off our state of the art Agarwood factory," said <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Steve Watts</span>, CEO of Asia Plantation Capital Berhad, in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Kuala Lumpur</span>. "We have spent several years reviewing the best all round strategic location, and are pleased to announce this expansion in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Malaysia</span>. It's a result of the country's stable business environment and forward thinking forestry and plantation departments at governmental level, that have led us to select <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Malaysia</span> and <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Johor</span> for this strategic factory expansion."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">He continued, "We fully expect over the coming years for Asia Plantation Capital to become a major exporter and employer in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Malaysia</span> as part of this programme. This is part of an <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia</span>-wide strategic factory and production expansion, with a distillation factory joint venture in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span> with Hua Lin Group -- <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China's</span> largest manufacturer of Agarwood products - as well as strategic expansion in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Thailand</span> into wood chip production and incense manufacturing and planned factories in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Middle East</span>. Over the last six years we have constantly been researching and improving our systems, and have now identified and perfected a proprietary 'soil to oil' production process which is now the subject of 22 separate intellectual property patent applications. These systems are not only being utilised by the group to widen our market share, but is also being offered to smaller growers and farmers across <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia</span>, to assist them in the cultivation and end processing of Agarwood into a valuable income. This will, in turn, help boost rural economies and also underpin the group's future supply requirements. As well as supplying systems and knowledge, we are offering fixed 'buy backs' on products made exclusively from our systems. This process is already underway in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">India</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Thailand</span> and <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Malaysia</span>."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Watts went on to say, "The Agarwood plantation industry, as we know, is huge and is continuing to grow rapidly. Currently however, in many cases, the standards of production are not up to scratch, and the systems being used are performing poorly.  Substandard products are the result, and a significant proportion of these still emanate from illegal sources. The consumer market is evolving and growing at a rapid rate, and consumers are looking for products of consistently high quality with all the relevant seals of authenticity, purity and sustainability. We have found that by having our own distribution companies in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Middle East</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span> and <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Europe</span>, and being face to face with our clients on a daily basis, we can achieve all of this, and more."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Watts concluded, "Our products now come exclusively with their own individual certifications -- including those from CITES -- along with EU Product Approvals, Product Safety Data Sheets, IFRA, Certificate of Origin, FDA approval, MSDS analyses, and Shariah Compliant status.  Our products, in particular our oils and wood chips, are also independently graded by experts in the field at <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Thailand's</span> Prince of Songkla University.  By strategically owning and operating state of the art, environmentally friendly mega factories, fuelled by our own plantations and other smaller growers, we are now able to deliver the end products that the market actually demands, in terms of quality, consistency and price."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The factory is operational and open for business, with new production lines being commissioned in the coming months. The visitor centre will be opening in <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">April 2015</span>, along with a wholesale factory shop and Agarwood product display library.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Asia Plantation Capital (APC) is the owner and operator of a diverse range of commercial plantation and farming businesses across the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> region and around the world, and is part of the Asia Plantation Capital Group of associated companies. Its focus is on multicultural and diverse plantation projects geared to the domestic and commercial demands of the countries in which it operates. Working closely with, and supporting local communities, is an underlying core principle of the APC business, providing social and cultural support, as well as investment, to move these communities away from deforestation and illegal logging activities, previously seen as a main source of income in some regions of <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia</span>. Established officially in 2008 (although operating privately since 2002) the group now has plantation and agricultural projects on four continents, with operational projects at various stages in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Thailand</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Malaysia</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">China</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Laos</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">India</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Cambodia</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Sri Lanka</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Myanmar</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Vietnam</span>, <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">North America</span> and <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Europe</span>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Promoting the use of sustainable and certified wood is the best way of preventing deforestation, protecting biodiversity, and combatting poverty in the tropical rainforest regions. For the yachting sector (a major user of teak) which strives for excellence and which is already involved in environmental efforts, this is also a way of ensuring that no wood from illegal logging is used.</p>
