              TripAdvisor Reaches 100 Million Reviews and Opinions Milestone
              
              Community of Millions Helps World's Largest Travel Site Become First in Travel to Achieve Content Mark
              
              SINGAPORE, March 13, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- TripAdvisor( http://www.tripadvisor.com.sg )(TM), the world's largest travel site*, today announced it is the first travel site to reach 100 million reviews and opinions -- a more than 50 percent increase year-on-year. Covering more than two million tourism businesses in more than 116,000 destinations around the world, the site has candid traveller reviews of hospitality businesses in every country of the world. Its remarkable scale and freshness of content allows travellers around the globe to make informed choices, based on the experiences of many, whatever their destination or personal preferences.

              Reviews add confidence and result in better trips
              
              According to a recent study by PhoCusWright (Note 1), commissioned by TripAdvisor, nearly nine out of ten users (87 percent) agree that TripAdvisor hotel reviews "help me feel more confident in my decisions." Despite travellers' increasing expectations and demands, the study also revealed that eight out of ten users (80 percent) agree that TripAdvisor hotel reviews "help me have a better trip."
              
              A socially connected world
              
              The benefit of the wisdom of the crowds is increasingly supplemented by the wisdom of friends, as Facebook-connected users currently submit 35 percent of new reviews on TripAdvisor. With the integration of Facebook on TripAdvisor, this means that travellers are able to see and share valuable perspectives with their own friends and their friends' friends.
              
              Community spirit
              
              TripAdvisor now has contributions from members living in every country of the world. Travellers cite their top three reasons for writing hotel reviews (Note 1) as follows:
              
              1. I feel good about sharing useful information with other travellers
              
              2. I wanted to share a good experience with other travellers
              
              3. I feel that I'm part of the TripAdvisor social travel community
              
              The average review rating on TripAdvisor in 2012 was 4.1 out of five.
              
              "Travellers the world over want to have the perfect trip, and nothing helps travel planning more than real reviews from real people who have been there before," says Steve Kaufer, co-founder and CEO of TripAdvisor. "Having 100 million reviews and opinions adds remarkable perspective to any travel-planning decision, and we thank our passionate community as their insights continue to increasingly help travellers plan and have the perfect trip."
              
              The coverage and associated usefulness of the site is set to exponentially grow as its user and membership base grow. TripAdvisor currentlyhas more than 200 million unique users a month (Note 2), more than 47 million marketable members (more than 100 percent growth year on year) (Note 3) and collects more than 60 user contributions a minute.
