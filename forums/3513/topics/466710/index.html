              Bringing attention to China's environmental health and promoting toilet culture
              
              SHANGHAI, March 6, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The China Clean Expo( http://www.chinacleanexpo.com/home/tabid/958/language/en-US/Default.aspx ) (CCE) 2013 is to be held on April 1-3, 2013, at the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition &amp; Convention Center. The organizer, UBM Sinoexpo, is teaming up with the World Toilet Organization( http://worldtoilet.org/wto ) (WTO) to create an onsite forum, the World Toilet Form, with the aim of attracting people's attention to China's public health and promoting toilet culture across China. Professionals and experts from the sustainable sanitation sector will be giving speeches and interacting with the attendees onsite. These will include Prof. Jan-Olof Drangert, from Linkoping University in Sweden.

              In accordance with people's physiological conditions and needs, people need to be able to find a toilet within 7-15 minutes. However, the numbers of toilets available in China is far from satisfying people's needs in this respect. Meanwhile, sanitation conditions in the currently available public toilets are less than impressive.
              
              The toilet situation in China was ignored to a certain extent in the past. In international cities and tourist regions like Beijing, Shanghai, Hainan, etc, even though the number of public toilets is more than acceptable, the sanitation level has not been ideal. In areas such as remote towns or underdeveloped villages, the situation is very worrying.
              
              In light of China's rapid economic development, people's living standards are continuing to see a substantial increase. Toilet hygiene is being bumped up the agenda and this should be a fundamental aspect of the government's commitment to the "building a beautiful China" project. Under this scenario, the CCE is taking the lead in promoting the concept of toilet culture together with the WTO.
              
              The World Toilet Organization (WTO) is a global non-profit organization committed to improving sanitation conditions for people globally through powerful advocacy, inventive technology, education, and the cultivation of opportunities in local marketplaces. Originally starting out with 15 members, WTO membership has grown continuously and to date has over 534 organizations operating in 86 countries.
              
              Today, the World Toilet Organization is well known all over the world and is helping Singapore's popularity in the social and humanitarian sector, together with endorsements from the Clinton Global Initiative, the World Economic Forum, the Schwab Foundation, Ashoka, and numerous other platforms.
              
              The World Toilet Form will cover a wide range of activities, including the Shanghai Toilet tour on April 1, which aims to discover the current status of local toilets. During the forum on April 2, there will be a morning plenary session offering an overview of the Shanghai public toilet status, toilet accessibility, design and efficient maintenance, as well as afternoon workshops discussing sanitation as a business, along with affordable technology and changes in toilet users' habits. Attendees will also find a variety of toilet cleaning products and tools in the CCE exhibition area. All participants are going to benefit from the rewarding experience.
              
              The World Toilet Organization was established to provide for the people who work in the field of public health services platforms and international networks, to enable them to exchange opinions and learn from each other. The China Clean Expo aims to boost the development of China's cleaning industry in all respects, including public and municipal cleaning. The cooperation between the CCE and the WTO will no doubt advance their shared visions to a new level, as well as increase public health awareness and improve the toilet situation in China.
