              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">CHICAGO</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Global Logistic Properties Limited ("GLP"), the leading global provider of modern logistics facilities, today announced the introduction of three capital partners into GLP US Income Partners I. They include two leading global institutional investors from <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia</span> and one from <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">North America</span>. One of the Asian investors is new to GLP's fund management platform. GLP will reduce its stake in GLP US Income Partners I from 55% to 10% and remains the sole asset manager. GIC continues to hold a 45% stake in the portfolio.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">In <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">December 2014</span>, GLP entered into an agreement to acquire one of the largest logistics platforms in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the United States</span>, with the stated intention of injecting the <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$8 billion</span> portfolio into its fund management platform.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The agreed sale price of the 45% syndicated interest is consistent with the price GLP paid plus retained earnings. The fund syndication is expected to close 2Q FY2016 (July - <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">September 2015</span>), upon the receipt of regulatory approval, including approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">the United States</span> ("CFIUS"). Upon closing, GLP expects to book a net divestment gain equivalent to the net income earned during the period held for sale.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Mr. <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Ming Z. Mei</span>, Chief Executive Officer of GLP, said: "We are delighted to welcome the new capital partners into GLP US Income Partners I. The offering was oversubscribed with significant investor interest. This draws on our longstanding relationships with leading institutions and strong management capabilities. The fund management platform is one of GLP's main sources of capital to fund growth. We remain focused on further expanding our fund management platform and driving higher risk-adjusted returns."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">GLP US Income Partners I comprises 115 million square feet (11 million square meters) of high quality logistics properties. The portfolio is concentrated in locations with higher barriers to entry, with 26 of 29 key markets with populations of one million or greater, ideal for last mile e-commerce deliveries. As of March 31, 2015, the portfolio was 92% leased, with the ability to further increase to 94% within the next year.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">This transaction is in line with GLP's growth strategy of expanding into the best logistics markets internationally via its fund management platform, which has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 97% to <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$20 billion</span> of assets under management today.</p>
