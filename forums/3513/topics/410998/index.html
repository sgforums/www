              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">SINGAPORE, Sept. 14 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- SINGAPORE, Sept. 14 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- CSC Holdings Limited (CSC), Singapore's largest foundation and geotechnical engineering specialist, and Singapore Emulsion Fuel Pte Ltd (SgEF), producer and supplier of environment-friendly Super Green E-Diesel, are taking concrete steps to support Singapore's vision of becoming a Sustainable City. In conjunction with the opening of Build Eco Xpo (BEX Asia) 2010 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, CSC and SgEF have signed a Memorandum of Understanding that will allow CSC to use SgEF's E-Diesel at all its work sites in lieu of fossil diesel.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"Our partnership with SgEF reinforces our commitment to the green building movement. We aim to gradually switch to the use of environment friendly fuel in order to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to the greening of the building lifecycle," says Mr See Yen Tarn, Group CEO of CSC Holdings.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Following the MoU signing, SgEF will start supplying up to 5,000 litres of Super Green E-Diesel daily to CSC Holdings project sites to power its fleet of foundation engineering equipment including hydraulic boring rigs, diaphragm wall grabs and cutters, cranes, excavators and other supporting machineries. The monthly supply will then be increased gradually based on the market price, the project site and project size.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">If all goes well, SgEF's Super Green E-Diesel may meet as much as 30 percent of CSC's fuel requirements over the next few years.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Commenting on the partnership, Mr Jeremy Ng, CEO of SgEF says: "Our collaboration with CSC Holdings underpins our commitment to address climate change through the production and use of groundbreaking green energy solutions. We are pleased to work with them and look forward to a long and successful collaboration."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"The pricing, as well as the customized mode of transport and delivery, support our intention to become a long-term partner of CSC Holdings," Mr Ng added.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">With over three decades of experience in the market and a very seasoned management team, CSC possesses the technical expertise to offer a full range of capabilities in geotechnical engineering. It is one of the region's leading ground engineering solutions provider for the private and public sector, residential, commercial and infrastructure projects.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Recognised as a clean energy and green building prime mover by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Building and Construction Authority, SgEF is focused on the development and production of breakthrough emulsion diesel and alternative biofuels. Its vision is to be the world's leading global supplier for emulsion fuel and alternative biofuels.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">In February 2010, SgEF opened Asia's first clear nano-emulsion diesel plant and launched Super Green E-Diesel for the building and construction industry.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">"Since the launch of SgEF and our flagship product Super Green E-Diesel, we have seen a significant increase in the market's interest for emulsion diesel as a sustainable alternative to fossil diesel. We expect more customers here in Singapore and overseas to shift to green energy," says Mr Ng.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">With better R&amp;D and the opening of the production facility, SgEF is targeting to ramp up its current daily production of 30,000 litres to 100,000 litres over the next year and then to a maximum daily capacity of 300,000 litres.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.6em;">Apart from catering to the Singapore market, SgEF plans to expand regionally. It has set up a venture in Malaysia with Pamuri Holding Sdn Bhd called Pamuri Green, and will soon name its business partners in Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>
