            <div class='col-md body'><p>SHENZHEN, China, March 2, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Compared with large and medium sized companies, micro enterprises are vulnerable groups. It is difficult for them to set up or continue their business model. Since the 2008 financial crisis, a large number of micro enterprises closed. Chinese import and export enterprises' risk-resisting ability has worsened. <br><br>On February 1, 2012, The Chinese Standing Committee of State Council introduced a policy which further supports the healthy development of micro enterprises. The Chinese Central Accounting Department will use 15 billion RMB to set up a fund and also give support in taxation, financing etc. <br><br>Why does Chinese government pay so much attention to micro enterprises? On one hand, micro enterprises absorbs a large number of labor in China .Also, they have made outstanding contributions in industry innovation. Chinese Government also gave a certain support to these micro enterprises on different policies and regulations, such as establishing low tax rate on VAT, sales tax etc. <br><br>Policies are beneficial for the development of micro enterprises. However they still need to get rid of some difficulties. According to market survey statistics on Global B2B website http://www.ecvv.com, each company encounters a wide range of problems, which are prominent among micro enterprises: non-stop appreciation of RMB, everlasting rises of raw materials, labor cost etc. These account for 80% of their business cost. The funds which can be used in developing overseas market get fewer and fewer. Due to family background, export micro enterprises may find difficulty getting loans from banks. Their survival is much more difficult. <br><br>In order to solve this urgent situation, China's 3rd largest B2B website http://www.ecvv.com is the first to introduce "Pay by Inquiry" business model and also helps micro enterprises to explore overseas market for free. This new kind of business model succeeds in breaking the Chinese B2B traditional business model- "pay by year", for instance, Alibaba. <br><br>There are a total of 4 advantages with "Pay by Inquiry": Companies are not put at risk and can start with zero input. You then get the chance to connect with overseas buyers directly by paying 30 US for each inquiry. <br><br>ECVV is planning to apply "Pay By Inquiry" into global micro-enterprises so they can also enjoy this free promotion service in Chinese market. Start only by registering for a free account on ECVV.
