              -- Leading broker's fxUni trader education programme enables thousands of students across APAC to experience trading in real-market conditions 
              
              SINGAPORE, Nov. 8, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- OANDA Asia Pacific, provider of innovative online foreign exchange trading and a trusted source of currency data, has announced the winners of the third annual OANDA fxUni( http://fxuni.oanda.com ) Contest. The trading contest is the culmination of fxUni, a foreign exchange education programme for tertiary students in Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia. 
              
              Tan Jun Kiat, who is a student at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, won the two-week long contest with an impressive portfolio return of 60.62% and was awarded the first prize of SGD $3,500. Robert Baskin of the University of New South Wales in Australia won the second prize of SGD$2,500, followed closely by Tan Wee Kiat of Singapore Management University who won the third prize of SGD$ 1,250. 
              
              Nearly 1,000 students from polytechnics and universities across the four participating countries competed in the contest, where they traded virtual currency under real market conditions using OANDA demo trading accounts( http://www.oanda.sg/trade-forex/demo ). 
              
              The contest winner, Tan Jun Kiat said, "Trading forex is not easy, especially for beginners, and the calculation of risk-reward ratio is certainly the key to success. It is definitely worthwhile for young traders to participate in a learning programme like OANDA fxUni, and use demo accounts to get hands-on experience of the forex market and learn the basics of how to trade before starting to trade with real money." 
              
              OANDA fxUni is a two-month programme that includes a series of training webinars and a curriculum of learning materials to educate participants on trading foreign exchange. The goal of the programme is to nurture the next generation of forex traders by introducing students to this emerging asset class. 
              
              In addition to the individual prizes, OANDA also awarded SGD$500 to the Investment Clubs of the universities with the highest number of participants in each country. 
              
              "We are delighted to have been able to contribute to OANDA's fxUni program," says Mr Henryk Abucewicz, President of NTU Investment Interactive Club at Nanyang Technology University in Singapore. "I am personally impressed with the OANDA trading interface as well as the training our students received during the contest." 
              
              OANDA will present the awards and certificates to the fxUni winners on November 12, 2012.
