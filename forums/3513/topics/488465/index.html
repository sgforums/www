              <div id="subheadlines" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.6em; font-style: italic;">--- Second data centre to address growing demand for data centre infrastructure in the city-state and interconnection needs in Asia Pacific</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">SINGAPORE</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <a style="margin: 0px; color: #6099e9; outline: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.digitalrealty.com/">Digital Realty Trust, Inc.</a> (NYSE: DLR), a leading global provider of data centre and colocation solutions, announced today its second data centre facility in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore</span>. Depending upon ultimate customer configuration, density, and scope, Digital Realty expects to invest upwards of <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">S$200 million</span> in new data centre infrastructure, underscoring the company's commitment to <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore's</span> Smart Nation plan, which encourages the sustainable supply of data centres to ensure sufficient future capacity. The new facility also addresses a growing demand for agile, open, and connected data centre solutions from cloud and content providers and financial services companies across the region and worldwide.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The data centre will span approximately 177,000 square feet and is a redevelopment of an existing printing paper storage facility. Digital Realty has entered into a purchase agreement with the seller and has obtained Jurong Town Corporation's (JTC) consent for lease assignment. Legal completion is expected to occur in early <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">July 2015</span>, although power and fibre works are already underway.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Digital Realty has extensive experience in converting non-technical buildings into connectivity-rich data centres, which helps it bring data centres to market faster. Located in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore's</span> northeast, the new 13.<span id="spanHghlte5bd" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">2 M</span>W data centre will connect via dark fibre to Digital Realty's first data centre, in the west of the city-state, which is home to global Tier 1 carriers, the Singapore Internet Exchange, and the Digital CloudConnect network. Together, these facilities offer geographic diversification and increased options for diverse IT workload deployments in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore</span>. The current construction program provides for an estimated late 2015 delivery of the powered base building along with up to 3.2 MW of data centre space.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"Our first data centre in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore</span> marked Digital Realty's entrance into one of <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia Pacific's</span> rapid expansion markets and enabled our global clients to enter the city-state and serve other regional markets with a trusted partner," said <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Daryl Dunbar</span>, Managing Director Asia Pacific at Digital Realty. "Our new data centre expansion supports <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore's</span> efforts to become a regional data centre hub and delivers the openness and agility that our global clients continue to want from us, as well as the broader data centre industry, to accelerate their growth.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"With the growing demand for premium data centre services, it is imperative for leading data centre providers such as Digital Realty to continue raising the bar to strengthen <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore's</span> position as a leading data management and connectivity hub. Aligned to our vision for <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Singapore</span> to become the digital innovation capital of<span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia</span>, Digital Realty's expansion will enable both local and international companies to build new digital capabilities and scale critical digital services in a cost effective and efficient manner," said <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Kiren Kumar</span>, Director of Information Communications and Media, Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB).</p>
