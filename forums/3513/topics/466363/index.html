              Palantir Technologies Creates Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action, Partners with Team Rubicon and Direct Relief to Revolutionize Disaster Response Efforts
              
              -- Palantir commits its innovative technology platform to help response organizations better analyze information and mobilize resources before, during and after crises
              
              NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Palantir Technologies announced a long-term Commitment to Action at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Winter Meeting held last week. The CGI commitment will use cutting edge data integration and analytics to significantly improve disaster relief efforts. As part of the commitment, Palantir has combined forces with Team Rubicon and Direct Relief to help expand current efforts to better mobilize, share and allocate resources in the face of natural and other disasters.
              
              The commitment, made through CGI, between Palantir Technologies, Team Rubicon and Direct Relief is the first of its kind - bringing together volunteers and staff with military, pharmaceutical, disaster relief and data science expertise to more efficiently meet the needs of vulnerable communities hit by calamities.
              
              "Palantir's CGI Commitment will empower analysts and responders to leverage information so they can make better decisions regarding the critical needs in the most vulnerable areas. This will expand on the recent work with Team Rubicon in the aftermath of Sandy," said President Bill Clinton, Founder, William J. Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. "They did an astonishing thing for some very grateful people and I'm glad they were willing to help me here to try to do it for everybody in our country and eventually beyond our borders."
              
              During Hurricane Sandy, Direct Relief used Palantir to integrate information from their own databases, partnering organizations, and open source datasets to conduct meteorological, social vulnerability, supply chain, and health risk analyses of areas in the path of the storm. This resulting information enabled Direct Relief to pre-position supplies and medicine before the storm hit, analyze real-time weather data during the storm, and provide emergency medical supplies where they were needed most in the wake of the storm. After the storm, volunteers and staff on the ground used Palantir Mobile to collect and send data to Direct Relief headquarters in real time. Palantir was also used to monitor infectious disease trends and route medical resources to the areas in greatest need. Team Rubicon also used the software to manage more than 10,000 volunteers and rapidly integrate photos, video, text and phone calls to address the urgent needs of victims in the Rockaways.
              
              "The global challenge of humanitarian relief following a natural disaster is one of the most important problems of our time," said Dr. Alexander Karp, founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. "We are delighted to join the Clinton Global Initiative, and to work with Team Rubicon and Direct Relief. Together we can make a big difference."
              
              Palantir can be rapidly deployed to laptops and smart phones and allows dispatchers and analysts working under critical time pressure to fuse together and analyze large amounts of data from different sources. Originally developed for use by the intelligence and defense community, the platform includes robust, built-in measures to allow users to access and share information across the community while protecting privacy and civil liberties.

              About the Clinton Global Initiative
              
              Established in 2005 by President Bill Clinton, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) convenes global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to the world's most pressing challenges. CGI Annual Meetings have brought together more than 150 heads of state, 20 Nobel Prize laureates, and hundreds of leading CEOs, heads of foundations and NGOs, major philanthropists, and members of the media. To date CGI members have made more than 2,300 commitments, which have improved the lives of over 400 million people in more than 180 countries. When fully funded and implemented, these commitments will be valued at more than $73.1 billion.
              
              CGI also convenes CGI America, a meeting focused on collaborative solutions to economic recovery in the United States, and CGI University (CGI U), which brings together undergraduate and graduate students to address pressing challenges in their community or around the world.
