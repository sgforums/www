              Canoeing in Chuncheon, Gangwon-do, Korea: The Successful End of "2012 Chuncheon Mulle-gil Festival"
              
              SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 30, 2012 /PRNewswire/ --
              
              â€¢	"2012 Chuncheon Mulle-gil Festival"Successfully Progressed From October 19th to the 21st in Mulle-gil
              â€¢	Admiring Scenery of the Beautiful Chuncheon Lake in Canoes and Enjoying Camping, Canoe Contests 
              â€¢	Foreign Tourists Also Marveled at the Beautiful Scenery of Chuncheon Lake in a Unique Wood Canoe
              
              Mulle-gil Company, a corporation in Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do of Korea held "2012 Chuncheon Mulle-gil Festival" from the 19th to the 21th, November along Uiamho, a large lake. This corporation has developed a new tour program called Mulle-gil and has become a finalist in the Tourism Venture Contest organized by Korea Tourism Organization.

              Mulle-gil is a travel program similar with Olle-gil of Jeju Island and Dule-gil of Jiri Mountain where people can enjoy the scenery while walking along. Mulle-gil is a representative canoe travel program of Korea and it became a representative experience attraction of Chuncheon-si in only one year after the opening. Chuncheon is a popular filming location of various dramas which have promoted the Korean wave, such as Autumn Fairy Tale and it is also well-known as a tourist attraction that foreign tourists must visit. 
              
              The peculiar thing about Mulle-gil is that it is an experience program through which people can enjoy watching the scenery of the lake and canoeing by looking around Uiamho Lake in wood canoes. Also in foreign countries, there are travel programs through which people can experience canoeing, mostly in canoes made of plastic or tube. However, Mulle-gil offers canoeing in a self-manufactured wood canoe at an affordable price.
              
              Three thousand tourists, including about one hundred foreign tourists, have visited the "2012 Chuncheon Mulle-gil Festival", and could enjoy canoe experiences such as making canoes, canoe contest, and cultural performances while camping around Uiamho. Especially, foreign tourists who are already familiar with the canoeing culture also complimented the fact that people can go canoeing while enjoying the charming autumn scenes of the lake in Chuncheon, which is different from lakes in other countries. 
              
              Canoe Slalom, Canoe Freestyle, and Canoe Marathon took place as part of the canoe contest. Canoe Slalom is a competition about turning around a buoy and reaching the finish line, so people could experience dynamic canoeing. Freestyle is a competition that players show their canoeing technique quite freely to the music by the time appointed. Canoe Marathon took place in a 20km course, passing through the island and bridge of Uiamho and coming back. 
              
              Mulle-gil is a new tour program which was awarded in the Tourism Venture Contest of Korea Tourism Organization, and people can enjoy it in Chuncheon Uiamho, Gangwon-do, of Korea. The price is $27(US) per two people. Inquiry: www.facebook.com/purecoism
