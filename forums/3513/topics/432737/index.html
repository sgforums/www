              <p>PRNewswire-Asia/ -- CASH* (HKEx: 1049) (to be renamed as "Net2Gather (China) Holdings Limited"), together with its associate CFSG** (HKEx: 510), today make a joint announcement to welcome the shareholder's support from significant shareholder, Abdulrahman Saad Al-Rashid &amp; Sons Company Limited (ARTAR Group).</p>
              <p>By way of background, the ARTAR Group has major presence in Saudi Arabia and owned by a Middle Eastern family interest (<a href="http://www.artar.com.sa">www.artar.com.sa</a>). The ARTAR Group is internationally recognised as an investment institution which is a long term and fundamental value investor.</p>
              <p>In recognition of the long term and fundamental value of CASH and CFSG, the ARTAR Group would have in total invested for about US$17 million (about HK$132,600,000) in the two companies by (1) subscription of a convertible note of CASH for US$12,000,000 (about HK$93,600,000), (2) acquiring shares of CFSG to take their ownership to 7.98% of CFSG, and (3) subscription of 30,000,000 CASH shares in the recent placing exercise for HK$15,300,000.</p>
              <p>Mr. Saad Al-Rashid, General Manager of the ARTAR Group, said, "We are long term fundamental value investors. We have noticed recent volatility in the share prices of CASH and CFSG for reasons unknown to the management, and we see it as a good opportunity to make a further investment in the CASH Group.</p>
              <p>"Since 2003 when I first met Bankee, his passion and enthusiasm in developing the CASH Group into a leading services conglomerate in China had convinced me that they are our ultimate partner in the China market and his current focus will unlock value, in my view, for all shareholders of the CASH Group..." Mr. Al-Rashid continues.</p>
              <p>Mr. Bankee Pak-hoo Kwan, Chairman and CEO of CASH, said, "We are very pleased to have the long-term support of the ARTAR Group. This is especially important at times when, for reasons unknown, the share prices of the CASH Group members faced volatility, which management believes does not reflect the fundamental strength and soundness of our operations."</p>
              <p>"We will continue to focus on developing our Mobile Internet business for CASH and financial services business for CFSG in China, which are both multi-billion dollar industries in China and maximise shareholders' returns," Mr. Kwan continues.</p>
              <p>The conversion price of the CASH shares under the convertible note is HK$0.50 per share and represents a premium of about 42.9% over the closing price of HK$0.35 per share as quoted on 13 June 2011. This reflects the share price on 8 June 2011 when the CASH Group closed a world class transaction with Oberon Media to acquire a repertoire of 1,200 casual games for its Mobile Internet business.</p>
              <p>"We firmly believe in the prospects of CASH and CFSG and are confident about their businesses. Their underlying valuation should in our view be much higher than the current level and we urge all shareholders to align with us," added Mr. Saad Al-Rashid.</p>
