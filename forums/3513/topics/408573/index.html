              <p> </p>
              <p>2010-08-19 15:00</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     SINGAPORE, Aug. 19 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- PayPal and comGateway today announced the Asia Pacific launch of HopShopGo that enables consumers to conveniently shop, buy and ship from over 300,000 U.S. online retailers at the touch of a keyboard and a click of a mouse.  HopShopGo is now open for business across the region - in particular for shopping-happy consumers in Australia, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia - at http://www.hopshopgo.com .  All consumers need to get started is a PayPal account to enjoy the benefits of this exclusive e-destination from today onwards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    HopShopGo is a one-stop online shopping site that takes care of consumers' payment and shipping needs, typically the two biggest barriers for online and overseas shopping. PayPal has teamed up with comGateway to provide a faster, safer online payment experience, while enabling consumers to find and snap up bargains and bestsellers from U.S. retailers, even those who do not ship to Asia Pacific or accept purchases outside of the U.S. What really makes HopShopGo truly special is a Buyer Protection policy* plus 10% lower shipping fees when shoppers pay via PayPal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    According to the Asia Digital Marketing Association (ADMA) 2010 Report, 39% of online shoppers across the region say they buy from overseas websites with the top reasons for online shopping include: convenience of being able to shop anytime; compare prices to get better deals; and finding and comparing products.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    With HopShopGo, consumers across Asia Pacific can now easily get their hands on well-known U.S. brands for fashion, electronics, health &amp; wellness, homeware and more, such as:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    -- Fashion: Neiman Marcus, Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue</p>
              <p>    -- Electronics: RitzCamera, NewEgg, BestBuy</p>
              <p>    -- Health &amp; Wellness: MacCosmetics, Drugstore, Bath and Body Works</p>
              <p>    -- Homeware: OverStock, Costco, Williams-Sonoma</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "Shopaholics no longer have to wait for the latest trends and items to hit their shores as HopShopGo provides easy access to the most famous brands and products in the U.S.  With our Buyer Protection policy, consumers will have greater confidence shopping on HopShopGo knowing that they can get a full refund for the eligible items they purchased from the U.S. but did not receive," said Nimish Dwivedi, Regional Marketing Head, PayPal Asia Pacific.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "Cross-border shopping is on the rise, as consumers are increasingly exposed to international fashion, cultural and technology products. So PayPal and comGateway have made shopping from the U.S. easier by allowing consumers to sign up at HopShopGo with their PayPal account.  On top of the savings from shopping online over physical stores, users can benefit from many other exclusive discounts on HopShopGo," said Wee Yirong, Business Development Director, comGateway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Online shopping experience with better consumer protection and more savings</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    When shopping on HopShopGo with their PayPal account, consumers will enjoy these benefits: </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    -- Faster shopping with express checkout: They do not have to </p>
              <p>       enter their financial details every time they buy an item.</p>
              <p>    -- Greater confidence with Buyer Protection Policy: They will </p>
              <p>       get a full refund if they do not receive the eligible items</p>
              <p>       that they ordered.</p>
              <p>    -- Lower shipping fees for greater savings: They will enjoy a </p>
              <p>       further 10% shipping discount.</p>
              <p>    -- More security through online financial privacy: Their financial</p>
              <p>       information is not shared with merchants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    "Online shopping allows me to find and buy items that can only be found overseas, like the latest items from ThinkGeek.com. I also get to enjoy better deals, especially when international sales are on and now when the Singapore dollar is strong," said Jerry Loi, 26, IT executive from Singapore. "With HopShopGo, I now can shop, pay and ship more easily and with bigger savings, while I can relax with greater peace of mind as my financial details and purchases are protected by PayPal."</p>
