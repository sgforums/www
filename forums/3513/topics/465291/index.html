              Ara Kara Consultancy Announces New Karma Busting Trip in 2013
              
              Ultimate Karma-Busting &amp; Miracle Manifestation Powerspot Trip to India will be held from March 1- 3
              
              SINGAPORE, Jan. 30, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Dr Baskaran Pillai, enlightened master, global thought leader and Time.com's 2008 YouTube Guru, has been teaching karma busting (or karma clearing) for the past 30 years. In support of his teachings, Ara Kara Consultancy Pte Ltd announced today the new karma busting trip in 2013 -- Ultimate Karma-Busting &amp; Miracle Manifestation Powerspot Trip to India. To be held from March 1-3, the trip aims to provide a platform for participants to explore their true, highest divine potential by overcoming negative karmas at powerspots in India. 
              
              What is Karma Busting?
              
              According to Dr Pillai, karma busting (or karma clearing) is defined as the removal of unwanted negative thoughts and patterns accumulated through countless number of births. He teaches that this is one of the fundamental steps to an individualâ€™s financial, spiritual, emotional, and material evolution. 
              
              What is a Powerspot?
              
              According to Dr Pillai, a powerspot is an energy vortex that has existed for thousands of years through the grace of the Divine. It contains the energy associated with a divine being. A certain location can also become a powerspot because a saint/yogi/enlightened master spent extended periods of time meditating there or was buried there.
              
              Why do people visit Powerspots?
              
              Dr Pillai teaches that there are specific powerspots that can give participants access to divine spiritual energies for enlightenment, karma busting, money, health, peace, relationships. For instance, if participants want to access the energies for wealth and abundance, they would visit powerspots associated with the archetype for wealth or Goddess Lakshmi as She is known in the Indian tradition.

              The Ultimate Karma Busting Trip Highlights:
              
              1. Full Karma Busting Walk around Mount Arunachala at Thiruvanamalai
              
              Mount Arunachala an embodiment of the Divine archetype Shiva in His form as FIRE. The full walk covers16km and will take approximately 4.5 hours to complete. 
              
              If participants are unable to join the full walk, they can join for a partial walk. A car will follow from behind throughout the walk and at any point participants feel they are tired and wish to return to the hotel, the car will be on stand-by to take them back. Participants can also opt NOT TO walk around Mount Arunachala if they have health issues. Instead, they can meditate in front of this magnificent mountain.
              
              2. Visit the famous Thiruvanamalai Temple dedicated to Shiva
              
              The Thiruvanamalai Temple was built 1,000 years ago. It represents a powerspot for FIRE out of the 5 elements of the mantra for universal power, OM NA MA SHI VA YA. 
              
              3. Remove the most primordial and deep seated karmic stains at the Makaral Powerspot Temple
              
              Visit and walk around the Makaral Powerspot Temple where the Makaral Shivaya Namaha karma-busting mantra originates.  Dr Pillai has revealed that visiting the Makaral Shivaya Namaha Temple can remove the most deep-seated and ingrained karmic sins in their life. At the Makaral Temple, for powerful karma busting, participants will walk around the Makaral Temple's inner sanctum 9 times, 27 times, 54 times or 108 times around the temple's inner sanctum as their heart guides them.
              
              4. Feed the poor at Thiruvanamalai
              
              Feeding the poor, as taught by Dr Pillai, is the easiest way and quickest to earn the grace of God.
              
              5. Chop 108 limes
              
              Serious karma-busting and clear the path to manifest their desires.
              
              6. Smash 9 coconuts
              
              Some intense karma-busting.
              
              7. Participate in a specially commissioned karma busting homa (sacred fire ritual)
              
              From ancient times, yogis, rishis and enlightened masters have proclaimed the homa (fire ritual) as the fastest way to communicate their prayers to the Divine. Everyone on previous powerspot trips felt the tremendous power of participating in the daily homas (fire rituals) organised as part of the trip. The karma-busting homa will be a powerful ritual to help participants clear their most stubborn and unwanted karmas.
