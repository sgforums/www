He was recognized for his innovative application of security techniques in the real world. <br><br>"As information technology continues to reach into every corner of our lives, the digital age also raises serious concerns about information security," said Prof. Deng. "The most vital sectors of our economy -- manufacturing, telecommunication, banking and finance, transportation and emergency service -- are potentially susceptible to disruptions by individual and organized hackers and cyber terrorists. There is an imperative need for more research on information security, for applying state-of-the-art information security techniques in the real world and for heightening the information security awareness of Internet users. I am very happy that my colleagues and I have contributed to these efforts. The recognition and award by (ISC)2 is an encouragement for me to further my research and outreach activities." <br><br>The other showcased honoree for the Senior Information Security Professional category was Mr. Dong Hoon Park, CEO, NICS Tech Co., South Korea. Mr. Park was honored for playing a pivotal role in the industry by collecting the opinions of industry leaders and further strengthening the global competitiveness of South Korea's security industry by facilitating communication throughout the international community. <br><br>Mr. Park said, "While serving as chairperson of the Korea Information Security Industry Association (KISIA) from February 2008 to February 2010, my peers and I successfully implemented diverse information security policies and systems adopted at the governmental level. I dedicate this recognition to all my peers, and it is an honor to be recognized by an internationally respected body like (ISC)2." <br><br>The showcased honoree for the Managerial Professional for an Information Security Project category was: <br><br>-- Mr. Ryuichi Inagaki, attorney (bengoshi), Ryuichi Inagaki Law Office, <br>Japan.

I anticipate that the ISLA program will benefit the improvement of the information security workforce in Asia-Pacific." <br><br>The showcased honoree for the Information Security Practitioner category was: <br><br>-- Mr. Frank Kai Fat Chow, CISSP-ISSAP, ISSMP, CSSLP, senior systems <br>manager, Automated Systems Ltd., Hong Kong.

He has also been <br>very active in organizing and supporting professional associations for <br>several years, including the (ISC)2 Affiliated Local Interest Group <br>(ALIG) Program and the Professional Information Security Association <br>(PISA), where he has contributed his expertise to foster local and <br>regional security communities. <br><br>Mr. Chow said, "I am eternally grateful for my ISLA recognition, not only for the positive affect it's had on me but also for the overwhelmingly positive influence it's had on my colleagues. They are all encouraged to live up to the high standard that the ISLA Program continues to set each year for workforce improvement. This recognition also belongs to my peers at PISA in Hong Kong, as I spent time with some wonderful professionals to develop the organization. Our rigorous efforts must continue because security is an ongoing process!" <br><br>W. Hord Tipton, CISSP-ISSEP, CAP, CISA, executive director of (ISC)2, said, "(ISC)2's mission is to make society safer by improving the productivity, efficiency and resilience of information-dependent economies through education and certification.
