              <p><br><br>To Build Homes and Hope in China and the Philippines <br><br>HONG KONG, April 22 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Banyan Tree Private Collection (BTPC), Asia's first asset-backed destination club offering perpetual and transferable membership, is proud to announce a fund-raising initiative to benefit the charitable organisation -- Habitat for Humanity. <br><br>As part of a joint program, BTPC is asking membership purchasers to donate US$10,000 from each individual perpetual membership sold, which BTPC will match dollar-for-dollar. Banyan Tree Private Collection boasts one of the most attractive fees in the destination club industry, with membership priced at a one-time joining fee starting at US$150,000. Under the fund-raising initiative, an exclusive rate of US$140,000 will be offered, with a stipulation that US$10,000 of this fee is directly donated to Habitat for Humanity, which BTPC will match with an additional US$10,000. <br><br>BTPC aims to raise enough funds to build 100 homes over the next year through this initiative, as well as a series of fundraising events to be held throughout the year. <br><br>Proceeds from the donations will go towards two Habitat building projects -- one in Guangdong, China and the other in the Philippines. <br><br>In Guangdong, the program centres on the Qujiang district in the southern part of Shaoguan municipality where Habitat aims to build at least 150 housing units in three years for low-income families living in substandard housing, and to transform existing unsanitary and unsafe villages into healthy and sustainable communities in partnership with the local government. More than 15,800 families in the district live in unsafe and temporary mud brick or earthen wall houses without sanitation or ventilation systems. In recent years, many of these houses collapsed during storms and floods -- causing death and injury to the people and animals. <br><br>In the Philippines, donations will also go towards helping Habitat's Philippines Pasig River Project, which aims to address the potentials of disasters occurring among slum colonies living along the riverbanks through resettlement and provision of adequate shelter. Habitat's ultimate goal for this project is to serve 40,000 additional families between 2011 and 2015 and a capacity of 10,000 families served per year by the end of the campaign. <br><br>"Banyan Tree has long been committed to being an agent of social and economic development through responsible tourism. Habitat's message -- 'hope starts at home' deeply resonates with BTPC and our commitment to corporate social responsibility and offer of a home away from home to our members and guests," says Marina Kleiman, BTPC's managing director. <br><br>Banyan Tree Private Collection is managed by the multi-award-winning Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts, which has a long history of Corporate Social Responsibility -- founded with the core value of driving sustainable development. The company seeks to continue to be an agent of social and economic development through responsible tourism. It is also a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact -- committed to upholding the Ten Universal Principles on human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. The resorts are engaged with active efforts specific to their local communities and ecosystem, and these programs have won a number of environmental awards from around the world. <br><br>Habitat for Humanity China's General Manager, Steven Ying, expressed delight at the joint initiative, "This is a meaningful partnership that starts with introducing the friends of Habitat for Humanity network to BTPC, which is part of the multi-award-winning Banyan Tree Hotels &amp; Resorts group, recognized for its corporate social responsibility initiatives worldwide. Likewise, we are excited to welcome BTPC's members to our global efforts. Together, we will bring hope and build decent homes for underserved communities in China and the Philippines." <br><br>Banyan Tree Private Collection offers members a lifetime of bespoke travel experiences as well as the benefit of a second home without the hefty expense or hassles of owning a property.
