Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm. "We are raising our <br>revenue and earnings guidance as our broad licensing partnerships and extensive <br>chipset roadmap, led by our integrated Snapdragon processors, position us well <br>for strong growth in fiscal 2012. We continue to invest in innovative wireless <br>technologies, products and services, and we are excited about the opportunities <br>ahead as 3G and 4G continue to expand across new device types and geographies." <br><br><br><br>First Quarter Results (GAAP) <br><br>-- Revenues: (1) $4.68 billion, up 40 percent year-over-year (y-o-y) and 14 <br>percent sequentially. <br>-- Operating income: (1) $1.55 billion, up 24 percent y-o-y and 25 percent <br>sequentially. <br>-- Net income: (2) $1.40 billion, up 20 percent y-o-y and 33 percent <br>sequentially. <br>-- Diluted earnings per share: (2) $0.81, up 14 percent y-o-y and 31 <br>percent sequentially. <br>-- Effective tax rate: (1) 19 percent for the quarter. <br>-- Operating cash flow: $1.78 billion, 38 percent of revenues. <br>-- Return of capital to stockholders: $461 million, including $362 million, <br>or $0.215 per share, of cash dividends paid, and $99 million to <br>repurchase 2.0 million shares of our common stock. <br><br><br><br>(1) The results of FLO TV are presented as discontinued operations, and prior <br>period amounts have been adjusted accordingly. Revenues, operating expenses, <br>operating income, earnings before tax (EBT) and effective tax rates throughout <br>this news release are from continuing operations (i.e., before discontinued <br>operations and the adjustment for noncontrolling interests), unless otherwise <br>stated. <br><br><br><br>(2) Net income and diluted earnings per share throughout this news release are <br>attributable to Qualcomm (i.e., after discontinued operations and adjustment for <br>noncontrolling interests), unless otherwise stated. <br><br><br><br>Non-GAAP First Quarter Results <br><br>Non-GAAP results exclude the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment, <br>certain share-based compensation, certain acquisition-related items starting <br>with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and certain tax <br>items. <br><br>-- Revenues: $4.68 billion, up 40 percent y-o-y and 14 percent <br>sequentially. <br>-- Operating income: $1.87 billion, up 32 percent y-o-y and 15 percent <br>sequentially. <br>-- Net income: $1.67 billion, up 24 percent y-o-y and 22 percent <br>sequentially. <br>-- Diluted earnings per share: $0.97, up 18 percent y-o-y and 21 percent <br>sequentially. Excludes $0.01 loss per share attributable to the QSI <br>segment, $0.11 loss per share attributable to certain share-based <br>compensation and $0.03 loss per share attributable to certain <br>acquisition-related items (the sum of Non-GAAP earnings per share and <br>items excluded do not equal GAAP earnings per share due to rounding). <br>-- Effective tax rate: 19 percent for the quarter. <br>-- Free cash flow (defined as net cash from operating activities less <br>capital expenditures): $1.49 billion, 32 percent of revenues. <br><br><br><br>Detailed reconciliations between results reported in accordance with generally <br>accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and Non-GAAP results are included at the <br>end of this news release. <br><br><br><br>The following should be noted with regards to the above results and <br>year-over-year comparisons: first quarter fiscal 2012 results included the <br>results of Qualcomm Atheros, Inc., which was acquired on May 24, 2011. <br>Additionally, on December 27, 2011, after the close of our first fiscal quarter, <br>we completed the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 <br>billion. As a result, we will recognize a gain in discontinued operations of <br>$1.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 related to the close of this <br>transaction. <br><br><br><br>First Quarter Key Business Metrics <br><br>-- MSM(TM) shipments: 156 million units, up 32 percent y-o-y and 23 percent <br>sequentially. <br>-- September quarter total reported device sales: approximately $41.4 <br>billion, up 22 percent y-o-y and 6 percent sequentially. <br>o September quarter estimated 3G/4G device shipments: approximately 191 <br>to 195 million units, at an estimated average selling price of <br>approximately $212 to $218 per unit. <br><br><br><br>Cash and Marketable Securities <br><br>Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $22.0 billion at <br>the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012, compared to $20.9 billion at the <br>end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and $19.1 billion a year ago. As of <br>December 25, 2011, $948 million remained authorized for repurchases under our <br>stock repurchase program, net of put options outstanding. On January 10, 2012, <br>we announced a cash dividend of $0.215 per share payable on March 23, 2012 to <br>stockholders of record as of March 2, 2012. <br><br><br><br>Research and Development <br><br><br><br>($ in millions) Non-GAAP Share-Based QSI GAAP <br>-------- Compensation --- ---- <br><br><br>First quarter fiscal <br>2012 $746 $126 $1 $873 <br>As a % of revenues 16% 19% <br>First quarter fiscal <br>2011* $560 $85 $4 $649 <br>As a % of revenues 17% 19% <br>Year-over-year change <br>($) 33% 48% N/M 35% <br>*As adjusted for discontinued operations. <br>N/M - Not Meaningful <br><br><br><br><br>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses increased 33 percent y-o-y primarily due to an increase in <br>investments in the development of integrated circuit products (including <br>connectivity products), next-generation technologies and other initiatives to <br>support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. <br><br><br><br>Selling, General and Administrative <br><br><br><br>Share- <br>($ in millions) Non-GAAP Based Acquisition QSI GAAP <br>-------- ------ ----------- --- ---- <br>Compensation Related <br>------------ ------- <br>Items <br>----- <br><br>First quarter fiscal <br>2012 $381 $101 $9 $12 $503 <br>As a % of revenues 8% 11% <br>First quarter fiscal <br>2011* $343 $70 $- $(4) $409 <br>As a % of revenues 10% 12% <br>Year-over-year change <br>($) 11% 44% N/M N/M 23% <br><br><br>*As adjusted for discontinued operations. <br>N/M - Not Meaningful <br><br><br><br><br>Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased 11 <br>percent y-o-y primarily due to increases in employee-related and marketing <br>costs. <br><br><br><br>Effective Income Tax Rates <br><br>Our fiscal 2012 effective income tax rates are estimated to be approximately 18 <br>percent for GAAP and approximately 18 to 19 percent for Non-GAAP. The first <br>quarter effective income tax rates for GAAP and Non-GAAP were both 19 percent. <br><br><br><br>Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives <br><br>The QSI segment makes strategic investments, many of which are in early-stage <br>companies, and holds wireless spectrum. QSI also includes the discontinued <br>operations of our FLO TV business. GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal <br>2012 included a $0.01 loss per share for the QSI segment. <br><br><br><br>Business Outlook <br><br>The following statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ <br>materially. The "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this news release <br>provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our annual and <br>quarterly reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <br>provide a more complete description of risks. <br><br><br><br>Our outlook does not include provisions for future asset impairments or for <br>pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and <br>estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such <br>as realized investment and certain derivative gains or losses, cannot be <br>accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our business <br>outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain; however, actual results may <br>vary materially from the business outlook. <br><br><br><br>The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current <br>business outlook.

This gain will be excluded from Non-GAAP results. <br><br><br><br>(3) Total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in U.S. dollars <br>(as reported to us by our licensees) of all licensed CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and <br>multimode CDMA/OFDMA subscriber devices (including handsets, modules, modem <br>cards and other subscriber devices) by our licensees during a particular period <br>(collectively "3G/4G devices"). The reported quarterly estimated ranges of ASPs <br>and unit shipments are determined based on the information as reported to us by <br>our licensees during the relevant period and our own estimates of the selling <br>prices and unit shipments for licensees that do not provide such information. <br>Not all licensees report sales, selling prices and/or unit shipments the same <br>way (e.g., some licensees report selling prices net of permitted deductions, <br>such as transportation, insurance and packing costs, while other licensees <br>report selling prices and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in <br>their reports), and the way in which licensees report such information may <br>change from time to time. Total reported device sales, estimated unit shipments <br>and estimated ASPs for a particular period may include prior period activity <br>that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period. <br><br><br><br>(4) The midpoints of the estimated calendar year ranges are identified for <br>comparison purposes only and do not indicate a higher degree of confidence in <br>the midpoints. <br><br><br><br>Sums may not equal totals due to rounding. <br><br><br><br><br>Results of Business Segments <br><br>The following table has been adjusted to reflect discontinued operations (Note <br>4) (in millions, except per share data): <br><br><br><br>Acquisition- <br>Non-GAAP Non- Related <br>Reconciling GAAP Items (2) Tax <br>SEGMENTS QCT QTL QWI Items (1) (2) QSI* (2) (3) Items GAAP* <br>-------- --- --- --- ----------- ---- -------- Share-Based ------------- ----- ----- <br>Compensation* <br>(2) <br>-------------- <br>Q1 - FISCAL 2012 <br>---------------- <br>Revenues $3,085 $1,440 $152 $4 $4,681 $- $- $- $- $4,681 <br>Change from prior <br>year 46% 36% (12%) N/M 40% 40% <br>Change from prior <br>quarter 19% 6% (7%) N/M 14% 14% <br>Operating <br>income <br>(loss) $1,871 ($13) ($247) ($60) $- $1,551 <br>Change from <br>prior year 32% N/A (46%) N/A 24% <br>Change from <br>prior <br>quarter 15% (44%) 2% 52% 25% <br>EBT $739 $1,267 $1 $55 $2,062 ($34) ($247) ($60) $- $1,721 <br>Change from prior <br>year 15% 42% N/M N/M 24% (62%) (46%) N/A 17% <br>Change from prior <br>quarter 30% 6% 120% N/M 19% 0% 2% 52% 30% <br>EBT as a % of <br>revenues 24% 88% N/M N/M 44% 37% <br>Discontinued <br>operations, <br>net of tax <br>(4) $- ($5) $- $- $- ($5) <br>Net income <br>(loss) $1,672 ($22) ($194) ($55) $- $1,401 <br>Change from <br>prior year 24% 75% (67%) N/A N/M 20% <br>Change from <br>prior <br>quarter 22% 0% 9% 54% N/M 33% <br>Diluted EPS $0.97 ($0.01) ($0.11) ($0.03) $- $0.81 <br>Change from <br>prior year 18% 80% (57%) N/A N/M 14% <br>Change from <br>prior <br>quarter 21% 0% 8% 57% N/M 31% <br>Diluted <br>shares used 1,721 1,721 1,721 1,721 1,721 1,721 <br>Q4 - FISCAL 2011 <br>---------------- <br>Revenues $2,587 $1,361 $163 $6 $4,117 $- $- $- $- $4,117 <br>Operating <br>income <br>(loss) 1,624 (9) (252) (125) - 1,238 <br>EBT 569 1,193 (5) (20) 1,737 (34) (252) (125) - 1,326 <br>Discontinued <br>operations, <br>net of tax <br>(4) - (5) (1) - - (6) <br>Net income <br>(loss) 1,372 (22) (214) (120) 40 1,056 <br>Diluted EPS $0.80 ($0.01) ($0.12) ($0.07) $0.02 $0.62 <br>Diluted <br>shares used 1,716 1,716 1,716 1,716 1,716 1,716 <br>Q2 - FISCAL 2011 <br>---------------- <br>Revenues $1,962 $1,746 $157 $5 $3,870 $- $- $- $- $3,870 <br>Operating <br>income <br>(loss) 1,652 (17) (199) (6) - 1,430 <br>EBT 417 1,575 (135) 13 1,870 (46) (199) (6) - 1,619 <br>Discontinued <br>operations, <br>net of tax <br>(4) - (267) (2) - - (269) <br>Net income <br>(loss) 1,450 (296) (146) (6) (3) 999 <br>Diluted EPS $0.86 ($0.18) ($0.09) $0.00 $0.00 $0.59 <br>Diluted <br>shares used 1,689 1,689 1,689 1,689 1,689 1,689 <br>Q1 - FISCAL 2011 <br>---------------- <br>Revenues $2,116 $1,057 $172 $3 $3,348 $- $- $- $- $3,348 <br>Operating <br>income <br>(loss) 1,416 - (169) - - 1,247 <br>EBT 640 892 - 128 1,660 (21) (169) - - 1,470 <br>Discontinued <br>operations, <br>net of tax <br>(4) - (80) (2) - - (82) <br>Net income <br>(loss) 1,345 (87) (116) - 28 1,170 <br>Diluted EPS $0.82 ($0.05) ($0.07) $- $0.02 $0.71 <br>Diluted <br>shares used 1,648 1,648 1,648 1,648 1,648 1,648 <br>12 MONTHS - FISCAL 2011 <br>----------------------- <br>Revenues $8,859 $5,422 $656 $20 $14,957 $- $- $- $- $14,957 <br>Operating <br>income <br>(loss) 6,084 (37) (813) (208) - 5,026 <br>EBT 2,056 4,753 (152) 183 6,840 (132) (813) (208) - 5,687 <br>Discontinued <br>operations, <br>net of tax <br>(4) - (308) (5) - - (313) <br>Net income <br>(loss) 5,407 (385) (624) (200) 62 4,260 <br>Diluted EPS $3.20 ($0.23) ($0.37) ($0.12) $0.04 $2.52 <br>Diluted <br>shares used 1,691 1,691 1,691 1,691 1,691 1,691 <br>------------ ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- <br><br><br><br><br>(1) Non-GAAP reconciling items related to revenues consist primarily of other <br>nonreportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations.

For more than 25 years, Qualcomm ideas and inventions have <br>driven the evolution of digital communications, linking people everywhere more <br>closely to information, entertainment and each other. For more information, <br>visit www.qualcomm.com. <br><br><br><br>Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures <br><br>The Non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in <br>addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures <br>calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, "Non-GAAP" is not a term <br>defined by GAAP, and as a result, the Company's measure of Non-GAAP results <br>might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. <br>Reconciliations between GAAP results and Non-GAAP results are presented herein. <br><br><br><br>The Company presents Non-GAAP financial information that is used by management <br>(i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's operating results on a <br>consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency <br>of the Company's ongoing core operating businesses, including the Qualcomm CDMA <br>Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Qualcomm Wireless &amp; Internet <br>segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments <br>against each other and against competitors outside the Company. Non-GAAP <br>measurements of the following financial data are used by the Company's <br>management: revenues, R&amp;D expenses, SG&amp;A expenses, total operating expenses, <br>operating income (loss), net investment income (loss), income (loss) before <br>income taxes, effective tax rate, net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per <br>share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Management is able to assess what <br>it believes is a more meaningful and comparable set of financial performance <br>measures for the Company and its business segments by using Non-GAAP <br>information. As a result, management compensation decisions and the review of <br>executive compensation by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors <br>focus primarily on Non-GAAP financial measures applicable to the Company and its <br>business segments. <br><br><br><br>Non-GAAP information used by management excludes the QSI segment, certain <br>share-based compensation, certain tax items and certain acquisition-related <br>items. The QSI segment is excluded because the Company expects to exit its <br>strategic investments at various times, and the effects of fluctuations in the <br>value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed by management <br>as unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Share-based compensation, <br>other than amounts related to share-based awards granted under a bonus program <br>that may result in the issuance of unrestricted shares of the Company's common <br>stock, is excluded because management views such share-based compensation as <br>unrelated to the Company's operational performance. Further, share-based <br>compensation is affected by factors that are subject to change, including the <br>Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option life, risk-free <br>interest rates and expected dividend payouts in future years. Certain tax items <br>that were recorded in reported earnings in each fiscal year presented, but that <br>were unrelated to the fiscal year in which they were recorded, are excluded in <br>order to provide a clearer understanding of the Company's ongoing Non-GAAP tax <br>rate and after tax earnings. However, the Company excludes any benefit resulting <br>from the retroactive extensions of the federal R&amp;D tax credit from Non-GAAP <br>results because the Company does not include the potential extension of the <br>credit in its business outlook due to uncertainty as to whether and when the <br>federal R&amp;D tax credit will be retroactively extended. In addition to its <br>historical practice of excluding acquired in-process research and development <br>expenses from Non-GAAP results, the Company began excluding amortization of <br>certain intangible assets, recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair <br>value and the related tax effects of these items starting with acquisitions <br>completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as any tax effects of <br>restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. These certain <br>acquisition-related items are excluded and no longer allocated to the Company's <br>segments because management has concluded that such expenses should not be <br>considered when assessing segment performance as they are unrelated to the <br>operating activities of the Company's ongoing core businesses. In addition, <br>these charges are significantly impacted by the size and timing of acquisitions, <br>potentially obscuring period to period comparisons of the Company's operating <br>businesses. <br><br><br><br>The Company presents free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating <br>activities less capital expenditures, to facilitate an understanding of the <br>amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow its business and to <br>create long-term stockholder value. The Company believes that this presentation <br>is useful in evaluating its operating performance and financial strength. In <br>addition, management uses this measure to evaluate the Company's performance, to <br>value the Company and to compare its operating performance with other companies <br>in the industry. <br><br><br><br>Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements <br><br>In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release <br>contains forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to risks and <br>uncertainties, including but not limited to statements regarding the Company's <br>business outlook; growth expectations; and estimates and guidance related to <br>financial performance, effective income tax rates, MSM shipments, device <br>shipments, device sales and device average selling prices.
