              <p>HONG KONG, Sept. 17 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- PublicAffairsAsia and the new industry group Food Industry Asia are set to honour achievement in the sphere of collaborative best practice with the 2010 Gold Standard Award for Good Governance.

This award, which is now open also to corporations, will indentify gold standard achievement by a company, agency or institution driving effective change in this important area." <br><br>The award is presented in association with Food Industry Asia, the newly formed industry group representing leading food companies in the region. Commenting on the award, Bev Postma, CEO of FIA, said: "In this complex landscape of regulatory development, there has never been a better time to champion good governance. Evidence shows that if governments and businesses work openly together to develop best practice, the socio-economic rewards can be that much greater. FIA is delighted to support this opportunity to show-case examples of sustainable good governance and we look forward to celebrating the outcomes of these initiatives." <br><br>Nominations for The Gold Standard Awards opened on September 1 and close on October 15, 2010.
