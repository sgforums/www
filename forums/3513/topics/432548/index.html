              <p>The World Vendor Awards, which is organized by Total Telecom, focus on telecommunications industry vendors and use a panel of independent and impartial industry experts to judge entries. The awards give recognition to the true excellence among the companies supplying the hardware, software and services for the telecommunications industry worldwide.</p>
              <p>The Best Hosted Solution award was given to CITIC Telecom CPC's Managed Video Conferencing Service -- VC² (VC-square).

VC² stands out for its high quality, scalable, flexible and efficient HD Managed video conferencing solution that acts as a communication tool and enables business continuity at all times. Very importantly, customers get to enjoy the mentioned benefits at an affordable rate with the managed service model that eliminates the usual high CAPEX required for setting up a video conferencing system, as well as the regular maintenance costs that come with it.</p>

              <p>The award comes at a strategic time as the company recently announced a name change from CPCNet to CITIC Telecom CPC and is preparing to launch two new solutions in its third flagship series -- SmartCLOUD. Hitting the market in the near future are SmartCLOUD Compute, a revolutionary virtual server solution that goes beyond ordinary offerings to deliver best-in-class high-performance and high-availability with unprecedented value and management ease; and SmartCLOUD Mail, a suite of secure business e-mail management tools with strong mobility.</p>

We are very glad to win the World Vendor Awards and it will encourage us to continue innovating and raising the bar as we widen our service coverage to the Asia Pacific region and beyond."</p>
