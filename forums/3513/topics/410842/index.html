              <p>HONG KONG, Sept. 10 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- CSR Asia, the leading provider of information, training, research and advisory services on sustainable business practices in Asia, will launch the 8<sup>th</sup> CSR Asia Summit at the Hong Kong Conventional and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) from 14<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup> September, 2010.</p>
              <p>The CSR Asia Summit is the flagship event from CSR Asia, which is the most innovative and challenging conference on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the Asia-Pacific region. The Summit will gather over 350 international thought leaders to explore key CSR issues and strategies, bringing new insights for businesses, governments, non-profit organisations and other CSR practitioners. This year, the theme of the summit is 'Strategic Solutions for Sustainability', which will address pressing concerns and reveal important emerging trends for businesses to address around the region.</p>
              <p>Stephen Frost, CSR Asia's Executive Director said: "CSR has become one of the indispensable core values and a unique differentiator of a successful company. Through this Summit, we would like to share our experiences and insights with companies in Asia on how they can incorporate sustainability strategies into their business operations."</p>
              <p>More than 55 key opinion leaders from local and international corporations, regulators, non-governmental organisations and other experts will address a wide range of topical CSR issues in Asia during the two-day Summit. Some of the conference discussion topics include: carbon disclosure, business strategies for adapting to a changing climate, the relationship between CSR and corporate governance and development of a more professional corporate culture in China.  </p>
              <p>Company stakeholders today demand of an organisation not only information transparency, but also the disclosure of its carbon footprint. Liam Salter, Managing Director of RESET (HK) Limited and Jeanne Ng, Director of Group Environmental Affairs for CLP Holdings Limited will investigate "Carbon Disclosure and the Value of Reporting" to help companies gain insights on how they are positioned to align their businesses with regional and global legislation on climate change reporting.</p>
              <p>There will also be a focus on the increased importance of corporate governance in a company's CSR strategy to address the needs of all stakeholders. Corporate governance experts such as Harish Srivatsava, Lead Faculty -- CSR of Centre for Organisation Development, Sharmila Gopinath from the Asian Corporate Governance Association and Erin Lyon, Executive Director of CSR Asia, will outline the trends, share best practices and failures of Asian corporate governance practices in the "Embedding CSR into Corporate Governance" session, for corporations to achieve their objectives of sustainable business growth.</p>
              <p>A new long-term initiative, China Compliance Professional Association, was established in Hong Kong to develop a culture of professionalism among auditors working in mainland China. This initiative seeks to address a number of key issues in the auditing industry. Key players who initiated this industry-led project, include Kitty Potter, Associate Director of APCO Worldwide and Stephen Frost, Executive Director of CSR Asia, will speak at the "China Compliance Professionals Association Workshop" session to discuss how to provide business solutions to develop a more professional corporate culture, gain greater control over industry practices and increase employees' levels of competency.</p>
              <p>As with previous CSR Asia Summits, the results of the "Asian Sustainability Rating™" will also be announced during this year's event. The Asian Sustainability Rating™ is an ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) benchmarking tool for use by Asian companies, investors and other stakeholders, which enables them to add a sustainability dimension to their investment decision-making and engagement practices.</p>
