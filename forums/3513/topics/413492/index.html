              </p><p>SINGAPORE, Oct. 18 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Come Monday, October 18th, Chinese-speaking residents in Singapore would wake up to the choice of another new 31 Chinese channels package from KyLinTV -- a new IPTV service provider making its entrance into the Singapore market following a proven success in North America and Europe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Singapore also marks KyLinTV's debut as the first country in Asia to tune in to this Chinese channels package -- Great Wall TV package. It consists of 18 channels which includes the line-up of CCTV-4, CCTV-News, CCTV-Opera, China Movie, Beijing TV, Dragon TV, Hunan TV, JiangSu TV and ZTV (ZheJiang TV), just to name a few. Great Wall TV package is the flagship product of China International Television Corporation's (CITVC) in its effort to reach out to Chinese overseas in its highest form of Chinese language programming standard; illustrated below includes:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CCTV-4, a news channel featuring up-to-minute news and current affairs programmes from China and around the world; </p>
              <p>Chinese Movie Channel, a 24/7 movie channel offering the best selection of films from China's prolific movie industry, ranging from the elegant classics to the most avant-garde entries of the new generation; </p>
              <p>CCTV-Opera, with a non-stop panoply of Beijing and other first class operas to satisfy the tastes of Chinese opera buffs; and;</p>
              <p>CCTV-Entertainment, a variety channel allowing Singaporean subscribers to keep up with the latest developments in Chinese culture with its wide line-up of superb variety shows.</p>
              <p>    Other than Great Wall TV Package, Singapore's Chinese residents can also look forward to more channels on KyLinTV's offering which includes 24-hour Chinese soap opera on KunLun TV and YangTze Drama; edutainment &amp; kids programme on KyLin Kids and Chinese Culture. Not forgetting, the business news &amp; current affairs programme on Trading Day and last but not least, lifestyle programme on KyLinTV Leisure. Also, joining the KyLinTV Basic's 14-channels package are the widely well-received channels by North American viewers are US TV Business, US TV News, KyLinTV Variety, MASTV and Oriental Education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    KyLinTV customers can enjoy a simple plug-and-play setup with any broadband network connection, set-top box (STB) and TV. Unlike the STB from current payTV service operators in Singapore, KyLinTV customers can watch their favourite programmes anywhere with a simple broadband connection even when they are holidaying overseas. Another not to be missed feature is their 48hr Playback STB feature which record all programmes for all channels allowing customer the convenience of playing back past programmes without the hassle of advance recording or the frustration of missed recorded favourite programmes.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    CITVC Vice President Wei Ping spoke enthusiastically of the cooperation, saying, "As the most important Chinese TV channel platform outside of China, the Great Wall TV package is a window connecting the latest members of the Chinese diaspora with their home countries. The latest partnership between CITVC and KyLinTV will provide them access to the best in Chinese television programming, enabling viewers to keep a close eye on what is going on in their hometown, meanwhile, the release of Great Wall TV on KyLinTV Singapore will provide all Chinese residents here who are interested in China with a better way to study the Chinese language and discover Chinese culture."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    KyLinTV president Duan Jianbing shared, "Singapore has both high ethnic Chinese population and good broadband infrastructure provides KyLinTV a good platform. As a new payTV provider in town to reach out our target audience fast, through the use of IPTV technology and strong Chinese contents, I believe KyLinTV's many advantages, including its advanced technology, the professional team, the excellent customer service and mature marketing strategy, all combine to ensure that this same high quality of service will be delivered to its new Singapore subscribers just like how we delighted the North American and European, while providing a bridge linking the members of the Chinese diaspora to their hometowns. That's not all, KyLinTV would continue to bring in new innovations and work with more channel partners to offer more contents relevant for the multi-racial society like Singapore."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    According to Billy Tianbo Huang, General Manger of KyLinTV Asia Pacific, Singapore will be the regional hub and KyLinTV will expand into other countries with huge Chinese populations like Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia and Japan. "Wherever there are Chinese and the Internet, KyLinTV will be there, " said Huang.</p>
