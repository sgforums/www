              With more than 29 years of presence in Malaysia, Datamation has regional operations in Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. Datamation's clients include Ministry of Education of Malaysia and Singapore, Department of Statistics of Malaysia and Singapore, AKPK (Agency of Bank Negara Malaysia), Sime Darby Medical Centres, Sunway Group, Jambatan Kedua Sdn Bhd (wholly owned by Ministry of Finance Malaysia), Star Publications, TH Properties and Construction Industry Development Board Malaysia etc.
              The strategic partnership also makes Datamation SEEBURGER's 1st appointed reseller partner in the Asia Pacific region to provide and implement SEEBUREGR's Cloud-based file sharing solution in Malaysia â€“the third largest economy in South East Asia and the 29th largest economy in the world.
              
              CEO of Datamation (M) Sdn Bhd, Alex Wee also shares, "SEEBURGER is backed by more than 26 years of successful deployment in some of the largest companies in the world. This partnership brings valuable expansion of our solution portfolios that will benefit both our partners and clients. The collaboration with SEEBURGER to provide secured information transfer will address the concerns for all Malaysia companies especially for those who are seeking to implement MS ISO/IEC 27001:2007, IT Security Techniques - Information Security Management Systems."
              
              James Hatcher, Regional Director of SEEBURGER Asia Pacific, "SEEBURGER made Malaysia its Asian regional headquarters in 2012 and we have been aggressively searching for local partners with the right mix of offerings to accelerate delivering our offerings to this market. Datamation's experience, market knowledge and strong customer base make them an ideal candidate for representing SEEBURGER,"
              "Datamation expects this partnership to increase its enterprise solution revenue and boost the number of enterprises in Asia into using Cloud-based file sharing. This year, Datamation is expecting at least 20% growth in enterprise solution revenue sales."
              Prior to today's announcement, Datamation has been a very active reseller of SEEBURGER's Business Integration Suite (BIS). 
              
              "This SEEBURGER-Datamation partnership is part of the company's strategy to increase its penetration in Asia Pacific where SEEBURGER already has a significant presence in countries including mainland China, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Australia," adds Hatcher. 
              
              Embarking on an Increasing Demand for File Exchange Solutions
              According to Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG)'s latest survey, 28 per cent of organizations have established corporate accounts for online storage and file sharing services. This is expected to hit 50 per cent by the end of 2013.
              
              Hatcher shares, "As enterprise-level file sharing fast becoming popular, so does the potential exposure for cyber attacks. Security is also becoming the main concern for enterprises wanting to adopt Cloud-based file sharing platforms."
              
              "Our partnership with Datamation is strategic to address those gaps. Driven by the increasing market demands, SEEBURGER Managed File Transfer (MFT), as component of BIS, will be sought after to encrypt, track and trace exchanged business files of any size for security, governance and compliance purposes.
