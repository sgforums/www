            <div class='col-md body'><p>To Celebrate Its 100th Anniversary, Steelcase Sparks Conversation around the Future of Work through Documentary Film, Microsite and More <br><br>GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan, Feb. 29, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- In celebration of its centennial anniversary this year, Steelcase is exploring the future of work by inviting leading thinkers to participate in a dialogue and dream about how work will change in the next 100 years. The kick-off will take place at TED this week where Steelcase unveils its anniversary theme "100 Dreams, 100 Minds, 100 Years." <br><br>To view the multimedia assets associated with this release, please click: http://www.multivu.com/mnr/54759-steelcase-centennial-future-of-work-100-years-dreams-minds-ted <br><br>(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120228/MM58354) <br><br>TED is about ideas worth sharing and encouraging others to dream. For years Steelcase has helped create the spaces that give TED attendees places to interact and collaborate. This year as the company celebrates its centennial anniversary, Steelcase invites TEDsters to participate in this dialogue, to dream and to think about the future of the world and work. <br><br>Steelcase began its 100 Dreams with children from around the world envisioning the future through their original artwork and a documentary film, "One Day" directed by Oscar winner Daniel Junge. The dialogue continues with 100 Minds who represent global business leaders, educators, innovators and artists asked to build on the children's dreams with their own vision for the future of work. <br><br>"Since Steelcase was founded in 1912, we have studied human behavior to develop insights around work, workers and the workplace," said James Hackett, CEO of Steelcase. "Looking forward into the next 100 years, we see our purpose as an organization is to help unlock human promise. This celebration will create a vision for the future of work and we're inviting people of all ages and experiences to share their dreams and help unlock that promise." <br><br>The One Day film will debut at private Steelcase events and be available online at 100.steelcase.com. The "100 Minds," including doctor and author Deepak Chopra, IDEO CEO Tim Brown and artist Dale Chihuly, also share their thoughts through words, drawings, photographs and other multimedia on this Web site. This online dialogue is moderated by Emmy and Peabody award winning author and journalist John Hockenberry. <br><br>Visitors will have the opportunity review perspectives from the "100 Minds," and share additional ideas and multimedia content to help unlock human promise for the next 100 years. Additionally, visitors are invited to submit their own dreams on a "Share your Dream" Facebook page( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Steelcase"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">https://www.facebook.com/Steelcase</span></span></a> ). <br><br>The TED conference runs Feb. 27 through Mar. 2, 2012 at the Long Beach Performing Arts Center, Long Beach, Calif. <br><br>About Steelcase Brand <br><br>For 100 years, Steelcase has been bringing human insight to business by studying how people work, wherever they work.
