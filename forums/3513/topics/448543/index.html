            <div class='col-md body'><p>BIETIGHEIM-BISSINGEN, Germany, March 5, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- <br><br>Premium carry solutions brand, DICOTA, is to mark 20 years at the forefront of the industry with the introduction of a new product range, Reclaim, a new addition to its TopPerformer collection, and a raft of refinements across its innovative Mobile Office Solutions range at CeBIT, the digital industry's largest tradeshow. <br><br>To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: <br><br>http://www.multivu.com/mnr/53760-dicota <br><br>"With 20 years' experience behind us, we are signalling our continued commitment to developing premium carry solutions that protect and personalise with the launch of Reclaim, and a brand new TopPerformer shoulder bag that doubles up as a backpack," says Michael Mé‚¦ehlenbruch, Head of DICOTA. <br><br>Reclaim is an exciting collection of notebook bags and cases made primarily from recycled PET plastic bottles. Recycled PET has a considerably lower environmental footprint than newly produced PET, and is one way DICOTA is making a substantive contribution to operating increasingly sustainably. All new DICOTA products announced since January 2011 are PVC-free. <br><br>Reclaim includes several different sizes and styles - clamshell, toploader and backpack - that make the collection compatible for all types of notebook devices. It also offers enhanced flexibility with shoulder strap options. The range is available in a number of striking colours and our classic black. <br><br>The bags feature a high-density foam cushioned notebook compartment with a tie-down strap, and a divider to enable optimum sizing of the compartment. Front pockets and holders provide ample storage for pens, mobile phones and accessories. Additional details include trolley-fastening straps, comfortable neoprene carry handles, and detachable, adjustable shoulder straps. <br><br>The Reclaim backpack includes a spacious central compartment with dividers for documents and additional room for accessories. Its front pocket features several compartments for pens, business cards and other items. It also has a separate compartment for a power cable. <br><br>DICOTA is also set to launch a new addition to its popular TopPerformer collection: TopPerformer Dual. This innovative bag is a perfect balance and combination of backpack and shoulder bag. Consumers will be able to use the bag for business - as with all DICOTA bags it features practical pockets throughout for electronic devices and other necessities - and use it as a backpack because it features two shoulder straps that are discreetly hidden when not in use. <br><br>Alongside the Reclaim and TopPerformer collections, DICOTA will be showcasing its Mobile Office Solutions (MOS) series. Under the tagline 'Perfection for professionals' the MOS products offer a wealth of innovative features that support customers' needs to ensure optimal use of their hardware and accessories. These products provide users with the freedom of using notebooks, mobile printers and projectors directly from the cases. <br><br>DICOTA, part of the OSM Group since 2009, started life in 1992 to meet growing demand for well designed, practical carry solutions for the emerging market in electronic devices. With an extensive presence comprising subsidiaries, agents and partners DICOTA is a leading global player on the market. <br><br>In addition to launching Reclaim and TopPerformer Dual, DICOTA will be celebrating its 20th anniversary with a number of special events during CeBIT, details of which will be released in the run-up to the exhibition. The actual date of our founding, March 10, falls during the show - a milestone we are sure to be marking in style at our stand. <br><br>Billed as the world's most important tradeshow for the digital industry, CeBIT held in Hanover, Germany, last year attracted more than 4,200 companies from some 70 different countries. The DICOTA stand at CeBIT will be located in the Planet Reseller Area, Hall 15, booth H53. This year's event kicks off on March 6 and wraps up on March 10.
