              Marsh Assists NTUC Unity Healthcare to Gain First BCM Accreditation in Singapore
              
              SINGAPORE, Feb. 4, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Through assistance provided by Marsh( http://usa.marsh.com ), Singapore's healthcare cooperative NTUC Unity Healthcare was today confirmed by the Singapore Accreditation Council as the first company in Singapore to be certified with ISO 22301:2012, the international standard for business continuity management.
              
              Natural disasters, such as those in Japan and Thailand in recent years, have demonstrated the complex interdependencies in the global risk landscape and have made business resiliency a key priority for companies and government in Singapore.
              
              Marsh Risk Consulting worked with NTUC Unity Healthcare to define, design and deliver a comprehensive business continuity management (BCM) programme and system. The BCM system was then audited and certified by SGS, a leading inspection, verification, testing and certification firm based in Geneva, Switzerland.
              
              Mr Lim Sek Seong, Asia Business Continuity Management Leader for Marsh, added: "NTUC Unity Healthcare's approach is a model for the wider Singapore business community. Marsh was pleased to be able to collaborate with Unity on this important initiative and looks forward to helping other Singaporean companies achieve their BCM goals."
              
              "We are honoured to achieve the accreditation. As a provider of healthcare services to Singaporeans, our ability to sustain or quickly resume services in the event of a major disruption is our first priority," said Mr. Steven Lye, Deputy CEO of NTUC Unity Healthcare. "We want to be well-prepared for any disruption that may impact our service to customers."
              
              Cresenciano Maramot, Managing Director for SGS Malaysia and Singapore said: "NTUC Unity Healthcare's accreditation for BCM is a further testament to Singapore's reputation as a hub for corporate best practices. SGS is pleased to have certified NTUC Unity Healthcare against the ISO 22301:2012, making it the first Singaporean company to achieve this certification with the accreditation from the Singapore Accreditation Council."
              
              About ISO 22301:2012 "Societal Security -- Business Continuity Management Systems"

The requirements specified in this International Standard are applicable to all organisations, or parts thereof, regardless of type, size and nature of the organisation.
