              <p><em>Themed "Capitalising on Fast Changing Markets", experts will share insights into 2013 economic outlook and "game changing" global trends</em></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct. 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Global Entrepolis @ Singapore (GES) Business Leaders Summit 2012 will get underway next week (22nd - 25th October), bringing together policy makers from Asia, leaders from the world's top management consulting firms and some of the top decision makers in business.</p>
              <p>This ninth annual event, aptly themed "<em>Capitalising on Fast Changing Markets</em>", takes place at a time when government and business leaders as well as non-government experts are dealing with the challenges of a highly dynamic and volatile economic environment. This year's event will take place at Resorts World Convention Centre in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Presented by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF), the republic's apex chamber, GES 2012 aims to catalyse the growing importance of Singapore as a gateway for the exchange of ideas and business-to-business facilitation. This year's forum will take a highly focused approach by concentrating on the challenges and opportunities ahead in 2013, the rapid rise in emerging markets like Indonesia and Myanmar, and how sustainable ideas and solutions can be transformed into business opportunities.</p>
              <p>Heading the list of political leaders include Guest-Of-Honour Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Malaysia Minister of International Trade and Industry HE Dato' Sri Mustapa Bin Mohamed and Ambassador of Ukraine to Singapore Pavlo Sultanskyi. Former Korea Prime Minister and current Korea International Trade Association Chairman Dr Han Duck-Soo will also be speaking at the event.</p>
              <p>The summit will be attended by more than 600 influential senior business executives, entrepreneurs, high net-worth individuals, founders and policy makers this year.</p>
              <p>"As the Federation celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, it is moving to be a more issue-centric organisation. GES is one of SBF's signature platforms in this strategic direction. The SBF has also increased its offerings with the inclusion of focused business forums and master classes. These key topics cover human capital, sustainability, franchising, supply chain leadership, and SME issues, in the context of increasing economic global volatility," said Mr Tony Chew, Chairman of Singapore Business Federation.</p>
              <p>ANZ Bank, which has a banking network across 28 markets in the Asia Pacific, is supporting GES as it sees a rapid growth in trade, capital and people flows in this region, said Singapore CEO Vishnu Shahaney. "We recognise that the pulse of commerce is sustained through cross-border exchange of ideas and insight. In our view, Global Entrepolis @ Singapore is an important working platform that contributes to this fresh interaction of ideas and solutions."</p>
              <p>Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq), an investment promotion agency from UAE's Sharjah Emirate, will be another key participant at GES 2012, using it as a key platform to promote links between both regions. "Shurooq has been actively pursuing stronger business ties with various companies, entities, governments, and organisations in the East and in this regard Singapore -- with its wealth of business experience and sound fundamentals -- is an excellent match for the Authority's aims," said CEO H.E. Marwan bin Jassim Al Sarkal.</p>
              <p>"Shurooq's goal is to develop Sharjah's considerable investment potential and providing facilities and incentives to help overcome obstacles facing investment activities in Sharjah is one of its key functions, which is why GES 2012 is such a valuable platform," he added. Shurooq is keen to promote investment and development sectors in the areas of travel &amp; tourism, healthcare &amp; pharmaceuticals, transport &amp; logistics, and environment in Sharjah.</p>
              <p>The summit will also explore opportunities in the infrastructure investments in Asia, present an update of the regional markets, and spotlight hot sectors and projects in emerging economies such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam.</p>
              <p>In addition, GES 2012 offers several programmes including the 'SBF SME Convention 2012', 'APAC Sustainability Leadership Forum', 'Growth Through Franchising Forum', 'Supply Chain Leadership Forum' and 'Selection, Development and Retention of Your Highly Talented People Forum'.</p>
