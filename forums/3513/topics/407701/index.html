              <p>WOWtv Partners with iConcerts to Showcase Live Concerts in Singapore</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p>2010-08-09 09:00</p>
              <p> SINGAPORE, Aug. 9 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, Asia's leading broadband entertainment content provider and a subsidiary of US-Based Amaru Inc (AMRU), has entered into an agreement on 23th July 2010 to launch iConcerts high-definition live music channel on WOWtv online platform. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WOWtv</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To distinguish itself from the massive deluge of contents both from its own library and the world wide web movies, WOWtv platform was conceived as a ubiquitous online player that features five selected Prime Programs Channels featuring WOWSelect, WOWFashion; Auto Tv, Qtrax Music and iConcerts Channel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Swiss-based Transmedia Communications has chosen Singapore WOWtv as its inaugural launch, to tap onto WOWtv's established presence in Asia Pacific. It sees Singapore's multi-cultural mix and its excellent IT infrastructure, governmental support, plus M2B's early-established presence in Asia Pacific, as an ideal launch pad for a burgeoning internet population in Asia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Featuring performances by some of the most popular international artists, from Coldplay to Santana and Amy Winehouse, iConcerts HD has already established itself as the first HD TV concert channel in Europe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It features the world's largest library of live music performances, from best-selling contemporary stars to legendary performers like Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>iConcerts has its sight on Asia, and M2B's WOWtv platform as its first Singapore outlet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Singapore is a perfect base to respond to the growing demand from Asian operators," commented Etienne Mirlesse, Transmedia CEO. "It is both a state-of-the-art digital hub and a top-notch production environment. It will allow us to not only bring the best of the international live music to Asia, but also to incorporate Asian artists into the iConcerts repertoire."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About the Venture</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Agreeing with Etienne's assessment to use Singapore as an effective launch pad for Western and European Media companies wanting to penetrate Asia, M2B's CEO Mr Percy Chua said, "We are extremely pleased to be part of this historic moment in the media development of Singapore, using M2B's WOWtv platform to showcase premium music concerts and entertainment channels." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To cap the significance of launching iConcerts in Singapore, a major live Concert event will be hosted in Orchard Road after the Mid-Autumn festival. This marks an important milestone for both companies.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"MDA (Media Development Authority of Singapore) is pleased that WOWtv -- a Singapore based company has been chosen by iConcerts to host its videos, and use Singapore as their Asian hub to expand into the region," commented Mr Yeo Chun Cheng, Director of Broadcast and Music.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We welcome iConcerts' presence here, which attests to Singapore's growing role as a Global hub in Asia where companies innovate, manage and integrate their Asian and global businesses. In Singapore, iConcerts will also have the opportunity to leverage our broadband infrastructure and digital media talent to develop innovative multi-platform services to extend its business," said Ms Angeline Poh, Director (Infocomms and Media), Singapore Economic Development Board. </p>
