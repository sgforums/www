"Businesses can now better manage and operate their imaging requirements through a much more effective and efficient process. Furthermore, with the bizhub PRESS C70hc, they now have access to unprecedented vivid and natural colour production." <br><br>Comprising talks and an exhibition, the BE SMART theme presents the 'Business Elements' in Konica-Minolta's product focus, which encapsulates the intelligence of its printing solutions through 'SMART' business elements: <br><br>-- Smart SECURITY: Deploying robust security technology, such as <br>Biometric Authentication, to ensure only authorized personnel can <br>use the device, and that such usage is tracked. <br>-- Smart MANAGEMENT: Incorporating advanced features to track usage, <br>print management and cost control. <br>-- Smart ARCHIVAL: Managing information, forms, and other documents <br>in the Document Management System from the Multi Function Device. <br>-- Smart REPRODUCTION: Intelligent Production Printing that bridges <br>the gap between small-volume office printing and high-end offset <br>printing. Production Printing enables high-quality materials <br>(such as direct mailers or brochures) to be printed in volumes <br>that would otherwise be uneconomical using normal offset printers. <br>-- Smart TECHNOLOGY: Konica Minolta's advanced printing and imaging <br>technologies such as OCR Connector and Pagecope Mobile. <br><br>SEMINAR HIGHLIGHTS: <br><br>-- Schenker (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd, an established and leading <br>transport and logistics service provider, shared their experience <br>on how the right imaging solution has helped propel their business. <br>This talk was presented by their IT Director of Special Projects, <br>Regional Information Technology, Mr Leong Chee Shian. <br>-- Mr Dannis Leow, Solutions Manager, Konica Minolta delivered talks <br>on Optimised Print Services to show how customers can better <br>utilise their imaging investments. <br><br>SPECIAL SHOWCASE: bizhub PRESS C70hc <br><br>The bizhub PRESS C70hc made its grand debut in Singapore at the BE SMART show, pioneering a new level of quality in many segments of production printing with its revolutionary High Chroma toner that produces vivid and natural colours. Unique to Konica Minolta's new Simitri HD toner, this enables colour gamut that gives the closest ever match to the sRGB. In addition, a faster turnaround print time is achieved as the post-print drying process is eliminated. <br><br>The bizhub PRESS C70hc features a resolution of 1,200 x 1,200 dpi (8-bit) and works with advanced colour processing technology S.E.A.D. Screen-Enhancing Active Digital Process, which guarantees exceptional colour reproduction of up to 71 pages per minute. The system can be equipped with any of three controllers - EFI Fiery, Creo Colour Server or our unique, Konica Minolta Colour Controller - and handles media of up to 300 gsm. <br><br>Graphic arts companies, commercial printers as well as advertising agencies and creative professionals will appreciate the large sRGB coverage area along with the facilitated sRGB colour workflow. <br><br>About Konica Minolta <br><br>The Konica Minolta Group offers high-quality services, solutions and products in imaging by combining four core technologies - materials, optics, nano-fabrication and imaging - to service the business technologies, optics, healthcare and measuring instruments markets. <br><br>Konica Minolta, with a history of expertise in light and chemistry, continues to create new value in production printing, a field of output that requires reliable high-speed and high-quality commercial printing, and in-house volume printing, as well as in next-generation lighting, solar power generation and other clean energy systems. <br><br>Konica Minolta, the logo, and other trademarks are trademarks of Konica Minolta and may not be used without permission. <br><br><br>SOURCEï¹›Konica Minolta Business Solutions (S) Pte Ltd <br><br></p></div>
