            <div class='col-md body'><p>LONDON, Feb. 27, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Alpari, a global association of companies providing online foreign exchange ("Forex", "FX"), precious metals and CFD trading services, today announced a five-year title partnership with the World Match Racing Tour. The agreement sees the world's leading professional sailing series become the Alpari World Match Racing Tour from February 2012. <br><br>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2012/02/27/20120227185606521501.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2012/02/27/20120227185606521501.html</span></span></a> ) <br>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2012/02/27/20120227185420784910-l.jpg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2012/02/27/20120227185420784910-l.jpg</span></span></a> ) <br><br>Jim O'Toole, CEO of the Alpari World Match Racing Tour, today joined David Stuart from Alpari in the City of London to announce the title sponsorship. To mark the start of the partnership a unique 3D street art project, recreating a match racing scene of two boats going head to head in a winner-takes-all competition, was revealed in the City. Passing City commuters had their photos taken "on board" one of the boats. <br><br>The deal will benefit both parties and is a timely boost to global professional sailing where other properties have struggled commercially against a backdrop of tough economic conditions. As a global sports series with events in North America, Asia and Europe, the multimillion-dollar partnership creating the Alpari World Match Racing Tour will help Alpari reach out to even more people across the continents and promote online trading to an even wider audience. <br><br>Speaking about the partnership, Jim O'Toole, commented: "To be collaborating with such a forward-thinking and ambitious organisation as Alpari is extremely exciting. We know from our research that the World Match Racing Tour's fan base provides the perfect audience for Alpari to engage with and build its customer base. The partnership further underlines the strength of the Tour's commercial proposition and I look forward to working with the Alpari team over the next five years." <br><br>David Stuart from Alpari added, "We are very happy to announce our partnership with the World Match Racing Tour. The Tour and Alpari have so much in common and we'll both be strengthening our brands by entering into this partnership. The Tour appeals to an international audience and specifically to people who are ambitious and self-motivated. These are essential attributes of successful traders so Alpari's services should excite them." <br><br>The Alpari World Match Racing Tour begins in May and will feature nine events in Germany, South Korea, USA, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Bermuda and Malaysia. The Tour attracts the world's best match racers who will compete for the ISAF Match Racing World Championship and the largest prize purse in the world of sailing (US$1.75 million). <br><br>Commenting on the season ahead, O'Toole added: "2012 will be a major landmark in the delivery of our owner's vision for the Tour with the title sponsorship relationship with Alpari, our new venue in Chicago and an exciting line-up of Tour Card Holders including multiple World Champions seeking to break records and rookies hoping to make the big breakthrough. It promises to be a dramatic season all round. We can't wait for our first race, Match Race Germany, to start!" <br><br>Notes to Editors: <br><br>2012 Alpari World Match Racing Tour Calendar: <br><br><br>Date Event Location <br><br>1 May 23 - 28 Match Race Germany Langenargen, Germany <br>2 May 29 - June 3 Korea Match Cup Gyeonggi, South Korea <br>3 July 2 - 7 Match Cup Sweden Marstrand, Sweden <br>4 July 10 - 15 Chicago Match Cup Chicago, USA <br>5 July 24 - 29 Portimao Portugal Portimao, Portugal <br>Match Cup <br>6 Aug 28 - Sep 2 St. Moritz Match St. Moritz, Switzerland <br>Race <br>7 Sep 24 - 29 Match Race France Marseille, France <br>8 Oct 1 - 7 Argo Group Gold Hamilton, Bermuda <br>Cup <br>9 Dec 4 - 9 Monsoon Cup K.Terengganu, Malaysia <br><br><br>About the Alpari World Match Racing Tour: <br><br>The Alpari World Match Racing Tour (WMRT) is the leading professional sailing series featuring nine World Championship events across the globe, sanctioned by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) with "Special Event" status. <br><br>The World Tour awards over US$1.75million in prize money with points awarded at each event culminating in the crowning of the "ISAF Match Racing World Champion".
