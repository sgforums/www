              HONG KONG, May 10 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- "New media -- new opportunities" -- that is the motto under which one of the leading event organizers of the region, UBM Asia, will launch MBAwired APAC (http://www.mbawired.com ), a virtual MBA fair for candidates in Asia interested in attending business school.

              Virtual fairs replicate the features of face-to-face events in a virtual world: instant messaging, voice and video chat and webinars allow participants to interact at virtual booths, in the auditorium and even in virtual networking lounges. Visitors benefit from live interaction with exhibitors and speakers -- all without leaving their desk.
              
              When MBAwired APAC opens its doors on June 3rd 2010, individuals interested in joining an MBA program will have many opportunities for research and education. Similar to face-to-face meetings, candidates attend a virtual venue to meet school representatives, students, and alumni at the exhibition booths. MBA prospects can also attend presentations and panel discussions in the auditorium and ask their questions to experts who will host public chats in the virtual networking lounge.
              
              Almost 15 business schools have confirmed their participation -- amongst those are top ranking schools such as Thunderbird, ESSEC, IE, Cambridge and many more. The organizers emphasize the broad geographical range with schools from Asia, Europe and the USA being represented. Candidates will be able to ask their questions, download information and get valuable contacts for future follow up.
              
              The virtual auditorium will be center stage for expert presentations on how to select the right business school and program, strategic approaches to the admission process, the GMAT test, and how to match MBA studies with career plans.
              
              Advice will be also available by independent MBA consultants in the virtual networking lounge. This public chat area will enable participants to ask their questions, contribute their experience and benefit from discussions about MBA studies.
              
              "Choosing the right business school goes beyond official rankings it is about the personal fit. With the online event we do not replace personal meetings but we make them much more efficient. We open the door to creating the perfect match between prospective student and the schools available. The virtual setup of MBAwired enables attendees to get crucial first hand information and establish valuable personal contacts with schools' representatives, students and alumni," said Jerome Hainz, Manager eBusiness at UBM Asia.
              
              The access to MBAwired is free of charge for prospective students -- a simple registration is required at http://www.mbawired.com/candidates.html (http://www.mbawired.com/candidates.html ).
