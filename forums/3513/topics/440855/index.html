              <p>TOYS"R"US, INC. Acquires Majority Stake in Existing Business Operations Throughout Southeast Asia and Greater China</p>
              <p>Joint Venture Agreement with Li &amp; Fung Retailing Provides Significant Opportunity for Further Expansion in New and Existing Asian Markets</p>
              <p>WAYNE, N.J., Nov. 1, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Toys"R"Us, Inc. and Li &amp; Fung Retailing today announced they have entered into a joint venture agreement for the Toys"R"Us(R) business in Southeast Asia and Greater China. With this agreement, the existing Toys"R"Us licensed operations throughout Asia, which currently consist of more than 100 stores and offices across nine markets, will become 70 percent majority owned and controlled by Toys"R"Us, Inc. and 30 percent owned by Li &amp; Fung Retailing. The terms of the joint venture also allow Toys"R"Us, Inc. to acquire the remaining share of the business in the future.</p>
              <p>Effective immediately, the joint venture will include 90 existing Toys"R"Us stores in Brunei, mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. These stores will be considered wholly owned operations of Toys"R"Us, Inc., increasing the number of the company's wholly owned international locations by 17 percent. The remaining 14 stores in the Philippines and Macau continue to be operated under a license agreement.</p>
              <p>"Li &amp; Fung has been a terrific partner in establishing and growing the Toys"R"Us brand in Asia, and we are pleased to continue our work with them as we enter this exciting next phase of our business development there. We believe there is significant growth opportunity for our company in this region, and we look forward to an aggressive expansion of our business in both existing and new Asian markets, including Northern China," said Jerry Storch, Chairman and CEO, Toys"R"Us, Inc. "International growth remains a key part of our long-term business strategy, and we are proud to celebrate this important milestone for our company."</p>
              <p>The joint venture will include ownership and oversight of office operations in all nine markets, as well as the regional headquarters in Hong Kong. More than 350 employees who had previously been part of the licensed operation will now become Toys"R"Us, Inc. employees. An existing network of eight distribution centers in Asia will be used to stock its Toys"R"Us stores.</p>
              <p>The Chairman of the Li &amp; Fung Group, Dr Victor K Fung said, "Over the past 25 years we have opened over 100 Toys"R"Us stores across Asia. This successful business has benefited from high brand awareness and the recruitment of nearly three million members in our Star Card loyalty program in the markets we operate. We are pleased to return to the joint venture arrangement with Toys"R"Us, Inc. in anticipation of the next phase of business growth. The new agreement will enable us to expand into additional geographies such as Northern China, which will help us leverage even further growth in the region."</p>
              <p>Toys"R"Us, Inc. opened its first international locations in 1984 with wholly owned stores in Canada and a licensed store in Singapore and has continued to grow its operations around the world. The Toys"R"Us business in Asia grew in 1986 when Li &amp; Fung Retailing opened the first Toys"R"Us store in Hong Kong at Ocean Terminal in a joint venture with Toys"R"Us, Inc. This joint venture was converted to a licensing business in 1999.</p>
