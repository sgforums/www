              <p>Enhanced Content Provides Conference Attendees Access to Authentic, Up-to-date Information Needed to Gain an Edge in Today's Competitive Asian Marketplace <br><br>MACAU, April 19, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- For its fifth anniversary, Global Gaming Expo Asia (G2E Asia) 2011 will offer enhanced conference content that will provide three days of the most comprehensive gaming education in Asia. Taking place June 7-9 at the Venetian Macao, in Macau S.A.R., People's Republic of China, G2E Asia 2011 will offer attendees the opportunity to explore the top issues affecting the Asian gaming market, including the operation of VIP junkets, new and enhanced ways to provide better security in casinos, and the best strategies for hiring (and retaining) top-notch casino staff. <br><br>"During the past several years we've seen gaming markets in Asia experience exponential growth," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr., president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. "These expanding markets and the critical issues facing the gaming industry will be examined thoroughly at the 2011 conference event. G2E Asia is the premiere conference event for the pan-Asian region and provides gaming industry professionals with the education and tools they need to succeed." <br><br>This year, G2E Asia will debut several exciting new features. The conference will introduce simultaneous translation services, allowing attendees to listen to sessions in English or Cantonese. Also, the G2E Asia website, www.G2EAsia.com , has added a feature where conference attendees can help craft the content for each session in order to maximize their conference experience. <br><br>The conference at G2E Asia 2011 will begin Tuesday, June 7 and will feature the Global Markets Forum, a full-day program that will examine the economic and regulatory issues affecting current and emerging markets in gaming jurisdictions throughout the pan-Asian region. Sessions will include "Southeast Asia: Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines," "Song of Singapore: One Year Later," "North Asia: South Korea, Taiwan and Japan" and "Down Under: Australia and New Zealand." <br><br>On June 8, the conference will divide into two tracks -- one for senior management and one for middle management -- and will cover operations, gaming technology and marketing with content tailored for each group. Sessions targeted to senior management include "Non-Gaming Amenities: Something for Everyone," "Protecting the Investment: Risk Management and Security in the Gaming Industry" and "Electronic Table Games: From Single Machines to Stadium Seating Games." Sessions for middle management include "Budgets That Work: Living Within Your Means," "Taking the Floor: The Ideal Mix of Tables, Slots and Amenities," and "Working for a Living: Hiring -- and Keeping -- Casino Resort Staff." <br><br>G2E Asia will conclude on June 9 with general sessions focusing on "Finding Finance: Following the Money," "The Chinese Consumer: How to Appeal to the Regional Giant" and "Dueling Demographics: Market Segments and Growth Opportunities." <br><br>The G2E Asia Gaming Management Certificate Program will also take place on June 9 and will include special interactive educational workshops designed to help new casino managers in Asia further their knowledge of current gaming trends in Macau. This executive program is produced in partnership with gaming professors at the University of Macau and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Singapore. All attendees will receive an official certificate of their achievement from both sponsoring universities and G2E Asia. <br><br>G2E Asia is the premier gaming exhibition and conference event dedicated to the Asian gaming markets.
