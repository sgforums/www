              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Exclusive deals and free shipping** on PayPal Plaza to boost holiday shopping for consumers across the region <br><br>SINGAPORE, Nov. 9, 2010 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- PayPal announced today that it will expand its consumer protection for shoppers across the Asia Pacific region just in time for the busy holiday shopping season when they make purchases at any of the 8 million merchants worldwide that accept PayPal. Starting this month, the enhanced PayPal Buyer Protection policy now protects shoppers across the region if they receive an item* that is significantly different than described by a merchant. This new layer of safety strengthens PayPal's current protection for shoppers across the region when they do not receive the item* they purchased using PayPal. For more info about PayPal Buyer Protection policy, please visit: https://www.paypal-apac.com/buyerprotection/security-centre.html . <br><br>"Since we launched our original Buyer Protection policy in June, Asian consumers have been much more comfortable with shopping online and they have increased their purchases using PayPal over the past 5 months. We value the trust that over 16 million PayPal users across the region place in us and our Buyer Protection Policy for a safer online shopping experience," said Nimish Dwivedi, Regional Head of Marketing, PayPal Asia Pacific. <br><br>Commenting on the upcoming holiday shopping season, Nimish said, "We're excited to expand our successful Buyer Protection policy to give Asian shoppers greater peace of mind when they shop for holiday gifts at this time of the year. We are also launching a new online shopping site for our users across the region called PayPal Plaza that offers exclusive deals and free shipping** from merchants across the region. With greater consumer protection and more savings for Asian consumers, shopping online this holiday season with PayPal is even safer and more rewarding." <br><br>PayPal Plaza (http://www.paypal-plaza.com ) features over 60 merchants from around the Asia Pacific region - including Australia, mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand - that offer up to 50% discounts along with free shipping** to any location in the region. The merchants are grouped into 15 categories - such as fashion, electronics, toys, books, jewelry, cosmetic, health products - as well as by three locations: China, Australia and Southeast Asia. More merchants and offers from around the region and the world will be added every month. <br><br>PayPal Plaza also provides useful shopping features including: <br><br>-- "Gift finder" to search for the perfect gift by budget, category, gender and age <br>-- "Wishlist" to keep track of great product offers and share the wishlist with friends and family <br>-- "Reminders" to find a gift for upcoming events like birthdays and anniversaries <br><br>About PayPal <br><br>PayPal is the faster, safer way to pay and get paid online.
