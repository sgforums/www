              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; font-size: medium;">HONG KONG, June 19, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Syneron Medical Ltd. (NASDAQ: ELOS), the leading global aesthetic device company, announced today the launch of the eTwo(TM),GentleMax Pro(R) and UltraShape(R)V3 systems in Asia. The announcement, which took place at a press luncheon at the Langham Place Hotel, on June 6, 2012, follows on the successful launch of these products in Europe. The launch event featured presentations from renowned dermatologists from across Asia on their experience with these newly launched systems. <br><br>(Logo: <a href="http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120528/535447">http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120528/535447</a> ) <br><br>"Syneron's products and technologies are ideally suited for the unique composition of Asian skin and are backed by the expertise and support of our dedicated Asian market Medical Advisory Board," said Louis P. Scafuri, Chief Executive Officer of Syneron Medical. "We are very excited to launch several of our newest and most popular products for our customers and patients in Asia. We believe they will be well received given that they meet the unique requirements of the Asian market and will help address the significant growing demand for aesthetic procedures in this market." <br><br>The eTwo(TM) platform, with its Sublime(TM) and Sublative(TM) applications, has received FDA approval and CE Mark for dermatological procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing in addition to non-invasive wrinkle treatment. It delivers highly effective skin rejuvenation treatments that increase collagen and elastin production for a brighter and smoother complexion, with minimal dermal disruption across all skin colors and skin tones. The eTwo(TM) platform supports the new Sublative iD tips, which are designed to maximize treatment options and results. Dr. Wichai Hongcharu, M.D., Chief of Dermatology Unit of Saint Louis Hospital, shared his experience with eTwo(TM) as "a non-invasive Complete Facial Rejuvenation, which has shown impressive improvements in tone, texture and skin laxity." <br><br>The GentleMax Pro(R) is a solid state, dual wavelength laser platform that offers maximum performance in speed and reliability for the largest energy-based, nonsurgical cosmetic procedures, which includes: hair removal, Melasma and deep vascular lesion treatment. The GentleMax Pro(R) features over a dozen new features and refinements to existing features, making it a more thorough and truly enhanced experience for both physicians and their patients. Dr. Geun-Soo Lee, M.D., Ph. D., board certified dermatologist of Korea, presented his remarkable results on treating Melasma using GentleMax(R) from a clinical study. He spoke highly of GentleMax(R), and he expects GentleMax Pro(R) will be even better for "covering wide range of indications with two different wavelength beams, variable parameters, beam size and DCD." <br><br>The UltraShape(R) V3, is a clinically proven non-invasive solution for fat reduction and body contouring using Vertical Dynamic Focus(TM) (VDF(TM)) "non-thermal" focused ultrasound technology. This unique fat selective technology gives physicians a comprehensive body sculpting solution that enables targeted, non-invasive fat destruction. Dr. Chung-Li Huang, M.D., board certified dermatologist of Taiwan, also the Director of Chung-Li Huang Dermatological Clinic and Cosmetic Laser Center, demonstrated the advantages of using the UltraShape(R) V3 on localized fat deposits. She is convinced that UltraShape(R) V3 would attract a significant amount of new non-surgical patients to her clinic, due to its "pain-free, 'walk-in, walk out' nature of the procedure and the long-lasting body contouring effect." <br><br>About Syneron Medical Ltd. <br><br>Syneron Medical Ltd.
