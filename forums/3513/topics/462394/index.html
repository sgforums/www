              MP International Announces IGDA to Support "Asia Game Show" (AGS) and "Global Electronic Entertainment Expo" (GEEE!)
              
              World's largest "International Game Developer Association" endorses Hong Kong's Iconic AGS, and this region's first and only B2B interactive game show: GEEE!.
              
              HONG KONG, Dec. 3, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Exhibition and Conference organizer MP International (Asia Pacific) Ltd. announced today that the International Game Developer Association (IGDA) will be the "Cornerstone Association Sponsor" for Hong Kong's largest interactive video entertainment shows in both the consumer (AGS) and B2B (GEEE!) marketplace.
              
              The 11th annual edition of the Asia Game Show (AGS) is the largest video entertainment tradeshow for the consumer marketplace in Hong Kong. This iconic event has become more than a predictable experience as well as Hong Kong's most anticipated annual event. More than 470,000 attendees participate at this must-attend, hands-on "happening" for video game enthusiasts. The 8,000 square meter expo is transformed into a fantasy world for retail buying and selling. Consumers last year generated nearly HKD$30million in sales; and that number is expected to rise in 2012. This year's event will take place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from Dec 21-24.
              
              Debuting in November 2013 at Hong Kong's Asia World Expo, Global Electronic Entertainment Expo (GEEE!) will open as Asia's largest and most significant gathering of cross platform technology partners in the Interactive Video and Electronic Gaming Industry. This tradeshow and conference is exclusively designed for "the business" of electronic entertainment, and therefore is a trade-only event. It will offer in-depth, hands-on educational training from leading companies, industry leaders and thought leaders in the interactive gaming field. For the first time ever in this region, this extraordinary new event will facilitate a face-to-face arena bringing together buyers (retail distribution chain), wholesale distributors, Developers, and industry leaders in electronic and interactive gaming.
              
              "We are certain to make Hong Kong the epicenter of this exploding international market by being the only city to Host the largest and most significant events in both the business to business and consumer Electronic Entertainment Market," said Mr. Charles Greco, Executive Director MP International. "The growth of the electronic entertainment industry is phenomenal and the region is expected to lead the global growth." he continued, "We want Hong Kong to be in the middle of it all by providing a comprehensive destination for the industry to come together to learn, network and most importantly, conduct business with each other."
              
              "Our endorsement of these two stellar events is in recognition of the technological revolution in the Asian Gaming Industry and the amazing growth it continues to experience;" said Mr. Craig Cook, Chair, International Game Developer Association and CTO, Playality. "There has never been a more important time for the industry to gather together at this epicenter (Hong Kong) of new opportunities for our industry." he continued, "As a result, the IGDA is announcing the establishment of a Hong Kong chapter for its Asia operations and to foster the already growing community of game developers. IGDA is pleased to support both the Asia Game Show and GEEE! (Global Electronic Entertainment Expo). With this new and exciting partnership we are in a strong position to help the industry grow, educate the community about developing games and entertainment, as well as showcasing business opportunities in this part of the world."
