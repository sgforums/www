              <div id="subheadlines" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.6em; font-style: italic;">-Leading GDS in Asia Pacific will enable accelerated global growth for Sabre</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">SOUTHLAKE, Texas</span>, and <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">SINGAPORE</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <a style="margin: 0px; color: #6099e9; outline: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sabre.com/">Sabre Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: SABR) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Abacus International, the leading global distribution system (GDS) in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> region. Abacus is currently owned by a consortium of 11 Asian airlines along with Sabre, which has a 35% stake in the company.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Sabre will purchase the remaining portion of Abacus for net cash consideration of <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">$411 million</span>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"The <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> travel market is the largest and fastest growing in the world," said <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Tom Klein</span>, Sabre President and CEO. "Acquiring Abacus immediately combines the global capabilities of Sabre with the deep local market expertise of the leading Asia-Pacific GDS. This powerful combination will give customers even more innovation and service options, while allowing Sabre to accelerate growth globally in a very capital efficient way -- and to gain regional synergies in all three of our businesses serving travel agents, airlines and hospitality companies."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Abacus International President and CEO, <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Robert Bailey</span> added, "With our extended network in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span>, Abacus has built a trusted brand of unique significance and scale. We now have the opportunity to take the business forward even faster, broadening the scope within the Sabre family and with the support of our shareholder carriers. This is great news for the industry in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span>, and we look forward to passing the benefits of integration to all sectors of this region's diverse travel community."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Abacus serves more than 100,000 travel agents across the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> region's 59 markets and has both global and uniquely local relationships with airlines and hotels, including the leading portfolio of low-cost content and Chinese airline content.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Separately, the acquisition includes new long-term distribution agreements between Sabre and the 11 airline owners of Abacus.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"We look forward to continuing our long-term business relationships with our former partners in Abacus, and our new agreements will provide benefits and confidence to travel agents throughout the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> region for many years to come," said <span class="xn-person" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Greg Webb</span>, President of Sabre Travel Network.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"Abacus currently provides a broad set of services to its customers using a base of Sabre technology for the large majority of core functions to market, distribute, sell and service travel in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> region," Webb added. "That, along with deep local market capabilities, will result in a smooth transition for <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> customers, who should see the benefits of global capabilities while continuing to use our familiar, leading technology."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Abacus will operate as a region of Sabre Travel Network, and Sabre expects its expanded <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> direct presence will benefit Sabre Airline Solutions and Sabre Hospitality Solutions, which already provide mission-critical support to 78 airlines and thousands of hotels throughout the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> region. Sabre also will continue its partnership to provide technology services to INFINI, a local Japanese GDS.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">"Sabre and Abacus have established the gold standard for service and content in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> region, and that only gets better," Klein said. "Together with Abacus, Sabre will provide customers and suppliers with improved and faster access to Sabre's industry-leading innovations, including low-cost carrier content, ancillary capabilities, data analytics, and the latest in mobile solutions and personalization services. Additionally, airlines and travel agencies will have more options for new and differentiated products and services created specifically for customers in the <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Asia-Pacific</span> market."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The acquisition, including associated working capital adjustments and cash acquired, is expected to be financed through approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">$250 million</span> in cash on hand, augmented by incremental net debt of approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">$160 million</span>. Pro forma for the transaction, Sabre estimates its <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">March 31, 2015</span> net debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA ratio would be 3.3x, compared to 3.0x as reported.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Assuming a third quarter closing date, Sabre expects the transaction will increase 2015 revenue by approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">$120 million</span>, be approximately neutral to 2015 Adjusted EPS and modestly accretive to current-year Adjusted EBITDA.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">In 2016, Sabre expects the transaction to increase revenue by more than <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">$300 million</span>, to increase Adjusted EBITDA by approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">$50 million</span> and to be accretive to Adjusted EPS by approximately <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">$0.05</span>.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Sabre will conduct an investor conference call on <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Thursday, May 14</span> at <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">11:00 a.m. Eastern Time</span>.

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">This release refers to unaudited non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, and the ratios based on these financial measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Income adjusted for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of capitalized implementation costs, amortization of upfront incentive consideration, interest expense, net, and remaining provision (benefit) for income taxes. We define Adjusted Net Income as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for impairment, acquisition related amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, other, net, restructuring and other costs, litigation and taxes, including penalties, stock-based compensation, management fees, and tax impact of net income adjustments. We define Adjusted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by the applicable share count.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">We present non-GAAP measures when our management believes that the additional information provides useful information about our operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. </p>
