Quantum3D will be showcasing its ExpeditionDI(R), the industry's first self-contained, wearable and fully-immersive close combat infantry simulator training platform, Mantis Real-Time Management Scene Management software platform for flight simulation, and its leading line of Thermite ruggedized embedded computers. <br><br>"As one of the world's largest aviation and defense shows, the Singapore Airshow provides an ideal international platform for Quantum3D to showcase our leading technologies in virtual training solutions," said Arthur Yan, president, Quantum3D. "Our solutions are well-known in the United States, and we are excited to expand our presence and exposure globally at the show." <br><br>Quantum3D will be demonstrating a range of leading virtual training systems at their booth (#T76, US Pavilion), including a two-soldier demo of its ExpeditionDI combat simulator training platform as well as Mantis Real-Time Scene Management software for flight simulation applications. Following are additional details on the Quantum3D products that will be showcased and displayed: <br><br>-- ExpeditionDI -- Designed to provide a realistic, immersive 3D training experience deployable on-base or in-theater for individual or squad-based training, as well as large scale joint training operations, ExpeditionDI is equipped with a high-resolution Head Mounted Display (HMD) and fully integrated wearable computing pack to respond simultaneously to multiple body and weapon movements. These advanced technologies enable an infantry squad to move through and interact in a virtual environment while fighting and communicating as they would in a real-world combat situation. <br>-- Mantis Real-Time Scene Management Software -- Delivering high-resolution imagery, Mantis offers a wide range of PC hardware configuration to match any simulation application, including fixed- and rotary-wing flight simulation, ground vehicle simulation, tank simulation, mission rehearsal, sensor simulation, and more. Mantis features a full range of special effects, sensors, weather, and lighting, along with mission-critical functions such as height-above-terrain and line-of-sight intersection testing. Mantis is fully customizable to provide unique effects and specific features to meet the demands of any simulation and training needs and also supports additional plug-ins, such as ocean effects, and rotorwash for an even greater sense of realism. <br>-- Thermite Family of Ruggedized Computers -- Designed to endure some of the most severe environmental and temperature conditions, from extreme weather to vibrations and shock, Quantum3D's award-winning line of Thermite embedded systems provide high-performance in field-deployed computing to meet the computing and operation needs of demanding military and aerospace environments. <br><br>For more information on ExpeditionDI, Mantis Real-Time Scene Management, or Quantum3D's line of Thermite systems, visit Quantum3D's website( <a href="http://www.quantum3d.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.quantum3d.com</span></span></a> ). <br><br>About Quantum3D <br><br>Quantum3D, Inc. is a leading developer and manufacturer of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS), open-architecture, real-time visual computing solutions.
