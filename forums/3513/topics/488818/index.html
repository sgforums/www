              <div id="dvContent" style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6em; color: #464646; word-wrap: break-word; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">LONDON</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Sequa Petroleum NV ("SPNV") is pleased to announce that an agreement has been reached for the acquisition of Tellus Petroleum Invest AS and its subsidiary Tellus Petroleum AS (collectively "Tellus") a company registered in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Norway</span>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">Concurrent with the acquisition, Tellus has entered into an agreement with Wintershall Norge AS ("Wintershall") to complete a large asset portfolio transaction on the Norwegian Continental Shelf ("NCS") acquiring working interests in 4 fields; Knarr 20%, Maria 15%, Ivar Aasen 6.5% and Veslefrikk 4.5%. Interests in seven exploration licenses and 10% in PL316 which contains Yme are also included in the transaction. As is normal for this type of transaction it is subject to consent by the Norwegian Authorities, including the approval of Tellus as a new NCS player, closing is expected at the end of 2015.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The purchase price for this portfolio is <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$ 602 million</span>, which makes it one of the major acquisitions on the NCS so far this year. In addition, Tellus Petroleum will make a further payment of up to <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">US$100 million</span> depending on the development of the oil price in the period from 2016 to 2019. With proven and probable (2P) reserves estimated to be 59 million boe net, based on the numbers from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD). The production peak is expected to be in the order of 15,000 boe net per day, predominantly oil. The effective date for the transaction is <span class="xn-chron" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">1st January 2015</span>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">On completion of the acquisition of Tellus, SPNV will become the 100% owner. Completion is subject only to a shareholder vote with simple majority of the votes cast, for which irrevocable undertakings of 48% of its shareholders have been obtained in addition to 15% of votes held by SPNV management team.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The current management team in Tellus will continue to run the company and the organisation will be further developed to manage the portfolio.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">The consideration for the acquisition of Tellus by SPNV is a combination of cash and new shares issued by SPNV to sellers of the shares in Tellus. Depending on future performance, the consideration will be a maximum of 6m SPNV shares and <span class="xn-money" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">$4m</span> cash.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.6em;">In addition to their extensive technical and commercial expertise in <span class="xn-location" style="font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Norway</span>, Tellus brings an attractive business development portfolio with identified targets that provide additional economies of scale, with attractive incremental returns in the near term. This fits with SNPV's strategic goal to acquire oil and gas assets that are in production or are being rapidly developed towards production.</p>
