              The iProperty Group Forms Exclusive Partnership with Floorplanner.com
              
              Offering property buyers an innovative platform to view and design their property
              
              SINGAPORE, Jan. 16, 2013/PRNewswire/ -- The iProperty Group, owner of Asiaâ€™s No.1 network of property portals in Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore, announced that it has formed an exclusive partnership with Rotterdam based company, Floorplanner.com. The partnership is set to offer property buyers a revolutionising platform to find the property of their choice.
              
              Set to be featured across the iProperty Groupâ€™s network of property portals, Floorplanner.com, a leading online floor planning application tool, will allow property buyers the opportunity to generate floor plans of their listing in either 2D or 3D.
              
              According to iProperty Groupâ€™s Chief Executive Officer, Shaun Di Gregorio, the partnership was also in line with iProperty Groupâ€™s strong focus in providing consumers a unique offering.
              
              â€œAs a company that strives on providing innovative solutions, the partnership with Floorplanner.com will allow us to take the products and services that we currently offer our consumers to a whole new level. The advancements of technological opportunities call for new ways of presenting and showcasing property,â€� said Di Gregorio.
              
              He added that Floorplanner will be a great tool for property buyers as they often wonder if the property they like will cater to their needs and whether renovating it will produce the results they desire.
              
              â€œIt truly is a compelling interactive tool as floor plans can be viewed directly on each of the portals that we own and operate. Property buyers can draw and design their floor plans themselves. They can renovate and furnish the floor plan according to their own preference and taste. The tools provided are easy and fun to use and we believe that property buyers will have fun illustrating their vision on how their desired home should look like,â€� added Di Gregorio.
              
              Elaborating on, he added that the partnership was an important component to the iProperty Groupâ€™s strategy to capitalize on the rapid growth of the business, and to solidify their position as a leader in the exploding and rapidly growing property industry.
              
              â€œWe see tremendous value in this partnership. We know that purchasing a home is one of the biggest investments they will ever make and with Floorplanner, they are now not only able to find their dream home, but now personally design the interior of their home virtually,â€� added Di Gregorio.
              
              Echoing the same sentiments, Jeroen Bekkers, Chief Executive Officer of Floorplanner.com, said, â€œWe are very excited to form this partnership with Asiaâ€™s No.1 network of Property Portals. I believe that with our unique offering combined with the iProperty Groupâ€™s extensive brand presence, we will be able to take our business to the next level.â€�
              
              He added that floor plans can be created with just a few clicks and filled with details using Floorplanner's library of objects. Everything can be resized, rotated and reshaped as desired. These floor plans can be published online or exported offline.
              
              According to Di Gregorio, Floorplanner, which is made available for free, is targeted to be officially launched in February this year.
