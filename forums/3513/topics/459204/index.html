              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 1.6em; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px;">RICHARDSON, Texas, Sept. 25, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- <a style="margin: 0px; color: #6099e9; outline: none;" href="http://www.mavenir.com/">Mavenir Systems</a>, a leading innovator of mobile infrastructure solutions for 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) operators, enables the rapid introduction of Voice and SMS services with its Circuit Switch Fallback (CSFB) solution that helps operators launch CSFB independent of their MSC.  Mavenir already has several live CSFB deployments with tier 1 operators in multiple countries. Several more are expected to go live in 2012.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 1.6em; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px;">Circuit Switch Fallback (CSFB) enables delivery of circuit-switched voice services to <a style="margin: 0px; color: #6099e9; outline: none;" href="http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=179689">LTE</a> handsets by triggering "fall back" to the 3G network to complete voice calls. With CSFB, operators can immediately support new LTE-enabled smartphones, such as the newly announced iPhone 5, for voice and SMS in advance of IMS-based VoLTE solutions that won't be widely available until 2014.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 1.6em; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px;">While CSFB is key to enabling the introduction of 4G LTE smartphones, the technology itself has the drawback of perpetuating investments in legacy 3G core infrastructure. Mavenir's unique solution overlays the legacy infrastructure and allows operators to focus their CAPEX investments on next generation 4G technology with a CSFB solution that can be launched within 60 days.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 1.6em; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px;">"Our value proposition is combining proven CSFB technology with our speed to market and the ease of integrating into 4G LTE networks." said Pardeep Kohli, president and chief executive officer of Mavenir Systems. "Our IWF CSFB function helps the network economics of introducing new LTE services quickly and cost effectively."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 1.6em; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px;">Mavenir is focused on helping operators around the world with their network transformation to all IP and their introduction of new advanced services, quickly and efficiently.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 1.6em; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px;">Added Kohli, "This is the first step for many operators, but they can easily leverage this Mavenir CSFB investment along the path to SRVCC and VoLTE."</p>

              <p>Technology in the mobile phones is 
                  evolving at the rapid pace. Everyone knows that mobile phones have 
                  become the important part of the people lives irrespective of their 
                  occupation or income. The whole concept of telephony has been 
                  transformed a lot in 21st century. Companies are trying hard to bring 
                  the innovative solutions so that it can spread all over the universe. 
                  Daily new mobile devices are launched along with the innovative 
                  features.</p>
              <p><span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p>4G technology is replacing the 3G networks. 3G 
                  technology which was introduced earlier allow the people go online using
                   your mobile phone. But 3 G technology created many problems as it was 
                  not the faster and was also less reliable. Fourth generation technology 
                  offers the fast speed as compared to 3G technology, With help of this 
                  technology almost all the people are connected form each and every 
                  corner.     LTE (Long Term Evolution) and WiMax (Worldwide 
                  Interoperability for Microwave Access) are the two technologies that 
                  constitute the fourth generation technology of wireless data networks. 
                  Both these technologies have gained lot of popularity. The goal of both 
                  these technologies is same but their specifications make it different. 
                  There is huge difference between these two technologies. WiMax 
                  technology can be used in that area where the people want high speed 
                  mobile Internet. Even this technology offers high speed because these 
                  are currently much more available. Already in many cities across the 
                  United States this network infrastructure has been incorporated. The 
                  other reason of people using this technology is that in many devices 
                  this technology is used. So people do not want to spend much money on 
                  buying LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology device. Both the 
                  technologies use the different bands.</p>
              <p>The advantage of using the LTE technology is that it has the download speeds up to 100 Mbps which is ten times faster as compared to the Wimax.
                   This technology helps to increase the efficiency as well as reduce the 
                  operation cost for the operator. Even the LTE technology consists some 
                  features if the WiMax technology. WiMax technology offers 30-40Mbps 
                  download speeds while LTE offers 100n Mbps download speed. One more 
                  advantage of having the LTE technology is that it has been incorporated 
                  with other cellular technologies to make it smoother while in Wimax the 
                  person has to face many problems finding 4G again once they use 3G area.
                   This type of problem is not prevalent in the LTE technology.</p>
