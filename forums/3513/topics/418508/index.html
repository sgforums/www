              <p>SINGAPORE, Dec. 17, 2010 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- AECOM Technology Corporation, a leading provider of professional technical and management support services for government and commercial clients around the world, announced today that it recently won three Awards of Merit in the Singapore Institute of Planners Awards competition.</p>
              <p>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/12/17/20101217884197.html">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/12/17/20101217884197.html</a> )</p>
              <p>From Top: Tanjung Rhu Resort, Langkawi, Malaysia; Subic Neocove Resort, Subic Bay, Philippines; and Gadeokdo Modalopolis, Busan, South Korea. All three projects have won Awards of Merit in the Singapore Institute of Planners Awards competition.<br>Presented every two years, the competition recognizes urban planners and consultancy firms in Singapore for their excellence in both local as well as overseas projects.</p>
              <p>AECOM's work on the Tanjung Rhu Resort received an Award of Merit in the Best Urban Design project category. For this project, the team envisioned a sanctuary of nature and authenticity that not only promotes sustainability, but also positions Tanjung Rhu as the first comprehensive and integrated resort for Langkawi, an archipelago located off the coast of Malaysia.</p>
              <p>A second project, Subic Neocove Resort Masterplan, for the resort in Subic Bay, Philippines, won an Award of Merit for Best Overseas Planning project. The vision for this project was to create an environmentally sustainable resort destination that captures the scenic beauty of the site but also incorporates well-balanced programs, activities and developments.</p>
              <p>Originally developed for an International Urban Ideas Competition for the Sustainable Development of Gadeokdo, Busan in South Korea, AECOM's Modalopolis -- which came in first for the competition -- also won an Award of Merit in the Best Overseas Planning category. The innovative concept frames Gadeokdo as a "major hub of global trading" for Northeast Asia, integrating urban development, business and tourism with nature.</p>
              <p>"This is a great acknowledgment from the Singapore Institute of Planners of AECOM's growing masterplanning capabilities, innovation and thought leadership in Southeast Asia. Underling each award were visionary clients with a strong environmental and social commitment for developing the right mix of use that will create exceptional places for each site," said Scott Dunn, AECOM's regional managing director, Planning, Design + Development, for Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p>Founded in 1971, the Singapore Institute of Planners (SIP) is a professional body dedicated to the advancement of urban planning and the promotion of the planning practice as a profession. The Institute promotes design excellence through its biannual design awards whereby a sovereign panel of highly-qualified judges evaluates all entries on the basis of originality, innovation, quality of presentation, planning approach and sustainability. This is AECOM's first participation to this awards competition.</p>
