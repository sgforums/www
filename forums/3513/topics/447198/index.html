              <p>Westcon Solutions Driven by Strong Local Relationships, Unique Go-to-Market Programs <br><br>SINGAPORE and TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Feb. 13, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Westcon Group, a value-added distributor of category-leading unified communications, network infrastructure, data center, and security solutions with a global network of specialty resellers, today unveiled a new business unit dedicated to distribution of high-growth software and security technologies in Asia Pacific. The business, Westcon Solutions, is driven by strong local partnerships and unique go-to-market programs -- backed by the power of Westcon Group's global brand and footprint. <br><br>Westcon Solutions today also unveiled inaugural vendor relationships in the areas of security, business intelligence, network access control, VPN encryption, and WAN optimization. The newly formed operation extends Westcon's successful strategy of developing separate, security-focused business units. <br><br>"Our business is designed to meet the needs and best-practices of each individual market. This allows Westcon to operate a number of separate business units dedicated to specific vendors or technologies," said Wendy O'Keeffe, Executive Vice President of Asia Pacific, Westcon Group. "Westcon Solutions is fully consistent with this strategy -- building on a strong global presence while allowing for development of unique, country specific go-to-market programs targeted at the Asian market." <br><br>According to IDC, the market for security software will continue to demonstrate significant growth in Asia Pacific during 2012: "Driven by enhanced security threats and new high-profile attacks, companies are taking a closer look at how they protect their infrastructures. This presents a unique opportunity for partners who can offer in-depth security expertise with an understanding of the local market," said Naveen Hegde, Senior Market Analyst of Software Research, International Data Corporation (IDC). <br><br>Westcon Solutions addresses partner requirements for value-added distribution alongside local support. The business offers a customized approach to channel development and focused selling and is investing heavily in personnel for sales and technical certifications – as well as marketing for lead generation, user education and partner enablement. <br><br>"When you look closely at the Asian market, what's clear is there's a huge growth opportunity for a regional value added distributor like Westcon Solutions," said Wilson Ho, Managing Director, Westcon Solutions. "We are focused on nurturing high-growth, niche market technology vendors. With dedicated technology expertise, a strong local presence, and the resources of a global brand – Westcon Solutions is perfectly aligned to capture an opportunity not often addressed by many broad-line distributors." <br><br>For more information on Westcon Solutions or Westcon Group, please visit <br>www.westconsolutions.com or www.westcongroup.com.
