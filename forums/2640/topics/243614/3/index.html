If you were to take my DSLR away and give me the Sony again, I think the only difference it would make is to affect the quantity of great shots, or "keepers", rather than affecting the quality of my "keepers".<br><br>So I don't think what inextremo says is true. Basics begin not with the type of equipment, but the mastery of your creative eye.<br><br>Anyway, <a href="http://wphaven.sgforums.com" rel="nofollow">the Writers' and Photographers' Haven</a> is where all critical photography topics should be in sgForums, so head down there if you like.</div>
