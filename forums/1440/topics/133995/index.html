            <div class='col-md body'>EULOGY BY GRANDDAUGHTER OF FORMER PRESIDENT WEE KIM WEE - LIM HUI MIN<br><br>Weekend May 7, 2005<br><br>MY grandfather's achievements as an editor, a diplomat and a head of<br>state are now the stuff of legend. You would have read all these things<br>in the newspapers or watched them on television - he was a public man.<br><br>What I should talk about is my grandfather as a family man.  I cannot<br>talk about my grandfather without also talking about my grandmother. She<br>was the rock of his life. His last thoughts were of her.  They were<br>holding hands when he finally went to sleep on Monday morning.<br><br>Last year, we celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary. After dinner he<br>presented her with a red packet full of money, which he then followed up<br>with a jewellery box - because my grandmother loves wearing jewellery.<br>There was a jade brooch inside the box. And, in return, in front of<br>everybody, she kissed him three times.<br><br>They were 87 and 88 at that time.<br><br>Once, (when) I was learning the piano, I thought I would learn some<br>songs to play at my grandmother's birthday party. I asked my grandfather<br>what songs he thought she would like.  To my surprise he gave me a<br>type-written sheet (with songs listed)in order of preference. He was<br>always a busy man - he used to tell me that he had two million things on<br>his mind. But at some point in his life, he had sat down and thought<br>hard about what music my grandmother would enjoy and typed it all out<br>and kept it in special folder ready to be whipped out at anytime.<br><br>Husbands who are here today: Do you have a list of your wife's top 10<br>favourite songs in a folder? That's a lesson you can take from my<br>grandfather.<br><br>They celebrated 69 years of marriage together in April this year. I<br>thank my grandfather from the bottom of my heart for showing us what it<br>really is like to love a person. I also thank my grandfather for showing<br>us what it is to love life.<br><br>He was a man who enjoyed life. He collected snuff bottles, coins and<br>stamps. He travelled the world; he played sports; he planted fruit<br>trees; he loved the smell and taste of hazelnut coffee.<br><br>Whenever his grandchildren visited him in his office - whether at the<br>Malaysian High Commission, the embassy in Tokyo, the Singapore Broadcast<br>Corporation or the huge halls of the Istana - there would come moments<br>when he would wink at us, open his desk drawer and say "have a<br>chocolate".<br><br>Unknown to my grandmother, who disapproved of his snacking in between<br>meals, he always kept a secret stash of Hawaiian hazelnut chocolates,<br>which he ate out of her sight during office hours.<br><br>My grandfather loved animals as well. He liked to watch horses running.<br>He liked dogs and cats and he liked fish. At the last count, his house<br>contained 11 chickens, eight terrapins, two goldfish and one dog.<br><br>Once, someone gave him six turkeys. I think the idea was for them to be<br>fattened up and eaten. My grandfather looked at them and spoke to them.<br>He gave them names. I remember my mother saying to me, "Oh no, he has<br>given them names - we'll never get rid of them now". And so the turkeys<br>were with us for quite some time.<br><br>But one day, they started irritating the chickens so my grandfather<br>decided to find them a new home. The Singapore Zoo was chosen. When the<br>family heard about this, of course we all joked that the turkeys would<br>be fed to the crocodiles.<br><br>He was so alarmed by this that he made special arrangements with the<br>zoo. They were to send him a written report every time a turkey died.<br>The report had to state the cause of death and age of each turkey.<br><br>That was the kind of man my grandfather was. He revered and respected<br>life - even the life of an animal.<br><br>The stories of his life are, to me, all stories of love. If you wish to<br>honour his memory in your life, then live your life to the full, stand<br>by your friends, cherish your family, listen to everyone with an open<br>mind and welcome those who cross your path with an open heart.<br><br>He has gone on another journey now. We have spent the past five days<br>saying goodbye to him and it is now the time to let him go.<br><br>From all your grandchildren and great grandchildren: I know you love us<br>all so very much.<br><br>Goodbye gong gong (granddad). Goodbye.</div>
