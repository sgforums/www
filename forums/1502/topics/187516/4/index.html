Or else some used to burn people at the stake just for saying something else not in accordance to their 'teachings'. Those religions have been a major cause of most wars in the past 1000 years. Of the only few genuinely peaceful religions, only one is not in support of it, but it does not condemn it outright either. U really want to use religion as a deciding factor? don't be daft. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>tell u what. WHY don't u explain why homosexuality is morally wrong. Go on. But let me warn u 1st, "because society" thinks so is NOT an acceptable excuse. U have to list it out in the proper cause-effect manner, as well as list the victims. And oh, don't try to give me the "if everyone was gay..." argument because thats daft as well. the way nature works is that there will never be 100% of either sexuality, so u can forget that.<br><br>meanwhile, lets not be shameless eh? "kind advice" indeed. don't make me laugh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Adams, Ph.D., Lester W. Wright, Jr., Ph.D. and Bethany A. Lohr<br>Department of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens 30602-3013, USA.<br><br>Abstract:<br><br>The authors investigated the role of homosexual arousal in exclusively heterosexual men who admitted negative affect toward homosexual individuals. Participants consisted of a group of homophobic men (n = 35) and a group of nonhomophobic men (n = 29); they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W. W. Hudson &amp; W. A. Ricketts, 1980). The men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual, male homosexual, and lesbian videotapes, and changes in penile circumference were monitored. They also completed an Aggression Questionnaire (A. H. Buss &amp; M. Perry, 1992). Both groups exhibited increases in penile circumference to the heterosexual and female homosexual videos. Only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli. The groups did not differ in aggression. <span style="color: red;">Homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies.</span><br><br>don't say im talking nonsense.
