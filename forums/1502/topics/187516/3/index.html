Why? no homosexuality. nature has taken a backseat and left the human species to its own mercies. So trendz's balls are destroyed thru nanotechnology because the he has shown not to be clever enough to be a candidate for the human selective breeding program (as proven by how he talks about homosexuality and nature without thinking deep enough the role of homosexuality within nature). He is not allowed to reproduce, neither is he allowed to have a mate. All such activities must be applied for, and sanctioned by the authorities before it can happen. Others choosen for the breeding program are not allowed to choose their mates. Instead, their genetic makeup are run thru a supercomputer to determine the best compatability with another set of genetics, and the 2 choosen humans are then forced to mate.<br><br>In this alternate world, where we pretend that there is no homosexuality because nature does not intervene, naturality is no longer preserved as a desperate human race resorts to desperate measures to combat a monstrous growth rate in the species numbers of homosapients.<br><br>Luckily, and thankfully, in real life, nature does intervene to keep human growth at a sustainable rate, so we can retain our ability to love freely and mate freely. Thus as human populations have ballooned over the last 500 years, we also see the % of homosexuals increase. That is the purpose of homosexuality in nature.<br><br>It'd take a big idiot to bandy nature's purposes about as a condemnation of homosexuality without even taking the time or the effort to understand and learn how its totally part of nature.</div>

U've spent all of it trying and failing miserably to insult me, and none of it to rebutt the facts I've put forward about how homosexuality is part of nature's workings. As we can see, anyone who cannot put back a good counter argument and has to resort to insults alone, is definately on the losing and deluded side of a debate. U're wrong about things and u know it, even if u're too thin skinned to admit it. Awww.... u poor thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  But thanks for helping indirectly prove my arguments are right.<br><br>yawn.... talk about life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  i have a life. do u? do u REALLY?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  small boys like u should learn to see the world as it is. but then if small boys like u are stupid enough to think anyone who fights against homophobia(note, its against homophobia, not speaking up for homosexuals) must be gay, then small boys like u really show what irony is when u say to "go get a life"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Any of u ever lived with a person who is gay? U ever bother talking to homosexuals to learn about things from their perspective? No u just sit in your sorry little holes with your sad pre-conceived notions about homosexuality and that is just fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cking sad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Well u might not like the idea but yes u're probably closet gay.

Its just sad that u continue deluding yourself "its simply not true" because u have no supporting evidence for that statement. U're believing in something that is built upon empty air, a belief held only because people less enlightened in the past believed in it and passed that belief along as the true.<br><br>So I guess u are so out of things to say u have to resort to personal insults. That shows the quality of people who are homophobic. Just pure stupid, uncouth louts who faced with the crumbling of the ideas they hold dear by the absolute truth of things, can only lash out in impotent rage.<br><br>Sad. At the end of the day, u're just on a sinking boat and pretending u can't feel the water around your legs.
