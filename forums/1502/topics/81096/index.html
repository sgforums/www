            <div class='col-md body'>i dont think this is true. the issue here is not about who not being able to understand who.<br><br>rather, i think this is an excuse ppl use for not communicating or for poor communication. there is always this mindset and mental model in both parties when an old speak to the young, based on not too rational things like appearance and perception.<br><br>in the end, if both parties are willing to communicate and are able to do so well without any preconceived notion, understanding is never a problem.<br><br>so the crux of the issue is communication.</div>

More often than not we are too narrow minded and our refusal to see past anything we have done renders our view to just a limited scope.Which seriously undermines any sort of effective communication<br><br>Or was there any communication in the first place... Then again...<br><br>So what should be done? I would suppose throwing them into situations at work. Learning the hard way. Too many are too spoilt and do not realise there is more to life than just whiling time away, wasting money and living life on the edge. Do they realise what is the future they are going to have if they continue to do so? I seriously doubt so.<br><br>So time for a serious re-think in ur attitudes and actions guys...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heavy hand and hurtful criticism won't help youth<br>I AM greatly distressed and discouraged by Ms Tan Lin Neo's condemnation of Singapore's teenagers as a 'bunch of softies' and her disapproving comments about the 'quality' of today's youngsters ('Don't let cushy environment ruin our youth's future'; ST, May 24).<br><br>As a Singaporean teenager myself, I am deeply hurt by the seemingly never-ending criticism of youth from all quarters.<br><br>What I find especially worrisome is Ms Tan's unwavering support for harsh punishment and firm discipline to 'instil the right values in our youngsters'.<br><br>She seems to equate the rise in freedom of speech with a loss of respect for elders. According to her, the greater freedom that the youth of today have seems to make us disrespectful, soft and ungrateful.<br><br>Her cure is for parents to 'reprimand and punish'. To her, the medicine for Singapore's social ills is to force the children to 'listen and obey' and, through that, learn the right values.<br><br>It is true that the youth of today are much more likely to voice their opinions than in the past. But does that mean we are disrespectful?<br><br>Does Ms Tan really advocate a return to the upholding of filial piety to the letter, with its attendant images of sullen children silently filing past adults, always in fear of being beaten for asking even harmless questions?<br><br>While I agree with her that perhaps we teenagers should express our opinions with greater tact and courtesy, there is an equal responsibility on the part of parents not to be too repressive. A question to authority need not necessarily be a questioning of authority.<br><br>I also agree that Singaporean teenagers are overly sheltered with maids and parents looking after their every need. But I disagree with Ms Tan's dire predictions that we will be left helpless without 'the fifties and sixties generation to guide us' and that we will be incapable of fending for ourselves.<br><br>Hundreds of Singaporeans are studying in overseas universities, and many of them grew up in precisely this kind of sheltered environment.<br><br>They face the enormous challenge of living alone far away from home, and not only survive but also grow increasingly independent.<br><br>These clueless teens - who, as Ms Tan insists, cannot fry an egg, nor wash their own clothes - seem to be doing pretty well on their own.<br><br>It is people like Ms Tan - who insist that a heavy hand and firm guidance are the only solution - who are responsible for perpetuating their very own dire prophecies.<br><br>How can we teenagers be expected to have any confidence in ourselves when our very elders (whom we are expected to respect and seek advice from) are unhesitating in doubting and condemning us?<br><br>The irony of the whole matter is that all these criticisms are born out of the fear of parents in letting go - they seem insistent on thefact that we can't take care of ourselves.<br><br>Sadly, harsh discipline, firm instruction, listening and obeying go only so far in teaching us how to survive in life. The rest has to be learnt, as they say, from the 'school of hard knocks'.<br><br>My belief is this: If the elders really want us to grow up, throw us in at the deep end of the pool and let us sink or swim. Cling to us and we'll drown.<br><br>CALEB LIU XILIANG<br>Oxford, Britain<br><br>--ST Forum</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Youth club to boost ties between generations<br>By Ted Chen, TODAY<br><br>SINGAPORE : Getting grandparents to go on food hunts across Singapore with their grandchildren is the answer to family bonding.<br><br>So says a youth volunteer group, and it will get $1,600 of funding from the Citibank's Citigroup Foundation to develop a business idea around this premise.<br><br>The Youth Culture Club (YCC), one of 50 four-member groups among 200 volunteers participating in this year's Citibank Youth for Causes (CYFC) programme, plans to sell cards and discount booklets to members of the public.<br><br>These will be their ticket to 20 restaurants in places like Chinatown and Little India where they can vote for Singapore's best local dishes.<br><br>Plans also include a food bazaar in which restaurants and cardholders can participate to raise funds for charity.<br><br>Proceeds will be donated to an as-yet unnamed elderly charity group.<br><br>Group leader Mr Radin Hassan, 31, explained: "Usually, the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren is better because grandparents tend to be more lenient. Their involvement can help parents bond with their children."<br><br>Mrs Tan Chee Koon, executive director of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre and one of the seven judges who selected the YCC for the programme, said the judges found the group's project appealing because it "aimed at strengthening inter-generational ties, when youths often tend to want to group with other youths".<br><br>The CYFC programme is a social venture capital fund started by Citibank and YMCA Singapore in 2002.<br><br>The Citigroup Foundation will provide $80,000 worth of seed funding to the volunteers - aged between 15 and 35 - who will develop business ideas and raise funds for 29 volunteer welfare organisations over a 10-week period starting from May 29. - TODAY<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>opportunities for communication - hopefully to lead to better understanding?<br></div>
