            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i had decided to pen down some of my thought after " volunteering" in a flag day by St. Luke Hospital and Eldercare. This, at the same time can also help to do something to revive my small pathetic Teen Planet. Haha, one stone hit two birds...<br><br>It was a pretty early morning, we waited at the mrt station to get our so called donation box but it was some kind  of bag with those stickers and one small licence. Anyway, continue my story, so off we go, we went to another mrt station with bus interchange. There will be more flow of people, that is what on our mind.<br><br>Started off with by standing alone all by myself just outside the mrt. I was very nervous, I approached the first person in an odd manner. Got rejected. The next few people show me off the stickers they got from the opposite bus interchange across the road, all i can do is to smile back to them. Maybe some other students might be selling there i thought. Bad luck, and did not even get a single donation, lost all my confident and thus i decided to join my friends in the other entrance of the mrt station.<br><br>In the new area, it was a complete different story to tell. I got ready my stickers by pasting them a straight row on my donation bag so that people can actually donate, get their stickers and hurry off to catch their train. It worked! Got my first donation of the day and all the fear of more rejection is gone. My friend and i approached several people from all walks of life. Our donation bag grew heavier and heavier, sense of acheivement i guess.<br><br>I also more about our Singaporean's kindness thru this 4 hour event. While I was standing, looking for donaters, there is actually some people who could take the trouble to walk up to me and empty their wallets or bags to contribute to the donation bag. The most memorable case is one lady whom I approached and she actually open up her handbag, her coin purse and ended up donating a shiny $10 note. WOW! There is what my reaction is when she slip it into the donation bag. Some parents with kids are also quite generous when it comes to donation, maybe they are trying to educate their childrens about helping the needy and so on. Way to go daddies and mummies!<br><br>There is also some awkward moment in which I encounter too. One boy in his primary school age donated and asked me for 2 more stickers to be pasted in his sticker book! Haha, I blinked several times and torn out 2 more stickers for him. Hope he can boast to his classmates about this rare sticker which can be gotta only from doing a good deed! Another one was a lady who asked me about the history of the hospital, the patient there, and asked it i actually worked there... All I could do is to smile and at the same time explain everything one by one to her. Do i look so old to work in there? Man, I as jus a student, a vlounteer... That is wat i told my friends in which they laughed at me. Haha. Never approach someone of the opposite gender around the same age as you, I tried and the moment is like asking for their mobile phone number, don't really know how to describe.<br><br>Lastly, it is overall a good experience and it teaches me more than what I could ever learn in classroom. I have also decide to donate to those whoever approached me when I get to the entrance of cwp to library. YEA!<br><br></div>
