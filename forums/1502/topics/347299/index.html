              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do you agree that secondary school sucks big time?</span></strong></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">I had recently done a survey, and report shows that majority of secondary school students strongly insist that their school’s system <strong>must improve</strong>.</p>
              <ol style="text-align: justify;">
              <li>Do students <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span></strong> enjoy their secondary school life, or do they curse and swear behind the scenes? </li>
              <li>Are teachers being fair to students in school, or are they just plain biased? </li>
              <li>Are strict rules for the sake of a school’s reputation in public eyes rather than for the students’ welfare? </li>
              </ol>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Read through this article to find out answers to the above questions and more that you never had expected.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AmosAtlantis says:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, let me tell you what I think about my secondary school based on my past experience. I shall go straight to the point and not beat around the bush.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly, I did not like my secondary school life at all. In fact, I hated my secondary life to the core. There are several reasons why I say so.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I did not like the attitude of some of the teachers whom used to teach me. I think that they are biased and evil, especially the discipline teachers. If you are one of them reading this article, I think you should know that you deserve to die, deep in your heart.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the rules set by my school, or rather, most schools, were horrible and doesn’t benefit the students at all. For instance, why are students not allowed to keep long hair? So long as we keep them neat and tidy, I see no problem with that. It is not like we dye our hair. It is utterly ridiculous to ask students to cut slope. One of my teachers even mentioned, what has the length of our hair got to do with how well we do for our exams? I think that is the right attitude.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why are students not allowed to loiter around places and shop at shopping centres around the vicinity? The school is doing this just to protect their reputation. Do you think they actually give a damn about you students?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why are we studying subjects that are not relevant to our future career? I agree that English language is essential to us. Otherwise, I would not even type out this article. But why the hell study subjects like Chinese, Geography, History, or worse, Design and Technology or Food and Nutrition? I find that it is meaningless and a waste of my precious time to do so.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The official school hours is for example, 8am to 2pm. However, it seems that most teachers are keeping students back after the official ending of school at 2pm. We are supposed to go back at 2pm, but yet, they keep us until 5pm, for example. And it is not for one day, but maybe 3 out of 5 school days. What right has those bloody teachers got to do that? As for myself, I did not bother about them, but just went back at 2pm. You think I am scared of you bloody teachers threatening to call my parents or send me for detention? Go ahead and do all you like. No one is going to give a damn about what you teachers do. You teachers deserve to be kicked hard in the ass.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why are schools sending teachers to patrol the neighbourhood? I thought it is the policemen’s duty? Those teachers don’t carry pistols, neither are they trained to catch thieves. Aren’t they afraid that they would be molested or raped by real thugs? Or are they catching students out there just because they think that students are younger than them so they can pick on? Shouldn’t those teachers be spending quality time with students in school, or marking papers instead of patrolling, or rather, loitering around the neighbourhood as well? I think those fucking discipline teachers deserved to be sacked.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why are we students cleaning up the classroom when the cleaners are paid to do so? I do not see any right a teacher has to command students to clean up their classroom. Furthermore, we are not paid to do so. Hence, why the fuck should we clean up the classroom?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I am not saying that we should dirty the classroom just because there are cleaners. Of course, we should respect our cleaners because they are the ones who keep our environment clean. I am just saying why are we even supposed to clean our classroom? Do teachers have rights to command us to clean classrooms and pick up litter?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, I hated secondary school so much till I did not do well for my O-Level exams. However, I just manage to get 3 credits for it. You may refer to my blog article at <a href="http://www.amosatlantis.com/2009/01/gce-o-level-examination-2008/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.amosatlantis.com/2009/01/gce-o-level-examination-2008/</span></span></a> for more information about this.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I think that I have acquired nothing at all from secondary school. I think that my success today does not depend on any of my teachers, nor my school. It solely depends on me and the support my family gave me.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><img title="Secondary school sucks big time!" src="http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg284/amosatlantis/hate-school-calvin-and-hobbes.jpg" alt="hate-school-calvin-and-hobbes Secondary school sucks big time!"></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Next, let us see what another guy has to say about whether he liked secondary school or not. He had requested for his identity to be kept anonymous.</p>
              <hr style="width: 100%; text-align: justify;">
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Anonymous says:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, there was the stress. In modern times like today, our teachers put stress on us, our parents put stress on us and even our grandparents do that too. I’m the eldest among my cousins, so I get a lot of pressure from my entire family, where I have to set a good example, set the right path … what’s worse? There was no one to help me through it, because I was the eldest and they keep putting high expectations on me, much higher than I know I can achieve. It really depressed me for a point of time.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, we put stress upon ourselves. Nowadays, as society gets more and more qualified, we tend to become more paranoid and put more stress on ourselves.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I have a few classmates who, like me, keep thinking we aren’t good enough, not doing enough, and we keep pushing ourselves, which did cause me to break down several times, more prominently during upper sec. As you might or might not know, getting a paper qualification is a norm these days. Not getting one would be below average.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, school becomes more like a workload and a chore than an enjoyment of life, which is what it should really be. Learning should be something one should love to do and enjoy, not dread and hate. That’s not really what life and learning are about. We don’t get to appreciate life this way, and we don’t mature as a person. That’s really sad.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Other than the stress, we have the friends. Luckily for me, I chose the right friends.<br>However, unluckily for me, during my upper sec days, I offended some of my level mates unintentionally. I didn’t even refer to them, but they took it as I did and it was so serious that they resulted to harassing me online and in school.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">During Sec school, everyone tries to fit in, tries to be popular and such. These trends have never changed throughout the years and are still prominent. Thus, many turned to bad companies to look cool. They resort to harassing others, being a bully and more. These made lives for others like me in school a nightmare.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Thus for me, sec school wasn’t very much memorable nor enjoyable. The only times they were enjoyable were with my good friends where we were enjoying ourselves.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, there are more and more such naughty students out there that honest and true friends are so hard to find.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Modern times are so complicating.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t know what happened at Coral Sec, but here’s what I think. Discipline teachers in my school are either blind or they are being biased. They tend to treat the prefects better than us normal students. Also, the prefects always let their friends off when their friends break the school rules, but to others? They catch them and give them a warning point. How fair is that?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">During upper sec, the students tend to break the school rules more, because they tend to be more brave and such.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">However, the teachers catch the students who didn’t seem to have broken the school rules, but let those who really did break the school rules, off.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">For example, the girls’ skirt has to be below the kneecap. I have a few friends who have skirts just at the knee cap or VERY LITTLE above it… Some have it below the kneecap, but all still get caught.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Mind you, we were sec 4s then. We had no time to care about such stuffs when we have to study every day, and for those who outgrew the uniform, you can’t expect them to buy a new set when it is already our last year. And my friends’ skirts weren’t short at all.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In other classes, there was this one girl that has the skirt WAY ABOVE the kneecap, but she never got caught. Not even once.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t know how the teachers see the length of the skirt, but like I said, it’s either they are blind, or biased. (My class was hated by a lot of teachers, so the answer is probably quite obvious.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The official time is 2pm? My school ends way later than that, especially when we were in upper sec. Even in sec 2, I remember ending at 3.30 on Tuesday. When I was in sec 4, we ended at 5 on Thursday, and those 2 are just examples. There were more.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Cleaning up the classroom is essential, but it can be taken place before school starts or during recess. Detention is part of the school’s discipline system, so if the students don’t want to be in one, just don’t break the school rules. Thus, I find these 2 quite reasonable.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I find that the teachers shouldn’t make the upper sec stay behind in school too late, as they usually have much more homework and revision to do. They should try to improve in timetabling.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">School rules are strict because the students are getting more and more out-of-hand. As long as they are reasonable, I think that’s fine.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of lameness, well, some are indeed lame. For example, some schools don’t allow students to keep long hair. What right does a school have to control the student’s hair? As long as the students know how to manage their hair, I think that’s fine.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I agree. I know of one school that looks very good in public’s eye, but is corrupted inside. Also, that school doesn’t care about the welfare of the students at all. They only think of the school’s reputation. Indeed, sometimes they do mention that it’s for our own good, but the real intention is not that.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">One fine example I know of (accurate one) was when once during assembly, one student fainted, the Principal only gasped, but didn’t run down to help.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">For this point, I can only say one thing: That’s invading the privacy of the students.<br>As a teacher, they should instil the right values in the students so that they will uphold it in their own will and not because they know that a teacher is watching them, and so they obey. That’s not right and it shouldn’t be like that.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Yes. Schools shouldn’t take up a student’s lives 24/7. Weekends should be reserved to spend quality time with the family, to learn other stuffs like sewing, to rest and to let one enjoy life using what little time one already has.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">And the public dares to complain that families are breaking up. What with work and school taking up one’s lives 24/7. If they never learn, they will never improve.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I don’t really have much comments of this because I never had trouble with the rules, but I do want to point out one point: Some prefects/DM can be irresponsible.<br>My friend once got caught for her earrings. The prefect said that they will confiscate it and return it to her later.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">However, up until we graduated, not only have her earrings not be returned to her (it was given to her by her sister (sentimental value) and it was quite expensive), the prefect lost it. No compensation either.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Just what did Coral sec do? I don’t know what to say about this, because I don’t have much information/experience, but I know my school tries to follow MOE’s one as best as they can.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, it all really depends on yourself, because it’s your life and how you control it. Others can’t and shouldn’t control you. They can only help. You yourself make the final decision.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Usually parents support teachers because they think they are right. I beg to differ. Probably because parents are teachers are from the same generation (most) and have the same thinking.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Of course Sec schools have to be improved! There are so many horrible ones out there and so many unreasonable rules and teachers out there! Students are suffering so badly.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">However, even those that are fantastic schools, improvement is a 24/7 thing and can never be stopped. One must always improve, or we can never upgrade ourselves.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I think that’s all I can say. I hope it helps. Of course, this is just my point of view, and might be wrong. I’m just going from experience.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><img title="Secondary school sucks big time!" src="http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg284/amosatlantis/teacher20in20bad20mood20angry20upse.jpg" alt="teacher20in20bad20mood20angry20upse Secondary school sucks big time!"></p>
              <hr style="width: 100%; text-align: justify;">
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AmosAtlantis says:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, let me end this article. But before I do so, I have already attained success in myself and I feel that you students should as well. If you hate secondary school, why bother to listen to your teachers? Are you afraid of them? Well, if you are, don’t be!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">There is nothing to be afraid about those teachers. Just treat them as nothing. They don’t dare to lend a finger on you. If they dare, just go home and explain the matter to your parents and then soon, the whole world will know about this matter.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">You know that media is very powerful now, so if those teachers dare to do anything silly to you, their bloody face will appear on the internet as well as on the television and newspapers. Then they will either be sacked or given a warning by MOE. So don’t be afraid of your teachers ok?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have anything, you can either go back home after school and report to your parents, or contact me. I will help publicize the matter all over the internet and we’ll both earn profits together alright? Cheers!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, I’m not from secondary school anymore. I’m enjoying life now, and I’m also independent. I know what I want. Do not think I am a failure just because I hated secondary school and didn’t do too well for my O-Levels. In fact, I am actually more successful than those who score flying colours for their results. Refer to my article at <a href="http://www.amosatlantis.com/2009/02/diploma-in-marketing/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.amosatlantis.com/2009/02/diploma-in-marketing/</span></span></a> to know what I am talking about. You can actually be successful as well, provided you have a goal in life and you are passionate and determined to do the things that will benefit your future career.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I have done the things that will benefit me and my future career. I can assure you that secondary school will not benefit you in your future career. Of course, please try to get a minimum of 3 credits for your O-Level exams; otherwise, I can’t help you as well. Getting 3 credits is extremely easy. Just be good in your English, Mathematics, and Science. Your 3 credits will be assured.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If you think that Junior College, Polytechnic, and ITE are your only choices of further education after O or N Levels, I think you are wrong. It is very narrow-minded to think this way. In fact, there are several other paths which may be better for you.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why bother to retake O-Levels or go to ITE if you had not done well in your exams? Do you want to suffer the plight of staying another year in secondary school and suck up to those god damn teachers? Are you able to bear it? Do you really think that it will benefit you and your future career in doing so? Are you very sure?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">I shall not tell you what the other choices are. If you wish to know, kindly <a title="contact me" href="http://www.amosatlantis.com/about"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">contact me</span></span></a> directly.

              <p>Hi <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/242376">Chris88110</a>,</p>
              <p>I've already graduated from secondary school. Currently attached with a media company and doing a diploma.</p>
              <p>I don't think I wish to get back into secondary school, at all. How about you, Chris?</p>

              <p>there are shitty teachers, but are all because of shitty students.</p>
              <p>and i used to think that studying geog, history, etc are irrelevant.</p>
              <p>but i believe that while these subjects are not actively applied in our future lives, they do impact our social behavior, and you apply studying methods etc which are useful in the future.</p>

              <p>You are required to study a wide base of subjects because you need to have a stronger foundation of knowledge on a wider variety  before you concentrate on the in-depth part of any sub. What future career? You born you know what you're going to be? Even those who have ventured out working for years still have dilema on what path they should walk in the future..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good schools no need to have teachers patrolling the neighbourhood. The only reason they need to do that is because there are shitty students out there doing stupid things like smoking in public while wearing uniform, illegal gathering or maybe even substance abuse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the long hair, we've adopted the British way of education since the start of SG, their school have rules on uniformity, so do we. But I do agree it's bullcrap to cut slope and force stupid hairstyles unto students even though it doesnt really affect their studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Got cleaners mean no need clean up room? Who taught you that? Why the room is dirty in the first place? Why got litters on the floor? Your school have how many cleaners? They don't have other places to clean ah? Your school normally will ask you clean your own classroom nia, cos you use mah, help clean will lose hand meh, never ask you clean hall clean canteen right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You bth they ask you stay back to study then you think you can study on your own, then leave the school loh, stop going back tell your parents to support you then take O's as private candidate lah, your school very sucky mah, you private maybe can get like 6 pointer leh.</p>
