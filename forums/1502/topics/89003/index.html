            <div class='col-md body'>Went to Sentosa on 8th of August with my adventure club people, they were practically a group of fun-loving jokers, made a couple of new friends, namely Roy and Amelia. Played a lot of stupid games, nevertheless it was still fun, after all how many times do you get to share a cherry with a guy? ( the guy's name is omitted in order to protect his privacy :p ) And how many times do you get thrown into the sea?<br>It was a joyous occasion, vastly different from a crestfallen night in Sentosa that I doubt I would forget for a long time to come.<br>Flashing back memories that I had buried deep down in the forgotten realm, the past came back to me.<br>A year ago, at the same place, same day, with different people.<br>Here is where it all begins, the dying of a love that I had never really come to accept. My mind took on the memory train, whisking me back to a time where I was still clad in ugly brown pants and a freshly pressed white shirt for five times a week.<br>After the national day celebration in school, I had to stay back in school for my chemistry mcq revision in preparation for my "O" levels due to my dear chemistry teacher's request. She was going to Sentosa as her friends had organized a birthday party for her. At one point, I was considering on whether I should skip my lesson to spend time with her. She asked me "Would you be going ?", her eyes looking intently at me. I replied softly "I can't .... have fun over there"<br><br>to be continued ...<br><br></div>
