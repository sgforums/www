            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Want to SMS the government to share your views and aspirations for the nation?<br><br>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports is launching a public consultation exercise especially for young people.<br><br>Starting on Saturday and lasting six weeks, the Ministry wants to gather enough views to help shape future youth-related policies.<br><br>Singapore has one of the highest SMS usage rates in the world, and the government wants to tap in on this.<br><br>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, said: <strong>"The definition of a Singaporean is someone who can SMS with his phone in his pocket, and I now want to tell you that you can do that and you can contact the government...so no one has any excuse for not sharing his plans, or his ideas."</strong><br><strong><br>Whether it is by SMS, telephone, email or fax, the Ministry wants to invite all young Singaporeans to share their dreams and plans for the nation.<br></strong><br>This is the first time that a public consultation exercise is focused specifically on the post independence generation or those born after 1965.<br><br>Some have said that this generation is more politically apathetic and unconcerned with larger national issues.<br><br>But Dr Vivian said this need not be the case.<br><strong><br>Dr Vivian said: "I disagree with that, I think that that is a perception and I intend to prove them wrong...there is a lot of potential waiting to be tapped, and we need to open up those avenues.<br></strong><br>"We are about to witness a real flowering of ideas and activism within Singapore, and our youth, particularly the post-independence generation, must be the vanguard of this movement."<br><br>He wants the views collected during the consultation exercise to form the basis of real policies dealing with youth development.<br><br>Dr Vivian said: "We will be able to catalogue what is it young Singaporeans are concerned about, what young Singaporeans want to do. If there are any obstacles perceived or real, it would also be identified, the resources available, the shortfalls in the resources available would also be evident by then. This will allow us to come out with a much more realistic and practical plan."<br><br>As guest-of-honour at a Boys Brigade event, Dr Vivian found no shortage of enthusiastic youths.<br><br>"We should be given more opportunity to stand up and do things for the nation, and personally I find that the youth should be more involved in community work."<br><br>"The youth could be more involved when it comes to political issues and coming to the decisions that our country is making."<br><br>As part of this new initiative, there will also be a focus group, bringing together youths from all walks of life to brainstorm and discuss ideas.<br><br>The group will be led by Dr Mohamad Maliki, who will be assisted by Dr Chong Weng Chiew and Ms Penny Low. All three MPs were born on or after 1965.<br><strong><br>The email is creating_our_future@mcds.gov.sg. Callers can also call 1800-3535555 or SMS 6353-5555. </strong>- CNA<br><br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>anyone keen to take up the offer?<br><br>i do believe there is alot of potential to be tapped - if not anything, just by the responses in this forum.<br><br>but other than the lack of channels to air them, the other is the reluctance to air them - to the authorities. people rather stick to informal channels.<br><br>or am i wrong, and that people are more than willing to share their views with the government if they provide more channels and platforms to do so?<br><br></div>
