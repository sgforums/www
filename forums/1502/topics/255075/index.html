            <div class='col-md body'>First thing I would do is to get schools to instill discipline in students. I've seen far too many male students with long hair gelled upwards trying to look like some superstar but ending up looking like fUck.......... Many also tuck out their shirts trying to look rugged but again ending up looking sloppy. I can say nothing if they are wearing their home clothes but it is the school uniform they are wearing and abusing! Gone is the honour, pride and respect in being in a uniform. And school authorities are doing absolutely nothing!<br><br>While it is understandable that students at this age are only experimenting and mean no harm, failure to enforce discipline will encourage more students to spend more on visiting professional hair salons and hair assessories to compete to see who is most hip (or should I say shIt?) Students from less well-off families may feel more pressurised.<br><br>Secondly, I will scrap all uniform-group ccas as I doubt students learnt anything from joining them. Instead, all secondary school students will be required to perform community service as by volunteering at various charities and social services centres. Fund collection as by selling flags will not be deemed as community service. Community service will only be considered as such if it is performed by students on site and hands-on at the social service centres.<br>This way, tudents actually see for themselves social issues and learn to care genuinely about the society they live in. This will more effectively inculcate in students care and concernfor the less fortunate.<br><br>I could go on and on but the bottom-line is I ain't a student no more and, more importantly, ain't the Education Minister and so ain't no business of mine.....! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

When the teachers tried to punish the students a bit, the parents will step in and question the authority of the teachers.
