            <div class='col-md body'>Depending on the type of student, different methods. most imptly, they must understand rather than memorise. make lessons interesting by talking to them abt schlife get to know them.

            <div class='col-md body'>for maths i think most impt is practice... so give the students exercises to do, but dun overwork them lah..<br><br>then after that go thru the questions with them, make sure they understand how to derive the answer.... ask them to explain how they got a certain answer...<br><br>then make them re-do some of the questions again, esp the harder ones that they got wrong... cos from experience after u explain and u ask if they understand, they will say yes... but usually won't know how to do it all over again by themselves...<br><br>for the weaker students i think it's impt to sit by them while they do their exercises, and prompt them when necessary...<br><br></div>
