Like i say, one small steps u take will cause more things unexpected result unkown. Dropping of result is one of them, work hard and play hard.

Then you have to forsake him because you're putting yourself in a bad situation.<br><br>If you want to maintain your relationship, you must learn to be able to study well and do that. It's not hard, but mentally stressful. At a tender age of yours, you'll likely end up to have be badly depressed.<br><br>However, my opinions and my advice is for you to hear only, not for you to follow.<br><br>You must follow your heart.</div>

Spend so much time on phone etc<br><br>my view: If you can prove to your parents that u can do well in studies yet having someone you love for company... go ahead... enjoy the feeling of being in love.... BUT if the r/s affects your studies... thus causing problems with your parents... then maybe you should think about what's better for you.</div>
