I agree some are really dry but of course it depends on preference. I am a more history person than literature. So I'd more readily accept a story from Romance of the Three Kingdoms than let's say the Story of Ah Q.<br><br>A lot of the textbook "stories" teach you "values". Some stories are pretty inspiring. One memorable one I remember today is the story of Lord Mengchang. (Mengchang Jun) It is a story of winning people's heart, which I feel is  relevant even today.<br><br>On the other hand, I feel the teaching of english quite unstructured. Machiam own time own target. Sometimes the teacher throw you comprehension and esssay writing .. and it is called teaching. No wonder my grammer and vocabulary CMI  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> I bet most people here learn english more from reading and watching dramas/movies.

While hokkien might be your grandparent's MT, that mentality (of recognizing hokkien and not chinese as MT) is 'obsolete' in this globalized village.<br><br>A common language binds people. Hokkien might bind your grandparents in their village last time, but hokkien cannot bind people from other dialect groups in Singapore, though this is not always true since even people from other dialect groups know hokkien. In any case, hokkien cannot bind students who know only chinese and their own dialect MT.<br><br></div>

That's where your vocab and command of the language can potentially expand.<br><br>One teacher even gave us supplement articles from time to time. I remember so fondly .. that was where I learnt Li Qing Zhao's most famous poetry - Sheng1 Sheng1 Man4.
