              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Mr Cheong used to close four deals a month, but is happy now with one.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MR DAVID Cheong has seen all sides of the local residential property market - as a property agent, and more recently as a trainer of property agents.</p>
              <p>   Times are tough now, he said, observing that many would-be agents fall by the wayside when they realise how difficult the market has become.</p>
              <p>   In 2007, he was prompted to quit his $5000-a-month job in the information technology industry, lured by stories of top agents closing more than 10 deals a month and raking in big money.</p>
              <p>   Said 39-year-old: "When I first joined, the industry was booming.</p>
              <p>   "But shortly after, in 2008, things weren't as good."</p>
              <p>   He said he sometimes questions his decision to leave his stable job for this uncertainty.</p>
              <p>   A year into being a full-time agent, he decided that the market was too bad and started looking elsewhere for a job, while supplementing his income as a part-time agent.</p>
              <p>   Now, he is a real estate agent trainer, and has taught more than 3,000 real estate agents.</p>
              <p>   However, only 20 per cent of his students are still in the industry.</p>
              <p>   "Most people come in with the dream that they are going to close many deals a month, but that is simply not true." he said.</p>
              <p>   "In reality, only the top 20 agents in the market are closing the deals."</p>
              <p>   Most of his students leave the industry after they realise that the market is not favourable as they thought it was.</p>
              <p>   He has no plans to go back to being a full-time agent, especially in this market.</p>
              <p>   "I used to be able to close at least four deals a month, but right now, in this market, I am very happy to close even one," he said.</p>
              <p>   Besides residential property, he has started handling commercial property deals, as well as foreign properties, just to stay afloat.</p>
              <p>   "Many agents these days are branching out, because the residential market is not big enough to sustain so many agents," he said.</p>
