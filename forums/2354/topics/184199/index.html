Hermann GÃ¶ring </strong><br><br>~ The most infamous of the Generalfeldmarschalls, GÃ¶ring was actually the first and only Reichsmarschall, the highest military rank of the Greater German Reich. Reichsmarschall was a special rank intended for GÃ¶ring making him the most senior commander in the Army and Air Force.<br><br>Commander of the Luftwaffe, and one of the main leaders of Nazi Germany.<br><br><strong>3. Walther von Brauchitsch |</strong><br><br>~  Commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht in the early years of World War II. Promoted to Generalfeldmarschall in 1940 and one of the key commanders at the battle of Moscow.<br><br><strong>4.  Albert Kesselring</strong><br><br>~ German Generalfeldmarschall who commanded Army Group C during World War II. One of the most respected and skillful German generals, he was nicknamed "Smiling Albert" or "smiling Kesselring". His 20 month long retrograde defence up the Italian peninsula ensured his place as one of the best commanders in the war.<br><br><strong>5. Wilhelm Keitel </strong><br><br>~ Remebered as the Commander who signed the surrender papers to the allies at the end of the european war. Commonly refered to as Lakaitel ("Lackey-tel") by his colleagues for meekly following Hitler's orders wthout question.<br><br><strong>6. GÃ¼nther von Kluge </strong><br><br>~ Led 4th Army in the ardennes offensive culminating in the fall of France. Served as commander, German forces, West after von Rundstedt's illness.<br><br><strong>7.

Fedor von Bock </strong><br><br>~ Attained the rank of field marshall for his sucesses during the campaigns of France and the low countries as comdr, Army Group North. Killed in an allied bombing raid in Hamburg in May 1945.<br><br><strong>9. Wilhelm List </strong><br><br>~ Comdr-in-chief of eastern front army group A in 1942. Sentenced to life imprisonment but eventually released in Dec 1952.<br><br><strong>10. Erwin von Witzleben </strong><br><br>~ Was appointed Commander-in-Chief West in 1941 but retired due to illness. Was implicated in the july plot and sentenced to death by hanging.<br><br><strong>11.Walther von Reichenau </strong><br><br>~ Reichenau commanded the 6th Army during the assault on USSR, taking Kiev and Kharkov. A active anti-semite, he supported extermination of the jews vigorously. A favourite of Hitler, he was killed when the plane carrying him crashed in Leipzig.<br><strong><br>12.Erhard Milch</strong><br><br>~ Little known fieldmarshall who was Air inspector general of the Luftwaffe after the defeat of France. He was removed from office and spent most the war after 1944 under Albert Speer.<br><br><strong>13. Hugo Sperrle </strong><br><br>~ Comdr, Eagel Legion during the invasion of Poland. Led German Air Fleet 3 against France and was made Generalfeldmarschall of the Luftwaffe in July 1940 before the Battle of Britain.<br><br><strong>14. Gerd von Rundstedt </strong><br><br>~ One of the apolitical generals of the Wehrmacht, he was one of the more capable generals who fought with distinction on both the eastern and western fronts during the war, and towards the end of 1944, frequently urged Hitler to make peace rather fight a futile war.<br><br><strong><br>15. Erwin Rommel </strong><br><br>~ Also know as the desert fox, Rommel was a highly respected and charismatic leader. Comdr of the 7th Panzer div during the blitzkrieg campaign in France in early 1940, his division earned the nickname Gespenster-Division 'ghost division' for its speed and surprise it was consistently able to achieve. Converting the 15th Panzer Div into the Deutsches Afrika Korps, he led the famed Div in the African campaigns to capture Tobruk, which fell in 21 June 1942.<br><br>Throughout his tour, despite having shortages of armour and air support, he still routed numerically superior allied forces by using the speed of his advance and the might of his 88mm flak guns to counter british armour. Towards the end of the african campaigns, he inflicted the first defeat on the Americans during the battle of Kasserine Pass, dispelling the belief that the Afrika Korps was a spent force. Subsequently re-assigned to command the channel defences, he was implicated in the July Plot to kill Hitler. He took poison and was given full ceremonial honours at his furneral.<br><br><strong>16. Georg von KÃ¼chler </strong><br><br>~ One of the more political generals, he was comdr Army Group North after von Leeb and charged with the capture of Lenningrad. He was sacked when the red army broke through the blockade and von KÃ¼chler requested a withdrawal to save his troops.<br><br><strong>17. Erich von Manstein </strong><br><br>~ Perhaps the most prominent of comdrs in the Wehrmacht, von Mainstein was a master tactician. A champion of blitzkrieg tactics, he suggested the 'sickle cut' manoeuvre to outflank the French in 1940, salvaged numerous counterattacks to relief the Wehrmacht on the eastern front during the height of the red army counter-offensive. He was also made comdr of army group don during the seige of Stalingrad to relief the 6th army. But the operation failed because Hitler refused to allow any breakout simultaneously with Army Group Don's offensive.<br><br>Made comdr of the newly formed Army Group South, Mainstein planned a couter-offensive into the weakened soviet lines. In quick succession, Army Group South defeated the soviets at Krasnograd and Barvenkovo and culiminated in the third battle of Kharkov. During Operation Citadel to crush the Kursk Salient, Mainstein achieved most of the objectives for his part in the campaign but the battle was lost due to the almost complete failure of Army Group North to meet theirs.<br><br>Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who led the Soviet defense at Kursk, praised Manstein by recalling that as the German Commander of the southern sector he displayed considerable talents in using his troops.<br><br>In one of his many acts of defiance, he disobeyed Hitler and ordered the withdrawal of the 11th and 42nd Corps (consisting of 56,000 men in six divisions) of Army Group South to break out from the "Korsun Pocket", which occurred on February 16/17th. Eventually, Hitler accepted this action and ordered the breakout after it already took place.(ironic) He was eventually dismissed after one too many arguments with Hitler over combat tactics on the eastern front.<br><br>He survived the trials of post-war Germany and was called by the West German Chancellor as senior defence advisor. He died on 13 June 1973 and was buried with full military honours.<br><br><strong>18. Friedrich Paulus</strong><br><br>~ Comdr, 6th Army, given the unceremonious promotion to fieldmarshall in the hopes he will hold Stalingrad to the death, Paulus eventually capitulated hours after his promotion and became a vocal critic of the Nazi regime in capitivity.<br><br><strong>19. Ewald von Kleist </strong><br><br>~ General recalled from retirement to command Panzergruppe von Kleist during the France campaign under Heinz Guderian. I March 1944, he disobeyed a direct order and ordered a withdrawal of 8th Army from the advancing Soviets to prevent the complete annihilation of the div. He was extradited to Russia for trial and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He eventually became the highest ranking officer to die in capitivity in 1954.<br><br><strong>20. Maximilian von Weichs </strong><br><br>~ Comdr of 2nd army, he led them during the campaigns in Kiev and Smolensk and then Vyazma and Bryansk. Weichs was put in leader reserve after insisting that the flanks of the 6th army was too thin and open for counter-attack. He retired on Mar 25, 1945 and owing to illness, was never convicted.<br><br><strong>21. Ernst Busch </strong><br><br>~ Played a major role in the Western offensive, leading the 16th Army on several successes. He died in British capitivity at the end of the war.<br><br><strong>22. Wolfram von Richthofen </strong><br><br>~ Played a minor role in WWII as Luftwaffe fieldmarshall. He retired on medical grounds in 1944 and died in American captivity in 1945.<br><br><strong>23. Walther Model </strong><br><br>~ Assigned nuermous positions in the course of the war, he was the youngest Generalfeldmarschall ever to be promoted. Comdr-in-chief, west and Comdr, Army Group North, he eventually committed suicide before he could be captured by American forces.<br><br><strong>24. Ferdinand SchÃ¶rner </strong><br><br>~ Comdr, 98th Moutain Regiment, he fought extensively in the the balkans and Poland. After the war he was actually charged in both Russia and West Germany for war crimes. He was eventually released in 1963, dying a free man in 1973.<br><br><strong>25. Robert Ritter von Greim</strong><br><br>~ The last and final generals to be promoted to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall, he fought with distinction during the war and was famed for his exploits during operation Citadel where his superior tactics assisted the Luftwaffe in the bombing of the Orel Bulge. For this he received the swords to the Knight's Cross. Towards the end of the war, he flew into beseiged Berlin in a Fieseler Storch with Hanna Reitsch to pursuade Hitler to leave. He was captured my American forces who extradited him to Russia. On the way, he committed suicide. <strong></strong></div>
