And so...why is it that the Government is always asking the overseas Grad to come back to singapore to work when in the first place..they are the ones that are being rejected by their country's uni to further thier studies locally.....any overseas grad out there who are back in singapore??you have gone thru this..maybe some comments??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Yes!<br>The whole system is structure in such a way that only those who are academically talented will excel. Those who are more talented in other field (like musics, designs, sports and etc) to be categories in the earliest stage of their education and branded as loser.<br>The system is so selfishly structure that only those brainy people will eventually goes to the top of the crop and become scholars. What about those who are very creative in drawing, good in dancing or superb in people relationship skills? You don't see many government institutes here providing education that is incline to the nature of the talent of these poor fellows! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>The education system here, fails to provide to everyone and thus unsuccessful in bringing out the maximum potential of every Singaporean. The MOE introduce a new method of categorizing students into different categories in the early phrase of their education in Singapore, so as to bring out the potential of the students. But hey, if they never change the education material they are going to provide for the students, it will just be another complicate categorizing method of seperating loser from those academic winners!<br>I feel that after so many years, problem of creativity and lack of talents in Singapore due to this education system has not been remedied. The government is simply looking at the wrong side to improve the system...in fact not improving at all.<br>To the government:<br>Don't blame us for not creative. You guys are not creative in the first place and you have been using the education system to kill our creativity and talent in the first place!<br>For those who simply can't excel in local studies which is very academically incline, no fear! For it is just that your talent is of another different nature. Go find out what it is and fully utilise it. If it requires you to leave the country, go ahead...unless you are very 'brainy', this place not for you! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes...the government is 'begging' those oversea grad to come back to Singapore to work. But, what for? They got the Foreign Talents, am I right? They highly paid those FTs and leave those poor local to die by the road side. I got friends who grad oversea and many of them are working oversea, earning money and trying to bring their family out of this god-forsaken place. Why? Because they know that out there, their next generation will get better treatment and education. Out there, they will have more freedom to probe and find out their interest and talent. Out there, they will eventually get more opportunities to excel and succeed. Lastly, they will get to own what is rightfully theirs, unlike in Singapore, you paid the full cost of your puny flat which is not even rightfully yours (there is a 99 years lease).<br>Oh...if you have the capability to go oversea, go oversea! Don't stay here.</div>
