            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry you couldn't make it Meng Kwan. Was given the impression that you were coming though.<br><br>Anyway, Leonard, Mark, Adrian, Kiong, Shahul and I met at the Heeren on Saturday evening at 6.30pm. We went to Marche to eat...was very crowded but we didn't really have to wait long for a seat. Khaz was supposed to meet us at about 8 after he finished work, and like I said, we were wondering where you were, MK, coz I was given the impression you were coming.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, we all went to get our food and after eating and Khazmin still hadn't arrived, we decided to head someplace else coz Marche was too expensive. Just as we exited, Khaz came and met us and we took a couple of pictures. Speaking of which, I haven't had the time to get the pics out of my camera yet guys !!! Patience is a virtue...it'd be worth it. =)<br><br>Then all of us, except Kiong coz he had to meet his other friends, went to Cartel in Plaza Sing to eat a bit more stuff. Leo left at about 8.30 and the rest of us about 9.15, coz we had a lot to talk about !!! An exchange of formats (actually, it was more of a passing of formats from one person to another) and we went to play pool until about 11.15 then we all went back.<br><br>A fun evening !!! Wish more people could have turned up, but ah well, maybe next time...</div>
