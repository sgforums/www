            <div class='col-md body'>Jo, just wondering, have you tried out the missions yet ??? Best advice is to complete all the side tasks before you even attempt doing missions for the mob in Portland. Do the taxi, firefighter, vigilante, and MEDIC !!! *hehe* missions first. Granted, it's a little hard to get to those spots in time, so don't be discouraged. Some missions later in the game are VERY frustrating, and quite a lot of patience (and game saving) is required.<br><br>Keep on trying Jo. Best to complete those side tasks (like what I mentioned up above) while you're still in Portland, coz Portland is relatively small (a LOT smaller when compared to Staunton Island and Shoreside Vale, which will be unlocked later in the game), and easy to drive around. After a while, you'll get used to all the roads and even know the shortcuts. Practise as much as you can and you'll get the hang of it !!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And yeah, it definitely IS possible. You just need to know the roads like the back of your hand (which requires you to drive around OFTEN). Driving skills gotta be top notch too, coz you need to go fast without HITTING too many things, or else your taxi will blow up or the passenger will get out of the cab. Practise...that's the only way to get 50 fares, let alone 100 fares.<br><br>By the way, did you manage to do the hooker trick ??? I've been trying and trying but they just don't seem to want to get into my car.<br><br>Here's a good site for GTA FQAs, cheats and hints:<br><br>http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/game/31127.html<br><br>Good luck with the game, Jo !!! I'm just about to install it into my computer as well...quite sick of playing it on the PS2, so I'll let you know my progress. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First to answer your question.. the Hooker trick works for me.. can get up to 125 total health (some says more)<br><br>Just park next to the hooker (the lady in jacket with bra and girdle showing).. she will come to you window.. wait.. then she will "talk" to you and get into the car.... (you can't use police car, emergency car or taxi)<br><br>drive to a safe location... like a park (I always heed to Callahan park).. then stop your vehicle... then the car will start to shake... and after the shaking stops, you get 25 extra health.. YAY!<br><br>Ok.. I need specific PC platform questions.. so Hope u can help me soon.. hehee<br>here are my specific questions<br><br>1) I have an Uzi... it says my ammo is 0-14. I can't seem to do drive bys?? What is the key to press for drive by shooting?  Just the normal fire button?  How do I aim then?<br><br>2) The target button doesn't work for me well... I have to hold it down to target ppl?  In vigilance, I always get blown by the criminal  shotgun before I shoot him.. mainly because I can't seem to aim properly....  It seems to work well for pedestrians but not work when I need it most<br><br>3) Is there a pause button for PC?  I'm talkin bout the pause button bug that makes the criminal get out of their cars in PS2 suring Vigilance.  Is there a pause button? or has the bug been fixed in PC?<br><br>4) Another very impt question... Do you mean all the taxi, police and medic side missions must be done in a row?? OMFG!!  100 straight fares to get the bonus? 70 straight medic rescue?? Are you positive bout that?  If I do 10 seperate 10 taxi fares, it doesn't count?? Must they really be straight up?  DAMN!<br><br>HELP!!!<br><br>Jo</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jo, I'm in class at the moment so I'll reply to your post a little bit later when I'm freer...<br><br>And the hooker trick doesn't seem to work for me AT ALL !!! Even when I'm not in any emergency or police vehicle or taxis. *shrug* They don't want to seem to walk to my window, let alone get in my car !!!<br><br>For further information, go to the website which I put up last night...it should have a LOT of walkthrus and hints that should answer your questions...<br><br>And yeah, to target people, you HAVE to hold down the button. BUt you should be able to switch targets by pressing another button too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Jo...on to the rest of my reply.<br>I've tried the hooker trick again...still doesn't bloody seem to work for me. I wonder if this translated to what it's like in real life too...heh.<br><br>Okies, for drive-by shootings, you can ONLY use the Uzi. Hope you remember which is your fire button coz you'll need that obviously !!! You also have to know which keys you set for "Look left" and "Look right" when in the car. That's the only way you can see what you're shooting when doing a drive-by. Press the key for "Look left" and it'll show the side profile of your car and people passing by on the left side as you drive. Press the shoot button and you're shooting people, effectively doing a drive-by !!! Ditto with the right side when you click the "Look right" button and press your fire key. As for aiming, you can't. Your uzi will fire in a straight line, where you're sitting from the car, so drive up to a person, get your door roughly in line with the guy you want to shoot, then press fire. Takes a bit of practise, but you'll get the hang of it. =)<br><br>Yes, you're supposed to HOLD DOWN the target button to target people. Or, if you're using your mouse, you can use it like a regular counterstrike crosshair and shoot people by. This isn't very accurate though, and it's not very effective when you've got a SWAT team chasing your ass from behind you and you're not paying attention. Holding down the target button effectively locks onto the nearest threat to you. See which is your preference. =)<br>Personally, when I'm being chased by cops, I like to hold the target button, so I can kill some po-lice !!! If you have the shotgun, two shots hitting a police car will cause it to catch fire and blow up. Don't hold the target button down if you intend to do that.<br><br>Errr...I'm not too sure about there being a pause button for the PC. Apparently, I've tried out some of the cheats but they don't seem to work. Would have been awesome if I got a tank in Portland View, ah, but what are you gonna do. =)<br><br>Okies, I'm not too sure about the side missions being done in a row. I guess it's probably not that way...kinda impossible to get 70 straight medic rescues !!! The damned ambulance is awful...I can't break hard or swerve hard coz it'll coz it to flip over and stuff. The taxi fares are probably cumulative. I just installed the PC version in my computer and going to play it as soon as I log off the internet. Oh yeah, there's this warehouse where you can store cars too. Hard to explain though...read the guide from the website..more details there !!! =)</div>
