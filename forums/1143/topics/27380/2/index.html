            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with brother mantis. Other things more important. Girls are everywhere. Just check your balls before you go up to them. who knows.<br>the world's been trhu a very bad vibe past 1 or 2 months. Deaths. Blasts etc. Poor gurkha guy. I used to take that path too, never in the rain or during lightning but who the hell would know right? Just like those poor kids at the Sari club. I was just thinkin if they were to hit Samui if i was at my full moon party...could be me while i was partying over there with thousands other foreigners.fucked up thought to play on yr mind if u're in my shoes.<br>my quote is a reflection of my feelings right now. have u guys ever wondered why the hell you are working so hard for? even those studying. when u start working, you're gonna have to work harder, and forever as well. for what? Just to fucking survive. not to get that real fancy big house n cars n shit so that u and yr family will be comfy. but just to fucking survive. cost of living here is ridiculous. how much money u make, the more will be taken away. thats why i want a better quality of life where it's not all abt money. if u guys are shaking yr head when u read this and say i'm a dreamer then u've been brainwashed. its not all about money. there's more to life than that. it is just a wrong way to live your life man. problem is in singapore this issue has been intensified n ppl just give up n go with theflow. jsut like when the govt screws up or somehting just isnt right, u sense it but u don do anything. mainly cos u cant be bothered/ donno how to do something/ even if u do something, it doesnt matter cos yr feedback is not all that important despite what they tell us. sorry if i'm ranting n raving. alot on my mind. but seriously i dont know how u guys can take the fare hikes n 5% GST hike. bloody hell. i never asked for an aircon interchange/tv in my bus/ contactless smartcard which is so irritating n often screws up. did they ask our feedback? u guys who are undergrads. go think abt it, we are the future of the nation. make a difference in yr life at least.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeo bro..that went deep. i agree with u. The cost of living is ever on the rise in sg. you work yourself away to get the bare neccessities in life. what happened to the quality of life. its pretty fucked up.Authoritarian govt ,,,,,. well the free democratic countries are fucked up too. For singapore to operate efficiently we have to be authoritrian but with a reasonable justification. The waste of capital in renovating bus interchange and the next generation of bus travel are money down the drain. Well they do though give the money package which so called covers the hike in gst and so on. you have to appreciate that the fucking govt. is smart. all the hoo ahhs are taken care of by the show of money in front of u. very attractive. there is your money people..free money so just ignore the increase until u get used to it...After that who the fuck cares.. its old story...............The life we make is the life we live.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hang on...I must have missed something. Sandy, you're married already ??? Or "hubby" was just a figurative term ??? I'm getting confuseded already...<br><br>The problem in looking for Mr (or in most of our case, Ms) Right Now, is how do you know if she's the one for you ??? If the now slowly fades away, then she would be Ms Right in the first place. But in reality, of course, it's probably next to impossible to find the right one for you. So it's a matter of having to adjust your expectations and standards in order to accommodate. Damn, I sound like a certain "HUA" person....<br><br>I agree with Mark-ki-lan...MOST guys don't look for gals merely for sex. It would be tragic if that's all we wanted or did...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Shahul...was going to look for the lyrics myself but since you posted it up...<br><br>And Mark, the thing is, even if you're sure of what qualities you're looking for or the type of person you're lookin for, there isn't any guarantee that you're going to find her in the first place. Sad, but true.<br><br>Errrr...guys are so fickle ??? Wtf ?!?! Indecisive, yes. Fickle, no.<br>What Sandy said reminds me of a song back in 1994 by some group that I can't remember the name of, but has the word "Black" in it I think: "Searching...for that something that I'll never find..."<br><br>But yeah, one would probably find his or her soulmate in the unlikeliest of places.

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa, what happened with the guy who got struck by lightning ??? Can someone please enlighten me ??? We don't get a lot of Singapore news here in the Australian newspapers.<br><br>At the moment, Australia is taking the Bali bombings as a terrorist attack against Australia. Reason being there are so many Australians who went to Bali for holidays, especially moreso now because the Aussie Rules Football season just ended and players are there for a little R&amp;R. Newspapers are being bombarded not just with news on the increasing death toll, but also on feature articles of the victims who are either missing or dead as a result of the incident.<br><br>A lot of commentary from leaders of foreign nations too, though I have yet to read anything contributed by any Singaporean politician. News is being published that America knew of the impending attacks and warned their own citizens, and they said it was the Australian government's own fault for not sending out stricter warnings on possible terrorist attacks. Megawati is being crucified (somewhat) by the Australian press also for not taking better action against the terrorist cells that are supposedly scattered around Indonesia. Top that off with yesterday's bombing in the Philippines...God, I'm glad we didn't have this kind of incident in Singapore, which NEARLY happened last December with the whole Yishun bomb scare.<br><br>It's really tragic all this stuff is happening in the world, so close to all of us, at the moment. It helps me appreciate life better. All these events happening right now are helping me have a better perspective on why we're here. Like Khazmin said, why the hell are we working so hard for, either in the working environment or studying ???<br><br>Yeah, it's to survive, surely, but with everything increasing in price, it's getting increasingly more difficult to do so. I echo his sentiments on the whole GST/increase in busfares/smartcard issues. Though this isn't affecting me now, it sure as hell will as soon as I get back. Did we even ask for this in the first place ??? The so-called improvements will probably prove to be great hindrances and nuisances before it starts getting better.<br><br>Francis (don't know if you guys remember him, he was in your CMC platoon, Adrian, not the other Francis from our Spec 2, but Young Koon) was relating to me how crappy the smartcard readers are. I mean, paying $1.40 upfront for your busfare is ridiculous. And imagine if you're getting off the bus, and the stupid smartcard reader at the exit doesn't work, then what, you effectively have to pay the full $1.40 for a trip that probably cost only $0.80 at the most !??!? What the hell is wrong with the people who thought up this stupid idea !?!?!<br><br>I, too, love Singapore, as much as I am a hugely critical of it. But looking at the situation back home, it makes me think of getting permanent residency here in Australia. Don't even know if the job market is going to stabilise by the time I finish my studies. It was supposed to get better 2 years ago...but it seems to be only getting worse at the moment.<br><br>Segueing back to the Bali bombings, I find it stupid that America continues to want to wage war on Iraq, especially since there's no remote connection between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Talk about single-mindedness and blind stupidity. All his bullshit about a war on terrorism was, as I surmised soon after the September 11 attacks, only a ploy to get the American people back on his side, considering he wasn't doing too well in the polls pre-911. Wish the world would have less morons like the "most powerful person in the world".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the song that you're thinking of is 'Searching' by China blue i think but maybe i got mixed up with Wu Bai's band..haha, anyway, its a corny one hit wonder back in the early 90s so who cares? they've prob. become taxi drivers or sth. by now.<br><br>My my..aren't we getting philosophical here..you guys will fit straight into my philo.1101 class. Seriously, i think the older we get, the more we know about life, the more we think about it. The more we realise how pathetic it is compared to the lives we see on tv and MTV, the sadder and depressed we get. This was what Marx termed 'alienation', when one realises how small, powerless and insignificant his life is. its truly shitty, this feeling of eternal 'sianness'<br><br>Have you all thought at some point or other, when you felt truly depressed, what was the ONE thing that could make it all better, if only you had it now? For some or most, i'm sure its Love, for others its world peace, yet other ppl would want a ferrari or a bigger house. For me, i just want to be a Rock Star...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not that I'm trying to defend what our Authoritarian government is doing, but let's put it this way, if our government was not authoritarian and didn't make some of the choices that we SIngaporeans view as being dumbass decisions, we probably would still be a 3rd world country languishing in poverty, instead of being the one of the richest countries in the world, with a gross national product per capita even surpassing the richest nation in the world, America (United Nations Development Programme 1999).<br><br>And we wouldn't be the joint 50th (with Manchester, of all cities) best city for expatriates to live in, even higher than better recognised and established cities like New York and Washington. This was taken from a recent survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit and published on the CNN website (CNN 2002). In fact, we're the highest ranked South East Asian city (no surprise there), and 4th highest Asian ranked city after Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong.<br><br>For all the lack of freedom and free speech that we don't get, I think we have to count ourselves lucky that we're living in SIngapore, and we don't really have to worry about things like hunger or poverty. But of course, too much is too much, and I still think things like the increase in GST and the whole busfare increase and smartcard thing is ridiculous and unnecessary.<br><br>It's just like David Ignatius, editor of the <span style="font-style: italic;">International Herald Tribue</span> said:<br>Â“When does a country become rich and successful enough that it can loosen its grip on its media and citizens, and operate more like a modern democracy? When is it stable enough to stop worrying so much about social control?Â” (Ignatius 2002)<br><br>Aren't we educated well enough to start making decisions on our own. I'm not saying we should be a completely democratic country free from government control suddenly, but surely it would be good for SIngapore if certain laws on free speech and democratism could be relaxed a little...or at given a trial phase... to see how Singapore would react to that kind of change ??? It would be good for Singapore and all its citizens.<br><br>Sorry about the referencing...but I just completed an essay that examined the work of journalists in Singapore and how political, cultural and economic factors influenced that work.<br><br>We are all individuals who, unfortunately, even with our own beliefs, opinions and thoughts, have to go with the system in Singapore, only coz we're SIngaporeans. To go against the system would just lead to us being arrested. It's sad, but true. We've got to work with whatever we're given, and try to make the best of it.<br><br>References:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">CNN </span>(2002), Â“Melbourne, Vancouver top city listÂ”, CNN.com/World, 4 October,  (accessed 8 October 2002).<br><br>Ignatius, D.
