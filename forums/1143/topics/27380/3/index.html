ANyway Leonard is back, he says he'll fly off on 7th so he said he'll probably meet us late this week or early next. I really don't know when since basically we're waiting for him lah. I cannot say when exactly ok. So keep youze mobile on and we'll get the word out aight. Just prepare for say 24hr activation if necessary. For my self I'm fine except Thursday and Saturday I have a spa party till about 8. If we meet then I can try to chow earlier lah. Btw sorry to those who were looking forward to the gig last Saturday, apparently the club management screwed my friend over so rather than bring him biz, he cancelled instead. Planning another one in Dec perhaps so will keep you guys posted aight. Quite ashame actually, estimated 100+ and most of them from NTU cos one of the DJ from NTU. bloodyhell.<br><br>anyway catch u all soon.<br><br>itoshi</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Shahul, though I think it hasn't really been THAT sunny since I came back last Sunday. More of a humid island, but oh well. Looking forward to meeting up with you guys...it seems like Thursday and Saturday is out at the moment coz multiple people cannot make it. I wouldn't be able to make it on Friday myself coz my entire day is pretty much booked. How about Sunday ??? Next week ??? If it's next week, just let me know which day it's gonna be in advance and I'll keep that entire day free. =)</div>
