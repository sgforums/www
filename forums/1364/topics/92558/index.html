To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he showed the first blonde a picture for five seconds and then hid it. "This is your suspect. How would you recognize him?"<br><br>The first blonde answered, "That's easy! We'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"<br><br>The policeman said, "Well, that's because the picture shows his profile."<br><br>Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashed the picture at the second blonde and said, "This is your suspect. How would you recognize him?"<br><br>The second blonde giggled, flipped her hair and said, "Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"<br><br>The policeman angrily replied, "What's the matter with you two? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing, because this is a picture of his profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?"<br><br>Extremely frustrated at this point, he showed the picture to the third blonde and said, in a very testy voice, "This is your suspect. How would you recognize him?" He quickly added, "And think hard before answering, so you don't say something completely idiotic."<br><br>The blonde looked at the picture intently for a moment and said, "Hmm... The suspect wears contact lenses."<br><br>The policeman was stunned speechless, because he honestly didn't know whether the suspect wore contacts or not. "Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file, and I'll get back to you on that." He left the room and went to his office, checked the suspect's file in his computer, and came back beaming. "Wow!" he said, "I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! But how were you able to make such an astute observation?"<br><br>"That's easy," the blonde replied. "He can't wear regular glasses, because he only has one eye and one ear."<br></div>

Another week went by and still nothing. Then after a whole month, a card finally arrived. Written on it with shaky handwriting were the words "British Airways". Mom took out her latest Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, and finally found the ad for British Airways.<br><br>The ad said: "Three times a day, seven days a week, both ways."<br><br>Mom fainted.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Joke 12</strong></span><br><br>One fine day, a bus driver went to the bus garage, started his bus, and drove off along the route. No problems for the first few stops - a few people got on, a few got off, and things went generally well. At the next stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on.<br><br>Six feet eight, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground. He glared at the driver and said, "Big John doesn't pay!" and sat down at the back.<br><br>Oh, did I mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and basically meek? Well, he was. Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but he wasn't happy about it. The next day the same thing happened, Big John got on again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down.<br><br>And the next day, and the one after that, and so forth. This grated on the bus driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.<br><br>Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good about himself.<br><br>So the following Monday, when Big John got on the bus and said, "Big John doesn't pay!," The driver stood up, glared back at the passenger, and screamed, "And why not?!?"<br>With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, "Big John has a bus pass..."<br></div>

"You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did, but let me give you a bit of advice.

Then I asked him where he was going fishing, and he said down at the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department, and I sold him that twin engine Chris Craft.<br><br>Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4X4 Pajero."<br><br>The manager says "You mean a guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and truck?!"<br><br>The kid, "No, no, no, he came in here to buy a box of Kotex for his wife and I said, "Well, since your weekend's already screwed up, you might as well go fishing."<br></div>

Perhaps the<br>following analogies will help clear it up:<br><br>1.* You see a handsome guy at a party. You go up to him and say,<br>"I'm fantastic in bed."<br><br>That's Direct Marketing.<br><br>2.* You're at a party with a bunch of friends and see a handsome<br>guy. One of your friends goes up to him and pointing at you says, "She's<br>fantastic in bed."<br><br>That's Advertising.<br><br>3.* You see a handsome guy at a party. You go up to him and get his<br>telephone number. The next day you call and say, "Hi, I'm fantastic<br>in bed."<br><br>That's Telemarketing.<br><br>4.* You're at a party and see a handsome guy. You get up and<br>straighten your dress. You walk up to him and pour him a drink. You say,<br>"May I," and reach up to straighten his tie brushing your breast lightly against his arm, and then say, "By the way, I'm fantastic in bed."<br><br>That's Public Relations.<br><br>5.* You're at a party and see a handsome guy. He walks up to you<br>and says, "I hear you're fantastic in bed."<br><br>That's Brand Recognition.<br><br>6.* You're at a party and see a handsome guy. You talk him into<br>going home with your friend.<br><br>That's a Sales Rep.<br><br>7.* Your friend can't satisfy him so she calls you.<br><br>That's Tech Support.<br><br>8.* You're on your way to a party when you realize that there could<br>be handsome men in all these houses you're passing.** So you climb<br>onto the roof of one situated toward the center and shout at the top of<br>your lungs,"I'm fantastic in bed!"<br><br>That's Spam.<br></div>
