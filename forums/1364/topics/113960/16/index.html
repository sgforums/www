            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, the $380 dollars which was collected is terribly pathetic.<br>10 people attending ++ so many overhead and fixed costs.<br>The price, and the amount of attendance is seriously hindering people from signing up.<br>Perhaps there is another solution.<br>Why not we go buffett?? eat all you can.<br>$38 dollars can pay for 3 times bbq at marina south and enough money for drinks.<br><br>The lucky draw, there are 10 lucky draw winners, so just nice, everyone goes home with a prize.<br>Hope you are not going to pull any of the 10 members and do an impromptu act.<br>The commitee forms more then 50% of the people who have paid. That means<br>the commitee is going to welcome 5 people into such a large venue?<br>I seriously suggest postponing the BBQ to a later date from a business perspective, you may choose not to heed me , but more convincing need to be done. Assuming<br><br>Budgeted revenue - $570<br><br>Food + Event + Prizes = $200<br>Rental of area = $200<br>Mis expenses = $ x<br><br>Not to mention this is one of sgforums.com most important event , not discouraging you all , but do a rough budgeting please..<br><br>I suggest we hire a special chartered bus to take 40 people from bedok mrt station to the area at 6pm and another bus to take people back at 10pm<br><br>After that, we hire 2 waiters dressed in tuxedos paid $8 dollars an hour<br>With regards to the prizes , and lucky draw , i think it could be forfeited because if no more then 20 people applies for it , there's isn't any fun because most of the time , they will get "chosen"<br><br>Why not minus off the lucky draw prizes instead and use the money for other stuffs , don't forget to set up an account specially to provide for in-cash excess cash is needed ? with regards to performance i think its a good idea<br>Spare cash is always safer.<br><br>It's a big event , just like prom night , the most important day in a secondary school calendar , some secondary schools cancel it because of high costs and many other significant factors.<br><br>Seriously , since you all call it a dinner and dance, you all would have to look into the matter of ratio of female to males, hope you all got a ratio of<br>1:1 .So no one would be left out.<br><br>With all the reasons i plead above, i myself, with utmost respect for the organisers , urge the organisers to perhaps postpone the D&amp;D , alot of stuffs can be improved on.<br><br>Not to mention that we need waiters to serve wine, wine costs almost $30 dollars per bottle.<br><br></div>
