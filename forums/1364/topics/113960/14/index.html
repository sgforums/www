            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you for the comments. It is very encouraging to see experienced organisers showing the rope to greenhorn like me..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I guess the starting point for all outings, in the mind of all organisers, is to provide a social gathering for any and every interested party, be it from the forum or not from the forum.<br><br>When the organising committee 1st had their kick off meeting, we all had visions of our fellow forumnites supporting this event and enjoying themselves during such a event like that of the BBQ.<br><br>We have, no doubt, lack the experience of organising event on such a large scale basis, but we are not afraid to try. Every small step we made, we hope it will evoled into something great for all our fellow forumnites.<br><br>Thus, we set out on a quest to run the D&amp;D for the forum. We made numerous calls, soliciting proposals, hoping to get the best deal for all participants. Sometimes, there were some disagreements among the memebers, but we were able to resolve it ( I hope so <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) at the end of the day, cos' we are all working towards the same objective.<br><br>We do not expect everyone from the forums to attend (if can, the best lah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), but we were hoping to see better response...but things did not turn out the way we foresee...nonetheless, we persisted....we even forked out money from our own pocket to pay for the deposit, hoping that miracle would appear towards that evening....<br><br>I hope this Twilight Summer Dream is not just a Dream of the organising committee...but a Dream to remember for those who attended for as long as they stay with sgForums.....</div>

I would  like to inform you that to us organisers of Year End BBQ last year, Yes it is a fun filled event but it's still not up to our expectation of 100pax. So to those who attended that event thinks that it's successful but to us ? Hopefully we can get 100pax this time round in Year 2005  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Cheers<br>nick34</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1stly, I only mentioned that Estee was a Organiser for Year End BBQ 2002 and 2003 and that reply of mine is only for MOS info as I see from the date he joined in Year 2004, he might not know about BBQ for 2002 and 2004.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">No comments, it's pretty factual.</span><br><br>2ndly, what makes you thinks that I'm making unproductive remarks ??? Is it about the last reply I posted in this topic on the showing temper or quarrel ??? If so, kindly read up page 11 and page 12. If after you read up these 2 pages and still feel that they are not quarrelling or whatsoever, there is nothing more to say<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Ok, fair enough, seems like a dispute to me about some attendence list and edited messages, but you could be more discrete about it. Don't need to point out the organiser's faults in front of everyone. What will others think? Not really helping the cause of the organisers, isn't it?</span><br><br>3rdly, Am i discrediting the Organisers ??? Like what www mentioned in his reply. As a organiser of a yearly event, we past years BBQ organisers do know how hard it is to hold such event and didn't I posted a thread that they still have one more month to make adjustment/s ??? If that is not enough to show that I actually hint the Organisers of DnD to make some adjustments then i'm really sorry<br><br><span style="color: blue;">By publicly pointing out the organiser's faults and not crediting their other efforts, I feel that you're discrediting the organiser. Make it seems like they are doing everything wrong. Pretty discouraging. </span><br><br>Lastly, may i know what's your point of [i.][/i] successful ??? I would  like to inform you that to us organisers of Year End BBQ last year, Yes it is a fun filled event but it's still not up to our expectation of 100pax. So to those who attended that event thinks that it's successful but to us ? Hopefully we can get 100pax this time round in Year 2005  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Well, whether the BBQ is successful is relative to each individual who attended it. Whether it's a fun-filled event is also subjective. Yes, wish you guys all the best in attaining your target for BBQ 2005.</span></div>
