              <p>True. Alot of tertiary students I met have no aim, or goal whatsoever. Whether they develop early or late, it's never too late to learn. But to be honest, I've learnt nothing for the past 12 years. I always believed school was there to pique your interests in subjects, to help you improve as a kid, to mature as a teen/young adult.</p>
              <p>But who am I kidding, it's Singapore's education system.</p>
              <p>We need to go way back, when these kids are in primary and secondary schools. They need dreams, goals etc. Not being pounded by parents/MOE to produce top grades with the knowledge of the heavens, but the common sense of a mental patient.</p>

              <p>Seriously ... when I was a student, I have no idea what I wanted to do too .. It was only when I came out to work then I realised I have an interest in this line, then I went on with it ..</p>
              <p>Of coz, a lot of kids now study what their parents want them to .. like engineering or accounting or finance, in order to get a good paying job in the future..</p>

              <p>That's now mah, that's how it is now. Whatever happened to find out during these times to know at least, what you're headed into.</p>
              <p>The transition period between primary to secondary, and then to tertiary, and thereafter to working life is really drastic.</p>
              <p><br>I guess I was lucky, to know what I wanted, to know what I can do, and to have people show me the way.</p>

              <p>Reality, during this times, is equivalent to having money. Which is the wrong motivation but it's also sadly a much needed material.</p>

              <p>Passion aside, is nothing if there is no interest in the first place. We're born to bury our heads in books, because we must. Here comes the role of the teacher. Hah.</p>
              <p>No offence, if there are any teaching staff here, that most of them, are only there to collect paychecks at the end of the month.</p>

              <p>but sometimes looking at another point, that's how they end up become stronger than others at every transition of their education path</p>
