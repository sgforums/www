"i still owe ppl $xxxxx..." "i also no money."<br>CRAP.<br>he has another family. while we live in 3room flat, he and his family of one wife and one 5 year old daughter live in 5-room flat. he got new car, handphone... we have none of these. so how can he say he has no money? don't bluff lor. and he buy so many toys for his daughter. (sometimes when i ask him to drive me to places, i see so many toys in his van. or i go his office to photocopy things i also see so many toys lying on the floor. kaoz.)<br>so while he's living happily on the other side (actually i also dun care he happy or not. give us what you owe us ok!), my mother is struggling to take care of me and my brother with her pathetic pay of $900 a month!<br>soooo...can i sue him? and what would we get if he really has no money or not enough money to pay?<br>thanks.<br></div>
