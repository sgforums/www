            <div class='col-md body'><br>I don't have the answer myself, I just got this paradox from somewhere else and it sets me thinking, but knowing someone could be smarter around here, I post it here and see what comments people have, and you do have valid points.<br><br>And then I got another question while at it. 2 guys were chatting and then suddenly 1 very rich man came over and hand each of them 1 envelope, each containing a check of a certain amount. Then he said, 1 of this envelope contains a check with an amount twice of the other envelope, but since you won't know which contains the higher amount, assuming you can take out and see how much your check has, say $100000, and have the option to trade it, will you do so?<br><br>Knowing the probabilities, this man thinks to himself, well, if I trade, I lose half the money ($50000), if I win I get twice the money ($200000). That means he is betting half of the money for twice the money, that is the chance of losing $50000 for winning the $200000. Is there anything wrong with his thinking?<br><br>This question also taken from a book I read, so don't ask me for the solution, I don't have it. I just want to know if anyone, or a mathematician can help around here.</div>

Just like in a maths question, they will use parameters to represent something, it's not the main thing of the question. For example, 2 apples + 3 apples = 5 apples. The parameter here is the apples, it's just to bring across a point, it could have been 2 pears or 2 vans or $2. So in my question, the parameters is "Singaporean" and "Liar".<br><br>I can easily change my question to something like, "This statement is false." So is the statement true or false?</div>
