And he had his car on the rack and he was lubing it and changing tires and everything all the time. And so then he got fired because he was goofing off, man, and he just kept taking parts and working on his car day and night. So he lost that job and I went to work in another gas station. He took that one, you know, so he could feed the kids and that. Then I went to work in a aircraft company, and uh, I was building these planes. I worked on the XB-70, I was the last welder on there. Yea but, It was pretty good bread because I was making um, $2.71 an hour. I was making a hundred and a quarter a week, and uh, yea it was good enough money to be working on so<br>i got an Oldsmobile, a groovy Olds. But I was going with this chick at the time. By the time I got the olds running decently, she went out and tore up the engine, and the trans and let her girlfriends get in there and booze it up and tare up the seats. They ripped the seats completely out. So uh, I got a '56 olds, which was this one chick I was going with, and uh we used to drive out all over the place and finally she got rid of that and uh, I got another pickup.<br><br>Fast Rock<br><br>Sound Effects<br><br>Sped Up Drums<br><br>Orchestral<br>Oh man, I don't know if I can go through this again.<br><br>Orchestral (1)<br><br>Orchestral (sped up)<br><br>Sound Effects<br><br>Percussion,Orchestra<br></div>
