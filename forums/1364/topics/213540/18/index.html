            <div class='col-md body'>The northern region consists of an arc of glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations. Most peaks in the north are over 23,000 feet (7,000 m) above sea level; the highest point is claimed to be the Kula Kangri, at 24,780 feet (7,553 m), but detailed topographic studies claim Kula Kangri is wholly in Tibet and modern Chinese measurements claim that Gangkhar Puensum, which has the distinction of being the highest unclimbed mountain in the world, is higher at 24,835 feet (7,570 m). Watered by snow-fed rivers, alpine valleys in this region provide pasture for livestock, tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds. The Black Mountains in central Bhutan form a watershed between two major river systems: the Mo Chhu and the Drangme Chhu. Peaks in the Black Mountains range between 4,900 feet and 8,900 feet (1,500 m and 2,700 m) above sea level, and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas. Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan's forest production. The Torsa, Raidak, Sankosh, and Manas are the main rivers of Bhutan, flowing through this region. Most of the population lives in the central highlands.<br><br>Terraced farming in the Punakha valley.In the south, the Shiwalik Hills are covered with dense, deciduous forests, alluvial lowland river valleys, and mountains up to around 4,900 feet (1,500 m) above sea level. The foothills descend into the subtropical Duars plain. Most of the Duars is located in India, although a 6Â–9 mile (10Â–15 km) wide strip extends into Bhutan. The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts: the northern and the southern Duars. The northern Duars, which abuts the Himalayan foothills, has rugged, sloping terrain and dry, porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife. The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil, heavy savannah grass, dense, mixed jungle, and freshwater springs. Mountain rivers, fed by either the melting snow or the monsoon rains, empty into the Brahmaputra river in India. Data released by the Ministry of agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64% as of October 2005. The climate in Bhutan varies with altitude, from subtropical in the south to temperate in the highlands and polar-type climate, with year-round snow, in the north. Bhutan experiences five distinct seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. Western Bhutan has the heavier monsoon rains; southern Bhutan has hot humid summers and cool winters; central and eastern Bhutan is temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool winters.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SBS3625D:</div><div class="quote_body">Recent Developments from 1980s to Present Day<br><br>By the 1980s, the government judged, they claim rightly, others claim wrongly and illegally, that there was a widespread illegal immigration of people of Nepali origin into Bhutan. This despite Bhutan having invited Nepali immigrants to open up and help cultivate its fields early last century. It also accused the ethnic Nepalis (called Lhotshampas) of a lack of integration into the political and cultural mainstream of the country. For their part, the Lhotshampas (by now several generation born in Bhutan) wanted to retain their Hindu culture in a country ruled by Buddhists. The government accuses the 'immigrants' (a misnomer considering most Lhotshampas were several generations Bhutanese, and considered themselves Bhutanese, not Nepali) of knowing very little of the culture of Bhutan arguing also that most could not understand any one of the local languages including Dzongkha (the King's own language and culture). Lhotshampas disagree, claiming they only wanted to be able to practice their Hindu ways in peace and without being chastised by the ruling government and army. Perceiving this growing dichotomy as a threat to national unity, the Government promulgated highly disciminatory directives in the 1980s that sought to preserve what it considered as Bhutan's cultural identity (based in Buddhism and distinctly not Hindu) with its controversial "one nation, one people" policy. The government claims it was a unifying measure, "benign and constructive" however detractors argue that it was ethnically and religiously exclusive and disciminatory, and further than those not adhering to the government's enforced cultural values were targeted, often violently, by the government and its army. The government implied that the 'culture' to be preserved would be that of the northern Bhutanese, not the southern (where the Lhotshampas mostly resided - a situation reflecting the fact that it was the Bhutanese government that originally invited nepali settlers to live in Bhutan generations ago to help open up and cultuivate the land in the south). This 'one nation, one people' policy therefore required citizens to wear the attire of the northern Bhutanese in public places and reinforced the status of Dzongkha as the national language. Nepali was discontinued as a subject in the schools keeping in line with the status of the other languages of Bhutan, none of which are taught.<br><br>Such policies were criticized by human rights groups as well as the Lhotshampas, who perceived the policy to be directed solely against them. From the perspective of the ruling Bhutanese, the issue was one of preserving a Himalayan Buddhist culture and way of life (which, it argues, has been completely destroyed in nearby Sikkim, it says by an onslaught of over immigration by ethnic Nepalis). The Lhotshampas (again, they are not, as Bhutan claims Nepali 'immigrants' as most were born in Bhutan going back generations) claim that the Bhutanese are clinging to power at the expense of human rights, pluralism, and democratic principles. However many in Bhutan see Lhotshampas' cry for pluralism and democracy as an excuse to overwhelm and take over a lightly populated Bhutan - however the Lhotshampas have never made any claims to power other than to be fairly represented and be allowed to continue their Hindu culture.<br><br>Simmering tensions were heightened in the late 1980s, when the government conducted a census exercise. The basis for the census findings was the 1958 'cut off' year, the year that the Lhotshampa population had first received official Bhutanese citizenship (before then, there was no need for paperwork and passport like identification as the borders between Bhutan, India and Nepal were fairly porous). Those individuals who could not provide proof of residency prior to 1958 (remembering many just didn't have it in the first place, despite being born in Bhutan) were adjudged to be illegal immigrants. This was implemented through the 1985 Citizenship Act. A delicate period in the development of the Government and protests by Lhotshampa democratic parties, spurred on this act which stated that only those who could show they had resided in Bhutan since 1958,through proof of documents prior to 1958, would be deemed citizens of Bhutan. Given many were poor farmers and land workers, many could not offer such proof. This act led to the increased activity of numerous groups to protest against what was seen as an injustice against Lhotshampas.<br><br>With Lhotshampas mobilising into protest groups and marching on government offies, the government set about systematically threatening the groups, particularly leaders, but also anyone who supported the Lhotshampas' protests. Lhotshampas claim they were threatened, abused, violently attacked, held at gunpoint, raped and in some cases murdered without inquiry. There is proof of many being taken away from their family homes and tortured and threatened, being forced to sign voluntary migration forms before being forced along with their families over the border. Their homes were either destroyed or appropriated by friends and family of the ruling government.<br><br>The government claims there was no systematic abuses, and that the Lhotshampas chose to leave in protest - although this is highly unlikely as neighbouring India refused to allow them to reside there, and Nepal considers Lhotshampas refugees and citizens of Bhutan; it does not regard Lhotshampas as Nepali and affords them little or no rights within Nepal. Thus seven refugee camps were set up in Nepal, although the Nepali government maintain that the refugees belong in Bhutan.<br><br>The issue remains unresolved today, with Bhutan unwilling to repatriate refugees. The refugees offer ownership of the national citizen identity cards as proof of citizenry. The government contends that there has been widespread forging of these documents.<br><br>The crisis of the people in the camps causes some tension between Bhutan and Nepal and is the glaring issue in Bhutan's international relations and human rights record.<br><br>In 1998, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck introduced significant political reforms, transferring most of his powers to the Prime Minister and allowing for impeachment of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly. In late 2003, the Bhutanese army successfully launched a large-scale operation to flush out anti-India insurgents who were operating training camps in southern Bhutan.<br><br>In 1999, the king also lifted a ban on television and the Internet, making Bhutan one of the last countries to have introduced the television. In his speech, he asserted that the television was a critical step to the modernization of Bhutan as well as a major contributor to the country's Gross National Happiness (Bhutan is the only country to measure happiness) but warned against the misuse of the television that may erode traditional Bhutanese values.<br><br>A new constitution has been presented in early 2005 (download from here), which will be put up for ratification by a referendum before coming into force. In December 2005, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that he would step down as King of Bhutan in 2008. King Wangchuck said he would be succeeded by his son, the crown prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. A group comprised of ethnic Nepalese claiming to be Bhutanese exiles, have criticized the constitution saying that the king is trying to overshadow the refugee problem in the country by introducing "limited democracy".<br><br></div></blockquote>A theory of sanity was proposed by Alfred Korzybski in his general semantics. He believed that sanity was tied to the structural fit or lack of it between our reactions to the world and what is actually going on in the world. He expressed this notion in a map-territory analogy: "A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness." Given that science continually seeks to adjust its theories structurally to fit the facts, i.e., adjusts its maps to fit the territory, and thus advances more rapidly than any other field, he believed that the key to understanding sanity would be found in the study of the methods of science (and the study of structure as revealed by science). The adoption of a scientific outlook and attitude of continual adjustment by the individual toward his or her assumptions was the way, so he claimed. In other words, there were "factors of sanity to be found in the physico-mathematical methods of science."<br><br>In his classic book, The Sane Society, published in 1955, psychologist Erich Fromm proposed that, not just individuals, but entire societies "may be lacking in sanity". Fromm argued that one of the most deceptive features of social life involves "consensual validation":<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though Bhutan's economy is one of the world's smallest, it has grown very rapidly with about 8% in 2005 and 14% in 2006. As of March 2006, Bhutan's per capita income was US$ 1,321 making it the highest in South Asia. Bhutan's standard of living grew and is one of the best performing in South Asia. Bhutan's economy is one of the world's smallest and least developed, and is based on agriculture, forestry, and the sale of hydroelectric power to India. Agriculture provides the main livelihood for more than 80% of the population. Agrarian practices consist largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Handicrafts, particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars are a small cottage industry and a source of income for some. A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads, and other infrastructure, difficult and expensive. This, and a lack of access to the sea, has meant that Bhutan has never been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce. Bhutan currently does not have a railway system, though Indian Railways plans to link up southern Bhutan with its vast network under an agreement signed in January 2005.[3] The historic trade routes over the high Himalayas, which connected India to Tibet, have been closed since the 1959 military takeover of Tibet (although smuggling activity still brings Chinese goods into Bhutan).<br><br>The industrial sector is minimal, production being of the cottage-industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian contract labour. Agricultural produce includes rice, chilies, dairy (yak) products, buckwheat, barley, root crops, apples, and citrus and maize at lower elevations. Industries include cement, wood products, processed fruits, alcoholic beverages and calcium carbide.<br><br>Bhutan's currency, the ngultrum, is pegged to the Indian Rupee. The rupee is also accepted as legal tender in the country. Incomes of over Nu 100,000 per annum are taxed, but very few wage and salary earners qualify. Bhutan's inflation rate was estimated at about 3% in 2003. Bhutan has a Gross Domestic Product of around USD 2.913 billion (adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity), making it the 162nd largest economy in the world. Per capita income is around $1,400 (Â€1,170), ranked 124th. Government revenues total Â€122 million ($146 million), though expenditures amount to Â€127 million ($152 million). 60% of the budget expenditure, however, is financed by India's Ministry of External Affairs.[4] Bhutan's exports, principally electricity, cardamom, gypsum, timber, handicrafts, cement, fruit, precious stones and spices, total Â€128 million ($154 million) (2000 est.). Imports, however, amount to Â€164 million ($196 million), leading to a trade deficit. Main items imported include fuel and lubricants, grain, machinery, vehicles, fabrics and rice. Bhutan's main export partner is India, accounting for 87.9% of its export goods. Bangladesh (4.6%) and the Philippines (2%) are the other two top export partners. As its border with Tibet is closed, trade between Bhutan and China is now almost non-existent. Bhutan's import partners include India (71.3%), Japan (7.8%) and Austria (3%).<br><br>In a response to accusations in 1987 by a journalist from UK's Financial Times that the pace of development in Bhutan was slow, the King said that "Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product." [5] This statement appears to have presaged recent findings by western economic psychologists, including 2002 Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman, that questions the link between levels of income and happiness. It signalled his commitment to building an economy that is appropriate for Bhutan's unique culture, based on Buddhist spiritual values, and has served as a unifying vision for the economy.<br><br></div>

He expressed this notion in a map-territory analogy: "A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness." Given that science continually seeks to adjust its theories structurally to fit the facts, i.e., adjusts its maps to fit the territory, and thus advances more rapidly than any other field, he believed that the key to understanding sanity would be found in the study of the methods of science (and the study of structure as revealed by science). The adoption of a scientific outlook and attitude of continual adjustment by the individual toward his or her assumptions was the way, so he claimed. In other words, there were "factors of sanity to be found in the physico-mathematical methods of science."<br><br>In his classic book, The Sane Society, published in 1955, psychologist Erich Fromm proposed that, not just individuals, but entire societies "may be lacking in sanity". Fromm argued that one of the most deceptive features of social life involves "consensual validation":<br><br></div>
