              <p>Deliver pizza is example lah haha.....seriously i dun know where I am heading in my career. Some people would have dreams to get promoted, to be the CEO, to be this, to be that. I dun wan to be anything.... but of cos I want to be promoted only for two reasons: More pay and of cos in my company if you stay in one position for too long, very high chance to kena kicked out easily haha.</p>
              <p>My boss in my appraisal says that maybe this year or likely next year, looking at promotion depending on my own development and the usual thing like if wanna move into middle and senior management, must be more matured in handling people etc...then wah i listen already i abit neutral, to a certain degree, unexcited....cos I never wanted to be in all this shit. I just wanna work happily, fulfil my responsibilities, make sure I do well so that I can keep my job. He asked me what I want to be in 5 years, I told him in work, nothing but for music, I want to be a rockstar. My boss laughed and appreciate my passion in music but also warned me if my CEO, his boss, happened to chat with me on this, I cannot use this kind of answer.</p>
              <p>Haiz....I wish I was free and selfish enough to make decisions for my life and for myself only that will make me happier. I am happy now lah, but I know I could be happier. I am 32 this year and God knows how long more I can live....I do not want my whole life to just be remembered for mundane things like "he was a good colleague" or "he was a good friend" or "he was a funny piece of shit".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HAIZ.....paiseh a bit lor soh this morning....</p>

              <p>Happiness for myself and happiness for people and for me, the only medium for me is music.</p>
              <p>I always wanted to do music. Music to most is a set of melodies made up of notes and give u a nice feeling listening to it. Music to me is life. There was a period of time in my poly when I fractured my leg and had to stay at home, bedridden for 4 months. It was depressing because I had to do everything in bed, peeing all these stuff in bed. It was depressing. Then I remembered one morning, I woke up 6 plus in the morning, it was raining and it just adds to my depression. That was when I picked up my guitar and wrote my very first song in life and you know what, that was a bloody unlistenable song as I looked back now but at that point of time, just singing how  felt and playing a melody that may sound like shit to others but amazingly, it had a very sedative effect on me. That was from that day I realised how music can go beyond just pure listening, music really does heal a person in amazing ways.</p>
              <p>It was always my dream to do music and one day when I am older and eventually when my mother is gone (I hope she lives long though), I would want to lug a guitar and go various places in the world, using music to communicate. The joy of not understanding each other through spoken language but yet understanding thru the language of music is undescribable..</p>

              <p>I wished I had the courage but i still do not have. Esp now when my father no longer around, she looks to me to provide everything for the household. Maybe one day I hope I have the chance to still be alive to live out my dream...I will never be too old, just dun know whether I will still be alive haha</p>
