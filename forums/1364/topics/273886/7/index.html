It was almost 5 years ago and my memory of it is vague, so I will write rather cautiously this time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>There were some tablets and offerings lying all around the perimeter of the house, as much as I can remember. The whole place was fenced then, there wasn't any possible ways to get in - except by climbing over or squeezing through a dog hole in the fence.<br><br>So we took the easier way and crawled through the hole in the fence, naturally. I, almost forgot to mention that there were 4 of us, and my eldest cousin was 30 years old then - I took comfort in the fact that we had an adult with us and finally agreed to explore the place with them.<br><br>We walked to the main door of the dilapidated house, past the frontyard and all without any trouble. But as soon, as we opened the main door... A fucking wave of rotten air hit us...<br><br>It smelt like there were a million corpses rotting inside, we were reluctant to go in initially but curiousity got the better of us. I don't know about the 2nd floor, but the first floor was a total disaster... with animals slain, blood everywhere, graffiti on the walls.. We didn't even walk a few steps into the house and we ran the F out for the sake of our dear lives <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
