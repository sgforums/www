            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I was prowling at 0300 last night at the coast when I saw a white NTU balloon tied to the railing.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> On closer look I was shocked, the balloon was not tied to the railing, it was just barely touching the railing but the very end was just somehow stuck to the wet rail.<br><br>........<br><br>So I reported it to the ops room although it was minor and I released the balloon. Just cannot fathom how a balloon can go up then down then up again. And it wasn't likely that anyone would tie a balloon there although it was possible and bear in mind that it wasn't tied. Me and my buddy just cannot explain how the balloon ended up there.</div>

This incident sounds more funny than scary...<br><br>My ex secondary school quite old, around 14++ years of age, one of the school in the East. I was from NCC, once they was having this camp but I did not attend.<br><br>During this camp, some of them suppose to sleep outside toilets at night. One of my buddy happen to sleep at the toilet located on the 4th floor. Many people say the 4th floor of our school is haunted, especially the corridoor along the science labs.<br><br>Ya back to my buddy. He saw this female ghost over there. But don't know what he thinking. He went to masturbate when sawing it. The next morning, all the other NCC members found him naked outside the toilet. He does not remember how he got naked that night <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div></blockquote>WTF? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah not so many stories in this thread hor? Alright I will share my part of stories here...<br><br>I'm a student, and I work in the airport as part time. One of my colleague, a malay, has got the third eye.<br><br>We were smoking during our break, and he told me one of the thing he encounter while working...<br><br>He was doing a flight on one of the night he work, at around 10pm. He was suppose to go to F60. F60 is the last gate and its located at the far end of the airport. FYI, we are working in Terminal 2. Our job is to carry the board with the passenger name, and go to the gate and page for them. They will respond to it and we will escort them out to arrival hall, there will be drivers picking them up over there. There are passengers like workers, sailors or VIP (those who stay in hotels like Pan Pacific or Intercontinental), we address them as VIP.<br><br>Ok back to the story, as the plane was not at the gate yet, he sat down and waited for it. As he was waiting, he saw an old lady (malay) at the other end of the passage. He started to feel werid, as only people who work in the airport was allowed there.<br><br>So he know it was that thing, as he said he got third eye, its normal for him to ignore all this thing. But the old lady walk nearer to him, her hand was holding a basket. That old lady started talking to him, asking if he want to buy nasi lemak from him. But my colleague knowing something was not right, he politely rejected her, and the old lady walk away. It seems that the old lady was harmless.<br><br>The police beside my colleague ask who was he talking to? So my colleague told him everything. The police somehow know something about it as he had heard some stories of the same thing that has happened before.....<br><br>Kinda tired, will end here.. continue other stories some other time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
