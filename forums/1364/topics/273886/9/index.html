              <p>me  and my family went to chalet around 4 years back.<br>and i was younger back den, and more naive, my cousin and i decided to try our luck to see ghost. .<br>we walk around the chalet premises and took pictures of our surrounding using our camera hp.<br>likearound half an hour later, we wentback to see the pics that we took. .<br>what we get to see are mostly flashes and orbs, prolly becos our camera suck.<br>we told our elder cousin, who was around ten years older than us, and she scolded us like mad, and made us delete it.<br><br>so, after the chalet over, i went to sleep over at my cousin place. We were showing each other the picture taken during the chalet, and one of the pics had a skeleton face,longhair+white dressing and a smaller face which look like a toyol. It was meant to be juz the picture of my baby cousin, age around 2 back den, and it was taken in the wardrobe of the chalet. . .</p>

              <p>Be warned: preschoolers' grammar, sentence structure and all.. no time for editing man!</p>
              <p>I was a trainee in some signal camp back then and had a few spooky experiences. Our bunk back then was located on the fifth level of the accomodations block. My bunk mates were made up of friends I knew from BMT and so it was almost a party every night (We stayed up quite late to talk cock and sing song).</p>
              <p>Throughout the 2 months training, everyone heard something just before midnight. It could be the sound of heavy chains being dragged across the corridor (Our bunk only has a row of windows and it is not by the corridors, so it wasn't possible to actually see what's going on outside without opening the doors), some rattan broom being swept across the corridor. Weird sounds, probably our imagination? Don't be too quick to judge, read on.</p>
              <p>There was this once around 2am, my friend and I was chatting at his bed. And we started hearing the sound of somebody clipping nails from the first bed which is at the extreme left of the bunk. We were dazed and looked blankly at each other. And I suggested that we go take a look...</p>
              <p>The two of us crept to bed 1 and we called out "Alv*n.. Alv*n... are you awake?" There wasn't any response and we could hardly see a thing, it was pitch black. The sound of the clipping continued and we rushed for the lights. The sound stopped when the lights were on and Alv*n was soundly asleep on his bed. Not wanting wake up the entire bunk, we switched off the lights and went back to bed.</p>
              <p>There were countless other incidents... Like the gust of cold wind my friend felt in an enclosed area... Presence felt and all... But the following incident takes the cake...</p>
              <p>The night I was awfully tired, left my cellphone charging at the powerpoint and I dozed off. I woke up next morning and saw more than 10 missed calls from my mom and a text message sent by her.</p>
              <p>In the exact words:<em> ''Son, are you ok? You called home last night and you were crying. I asked you what's wrong and you hang up.''</em></p>
              <p>Naturally, I called my mom and asked her what happened. She claimed that I called home last night, I was sobbing bitterly and in between my cries, I was murmuring "mummy.... mummy" that kinda thing. I denied that I called home and instructed my mom not to pick up calls if she sees my number flashing after midnight. Initially, I thought it was my friends playing a prank on me... and I questioned them... No one admitted to it...</p>
              <p>And the strange thing is 1) Checked the call logs, no calls were made out  2) I don't save my mom's number in the phone I use for army.... So how possible it was for someone to dial my mom's number, cried his heart out and even called out "mummy"?</p>
              <p>Sensing something was wrong, I had been more careful - I took extra effort not to leave my cell phone charging overnight, even turned it off and locked it up in the locker before bedtime. And my mom didn't recieve any weird calls after that.</p>
              <p>It was till 2 weeks before our POP, the 2nd episode began. I couldn't sleep that night and was turning and tossing in bed. And I started hearing muffled crying of a child coming from the corridor, I immediately froze. I started to focus on the sound, it got clearer and was of a child crying... "sob sob... .sob Mummy... sob sob.. Mummy... sob"</p>
              <p>I remained motionless on my bed until it went away for a long time before I saw some movement on the bed opposite mine and I immediately walked over, nudged my friend a little and told him what I've heard......</p>
              <p>Sheeesh... Sheeesh... I'm still wondering what was that...</p>
