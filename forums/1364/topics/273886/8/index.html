            <div class='col-md body'>Story to share!<br><br>I was painting the wall outside the room with my friends until evening and then we decided to take 5. We off all the lights inside the room and went to sleep. The room was pitch black, cannot even see your hand.<br><br>Anyway, I wanted to zhi xiao my friends, so I made my way slowly in the dark to the adjoining room which is at the other side, through the door connecting both rooms. The other room was also pitch-black, but there was no one inside.<br><br>I went inside and then I sat inside to wait for my friends to find me missing. (Okay, I'm bloody childish, I know.) 5 min later, I swore I felt something creeping up onto me. I dismissed it as my imagination going mad because of the dark.<br><br>And then I had "spider-senses". I don't know how to describe it. It's like the dark suddenly flashed gray in sets. And the accompanying "eee" in your ears become louder in sync. AND THEN I started hearing footsteps coming in my direction. Call me disoriented and confused, but I'm darned sure the noise was coming in the opposite direction I had come from.<br><br>I freaked out and started walking back, using hands to feel my way and then I yelled for the lights to be switched on. It came on and I got a nice screwing from my friends.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Make what you will of this story.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>me  and my family went to chalet around 4 years back.<br>and i was younger back den, and more naive, my cousin and i decided to try our luck to see ghost. . <br>we walk around the chalet premises and took pictures of our surrounding using our camera hp.<br>likearound half an hour later, we wentback to see the pics that we took. . <br>what we get to see are mostly flashes and orbs, prolly becos our camera suck.<br>we told our elder cousin, who was around ten years older than us, and she scolded us like mad, and made us delete it.<br><br>so, after the chalet over, i went to sleep over at my cousin place. We were showing each other the picture taken during the chalet, and one of the pics had a skeleton face,longhair+white dressing and a smaller face which look like a toyol. It was meant to be juz the picture of my baby cousin, age around 2 back den, and it was taken in the wardrobe of the chalet. . .</p></div>
