A symbolism of Mother Earth and her protection.<br><br>No harm trying....I have and it works.<br><br>As you put a pinch of salt in the corners, just visualize a cleansing air sweeping the entire area of your house and when the last corner is done, the house being cleansed.<br><br>I did this when i was in the army when my bunk mates were being disturbed...also in my friend's old house that had alot of problems........and in my own room....kid's expecially seem to find it calming.</div>

I sat up in my bed trying to focus in on who it was...eyes still blurry...dark and all.<br><br>The thing has wrinkled grey skin and dark dirty long hair...it put stared straight at me and put it's finger to it's mouth and shook it's head....basically telling me to keep quiet....the thing that made me nearly cry was the look it had on its face....a mischeivious almost evil grin.....<br><br>I lay back down and covered my head with the blanket....contemplating reaching out to my aunt who was a few feet away from me...but i was scared it might see me so i lay there till what seemed like an hour passed by before i calmed down and slowly began pulling the blanket off my face...<br><br>It was then i felt a hand grab mine....and i screamed....my brother apparently had seen something standing next to me and grabbed me to pull me away.<br>When i screamed...he screamed....and my aunt woke up with a shock....<br><br>we told my mum what happened the next morning and were brought to temple the very next day....the priest did his mumbo jumbo thing and all was well again....a religious quick-fix if you will.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2<br><br>But before I do, I solemmly take an oath that all that I shall expound is true.<br><br>That night after our BBQ and merry making; emptying our last bottle of whiskey, we decided to retire for the night and go to bed. I remember it was almost 1pm before we went up the 2nd level of the chalet and into the respectively bedrooms (there were 2 bedrooms, if my memory does not fail) of the guys and girls.<br><br>And yes, everyone went up to the bedrooms - no one is willing to spend the long night alone in the living area on the 1st level. The place already raised a few hairs at the back of our necks when we stepped in that afternoon.<br><br>I do not know of the girls; but the most of the guys fell asleep after awhile. I was on the phone and counting down, hoping that dawn would crack soon for the boredom was already killing me. Suddenly, screams and cries for help were heard from the bedroom next to mine. I could hear the girls next door, screaming frantically.<br><br>So I woke the guys up, some even before I woke them, had already awoken. We turned on the lights and rushed over to the girls' room. And I saw my female friends all tensed up and very much awake; 2 of them were crying. We, boys, did what we could to calm everyone. And I started to question the girls. It was about 2.30am at that time, I had my watch on all the while so I managed to keep track. The exact time it happened I couldn't bring to mind, but in this account - I will try to be as accurate as possible.<br><br>In her sobbing, I managed to find out that something had been tickling the sole of her left foot. She thought it was a prank by one of the other girls, so she roused herself and looked around the room. According to her, everyone was asleep and so she continued to lie down. The tickling didn't stop and it got worse as she claimed and she tried to kick it off but failed.<br><br>She elaborated that she totally got freaked out, but managed to remain quiet. For a girl, I admit it was strong of her not to scream at the beginning - but maybe, she was too scared to react in any ways possible. She couldn't bear it anymore when she felt that thing scratched her, she claimed that thing was clawing at the shin of her left leg. She couldn't take the pain and let out a yell, and that scared the hell out of the other girls and soon everyone started screaming like dominos effect.<br><br>I, rather we examined her left leg and indeed that there was some sign of scratching. It wasn't really exaggerated, but it was an obvious sign of some nails over her shin. At that point of time, I was still very cynical - it is not me to believe in whatever paranormal (Even thought I was raised with a Christian faith, and the Bible did speak of Demons and Spirits), at the time I was pretty agnostic.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To be continued...</span></div>
