            <div class='col-md body'>Part 3<br><br>I believe I was still pretty much calm and level-headed at that time. And I asked everyone to gather at the living area on the 1st level; if indeed an unknown evil dwelled on the very room the girls slept in, it made no sense to me for everyone to remain in there.<br><br>14 of us started to make our way down to the 1st level; huddled in a bunch, some were very frightened and still shaking and the others still composed. Thank God, the lights on the 1st level was still on - someone suggested we turn it off earlier on and fortunately no one heeded her.<br><br>We got together at the living room, and a friend turned the TV on - she wanted the room to be more lively so it wouldn't be as eerie. The guys then tried to start talking and cheering everyone up; gradually everyone started to warm up. Laughter is indeed infectious.<br><br>We kept talking for a good while and most of us had already forgotten about the earlier incident. And just so I happened to turn my head to the left, and I caught a glance of a image flashed past the window. I could not percieve what it was exactly, till this very day I still do not know what flew past the windows. But it was a circular object with jagged edges, it was luminous to the best of my memory. It glew a little with a white light, or was it green? I couldn't tell for sure.<br><br>I quickly turned my head around to the right and I caught a malay friend looking at me, his eyes confirmed that I was not the only one who saw what I saw. I asked if he saw clearly what was it and he replied to me that we shall not talk about such things at such hour. The girls then, with an understanding of what we were talking about, started to panick. Many probed us what we saw, but we brushed it off and told them it was nothing. We did not want to add grief and worry to their hearts.<br><br>And not long after, we started to hear the sound of someone tapping at the backdoor. It was very consistent; it went like "tok, tok, tok, tok, tok....", never missing a beat, never too loud nor too soft. One of suggested that we should check it out, but I doubt anyone in their sane mind would have done that.<br><br>We kept very quiet, the entire room was silence except for sound of the TV and the constant tapping. The tapping soon became louder and more obvious, it came to the point it actually became hardly bearable. I know that right outside the backdoor is a path that leads to the toliet, no trees or any objects were placed near the backdoor (I was there earlier in the afternoon, when we checked in)<br><br>Then someone among us, couldn't bear with it anymore. Took out her phone and called for her parents to pick her up. There were still the sounds of knockings against the backdoor...<br><br>The night did not end here... It wasn't even close to 4am...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To be continued...</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 4 (Probably the last part, I'll try to be as concise as possible)<br><br>"Tok, Tok, tok, Tok"<br><br>That dreadful sound went on for sometime before it finally died, I can't bring to mind what time exactly when the knockings went off - was already too weary and fighting hard to stay awake. But it went off, and I was glad for awhile; was almost a burden off my heart.<br><br>At about 4.30am in the morning, my friend's father came to pick her up. I guess that the pressure was too big for her to take and leaving would be the best solution. Along with her, went the girl who was scratched by the unknown evil and 2 other girls.<br><br>Now those who remained, were 7 guys and 3 girls. 10 of us and less than 2 hours to daylight, I was hoping that the black night would just pass as peacefully as possible.<br><br>The scratching, the sighting of unknown object past the window and sound of knockings against the backdoor - I don't know what you readers think, but it was very pressurizing for me then. After all, we were in a quiet chalet on top of a hill - and the other 2 Biggin' Hill Chalets beside us were empty.<br><br>The last encounter happened not long later, it was the most hair-raising for us. And I'm afraid that I might not be able to describe it well enough to impose the same fear we felt on you, but I shall try.<br><br>So 10 of us were sitting in the living area with the TV on in the background, waiting for dawn to crack. And I heard a voice coming from the kitchen, it was of a woman talking. What she was saying, I couldn't understand. But her voice was loud to be audible enough and high pitched, so for the love of God - I know it wasn't my imagination.<br><br>Soon another female voice came in, and they started talking in a language to me. It was neither English, Mandarin, Malay, Spanish, Hokkien nor Cantonese - all those I know. I looked around and it was obvious by the body language of my friends that there were really 2 voices speaking to one another. Everyone almost bundled ourselves together at that instance.<br><br>To make matters worse, the 2 female voices didn't stop talking. From the direction, they were in the kitchen area. And they started giggling. The whole crap lasted a good 10 minutes or so before they were gone. And 2 of my friends started praying all the way till daylight.<br><br>It was a little after 6am, we started packing up. The whole place was in great mess and disorder but we only picked up our stuff. At that time, I'm sure everyone would rather get in trouble with the chalet authorities and be issued a fine than to stay in that cursed chalet any longer.<br><br>We went to the coffeeshop nearby for breakfast, and started to talk about the eventful night. Some claimed to witness more than I did; some even claimed they already saw "unclean" stuff earlier when we were having our BBQ. Another friend spoke of seeing a ghastly image in the mirror earlier, when he went up to the 2nd level to use the toliet there.<br><br>As much as I am concerned, I've only reported what I've experienced in this account of 4 parts. Buy it or not? I've already spoke my piece. If you're keen for adventure, go to Biggin' Hill Chalet - the one on the right.<br><br>Caution, evil dwells.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Oath-keeper,<br>Detached<br><br></div>
