              have just started to give out free sdk to attracted i-phone

              <p>But iphone has one of the best user interface that is all finger

              mind. But other phone function such as sms-ing multiple reciepient
              with a single sms cant be made from the i-phone. (not sure if they
              solve the threading bug).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ass for HTC, the diamond is a good buy, in term of money for
              value. But the new looking interface that is trying to minic
              I-phone has alot of flaws. Meaning it lead memory and hang after

              <p>The actual cost of the samsung onima is rather high. They really

              <p>I personally prefer the samsung Omnia. Coz itis a very good spec phone. Big touch screen is a very attractive feature. Like the i-phone, it have the inbuild motion sensor chip. GPS chip (cost only USD$5 only btw). so itis kinda cool.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless u are a mac user, i would say go for the samsung since itis more money for value. I-phone spec is much lower compare to omnia. like the inbuild camera, bigger hard disc with memory card slot. But so far, nothing beat i-phone for it user interface. It is so user friendly that even grandma have no problem using it. Plus the cool x factor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u have the money, of coz go for it. But like all new phone, it value drop rather fast. Btw, samsung is coming out a new simbian phone with a 8M pixel camera. It picture quality is one of the best.</p>

              <p>That is a very nice handy phone to have. Itis classy and nice small size. Like all miniture stuff, itis processor speed isnt as fast and oso, itis a 2007 release phone. Hence it camera is only 2M pixel and it doesnt come with a standard GPS reciever. Atleast itis a 3G phone. But it classic black posh out look is base on the prada phone. Hence, it goes well in the female gender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a very typical pda phone with most of the standard feature in. In case u are not a window mobile user, i have to inform u abt the flaw of it. Like all Windows OS, it crashs hang and need restarting once a while, sometime like once a month min. It does have slight more internal memory of 128Mb, which is alot higher for phone launch ard that time. Of coz, u cant compare that to omnia which have a 16G hard disc. and itis running on 400Mhz.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently, i am playing afew ASUS pda phone with GPS capabilty that is build with the stardard feature found in older pda found release in the late 2007. They are supposed to be the cheaper alternative of those highend phone like i-phone and omnia. They are small and cheap but slower processor. One it that i am playing is slightly smaller then ks2. B'coz those are sample phone, i am not sure if any telco will be importing them in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i am saying is that, there is alot of pda phone surfacing on the market and i am sure the cheaper alternative will be available soon.</p>

              <p>As far as i know.. Omnia have 3 version of firmware. the one release are either the version 2nd or the version 3rd. If u are lucky, u get the version 3rd. Fireware for pda phone are alot easier to upgrade. Like computer motherboard, all u need to do it download it to your computer, sync ur phone to it and run it. Some might even run on the phone itself. Try looking the samsung omnia web site for support download. U shd ba able to fine the needed infor there.</p>

              <p>That is a very nice handy phone to have. Itis classy and nice
              small size. Like all miniture stuff, itis processor speed isnt as
              fast and oso, itis a 2007 release phone. Hence it camera is only 2M
              pixel and it doesnt come with a standard GPS reciever. Atleast itis
              a 3G phone. But it classic black posh out look is base on the prada
              phone. Hence, it goes well in the female gender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a very typical pda phone with most of the standard feature
              in. In case u are not a window mobile user, i have to inform u abt
              the flaw of it. Like all Windows OS, it crashs hang and need
              restarting once a while, sometime like once a month min. It does
              have slight more internal memory of 128Mb, which is alot higher for
              phone launch ard that time. Of coz, u cant compare that to omnia
              which have a 16G hard disc. and itis running on 400Mhz.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently, i am playing afew ASUS pda phone with GPS capabilty
              that is build with the stardard feature found in older pda found
              release in the late 2007. They are supposed to be the cheaper
              alternative of those highend phone like i-phone and omnia. They are
              small and cheap but slower processor. One it that i am playing is
              slightly smaller then ks2. B'coz those are sample phone, i am not
              sure if any telco will be importing them in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i am saying is that, there is alot of pda phone surfacing
              on the market and i am sure the cheaper alternative will be
              available soon.</p>
