In ancient Egypt, the cat god, Bast, was a goddess of the home and of the domestic cat, although she sometimes took on the war-like aspect of a lioness. She was the daughter of the sun god Ra, although she was sometimes regarded as the daughter of Amun. She was the wife of Ptah and mother of the lion-god Mihos. Her cult was centered on her sanctuary at Bubastis in the Nile Delta, where a necropolis has been found containing mummified cats. Bast was also associated with the "eye of Ra," acting as the instrument of the sun god's vengeance. She was depicted as a cat or in human form with the head of a cat, often holding the sacred rattle known as the sistrum.<br><br>Several ancient religions believe that cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that they are all-knowing but are mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans.<br><br>It is common lore that cats have nine lives. It is a tribute to their perceived durability, their occasional apparent lack of instinct for self-preservation, and their seeming ability to survive falls that would be fatal to other creatures.<br><span class="small">(Extracted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#History_and_mythology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#History_and_mythology</a>)</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The facts:</span><br><ul>Cats can go up to two weeks without food and water due to, among other things, the way their kidneys work.</ul><br><ul>Cats use their whiskers to know exactly what they can fit into, which can be very tight places!
