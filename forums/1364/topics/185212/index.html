            <div class='col-md body'>Genesis Climber Mospeada<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br><br>Genesis Climber Mospeada (機甲創世記モスピーダ, Kikou Souseiki Mosupiida?) is an anime science fiction series. The 25-episode television series ran from late 1983 to early 1984 in Japan. MOSPEADA stands for Military Operation Soldier Protect Emergency Aviation Dive Auto, one of the transformable motorcycle-armors the series features. The other primary mecha featured in the show is the three-form transformable fighter called the Armo-Fighter AFC-01 Legioss, which is very much similiar with the VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighter in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross.<br><br>Story<br><br>The story takes place in the 21st century, when humans have colonized Mars in search of new place to call home as a result of overpopulation on Earth. In the year 2050, a mysterious alien race called the Inbit invaded the Earth. Unable to fight the Inbits, Earth became desolate with only a few scattered populations of human beings.<br><br>However, the Mars colony, dubbed the Mars Base, did not forget about the plight of Earth. Troops were sent in to fight the Inbits from the Moon, only to fail miserably. The Inbits did not attack Mars, as they were only interested in Earth, though Mars Base expected the attack. In 2080, Mars Base sent in the next wave of troops. Although equipped with more technological advanced equipments and transformable mecha, the attempt on recapturing Earth was nonetheless a failure.<br><br>Three years later, Mars Base launched another attack called the Second Earth Recapture Force. One of the troops happened to be Lieutenant Stick Bernard. The mission proved to be unsuccessful as it did three years ago and Stick's fiancÃ©e Marlene was killed. After losing his fiancÃ©e, Stick was forced to crash into Earth, landing in South America. At first, he was sorrowful and depressed at the death of his beloved Marlene. After seeing the holographic recording of his dead fiancÃ©e, Stick swore an oath of vengeance. In his quest to reach the Reflex Point on North America, the Inbit 'hive', he meets other characters of the show, forming a group of ragtag freedom fighters on a goal to free Earth from the Inbits.<br><br>As the plot unravels, the purpose of the Inbits invading Earth was revealed. Their sole purpose of invading Earth was because Earth provides them a suitable place to evolve into more complex beings. However, little did the Inbits know that their endeavor actually threatens to cause the extinction of both humans and Inbits. And thus, it is up to Stick and his group, with the help of human-like Inbits (Aisha and Solzie), to convince the supreme ruler of the Inbit, the Refles, to flee from Earth.<br>[edit]<br><br>Characters<br><br>Twenty-year-old Mars Base lieutenant Stick Bernard leads the team, which includes 17-year-old scavenger Ray, spirited 13-year-old Mint Labule, 16-year-old former biker gang member Houquet et Rose, 32-year-old maintenance mechanic Jim Warston, and 22-year-old singer Yellow Belmont. (The English-subtitled Mospeada DVD release by Harmony Gold and ADV Films use the inaccurate names Â“StigÂ” Bernard, Mint Â“Rubble,Â” Houquet Â“Emrose,Â” and Jim Â“AustinÂ” derived from fans on Robotech.com and the Robotech Art I book.) In Robotech Stick Bernard becomes Scott Bernard, Ray becomes Rand, Mint Labule becomes Annie LaBelle, Houquet et Rose becomes Rook Bartley, Jim Warston becomes Lunk and Yellow Belmont is Lancer AKA Yellow Dancer.<br>[edit]<br><br>Adaptation for the Robotech universe<br><br>Most of its animation (with edited content and revised dialogue) was adapted for Robotech: The New Generation, the third saga of the Robotech series. In Robotech, the Inbit became the Â“InvidÂ” of the Â“Third GenerationÂ” (also featured in Robotech II: The Sentinels) and the advanced space forces are the returning Robotech Expeditionary Force (REF) that left before the Â“Second GenerationÂ” of Robotech on Earth. EarthÂ’s Defense Forces were decimated in the previous saga. Unlike the Invid in the adapted Robotech, the Inbit in Mospeada had nothing to do with the Robotech Masters (their sworn enemies in Robotech) and they were just looking for a good planet on which to evolve and reach perfection. Likewise, the REF forces under Admiral HunterÂ’s command that Bernard constantly rattles along were troops from the Mars and Jupiter bases which harassed the Inbit, though they were playing a Â“leave aloneÂ” system with humans on Earth.<br><br>The transformable VR series of Armor Cycles became the VR series of Veritech Cyclone motorcycles; transformable Armo-Fighter AFC-01 Legioss became the Alpha Veritech VF/A-6; the transformable Armo-Bomber AB-01 Tread became the Beta Veritech VFB-9. Character names were generally altered without major changes in characterization, making Mospeada the least altered series of the three. Like Macross and The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, Genesis Climber Mospeada was cut and fitted to be part of the Robotech continuum by Harmony Gold and Carl Macek.<br>[edit]<br><br>Love Live Alive<br><br>After the original run of the television series, an OAV music video titled Genesis Climber Mospeada: Love Live Alive was specially (mostly due to demands of hardcore Mospeada fans) released in Japan on September 1985. The music video consisted of both old and new footage. The story of Love Live Alive chronicled the events after the ending of the original Mospeada, featuring Yellow Belmont as the main character. The music video focused on Yellow's concert and also on his flashback of past events.<br>[edit]<br><br>External links<br><br>Official Site:<br><br>* Mospeada.Com - Harmony Gold's official Mospeada website.<br><br>Fan Site:<br><br>* Ultimate Genesis Climber Mospeada Home Page - Includes detailed information of the Mospeada world.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
