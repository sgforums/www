We should go riding together, the whole group, one of these days. Take the horses out and canter through the woods. Its a darn good feeling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There's another nice place at Leisure Farm, Bale Club. The horses there are beautiful but not too exercised and don't really respond that well. There's a great arena for riding which is scary as hell cos its huge and probably 5 times the sizes of Mos' arenas. Mos was thinking of going there but he's got his babies to think about.<br><br>If you are seriously considering polo, there's a full month intensive course at Selangor. Stay in and stuff like that so if you're really passionate, and still young *hic*, go try it out. Polo in Singapore is very exclusive and expensive. The polo club is members only and seriously, their horses look tired and listless. The horses at Saddle Club are a lot more interesting lot. I actually love the huge ass dressage horses. Very steady and even tempered. Arabians are very very skittish and seriously, I can't handle them. There's one I met at Langkawi once. An Arabian. Sheesh.... nasty boy i tell you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well hello! Great to have u drop by! What happened with you and Pelangi??? Bad experience? Yea the horses in Pelangi are in pretty bad conditions, they have this funny skin diesease with patches of hair missing... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>The reason I still go back and ride there is because of Doris. Oh how much I love her. She's always so eager to please and willing, and there's a slight air of loftiness around her; she doesn't like to be mounted from the steps if she recognizes you. Instead, she wants to be mounted from ground, haha. All it takes is a slight maneuver of the rein and there she goes trotting or cantering.<br><br>She's very alert and her ears are always twitching back and forth, waiting for commands. Although at only 14h, she has a huge bouncy trot and canter.<br><br>Kimchi and Melbourne(Mos's) are much much smoother in their gait, which makes them pretty much easier to ride. I haven't really tried Alabaster though, maybe I'll work him one of these days as I heard he's much more alert. Hmm...<br><br>If it helps, I heard from Halim few days ago that the school(Pelangi) is going to buy some new horses. That probably explains why they're extending the stables and overlaying new tarmac there. So yea, sit tight and wait for the good news. Maybe the conditions for the horses there will improve when things start picking up.<br><br><img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/8918/21334457nx3.jpg"><br><br>The above image is the polo ground at leisure farm. The track laps about 830m, wow! Great for galloping! The paddocks at Pelangi and Amigos is only about 160m so...<br><br>In fact, I was at leisure farm last week. They've only got 6 horses there and only 2 are fit to ride. Big field they may have but it's pointless if you can't let loose the reins, get what I mean? haha. From what I heard, they stopped playing polo there because of some royalties issues. What the...<br><br>Yea I've always wanted to take up a polo course in Selangor, which costs about RM2000 for 24 lessons and horse. Relatively cheap and the best deal you can get if you ask me. Still, it's too far away and it's going to burn a deep hole in my pocket!<br><br>Hell yeah we should ride out. Langkawi looks deliciously tempting, how say you about it? I can drive, if you don't mind my old beat up car that is... lmao.<br><br>By the way, I'm going up to Pahang this afternoon to visit my grands. Whew, 8 hours drive man... Nuts. Well, I've drove longer, no big deal. Yeah I've booked a half day ride with Lorraine Bottreau at Bukit Tinngi, Pahang. Will post some pics when I'm back.<br><br>LET'S RIDE<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by desertmoon7:</div><div class="quote_body">Harlo Maurince! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have to say, its thrilling to find like-minded riding enthusiasts.
