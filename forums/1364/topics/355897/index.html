              </span></p><p>IN her own words, she's happily married to a businessman who lavishes her with expensive gifts and dotes on their sons.</p>
              <p>Her two teenage boys are 'good kids, obedient and respectful'.</p>
              <p>But all that is not stopping the 42-year-old tai-tai from seeking - and paying for - the company of toyboys at karaoke clubs.</p>
              <p>Yes, she said she knows that her nights out could easily tear the
              family apart, as her husband thinks she's out playing mahjong with her
              tai-tai friends.</p>
              <p>Yet, said Madam Wang, who agreed to be interviewed on condition we
              did not use her full name: 'The temptation is just too irresistible.</p>
              <p>'I'd feel something was missing if I had to skip one of my regular visits to the club.'</p>
              <p>Her regular haunt is one of several KTV-like clubs catering to women that have sprouted across Singapore.</p>
              <p>There are at least 11 such clubs, all of which opened in the past year.</p>
              <p>Young, good-looking men sing, dance and cuddle up with women like Madam Wang at these places.</p>
              <p>The New Paper on Sunday team spent four nights over three weeks at
              seven clubs in areas such as Tanjong Pagar, Katong, Jalan Besar and
              Shenton Way.</p>
              <p>Women easily made up 95 per cent of the clubs' clientele - and they were treated like queens.</p>
              <p>Whether it was raucous sleaze or discreet fun, everyone got a chance with the male hosts.</p>
              <p>When we first spotted Madam Wang at a club in Jalan Besar around 7pm
              on a weekday, she was on a high chair, leaning across the glass-top
              table, smiling at a Thai host.</p>
              <p>He held a slice of watermelon, teasing her. Each time she was about
              to nibble at the watermelon, he'd move his hand away and her lips would
              nearly meet his.</p>
              <p>The routine, repeated several times in the four hours that Madam Wang was at the club, left her giggling.</p>
              <p>She said later: 'It may sound silly to you, but he made me feel
              young all over again. That's one feeling I don't get from my husband
              any more.'</p>
              <p>That 'youthful feeling' comes at a price. The bill for about three
              hours of chatting, entertainment, a plate of fruits and three jugs of
              beer for our team at the club came to nearly $500.</p>
              <p>Madam Wang said she spends about $1,500 each night. If she takes a
              male host out to supper, it can set her back by another $150 an hour.</p>
              <p><strong>'Selling dreams'<br></strong>Such clubs are successful
              because they 'sell dreams' - as it says in the club's tag line. At such
              places, said psychologist Richard Lim, women can 'indulge in the thrill
              of an alpha-female relationship' and 'fulfil their needs to be desired'.</p>
              <p>The club's black, wooden doors appear intimidating. But the door
              bitch (or bouncer) was far less intimidating than those you're likely
              to encounter at some other clubs.</p>
              <p>She is likely to usher you into the dimly-lit club without much fuss - even if you have not made a reservation.</p>
              <p>With a friendly smile, she settled her guests into the sofas, couch
              seats or bar stools - all arranged in a mix-and-match fashion.</p>
              <p>There is no dress code. Women customers were dressed mostly in office attire or simple black dresses.</p>
              <p>At two-hour intervals, about 30 male entertainers from Thailand,
              China, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea - and even Singapore -
              took turns to strut on the stage.</p>
              <p>They were geared up to dazzle in smart, fashionable attire.</p>
              <p>Some wore body-hugging shirts or tight tees that showed off their
              toned muscular arms. Others were suited up in sleek leather jackets and
              black pants.</p>
              <p>And almost all of them sported immaculately waxed and tousled hair, like trendy pop celebrities.</p>
              <p>After the emcee called out their numbers - no names - they stepped
              up and mumbled into the mike. Most times, we couldn't really hear what
              they said, except the names of their countries.</p>
              <p>What followed was like what goes on in Thai discos where customers
              can buy flowers for their favourite entertainers, with the two floor
              managers approaching customers to stake their claim on their choice for
              the night.</p>
              <p>Garlands of plastic flowers were priced at $30, $50 and $80, while sashes started from $100 and went up to $1,000.</p>
              <p>There was no live band. The men sang karaoke-style and performed with much gusto and improvised dance moves.</p>
              <p>Results varied drastically, ranging from some who could do a nifty
              imitation of professional singers to those who seemed to be tone-deaf.</p>
              <p>But singing appeared to be secondary. Most of the men were young and hunky, with some sporting model looks.</p>

              </span></p><p><strong>Making their rounds<br></strong>The men went from table to table between their sets to chat or play dice games over drinks.</p>
              <p>They flirted and teased, sometimes with a hand on the lap, or an arm across the shoulder, a whisper or just holding hands.</p>
              <p>Think simple 'boyfriend touches' - an effect that is probably lacking in the women's lives.</p>
              <p>There were no vulgar moves in the club, except for the occasional
              over-indulgent woman. One was locked in a tight embrace with a Chinese
              entertainer - despite the presence of her eight women friends.</p>
              <p>The Chinese host seemed to be the most popular, getting about $1,800 worth of garlands and sashes whenever he sang.</p>
              <p>While the owner of the club declined to be interviewed, he insisted that the club was 'like any other normal karaoke club'.</p>
              <p>What takes place after closing hours is beyond his control, he added.</p>
              <p>That is when the story becomes murky, with some women and the men
              singing different tunes, as we discovered during our stake-out.</p>
