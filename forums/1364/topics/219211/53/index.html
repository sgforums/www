            <div class='col-md body'>Joke of the day<br><br>A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes<br>to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, "My car broke down. Do you<br>think I could stay the night?"<br><br>The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the<br>man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he<br>asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, "We can't tell you.<br>You're not a monk."<br><br>The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.<br><br>Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.<br>The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the<br>same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.<br>The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, "We can't tell<br>you. You're not a monk."<br><br>The man says, "All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I<br>can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a<br>monk?"<br><br>The monks reply, "You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of<br>grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these<br>numbers, you will become a monk."<br>The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks<br>on the door of the monastery. He says, "I have traveled the earth and have<br>found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass<br>and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth."<br>The monks reply, "Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show<br>you the way to the sound."<br><br>The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, "The<br>sound is right behind that door."<br>The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, "Real<br>funny. may I have the key?" The monks give him the key, and he opens the<br>door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.<br><br>The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and<br>he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from<br>the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made<br>of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald,<br>silver, topaz, amethyst...<br><br>Finally, the monks say, "This is the last key to the last door."<br>The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and<br>behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.....<br><br>Scroll Down<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>scroll down<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>But I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.</div>

He goes<br>to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, "My car broke down. Do you<br>think I could stay the night?"<br><br>The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the<br>man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he<br>asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, "We can't tell you.<br>You're not a monk."<br><br>The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.<br><br>Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.<br>The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the<br>same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.<br>The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, "We can't tell<br>you. You're not a monk."<br><br>The man says, "All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I<br>can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a<br>monk?"<br><br>The monks reply, "You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of<br>grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these<br>numbers, you will become a monk."<br>The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks<br>on the door of the monastery. He says, "I have traveled the earth and have<br>found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass<br>and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth."<br>The monks reply, "Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show<br>you the way to the sound."<br><br>The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, "The<br>sound is right behind that door."<br>The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, "Real<br>funny. may I have the key?" The monks give him the key, and he opens the<br>door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.<br><br>The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and<br>he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from<br>the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made<br>of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald,<br>silver, topaz, amethyst...<br><br>Finally, the monks say, "This is the last key to the last door."<br>The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and<br>behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.....<br><br>Scroll Down<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>scroll down<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>But I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another joke<br><br>One evening, after attending the theater, two gentlemen were walking down the avenue when they observed a rather well dressed and attractive young lady walking ahead of them.<br><br>One of them turned to the other and remarked, "I'd give $250.00 to spend the night with that woman." Much to their surprise, the young lady overheard the remark, turned around, and replied, "I'll take you up on that offer."<br><br>She had a neat appearance and a pleasant voice, so after bidding his companion good night, the man accompanied the young lady to her apartment.<br><br>The following morning, the man presented her with $125.00 as he prepared to leave.<br><br>She demanded the rest of the money stating, "If you don't give me the other $125.00, I'll sue you for it." He laughed saying, "I'd like to see you get it on these grounds."<br><br>The next day, he was surprised when he received a summons ordering his presence in court as a defendant in a lawsuit.<br><br>He hurried to his lawyer and explained the details of the case. His lawyer said, "She can't possibly get a judgment against you on such grounds, but it will be interesting to see how her case will be presented."<br><br>After the usual preliminaries, the lady's lawyer addressed the court as follows:<br>"Your honor, my client, this lady, is the owner of a piece of<br>property--a garden spot--surrounded by a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to rent to the defendant for a specified length of time for the sum of $250.00. The defendant took possession of the property, used it extensively for the purposes for which it was rented, but upon evacuating the premises, he paid only $125.00, one-half of the amount agreed upon. The rent was not excessive, since it is restricted property, and we ask judgment be granted against the defendant to assure payment of the balance."<br><br>The defendant's lawyer was impressed and amused by the way his opponent had presented the case. His defense, therefore, was somewhat different from the way he originally planned to present it. "Your honor," he said, "My client agrees that the lady has a fine piece of property, that he did rent such property for a time, and a degree of pleasure was derived from the transaction. However, my client found a well on the property around which he placed his own stones, sunk a shaft, and erected a pump, all labor performed personally by him. We claim these improvements to the property were sufficient to offset the unpaid amount, and that the plaintiff was adequately compensated for the rental of said property. We, therefore, ask that judgment not be granted."<br><br>The young lady's lawyer answered thus: "Your honor, my client agrees that the defendant did find a well on her property. However, had defendant not known that the well existed, he would never have rented the property. Also, upon evacuating the premises, the defendant removed the stones, pulled out the shaft, and took the pump with him. In doing so, he not only dragged the<br>equipment through the shrubbery, but left the hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making the property much less desirable to others. We, therefore, ask that judgment be granted."<br><br>In the Judge's decision, he provided for two options: "Pay the 125.00 or have the equipment detached and provided to the plaintiff for damages."<br>The defendant wrote a check immediately.</div>
