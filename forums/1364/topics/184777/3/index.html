            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm a couple of more dramatic rascist incidents in australia but tts not as ... important as the subtle undercurrent that runs generally and yes, it's big city australia...<br><br>But..what I do love abt Australia is the large spaces, nature, the flowers, the beaches, the al fresco dining, winding roads by the oceans, rivers, trees... I enjoy the cool weather in spring and autumn and winter, and eating lunch under trees.<br><br>I enjoy the emphasis on hands on knowledge, the camaraderie, sharing and understanding I had from some of my lecturers who were easy going, and inspiring. I enjoy the markets with heaps of fruits and fresh goods, and crafts made by aspiring artists all often so colourful and creative.<br><br>But I don't enjoy the part of nature that includes heaps of spiders, (red back!) and weird caterpillars! (A big huge fuzzy pink one fell just in front of me) And the chinese food that looks good in the glass cabinet but manage to taste extraordinarily BAD and expensive too. The sharks makes one a little queasy abt sea sports... and. hmm... drinking appears to be a problem too.. err.. for those who don't drink that is.</div>
