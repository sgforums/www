            <div class='col-md body'>Last evening, i met up with Oceanos and Karkadann there again, so I can collect more intelligence for everyone who is interested.<br><br>Oceanos and Karkadann both ordered the po-lo bao and ying yong, and i ordered Macau pork chop burger and HK milk tea<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v366/Mospeada/IMAGE_077.jpg"><br><br>The verdict?<br><br>the supposedly crispy crust of the po-lo bao were not crispy. it was a total disappointment, as what Oceanos would say.<br><br>They did agreed with me that the ying yong was good...smooth texture and a perfect blend of tea and coffee.<br><br>As for the pork chop burger, 2 pieces of french loaf with lettecue, tomato, cucumber, slice of cheese and, of course, the pork chop.<br><br>The pork chop was tender and juicy, not the very chewy type you might think it will be. One thing: you must eat it while it is hot...and beware of the  tenderizing and juicy pork chop  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The HK milk tea. I would say it is as smooth as the Ying Yong...but as compared to the ying yong, the HK milk tea lose its glam. Maybe it is my taste bud, but I cant really tell the different between HK milk tea and the ying yong..I will pay more attention next time when i order ying yong <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
