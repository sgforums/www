            <div class='col-md body'>SCORPIO SNAKE: WATER + NEGATIVE FIRE<br><br>Skeptical, skeptical combination. The Scorpio Snake will possess great depths of emotion and be a cunning tactician. Cloaking his feelings with prudishness, he may prove to be quite inscrutable. Ambitious and performance-oriented, he soaks up knowledge like a sponge and is adept at interpreting the slightest insinuation. Whatever arouses his curiosity will be examined with no costs spared. Self-contained and ultra secretive, you won't catch him handing out explanations. Honestly, he cares little about idle gossip, but it is worth remembering that he is not to be taken lightly, for hell hath no fury like a Scorpion Snake scorned!<br><br>Definitely me.</div>

Cheerful and versatile, this aerated water personality is crystal clear in expressing himself and needs variety and freedom in everything he does. The Aquarian Rat is less acquisitive and values his personal relationships more than financial ones. Impatient and audacious, he can be rebellious. Armed with sharp perception and gifted with enticing charm, he can usually convince others to dance to his tune. He makes amends for his uneven moods by giving his allegiance to good causes and serving others without expecting rewards.<br><br>Its so me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Nonviolent but nonconforming, too, the ebullient Aquarius will teach the stiff Ox that he must sometimes stoop to conquer. The Water Bearer is too intelligent to resort to the brute force Buffalos employ when they are vengeful. Likewise, this subject will have enhanced vision and social graces. He is less predictable than other Oxen and not above defying public opinion by trimming the rules to suit his tastes.<br><br>i am a unpredictable person but quite violent</div>

Both solar and lunar signs here do not fear facing obstacles, although this conservative person has great respect for the wishes of others. Punctilious and hardworking, the Capricorn Boar will have the Pig's good faith and the Goat's "better safe than sorry" mentality. No pie-in-the-sky dreams for this conscientious worker. The Capricorn Boar upholds tradition with pride and does not skirt responsibility when rules have to be enforced.</div>

The Balance loves society and harmonious relations as does the Rat and both signs are born charmers. The Libran Rat is bound to be very flexible and understanding.

Abrupt and to the point, the Scorpio Rooster abhors compromise.. Don't even hint at it. It means defeat to him and he is never ever going down as a quitter. Since this personality sets out to win, he usually does, although his methods won't win him hordes of friends. Never mind, he may prefer - proud isolation to yielding even a single inch of ground. Scorpio's watery currents bring out the sleuth in the Rooster and little if anything escapes this commanding investigator.<br><br>somewhat bah..........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CAPRICORN TIGER: EARTH + POSITIVE WOOD<br><br>The result of this combination will be a captivating but less headstrong and impetuous Tiger. No doubt, he or she will still have that strong temper, but Capricorn's influence should see that this force is applied correctly. Linked to the Mountain Goat, this Tiger is not so restless as normal and is inclined to be less of a radical. He does not like sudden changes and can be relied upon to take his vows seriously. A dutiful Tiger who won't mind hardships or menial tasks if they develop his abilities. The Capricorn Tiger will not be entirely led by his heart as Tigers of more combustible combinations are.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Scorpio's stealth keeps him wedded to an uncompromising way of thinking. Submissiveness and consideration are not his chief virtues. Yet the Scorpio Monkey can be indispensable, efficient, attractive, clever and most aspiring. He will work hard for what he wants but could be pitiless to those looking for a handout. The Monkey is positive and captivating, but also incorrigible when it comes to getting his way. Both signs here are masterful at retaliation; he will have to even the scoreÃ„or die trying.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>

Otherwise, he is an affable fellow with large and lusty appetites. A person of this combination will do everything with mucho gusto, as both solar and lunar signs here are remarkably sensual and healthy. Patient and conscientious, the Taurean Boar will be a genuine friend and confidant. This combination produces a Bull who is more cooperative and a Boar favored with industry and perseverance.<br><br></div>

But Arians are also known to go into a rage very easily when challenged. Those of you who have been on the receiving end of the Aries temper know that if not calmed down they can even get violent. But one thing is certain if the opponent remains calm and does not react to their outburst, Arians cool down very fast. They are also the first to apologise, which makes them easier to forgive.<br><br>TAURUS APRIL 21 Â– MAY 20<br><br>You are generally quiet and have control over your emotions. It is difficult to predict what will upset you, so when you do lose your cool, people donÂ’t know how to react. Your temper is like that of a raging bull, and anyone trying to pacify you will be the first one to get a verbal bashing. You generally get upset when you are concerned or when people accuse you of doing something wrong. You also hate being reminded about mistakes youÂ’ve made in the past. You also have the potential to be terribly vindictive if rubbed the wrong way.<br><br>GEMINI MAY 21 Â– June 29<br><br>You are recognised by your cheerful disposition and your jovial nature is easily susceptible to anger. In fact, you are the best person to have around when there is an ugly scene at a party you can bring the warring factions together quite diplomatically. But when you lose cool, you yell and scream and will not listen to reason. You must have the last word in a wordy duel. Your capacity to argue aggressively is matched only by your seductive charm.<br><br>CANCER JUNE 21 Â– JULY 21<br><br>Considering how charming, caring and kind you are, you dislike unpleasant scenes, much less creating one yourself. You have great tolerance and rarely get provoked into losing your temper. If someone is unreasonable or trying to create trouble, you are more likely to walk away quietly. But that does not mean you do not have a temper. When angry, in your effort to control your emotions, you tremble, your hands get sweaty and sometimes you fumble for words. Tears roll down your eyes easily and the opponent is touched by your innocence and will seek an apology immediately.<br><br>LEO JULY 22 Â– AUGUST 21<br><br>If anyone has total control over their emotions, it is you. But then, you can be described as stiff, cold and uncaring. You are known to lack spontaneity but you really donÂ’t care about opinions. You donÂ’t like to create scenes and will never accept invitations to a party where you suspect the presence of an unruly lot. But your very presence seems challenging to some and they take vicarious pleasure in your disquiet. When angry you can use critical language. A dressingdown can humiliate your opponent, causing a strain between both of you forever.<br><br>VIRGO AUGUST 22 Â– SEPTEMBER 21<br><br>Most of you are gentle and have full control over your emotions but those of you given to temper tantrums can certainly get violent. When see things with rage, you yell and shout and tend to break things lying close at hand. You can even harm yourself by banging your hands on a glass top table or wall. You should never get into any argument, for you are a sore loser. You feel that others are trying to persecute you and donÂ’t quite respect your opinions. When hurt, you can also hold grudges forever.<br><br>LIBRA SEPTEMBER 22 Â– OCTOBER 22<br><br>Did someone say that you are the charmers of the zodiac? Well, itÂ’s true. Few have ever seen you ruffled or angry. You are very conscious of your image, and you believe that anger distorts your face and personality. You also think you are above things like anger. But wait before you get into self-congratulatory mood. Your family or those very close to you know you better. You have an unmatched temper amongst all the zodiac signs, and what makes it worse is your capacity to justify it.<br><br>SCORPIO OCTOBER 23 Â– NOVEMBER 21<br><br>Of course you donÂ’t lose your cool. But your very demeanour (manner) projects hauhtiness (arrogance, pride), pride and grand disdain (disregard) for lesser mortals (human). Others are often found saying that anger sits on your nose and you are raring to give your piece mind to the first person who try to be funny with you. You are selective in the choice of your friends, and have a low tolerance for the superflous (extra) types. Your tongue-lashing (attack) is generally in a soft hissing tone for when you scream, your voice tends to get shrill and loud and you do hate drawing attention to yourself! When upset, you are angrier with yourself for having shown weakness, for the last thing that Scorpio wants to show is being out of control.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS NOVEMBER 22 Â– DECEMBER 20<br><br>You are insensible and generally have no complete control over your emotions. You do get angry quickly and others marvel at your anger levels even when provoked. Actually, you get tongue-tied when angry and you will remove your anger waiting for the other person to calm down. Then you will reason with your opponent and convince the other person in a very gentle manner that the whole thing was just his mistake. YouÂ’re also likely to totally sever ties with someone when youÂ’re upset with them.<br><br>CAPRICORN DECEMBER 21 Â– JANUARY 19<br><br>Few will believe that a hardcore practical and materialistic person like you is capable of sensitivity and genuine emotions. You project a hard exterior but are actually very sensitive, a trait you successfully hide from others. You can see thing with anger but will not betray your feelings. But then, there are times that even you cannot control your temper. Under such circumstances you can shout and scream, more with frustration at the situation than with anger at any particular person. Your outbursts can shock others and can make them feel guilty too.<br><br>AQUARIUS JANUARY 20 Â– FEBRUARY 18<br><br>You are noble and kind and dislike losing control over yur emotions. It is very rare for you to get angry. You are also the pacifier in situations that involve arguments. It is always your endeavour to be perfect and socially correct in your behaviour and attitude, but if misunderstood and slighted you can give in to an angry outburst. You will shout and scream and then walk out from the scene. You cannot easily forget the situation and will be bitter about it for a long time.<br><br>PISCES FEBRUARY 19 Â– MARCH 20<br><br>The only thing that can be said about you dreamers is that you appear even more attractive when angry. You are very sensitive to othersÂ’ feelings, so you rarely hurt them. But when others tend to hurt you, then things take a nasty turn. You will yell and use harsh words and feel inclined to shake everything and everyone up. Your creative imagination is at its best when angry, and you tend to get pretty dramatic. When upset, you refuse to listen to reason and wish to be left alone. But once you calm down, you repent your tantrums and seek forgiveness. SO nobody can be upset with you for too long.</div>
