              <p>How would you like to have this as your Internet <a href="http://freedom.ws/?language=english&amp;sponsor=zh110110">Address</a>? </p>
              <p>The domain industry is exploding! Industry experts predict that over 500 Million domains will be active annually within the next ten years.</p>
              <p>Before you can start up a business - any business - customers need to be able to find you. On the Internet, your address is your domain name; the part of an Internet address that comes after the www. With the unparalleled growth of the Internet, dot com domain names continue to sell like hotcakes. Currently, there are more than 20 million dot com domains, and over 34 million total domains registered worldwide. Industry experts forecast that more than 500 million domains will be registered in the next ten years. In fact, reliable sources from companies like Intel are predicting that every personal computer in the future will have its own domain name.</p>
              <p>Why Do You Want A Web Site?<br>You can establish a professional, trusted image by having a Web site. An online presence can perform many functions to help support your business, and all of them should incorporate the following three top-level goals:</p>
              <p>Enhanced Customer Service. The Web offers unprecedented ways to improve service to your customers. You can give buyers the ability to check the status of their orders or accounts, and to handle transactions electronically anytime. Customer loyalty can be enhanced through interactive discussions and surveys designed to assess public reactions and gather honest feedback about products and services. FAQs and e-mail can reduce the volume, and therefore the expense, of toll-free calls. If you sell products online, you can use e-mail to confirm orders.</p>
              <p>Reduced Sales and Marketing Costs. Online operating manuals and troubleshooting guides can reduce telephone time and streamline operating efficiency. You can provide information on special offers without incurring the cost of brochures, direct mail, long-distance charges, travel or other business expenses. You can stretch your marketing dollars by including your Web address on print materials targeting potential customers. If your site is designed to process orders, you can make sales around-the-clock, seven days a week, regardless of staffing levels and without the extra costs of toll-free telephone lines, regional sales offices or distribution centers.</p>
              <p>Opening New Markets. A Web site allows you to explore new ways to sell your products. Wholesalers can open a retail channel (provided their own retailers don’t object), and local businesses can tap into national and international markets that were previously out of reach.</p>
              <p>Global Domains International, Inc. is the worldwide domain name registry for all .ws (Dot WS) domain names. Our product is an incredible $10 per month package that includes your own domain name, hosting accounts, and up to ten email accounts, plus an easy-to-use online web site builder that will allow you to get a professional looking web site on the web as quickly as possible. And the best thing is, you can try out everything we have to offer, starting today, for <a href="http://freedom.ws/?language=english&amp;sponsor=zh110110">FREE</a>.</p>
