              <p><strong>Denial</strong> is a <a title="Defense mechanism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_mechanism">defense mechanism</a> in which a person is faced with a fact that is too painful to accept
              and rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may
              be overwhelming <a title="Evidence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence">evidence</a>.
              The subject may deny the reality of the unpleasant fact altogether
              (simple denial), admit the fact but deny its seriousness (minimisation)
              or admit both the fact and seriousness but deny <a title="Moral responsibility" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_responsibility">responsibility</a> (<a title="Transference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference">transference</a>). The concept of denial is particularly important to the study of <a title="Addiction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction">addiction</a>.</p>
              <p>The theory of denial was first researched seriously by <a title="Anna Freud" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Freud">Anna Freud</a>. She classified denial as a mechanism of the <a title="Immaturity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaturity">immature</a> mind, because it conflicts with the ability to learn from and cope with
              reality. Where denial occurs in mature minds, it is most often
              associated with <a title="Death" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death">death</a>, <a title="Dying" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying">dying</a> and <a title="Rape" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape">rape</a>. More recent research has significantly expanded the scope and utility of the concept. <a title="Elisabeth Kübler-Ross" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_K%C3%BCbler-Ross">Elisabeth Kübler-Ross</a> used denial as the first of <a title="Kübler-Ross model" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model">five stages in the psychology of a dying patient</a>,
              and the idea has been extended to include the reactions of survivors to
              news of a death. Thus, when parents are informed of the death of a
              child, their first reaction is often of the form, "No! You must have
              the wrong house, you can't mean our child!"</p>
              <p>Unlike some other defense mechanisms postulated by <a title="Psychoanalysis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis">psychoanalytic theory</a> (for instance, <a title="Psychological repression" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_repression">repression</a>),
              the general existence of denial is fairly easy to verify, even for
              non-specialists. On the other hand, denial is one of the most
              controversial defense mechanisms, since it can be easily used to create
              <a title="Unfalsifiable" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfalsifiable">unfalsifiable</a> theories: anything the subject says or does that appears to disprove
              the interpreter's theory is explained, not as evidence that the
              interpreter's theory is wrong, but as the subject's being "in denial".</p>
              <p>A commonly-cited example of spurious denial is the psychologist who
              insists, against all evidence, that his patient is homosexual: any
              attempt by the patient to disprove the theory (as by pointing out his
              strong desire for women) is evidence of denial and thus evidence of the
              underlying theory. This tension can become serious, especially in areas
              such as <a title="Child abuse" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse">child abuse</a> and <a title="Repressed memory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressed_memory">recovered memory</a>. Proponents often respond to allegations of <a title="False memory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory">false memory</a> by asserting that the subjects are genuine victims who have reverted to
              denial. Critics reply (some seriously, some less so) that it is the
              proponents who are in denial about the tenuousness of their theories.</p>
              <p>The concept of denial is important in <a title="Twelve-step program" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program">twelve-step programs</a>,
              where the abandonment or reversal of denial forms the basis of the
              first, fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth steps. The ability to deny or
              minimize is an essential part of what enables an addict to continue his
              or her behavior in the face of evidence that, to an outsider, appears
              overwhelming. This is cited as one of the reasons that compulsion is
              seldom effective in treating addiction — the habit of denial remains.</p>
              <p>Understanding and avoiding denial is also important in the treatment of various diseases. The <a title="American Heart Association" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association">American Heart Association</a> cites denial as a principal reason that treatment of a <a title="Myocardial infarction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction">heart attack</a> is delayed. Because the symptoms are so varied, and often have other
              potential explanations, the opportunity exists for the patient to deny
              the emergency, often with fatal consequences. It is common for patients
              to delay mammograms or other tests because of a fear of cancer, even
              though this is clearly maladaptive. It is the responsibility of the
              care team, and of the nursing staff in particular, to train at-risk
              patients to avoid such behavior.</p>

              <h2><span class="mw-headline"></span></h2>
              <p><strong>Denial of fact</strong>: This form of denial is where someone avoids a
              fact by lying. This lying can take the form of an outright falsehood
              (commission), leaving out certain details in order to tailor a story
              (omission), or by falsely agreeing to something (assent, also referred
              to as "yesing" behavior). Someone who is in denial of fact is typically
              using lies in order to avoid facts that they think may be potentially
              painful to themselves or others.</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of responsibility</strong>: This form of denial involves
              avoiding personal responsibility by blaming, minimizing or justifying.
              Blaming is a direct statement shifting culpability and may overlap with
              denial of fact. Minimizing is an attempt to make the effects or results
              of an action appear to be less harmful than they may actually be.
              Justifying is when someone takes a choice and attempts to make that
              choice look okay due to their perception of what is "right" in a
              situation. Someone using denial of responsibility is usually attempting
              to avoid potential harm or pain by shifting attention away from
              themselves.</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of impact</strong>: Denial of impact involves a person avoiding
              thinking about or understanding the harms their behavior have caused to
              themselves or others. By doing this, that person is able to avoid
              feeling a sense of guilt and it can prevent that person from developing
              remorse or empathy for others. Denial of impact reduces or eliminates a
              sense of pain or harm from poor decisions.</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of awareness</strong>: This type of denial is best discussed by looking at the concept of state dependent learning<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial#_note-0">[1]</a></sup>.
              People using this type of denial will avoid pain and harm by stating
              they were in a different state of awareness (such as alcohol or drug
              intoxication or on occasion mental health related). This type of denial
              often overlaps with denial of responsibility.</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of cycle</strong>: Many who use this type of denial will say
              things such as, "it just happened." Denial of cycle is where a person
              avoids looking at their decisions leading up to an event or does not
              consider their pattern of decision making and how harmful behavior is
              repeated. The pain and harm being avoided by this type of denial is
              more of the effort needed to change the focus from a singular event to
              looking at preceding events. It can also serve as a way to blame or
              justify behavior (see above).</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of denial</strong>: This can be a difficult concept for many
              people to identify in themselves, but is a major barrier to changing
              hurtful behaviors. Denial of denial involves thoughts, actions and
              behaviors which bolster confidence that nothing needs to be changed in
              one's personal behavior. This form of denial typically overlaps with
              all of the other forms of denial, but involves more self-delusion.</p>

              <p><strong>Denial</strong> is a <a title="Defense mechanism" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_mechanism">defense mechanism</a> in which a
              person is faced with a fact that is too painful to accept and
              rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may
              be overwhelming <a title="Evidence" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence">evidence</a>. The subject may deny
              the reality of the unpleasant fact altogether (simple denial),
              admit the fact but deny its seriousness (minimisation) or admit
              both the fact and seriousness but deny <a title="Moral responsibility" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_responsibility">responsibility</a> (<a title="Transference" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference">transference</a>). The concept of denial is
              particularly important to the study of <a title="Addiction" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction">addiction</a>.</p>
              <p>The theory of denial was first researched seriously by <a title="Anna Freud" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Freud">Anna Freud</a>. She classified denial as a mechanism of
              the <a title="Immaturity" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaturity">immature</a> mind, because it conflicts
              with the ability to learn from and cope with reality. Where denial
              occurs in mature minds, it is most often associated with <a title="Death" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death">death</a>, <a title="Dying" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying">dying</a> and <a title="Rape" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape">rape</a>. More recent research has significantly
              expanded the scope and utility of the concept. <a title="Elisabeth K&amp;uuml;bler-Ross" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_K%C3%BCbler-Ross">Elisabeth
              Kübler-Ross</a> used denial as the first of <a title="K&amp;uuml;bler-Ross model" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model">five stages in the
              psychology of a dying patient</a>, and the idea has been extended
              to include the reactions of survivors to news of a death. Thus,
              when parents are informed of the death of a child, their first
              reaction is often of the form, "No! You must have the wrong house,
              you can't mean our child!"</p>
              <p>Unlike some other defense mechanisms postulated by <a title="Psychoanalysis" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis">psychoanalytic theory</a> (for
              instance, <a title="Psychological repression" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_repression">repression</a>), the
              general existence of denial is fairly easy to verify, even for
              non-specialists. On the other hand, denial is one of the most
              controversial defense mechanisms, since it can be easily used to
              create <a title="Unfalsifiable" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfalsifiable">unfalsifiable</a> theories: anything
              the subject says or does that appears to disprove the interpreter's
              theory is explained, not as evidence that the interpreter's theory
              is wrong, but as the subject's being "in denial".</p>
              <p>A commonly-cited example of spurious denial is the psychologist
              who insists, against all evidence, that his patient is homosexual:
              any attempt by the patient to disprove the theory (as by pointing
              out his strong desire for women) is evidence of denial and thus
              evidence of the underlying theory. This tension can become serious,
              especially in areas such as <a title="Child abuse" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse">child abuse</a> and <a title="Repressed memory" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressed_memory">recovered memory</a>. Proponents
              often respond to allegations of <a title="False memory" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory">false memory</a> by asserting that the subjects are
              genuine victims who have reverted to denial. Critics reply (some
              seriously, some less so) that it is the proponents who are in
              denial about the tenuousness of their theories.</p>
              <p>The concept of denial is important in <a title="Twelve-step program" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program">twelve-step programs</a>,
              where the abandonment or reversal of denial forms the basis of the
              first, fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth steps. The ability to deny
              or minimize is an essential part of what enables an addict to
              continue his or her behavior in the face of evidence that, to an
              outsider, appears overwhelming. This is cited as one of the reasons
              that compulsion is seldom effective in treating addiction — the
              habit of denial remains.</p>
              <p>Understanding and avoiding denial is also important in the
              treatment of various diseases. The <a title="American Heart Association" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association">American Heart
              Association</a> cites denial as a principal reason that treatment
              of a <a title="Myocardial infarction" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction">heart attack</a> is
              delayed. Because the symptoms are so varied, and often have other
              potential explanations, the opportunity exists for the patient to
              deny the emergency, often with fatal consequences. It is common for
              patients to delay mammograms or other tests because of a fear of
              cancer, even though this is clearly maladaptive. It is the
              responsibility of the care team, and of the nursing staff in
              particular, to train at-risk patients to avoid such behavior.</p>
              <p><a id="Types_of_Denial" rel="nofollow" name="Types_of_Denial"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Denial of fact</strong>: This form of denial is where
              someone avoids a fact by lying. This lying can take the form of an
              outright falsehood (commission), leaving out certain details in
              order to tailor a story (omission), or by falsely agreeing to
              something (assent, also referred to as "yesing" behavior). Someone
              who is in denial of fact is typically using lies in order to avoid
              facts that they think may be potentially painful to themselves or
              others.</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of responsibility</strong>: This form of denial
              involves avoiding personal responsibility by blaming, minimizing or
              justifying. Blaming is a direct statement shifting culpability and
              may overlap with denial of fact. Minimizing is an attempt to make
              the effects or results of an action appear to be less harmful than
              they may actually be. Justifying is when someone takes a choice and
              attempts to make that choice look okay due to their perception of
              what is "right" in a situation. Someone using denial of
              responsibility is usually attempting to avoid potential harm or
              pain by shifting attention away from themselves.</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of impact</strong>: Denial of impact involves a
              person avoiding thinking about or understanding the harms their
              behavior have caused to themselves or others. By doing this, that
              person is able to avoid feeling a sense of guilt and it can prevent
              that person from developing remorse or empathy for others. Denial
              of impact reduces or eliminates a sense of pain or harm from poor
              decisions.</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of awareness</strong>: This type of denial is
              best discussed by looking at the concept of state dependent
              learning<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial#_note-0">[1]</a></sup>. People using this type of denial will
              avoid pain and harm by stating they were in a different state of
              awareness (such as alcohol or drug intoxication or on occasion
              mental health related). This type of denial often overlaps with
              denial of responsibility.</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of cycle</strong>: Many who use this type of
              denial will say things such as, "it just happened." Denial of cycle
              is where a person avoids looking at their decisions leading up to
              an event or does not consider their pattern of decision making and
              how harmful behavior is repeated. The pain and harm being avoided
              by this type of denial is more of the effort needed to change the
              focus from a singular event to looking at preceding events. It can
              also serve as a way to blame or justify behavior (see above).</p>
              <p><strong>Denial of denial</strong>: This can be a difficult
              concept for many people to identify in themselves, but is a major
              barrier to changing hurtful behaviors. Denial of denial involves
              thoughts, actions and behaviors which bolster confidence that
              nothing needs to be changed in one's personal behavior. This form
              of denial typically overlaps with all of the other forms of denial,
              but involves more self-delusion.</p>
