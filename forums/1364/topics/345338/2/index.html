              <p><br>Verdasco's a one-off - Gonzalez, Schuettler, Baghdatis and Tsonga have all been there over the last couple of years and none of them has come anywhere close to reproducing the sort of form in subsequent years.</p>
              <p>Anyway, expect Nadal's efforts against Verdasco to be punished big time tomorrow - Federer to win in 4, at most.</p>

              <p><br>Go through the stats and you might get a more concise picture of the absurdity in your point.</p>
              <p>Gonzalez, Schuettler, Baghdatis, Tsonga were all former finalists at the Aussie Open and they haven't come anywhere close to recapturing the sort of form at any Slam since (mind, they are all easily in their mid to late twenties with one already in his thirties). So, is it all that hard to imagine Verdasco - who is making his first SF at a slam at the tender age of 25 <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> - shouldn't be cast in the same light?</p>
              <p>Putting it bluntly, Verdasco (if you have been watching his tennis over the last few years) isn't even in the league of the Roddicks, Hewitts or Safins who were consistent quarter and semi-finalists at the major slams.</p>
              <p>Mind, if the precedence of the names I mentioned is anything to go by, all 4 of them were comfortably top 10 players in their prime (rather, when they had the run of their careers) and Verdasco has only just cracked the top 10 (he's 9th now) at 25. Now, how any parallels you can draw between Verdasco (taking the argument he hasn't had sufficient time to prove himself) and Federer/Nadal (Federer had amassed 8 Slams by 25; Nadal has 6 at 22) is simply beyond me...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The only Slam I haven't been to is the French Open, so for me, I'd say Aussie and US Open are similar in style in terms of the fanfare and carnival-like atmosphere, which is great for the fans. I'd say the Aussie and US Open are probably more contemporary and would appeal more to fans who are just looking for some fun on a good day out. They'd probably appeal more to the casual fan who doesn't know or care as much about the game as simply basking in the resplendent atmosphere of being there.</p>
              <p>That said, I'd say Wimbledon stands out for me simply because of the whole culture about the place which is very much built in the tradition of what the game is really about - looking beyond the all-white attire players are required to don, it certainly smacks of a certain romanticism in terms of how close fans are to the action on Centre Court and the respect accorded to the players and game at large (for starters, you don't frequently get nutcases shouting in the middle of a point disrupting play in the process), among other things. Call me a traditionalist if you would, but I just find it ridiculous for tennis fans to behave in the way you'd expect of a football crowd.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, I'd liken going to Wimbledon to watching football in England where fans have almost unrivalled access to the action compared to what is on offer in most parts of continental Europe where fans actually watch the action miles away behind fences/barriers.</p>
              <p>Incidentally, I was at the Aussie Open the year Baghdatis made the final (think it was 2006) and some of his matches were ridiculous looking at how much his crowd (I mean those folks sitting inside the players' box) got away with - you could be forgiven for thinking you were actually watching a game of football, rather than tennis.</p>

              <p><br>No taking anything away from Nadal - Federer blew it in the decider and Nadal deserved his win big time. Funnily, I think the psychological blow Nadal dealt Federer at Wimbledon last year was enduring - for once, he clearly sent the message to Federer that he was more than just a threat on clay.</p>
              <p>While I'd still dearly like to see Federer recover from this to eclipse Sampras' record of 14 Slams (I still regard Federer as the most naturally gifted tennis player whose game offers the most aesthetically-pleasing and elegant touches I have ever seen), it'd be interesting to see how Federer recovers from this latest setback.</p>
              <p>All said and done, just like any other sport, Nadal-Federer's rivalry can only be good for the game...</p>

              <p>Absurdity?  I think you seriously need to take a chill pill.  I normally respect your opinion, but if you're going to be a jerk about it, blather on all you want because you'll just be talking to the hand.</p>
              <p>You would do well to conduct a position check, my lad.  This is the University of Crappology - stodginess and sanctimony are not the order of the day round these here parts.</p>

              <p>Get a grip and talk to your hand then if it helps. You're making as much sense as a toddler with your Verdasco garb.</p>
              <p>So what's next on the cards? The University of Crappology espouses and embraces ingenius and creative propositions like Verdasco completing the Grand Slam on the back of his Aussie Open performance?</p>

              <p><strong>You</strong> get a grip.  Do a Larry King on David Letterman and someone's gonna tell you to pull that stick out your arse and stop making a fool of yourself. This forum's for chilling (or did you think Crappology was a bona fide field of study, moron?) and not trying to impress anyone with your wealth of useless knowledge.  If you're so desperate to show off what little knowledge you have in as inappropriate a context as the present one, sheesh, son, you really do need to get a life. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Get it, or do you really need to pull that stick out your arse, you starched self-important twat?</p>
              <p>I'm done with you.  Go find some kid to impress with your anal wannabe ramblings, cause I've got better things to do with my time than listen to some never-was regurgitate the sports page. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>Morons don't come bigger than you, do they? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> So what are you bragging about, nincompoop? Gone to your first tennis tourny on corporate tickets and pretend to know bags about the game and the players? Which planet have you been on, really? To liken your brand of silly comedy to the slapstick of Letterman is pretty much an insult to the dullest minds around - have you seen Letterman espousing criminally laughable bullshit in the mould of witnessing snow in the summer? Amazing you'd even liken your Verdasco garb to pass off as crap fit for rational consumption. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Talking to your hands and getting a life might just do your rather limited mental faculty a world of good - so much for chilling! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> In the meantime, mugging that tennis encyclopedia might actually do wonders for starters to boost your rather pathetic knowledge of a sport which seems to do wonders in further fuelling your anal inaptitude at comprehending your awe-inspiring folly.</p>
              <p>So, what's new? Come back after getting a grip on your drivel with something more salient than "reserving comments" on Verdasco on the back of your first ever corporate excursion to a Slam (bet it must have been as memorable as your pre-school trip to the zoo...pathetic, isn't it?) - maybe, just maybe, you'd have more than just your hands to talk to then. </p>
              <p>In the meantime, enjoy your delusional ramblings fit for a foolish wannabe (and enjoy selling your spin to a few ignorant souls) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
