              <p><span style="color: #333399;">What’s a savvier investment decision in this economic climate: A masterpiece 
              or contemporary art painting? By Ramesh William</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/458/6-opinion.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Auctions at Sotheby’s, the world’s largest auction house, are often 
              jaw dropping affairs. The well-heeled art buyers it attracts are known to drop 
              more than a few dozen million without batting an eyelid—in the good old days, at 
              least. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        So last November, eyebrows were swiftly raised when a Vincent van 
              Gogh painting drew no bids at all at a New York auction. The eye popping figure 
              of zero bids drew gasps of breath from art observers and art experts alike. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        For it was indeed a sign of the times; high-end art collectors keeping 
              their checkbooks firmly against their breast pocket, causing the art market to 
              plummet. But in the oft-mysterious world of art, a drop in demand doesn’t 
              automatically mean that a drop in valuation will immediately follow. In plain 
              English: Just because the estimated $45 million Van Gogh didn’t sell, doesn’t 
              mean you can have it for a couple of million. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        But say you have a bit of 
              spare cash (yes, a cool couple of million will do nicely, thank you very much) 
              lying around and you’d like to buy some art, what would be the better choice for 
              you: Contemporary art from painters like Chinese Pop Art contemporary Feng 
              Zhengjie and modern day renaissance men like Julian Schnabel, or masterpieces 
              from the likes of Pablo Picasso or Henri Matisse?  <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        Well, the jury is still 
              out on this. According to Stephane Le Pelletier, Director of Asia-Pacific for 
              Opera Gallery here in Singapore, it remains to be seen whether the prices of 
              masterpieces will drop in the near run, making them an attractive target for 
              potential newbie art investors. “There are many factors that determine the price 
              of a masterpiece,” he says. “The main question now for masterpieces is whether 
              demand (and price) for these works of art will contract in view of the new 
              economic climate.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        Le Pelletier also debunks the myth that the price of 
              masterpieces are beyond the reach of the Average Joe, pointing out that, “the 
              price range of masterpieces vary from anything at a few thousand dollars to a 
              six, seven figure sum.” While it may be moot to speculate by just how much 
              masterpieces are falling (if at all) in value, the Opera Gallery director notes 
              that now is a definitely a good time to look for rare works, with several 
              bargains thrown in the mix. “With some collectors putting their artworks for 
              sale at attractive prices, it’s a good time for new buyers to consider entering 
              the market,” he adds.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        While contemporary art, especially Chinese 
              contemporary art, has been all the rage in the region in recent times, Le 
              Pelletier offers the following advice to those still unsure which way to turn. 
              “Masterpieces by artists like Matisse, Chagall and Picasso will always be 
              considered the ‘blue chips’ of fine art,” he says. “Their value will always 
              stand the test of time.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        “Masterpiece paintings are conferred this title for 
              many reasons—collectors recognize and appreciate the value of these artists, and 
              for good reason. It is difficult to give a figure of expected appreciation, but 
              the values of these art works usually endure all sorts of economic ups and 
              downs.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        While contemporary art has its legions of followers, Le Pelletier 
              feels the inherent strengths of the masterpieces instantly give them an edge 
              over avant-garde, more contemporary rivals; the obvious edge being the 
              rarity<br>of works by masterpiece painters and yes, their rather timeless 
              quality. “Matisse is the past, while Feng Zhengjie is the present,” he says. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        Another aspect to consider when buying art is to ask oneself whether it is 
              solely for investment purposes or for an aesthetic appreciation. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        “If this 
              is purely an investment call, it would be best to be prudent and look out for 
              the good pieces expected to flow into the market in times like this,” says Le 
              Pelletier. “However, art without love and a sense of appreciation would be 
              meaningless; so always buy pieces that speak to you.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        But it’s all not 
              doom in gloom in the art world. We’ve been mostly discussing about paintings 
              here—without pointing to the fact that contemporary artworks, be they in the 
              form of sculptures and art installations, are seemingly recession proof and 
              doing well. Jeff Koon’s sculpture “Stacked” was bought in 1997 for $375,000 and 
              is now being offered a cool $4.5million for it. Meanwhile, Damien Hirst sold 
              more than $270 million dollars worth of his “stuff” (artworks like his famous 
              dissected sharks and cows) via Sotheby’s last year—and said that contemporary 
              art was getting too expensive. Yeah, right. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        So what do outrageous numbers 
              like those mentioned above mean to the average punter looking for some choice 
              investment picks or simply searching for a tasteful, classy piece for his living 
              room wall? <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">        Well, it means that the art market isn’t completely on its 
              knees yet. Buying and selling aside, most are just watching, waiting and 
              studying the market. With a host of resources online, from blogs to forums to 
              the financial pages, you may only be a tip or two away from snagging that 
              masterpiece or a cool contemporary for a steal. Both have their merits in the 
              art market. So keep your eyes peeled.</span></p>
