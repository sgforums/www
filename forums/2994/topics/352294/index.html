              <p>THE National Art Gallery (NAG), which is slated to open in 2013, will be run as a company, similar to Singapore's most iconic artistic building, The Esplanade.</p>
              <p>The gallery will have full operational autonomy and its own board, to allow it the necessary flexibility to be a nimble and effective organisation. However, it will still be established under The National Heritage Board (NHB).</p>
              <p>Such an arrangement, explained Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts Lui Tuck Yew yesterday, would ensure 'accountability for its performance, financial discipline and responsible management'.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui, who is also Senior Minister of State for Education, was announcing the incorporation of the gallery. He also gave an update on key NAG appointments.</p>
              <p>'Over a period of a year, the search committee went over 170 resumes of local and international candidates, and eventually interviewed a shortlist of six.'</p>
              <p>The committee also recommended that a CEO set the direction and focus for the gallery, and a director to provide curatorial expertise. It then recommended that the posts be filled by NHB chief executive Michael Koh and Singapore Art Museum director Kwok Kian Chow respectively. The government has accepted its recommendations.</p>
              <p>On his wearing of two hats, Mr Koh said that there is unlikely to be a conflict of interest since both the gallery and NHB have shared visions and goals.</p>
              <p>Also, the gallery will have its own board, which Mr Lui has asked the search committee's head, Koh Seow Chuan, to chair.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui said that the gallery would be a vibrant civic and creative space accessible to everyone. 'In our plans, we intend to create several spaces where visitors will enjoy free access.'</p>
              <p>These include the Singapore Art Gallery, which will showcase Singapore art and its rich heritage, and a Children's Museum, for school children and families. There will also be a large rooftop plaza with many public spaces, with restaurants, art installations and public programmes.</p>
              <p>With a vision for the gallery to be an endearing place for Singaporeans as well as a successful visual arts venue, Mr Lui hopes that NAG would emulate The Esplanade and be recognised as one of the top art galleries and 'do the same or more for the visual arts in Singapore'.</p>
