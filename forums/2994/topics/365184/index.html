              <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">June 12, 2009</span></strong><span style="color: #800000;"> -- Leonardo da Vinci, in a Renaissance version 
              of Mad Magazine, may have painted his famous Mona Lisa in a number of ways, 
              including nude. Now, a painting has surfaced that looks much like the original, 
              sparking debate over just how far the master took his iconic painting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The newly revealed painting, hidden for almost a century within the wood wall 
              of a private library, shows a portrait of a half-naked woman with clear links to 
              the famous (and clothed) Mona Lisa. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The work, which documents suggest was at least based on never-seen similar work by Da 
              Vinci, is now on exhibit at the Museo Ideale in the Tuscan town of Vinci, where Da Vinci was 
              born in 1452.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The lady in the portrait does not exactly resemble the original Mona Lisa, 
              but there is little doubt it has parallels with the painting hanging at the 
              Louvre museum in Paris.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"The frontal look, the position of the hands, the spatial conception of the 
              landscape, with columns at the sides, show a clear link with the Mona Lisa's 
              iconographic theme," Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the museum, told Discovery 
              News.</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The naked portrait once belonged to Napoleon's uncle, Cardinal Joseph Fesch 
              (1763-1839) and was ensconced within the wood walls of Fesch's private library 
              for nearly a century, before trading more hands within the Napolean family. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">An art lover, the Cardinal owned an impressive collection of artworks, 
              including Da Vinci's "St. Jerome" (now in the Vatican gallery), which he 
              discovered in pieces in the Roman shops of a second-hand dealer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">A note dating to 1845 records that the Cardinal bought "the portrait of the 
              Mona Lisa, mistress of Francis I, by Leonardo da Vinci," from the Rospigliosis, 
              a rich aristocratic Roman family.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">After changing hands at the death of the Cardinal, the portrait was possibly 
              bought by Napoleon III, and finally landed in the private collection of Count 
              Giuseppe Primoli, a descendant of Luciano Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">The documentation from the painting's original purchase is not enough to 
              verify the work is by Da Vinci, himself. The nude portrait will now undergo 
              scientific and artistic investigations in an attempt to date the work and 
              determine its author. Even if it is not by Da Vinci (and it likely isn't, 
              experts say), it may be based on a lost original by the artist himself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"I think it is very likely that Leonardo da Vinci conceived a naked Mona 
              Lisa," leading Da Vinci scholar Carlo Pedretti, director of the Armand Hammer 
              Center for Leonardo Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles, told 
              Discovery News.</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Indeed, several other claims of unclothed Mona Lisas have been 
              made over the years, pointing to the theory that Da Vinci might have had fun 
              with the famous image he had created around 1503-1506. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"There are at least six nude version which are very close to Da Vinci's hand. 
              All are attributed to the Da Vinci school. The most likely scenario is that his 
              followers got inspired by a now-lost original," Vezzosi said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">According to Vezzosi, the original naked Mona might have been part of a 
              series of erotic portraits by Da Vinci and his pupils, which were never really 
              shown because they were considered inappropriate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Called "Monna Vanna," the topless versions of the Mona Lisa are indeed often 
              considered the portraits of a court mistress or prostitute.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Nevertheless, these paintings inspired nudes by other artists, including 
              Raphaello's 1518 portrait of his mistress, "The Baker Girl."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">"Our quest for naked Mona Lisas continues. We are now on the tracks of 
              another interesting version in Las Vegas," Vezzosi said.</span></p>
