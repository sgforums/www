              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Street art in Singapore has evolved to become 
              more than just spray paint on walls. Local artists here are getting more acclaim 
              than ever—taking their works out of the streets and into art galleries and the 
              corporate world. By <strong>Baey Shi Chen</strong> and <strong>Zaki 
              Jufri</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/458/7-9-Feature1.jpg" alt=""></strong></span></p>
              <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">
              <p>In 2005, a little known street artist who goes by the name of Banksy slipped 
              unnoticed into the Museum of Modern Art and art galleries in New York to mount 
              his own works among existing paintings as a way of poking fun at the fine art 
              establishment. Fast forward a few years later, the reclusive artist counts 
              celebrities like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as fans, with the couple 
              reportedly shelling out more than £1 million for his works. Likewise, local 
              street and graffiti artists here are getting more recognition than ever; some 
              have even held shows in art galleries and museums like the Singapore Art Museum 
              and Singapore Tyler Print Institute—albeit in a more legit way than Banksy, of 
              course. <br>  Corporations today also are embracing urban and street art, as are 
              fashion labels, media types and even club owners, as a way of reaching out to 
              the young and trendy. Belvedere Vodka recently flew French artist Andre in to 
              promote its new specially-designed vodka bottle, the Belvedere IX (see our 
              interview on p.10); while footwear brands like Adidas, Nike and Vans have 
              commissioned local street artists like Zero, Jahan Loh and The Killer Gerbil to 
              paint giant murals for their campaigns. <br>  Indeed, the local street art and 
              graffiti scene has come a long, long way. Gone are the days when these artists 
              and “taggers” were looked upon as hooligans or wayward kids—they are now 
              championed as serious artists doing caliber work. <em>I-S</em> presents street 
              artists whose works you simply must look out for—whether its on the streets, at 
              the galleries or even, on that bottle of beer or vodka.<br>  <br><strong>Street 
              Chic</strong><br>From the streets to the galleries, these individuals are taking 
              street art to newer heights.</p>
              <p><strong>Jahan Loh<br>Claim to Fame:</strong> Although this 32 year-old has 
              come a long way since his first gallery showing way back in 2002 at Utterly Art, 
              he’s still active out in the streets, spraying on the fly in between gallery 
              shows, guest painting stints and no stranger to attention—all kinds of it. <br>  
              “I always get into trouble, be it illegal graffiti throw-ups or my Cherry Pop 
              artworks in galleries,” says Loh. His ongoing Cherry Pop series of works which 
              looks like stylized erotica deals with the naked female form as a metaphor for 
              the shedding of social rank and the returning of the human being to a simpler 
              condition. <br>  Currently based in Taiwan, Loh has exhibited his works in 
              Singapore, Taipei, New York, Melbourne, Beijing, Seoul and Glasgow, and judging 
              from his art sales, it is safe to say that he is one of Singapore’s most 
              successful street artists to have made it to the galleries and auction houses. 
              One of his previous works for a 2006 exhibition at the Esplanade reportedly went 
              under the hammer for a whopping USD$25,000 at the Kingsley auction last year. 
              His Cherry Pop sculptures for his Taipei debut show last year were also sold for 
              USD$12,000 a pop. Not bad for someone who ran afoul with the law during his 
              youth for his art—something that he, like most street artists, considers a badge 
              of honor.<br><strong>Word Up:</strong> Loh is currently working on a new series 
              of works for a show in Beijing later this year which he says is a departure from 
              his earlier concepts. “The new series I am working on for my solo show in 
              Taiwant at Beijing 798 gallery is on the concept of ‘dead space,’ and how we 
              wander through this wilderness, in search for meaning in life,” he says. Loh 
              wishes to see more street artists like him make their mark out of Singapore at 
              the galleries; but not to forget their “outlaw” roots so as to strike a balance 
              in their work. “I think the whole spirit of street art is its borderline 
              criminal expression, and when legitimized, it’s like pulling the fangs out of a 
              wild tiger and putting it in a cage.”</p>
              <p><strong>Lip<br>Claim to Fame:</strong> Intrigued by the identity and style 
              that street art is able to achieve, Wong Lip Chin, a.k.a. Lip, became a street 
              artist four years ago and has rapidly made a name for himself. Other than 
              producing a body of work that includes distinctive images of genres such as 
              cartoons and sampled images juxtaposed against one another, the LASALLE College 
              of the Arts student has already chalked up a solo exhibition and a stint as 
              artist-in-residence at the Marina Mandarin hotel—all at the age of 22. Citing 
              artists such as Jeff Koons, Herakut, INSA, and Sc3L as influences, Lip describes 
              his style as “Realism fusing with flat-art,” and is interested in pushing the 
              technical aspects of aerosol.<br><strong>Word Up: </strong>“I did not categorize 
              myself as a street or graffiti artist when I started out as these are just terms 
              that limit your direction in making art. I would like to break boundaries in the 
              art world. My work is really organic—I started in the street, but I am zooming 
              in on the fine arts and conceptual art aspects now as there are so many more 
              things to explore and talk about. I would really like to create something 
              outside Singapore Parliament House. It’s never really crossed my mind how my 
              work will look like in 10 years, but I hope it’ll definitely be something in the 
              evening sales of Sotheby’s and Christie’s!” </p>
              <p><strong>Project Midas<br>Claim to Fame: </strong>Certainly one of the most 
              exciting developments in the street art scene here, Project Midas represents 
              what was sorely lacking in a scene that most artists say looks “promising” but 
              is still in its infancy. Started by street art aficionados Ken Tan and Jon Nah, 
              Project Midas is Singapore’s first ever company dedicated to increasing the 
              awareness of street art. Inspired by the art shows they attended during their 
              travels, the duo felt the need to promote a similar kind of appreciation back in 
              their region. “It was quite a natural progression for us as we collect art on 
              the side, which led to us establishing relationships with all the artists. So, 
              we thought, why not make a business out of it?” says Tan. The duo recently 
              organized a show for renowned British street artist Swifty at a gallery in 
              Melbourne in March this year and also put together another show at the Asylum 
              store featuring Melbourne’s leading artists Ghost Patrol and Nior.  
              <br><strong>Word Up: </strong>The boys recently held a party, Tagged, at Home 
              Club to officially launch Project Midas last weekend showcasing the best of what 
              local street and urban art has to offer. Artists involved include Scope One, 
              Mimer, JabaOne, Lip, Mojoko and Andy Yang. Next in the pipeline are a slew of 
              exhibitions in the region like the next Swifty show in Jakarta, a Delta (Dutch 
              street artist) show in Bangkok and something on a larger scale back in Singapore 
              next year.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>ZERO<br>Claim to Fame: </strong>With his masked Luchadore (Mexican 
              wrestler) characters that usually propagate his works, Zulkarnaen Othman a.k.a. 
              ZERO constantly tries to integrate and negotiate the function of design and 
              advertising within the framework of conceptual and traditional fine arts. The 
              Associate Artist for The Substation was shortlisted for the President’s Young 
              Artist Awards in 2005, and has shown in Jakarta, Shanghai and other various 
              street art events in Singapore. His most notable work to date was covering the 
              façade of the Singapore Art Museum in 2006 with his Luchadore characters.  
              <br><strong>Word Up: </strong>For his recent Pseudo Branding series of works 
              which he first showcased as part of his undergraduate work early this year, he 
              commented on the relationship between art and branding. “I attempted to come 
              across selling a logo attached with my brand name ZERO,” he says. “As what’s 
              going around in the world most of the time, a piece of work is highly valued 
              when there is a famous name attached to it. The works could look as kitsch as 
              (Takashi) Murakami’s, but with the famous name attached to it, suddenly it is 
              seen as an acclaimed piece of artwork. This is a satirical approach on how most 
              advertisements try to sell a certain lifestyle attached to their products while 
              not really explaining or selling what their product is really about.”</span></p>

              the corporate big boys. </span></p>
              <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">
              <p><strong>Eeshaun <br>Claim to Fame: </strong>Describing his work as 
              “free-form, improvised drawings of inhabitants in organic environments,” Soh Ee 
              Shaun, 28, a.k.a. Eeshaun, creates humorous and whimsical images comprising 
              flowing lines and rich swirls of color. Most notably, he has produced works for 
              the 11th Venice Biennale, Adidas Originals and was specially appointed by 
              Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) to create murals at Bishan station for the 
              upcoming Circle Line. Drawn to works with bright colors and illustrated in a 
              flat, simple 2D style, the artist, who also lectures at Republic Polytechnic, is 
              inspired by international artists Keith Haring, Chris Johanson and Jon 
              Burgerman.   <br><strong>Word Up: </strong>“Actually, much of my work is done at 
              home and not really on the street,” he says. “So most people might disagree that 
              it’s street art—although it might resemble what people understand as street art, 
              or graffiti or character art. I’d say its more Pop Art, or illustration. I think 
              the message I want to convey in my work is that everyone should enjoy life, be 
              happy, and not sweat the small stuff. I think street art in Singapore is headed 
              wherever the rest of the world is heading. I see it as a global movement, and 
              local artists must react very quickly to new styles that other countries 
              produce. I’d definitely like to see change in my work in 10 years. I hope I’ll 
              pick up a new skill like programming and maybe use new technology to design my 
              artwork.”    </p>
              <p><strong>The Killer Gerbil (KGB)   <br>Claim to Fame: </strong>Mustafah 
              Luthfi, 30, a.k.a. The Killer Gerbil (KGB), started creating graffiti art in 
              2003 by leaving stickers and painting artworks on recycled materials on the 
              streets. Inspired by pop culture, MTV, graphic design and errr, his dead pet 
              gerbils (you heard us right), KGB’s work is distinguished by repeated images of 
              his alter ego, whom he describes as “a street rat that kills empty spaces with 
              colors and forms.” A dominant figure in the local street art scene, KGB won the 
              Motorola Streetstyle Street’s Choice Award in 2005 and has created works for 
              events and exhibitions both locally and overseas. A recent collaboration with 
              Nike Singapore to celebrate the launch of the Nike Air Yeezy will see the 
              unveiling of a KGB mural at the flagship store in Wisma Atria in May. 
              <br><strong>Word Up:</strong> “I don’t have a habit of looking to another artist 
              for influence. I want to be original,” he says. I have definitely evolved in 
              style, form and color, because as an artist I am easily bored ... I feel that 
              locals are beginning to open up slowly but surely to this art form, and it’s 
              also good to know that some individuals are bringing street art into 
              institutions. I’ve been lucky that people actually enjoy and support my works. I 
              think street art will become how hip hop is at the present—everyone (and their 
              moms) will be doing it and this art form will be openly accepted by the 
              masses.”</p>
              <p><strong>Momorobo<br>Claim to Fame:</strong> Morris Lee, 27, the founder of 
              local multimedia design collective Momorobo, never had an education in art or 
              design. While not technically street art practitioners, Lee and his crew’s 
              (Eddie Yeo, Eric Lee and Meng Han) works lean to sensibilities which have their 
              roots in street and urban art. But that, however, has not stopped him from 
              steering the group towards becoming one of the leaders in the design industry. 
              With prestigious collaborations with companies such as Ministry of Sound, 
              Motorola, Adidas, The Butter Factory and Theatreworks just to name a few, Lee 
              loves to push clients’ aesthetic limits and always considers the next project 
              his key work. They were recently commissioned by Belvedere Vodka to create a 
              series of graffiti-inspired artworks. Citing artists like Richey Edwards and 
              Mark Rothko as well as local art directors Theseus Chan and Melvin Chee as 
              influences, Lee’s work aims to convey “the fragility of humanity and what I’m 
              going to have for lunch.”   <br><strong>Word Up:</strong> “Nothing much has 
              changed in the genre since I first started. Everything’s pretty much eye candy 
              still. Singaporeans have become accepting of street art as it’s certainly 
              mainstream now. Working with many global companies has led to artistic 
              compromises, but that’s only right because they are paying the bills. My work 
              has gone through several phases, so I guess it’s a ‘let’s try to round up 
              everything, throw it into a washing machine and see what I’ll get’ style. I try 
              not to think too much about my style and direction. I would love to skip the 
              evolution part and become something entirely different and unrecognizable 
              altogether.” </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Antz <br>Claim to fame: </strong>Anthony Chong, a.k.a. Antz, cut his 
              teeth in street art when he decided to move his art from the computer to a 
              platform with a bigger surface. In the three years he has been on the scene, 
              Antz has already amassed a portfolio of hip collaborations with global companies 
              Adidas, IdN, Converse, Nike, Taggerbags and MTV Asia. Describing his style as 
              East-meets-West, the 27 year-old’s work comprises illustrations of ideas 
              generated from everyday life, and also Chinese myths and Asian folklore 
              reimagined in a modern context. Antz counts fellow local artists Zero, The 
              Killer Gerbil, Jahan Loh and :phunkstudio as influences, and also admires 
              international artists Michael Lau, Jamie Hewlett and Banksy. He recently 
              collaborated with Momorobo for a live painting session for Belvedere Vodka 
              during its Belvedere Beat campaign.   <br><strong>Word Up: </strong>“I’m 
              inspired by anything and everything—it’s a matter of whether the ideas stay long 
              enough for me to pop them into my black book,” he says. “I think street art is 
              misunderstood in Singapore—we are not just artists who appear at events and do 
              only live art demos or create a cheaper option to replace expensive vinyl 
              stickers. It took us a long time to practice and explore the art form, and I 
              hope people will at least try to get to know a bit about it before they judge. I 
              would like to paint something as huge as one of the Suntec buildings. Actually, 
              I really want to paint on a jet plane.”    </span></p>

              <p><strong>Scope One<br>Claim to Fame:</strong> “Just imagine a wall somewhere. 
              It was plain white or pale grey the night before, but when you pass by it the 
              next day on your way to work, then BOOM! Someone did a massive explosive color 
              piece out of nowhere,” says Mazlan Ahmad a.k.a. Scope One excitedly about his 
              reasons for being a graffiti artist: To create without boundaries.  <br>  With 
              his old school “wild style” graffiti style of writing, the 33 year-old is one of 
              Singapore’s pioneering street artists. Scope One is also the artist responsible 
              for putting the country on the world graffiti/street art map when his works were 
              showcased on the infamous artcrimes.com website. Since then, the artist has been 
              honing his craft as a full-time graffiti artist here, doing both commissioned 
              and “un-commissioned” works, and participating in graffiti exhibitions here and 
              abroad, like the annual Singapore Street Festival. <br><strong>Word Up:</strong> Scope One was the second artist invited to paint a mural at the dbl-O Art Space 
              in February this year as part of the club’s efforts in nurturing the local urban 
              arts scene. As for future plans, he is also branching out into other aspects of 
              the scene which no doubt will further raise awareness of the burgeoning street 
              art scene here. <br>“I am going to do a book called Undaground Singapura. It’s a 
              book about Singapore’s graffiti scene, and I’m already planning to work on toys 
              with other artists, and also planning to curate solo shows or collaborations 
              with other artists,” he says.    </p>
              </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Speak Cryptic<br>Claim to Fame: </strong>Calling his works “text 
              interventions,” the artist known as Speak Cryptic has been peppering public 
              spaces with subversive messages seeking to prompt passersby to question the 
              world, and especially the institutions and space around him. “I’ve always been 
              interested in the human condition and the relationship between man and his 
              immediate environment,” he says. “This whole idea of trying to make the world a 
              better place is the ultimate intention, as cliché as that might sound.” With 
              that, the artist, who is also a member of local post-rock music outfit I Am 
              David Sparkle, only started plying his craft by chance on an outing with fellow 
              artist The Killer Gerbil in 2005, when he began tagging the town with his 
              stickers with messages like “Make Up Your Mind And Leave” or “Breathe In 
              Moderation.” “I want people to question the things around them and by leaving 
              stickers, signs, posters and paintings behind, it is my hope that society at 
              large will be as curious as cats and start questioning.” <br><strong>Word 
              Up:</strong> “I never stick around long enough to find out,” says Speak Cryptic, 
              when asked about reactions to his works. “I have no idea how people react and I 
              guess in that regard, it would seem kind of pointless to keep putting out works 
              back onto the streets, especially since street art in itself is all about 
              interaction with the public.” <br></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><br><strong>Where to get your dose of street art (other than the

              <p><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Well regarded graffiti artist Andre Saraiva recently collaborated with 
              Belvedere vodka to launch its premium version, Belvedere IX. We caught up with 
              this cool cat when he was in town for Belvedere Beat 2009. By Ramesh 
              William</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/458/10-11-Feat2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Best known for his iconic street art figure Monsieur A, graffitist Andre 
              Saraiva wears many—pretty cool—hats. Part nightlife entrepreneur, part 
              anti-establishment artist, part fashion designer and part occasional filmmaker, 
              Saraiva, 35, was at the fore of the street art movement in Europe during the mid 
              ‘80s and still continues to break artistic molds today. A rabid partygoer, who 
              owns nightclubs on three continents, he shares his thoughts on the sidelines of 
              last month’s Belvedere Beat 2009 in Singapore. <br></span><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>How did you start 
              and how did you develop your style? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>I started in 1985, which was 
              around the beginning of the graffiti movement in Europe. We had no magazines or 
              the Internet then to study styles coming out of America, so we had to develop 
              our own styles. And as result most old school European street artists have a 
              distinctive style that’s quite different from the streets of urban America. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Did you have any weird childhood ambitions? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Nope. I was 
              only good at drawing, so I knew I was going to be an artist. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Your trademark image and alter ego is Monsieur A. What is it that 
              compels you about this image, and do you think of it as your “brand”? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Nobody was using character-based depictions in street art circles 
              back then. So I created something which would be recognized, understood and 
              appreciated by people from all walks of life—the young, old, rich, poor and even 
              people who hated street art. I don’t think of Monsieur A as a brand, because 
              that has a corporate ring to it; I’ve never looked at what I do as a career. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">You were born in Sweden, spent your teens in Paris, live in New York 
              and have business interests in Tokyo. How have these places shaped your 
              art?</span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>My work is very urban and like any artist, I use cities, people 
              and pop culture as references. While cities are my canvas, I also use buildings 
              to understand how best to evolve my art; because when you do graffiti, you 
              educate your eye to look at the form and shape of buildings and ask how best to 
              use them. <br></span><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>So, would you consider yourself French? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Not particularly. But I would consider myself a Parisian. It’s the 
              city which has had the biggest impression on my life and art. It has a 
              seductively easygoing vibe: You can sit at the café, while away your afternoon 
              with a newspaper and let the streets entertain you. Plus it’s beautiful—c’mon, 
              we artists dig beauty. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">What do you feel about a place like Singapore, which offers only 
              limited, and controlled, spaces to create street art? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>The true 
              spirit of street art thrives without any controls imposed upon it. But I’ve met 
              several Singaporean graffiti artists while I’ve been here and been very 
              impressed with what I’ve seen. So perhaps, there is still hope for street art 
              here. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">You also live in America. What’s that like for you?</span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"> <br>I 
              love New York City. The art scene there is amazing and immensely energizing. The 
              Americans have a beautiful capacity to renew themselves when things go wrong. 
              Electing Barack Obama is a good example of that. I’m mostly an anarchist but I 
              think Obama is all right. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">You own clubs in New York, Paris and Tokyo. Why did you get into that 
              scene? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>I’m a night animal through and through. The night has always 
              been part of my life—graffiti artists almost always work after dark. And after 
              “working” I’d go check what club and venues would still be open—the prospect of 
              discovering new places was always, and still is, a thrill. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Have you walked into one of your clubs, looked at the crowd, and gone 
              geez ... what are these guys doing here? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Yes I have, sadly. But my 
              bouncers know what kind of people I like having in the club, and for the most 
              part they do their job. Most, however, are welcome—I’m an easygoing, open 
              person. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">What’s your relationship with music? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Very important. I 
              like loads of indie and nu-indie. Lots of electronica and rock ballads are also 
              good. My wife has a band and I listen to her albums when I work. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Besides art, what else are you passionate about? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>I love 
              fixed-gear bicycling. I don’t drive. I get a tremendous kick out of cycling 
              around cities and looking at stuff.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Tell us about your collaboration with Belvedere Vodka? How did it 
              come about?</span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>I have been friends with the Belvedere people in Paris 
              for a long time. We’ve always wanted work together and one day they said they 
              were thinking of doing this new vodka and it set in motion a fascinating 
              process; from helping with creating the taste, designing the bottle and 
              conceptualizing the launch party, which was helmed by musician Mark Ronson. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Your critics and some of your fans have labeled it a sell-out. Is 
              that fair? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>They can say what they want, but I have my underground 
              side and that will continue to be my mainstay. I have always been fascinated by 
              someone like Andy Warhol who collaborated heavily with brands. It’s one part of 
              graffiti culture; to work with pop culture and make collaborations. That’s the 
              way to make our art accessible to everyone.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">What do you think about your most famous contemporary, Banksy? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Tremendous. Innovative. Always reinventing. Always pushing 
              boundaries. A genius with an electric sense of humor. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">You’ve met him? Wow! So, who’s he? We promise not to tell. </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Of course I’ve met him. Well, he’s just a guy. That’s all I’m 
              telling you. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Who else do you admire among contemporaries; what have you learned 
              from them?</span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>I like Shepard Fairey, who created the iconic Obama 
              poster. I’ve learned humility and to not be too selfish from these guys. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">You’re a successful, well-off artist; what does money mean to 
              you?</span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Nothing. It’s just a tool for other things. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">What’s your greatest fear? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Being buried alive. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">You’ve been quite the busy bee of late. What are you working on now? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>I’m writing a script for a film. I’ve made short films before, but 
              this is a much bigger project and I can’t give away too much now. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">Which emotion works best with your art: Love or Anger? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>Sometimes too much anger is bad. For me love and happiness are more 
              important emotions than anger or sadness; I need happy vibes when I create. Much 
              of my work is centered on love; my first graffiti piece was a drawing of my 
              lover’s name. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;">What’s the biggest misconception about you? </span></strong><span style="color: #a53cc2;"><br>I love 
              misconceptions. I don’t like people to stereotype or label me. I like to keep 
              them guessing.</span></p>
