              <p id="paragrah">If Pythagoras, Aristotle or any of the other axial luminaries of 
              the Classical World were alive today, they might just be working as conceptual 
              artists in the mold of Hitoshi Nomura, rather than philosophers and scientists. 
              This is because the science and philosophy that these intellectual giants 
              practiced were infused with a mysticism and metaphysical side quite at odds with 
              the strict criteria and dry agendas of their modern equivalents, and much more 
              in keeping with the interests and artistic methods of Nomura, whose career is 
              the subject of a major retrospective at the National Art Center Tokyo 
              (NACT).</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 10px;"><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/images/photos2009/fa20090612a1a.jpg" border="0" alt="News photo" width="250" height="214"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Tardiology" (1968-1969) by Hitoshi Nomura</span></span></p>
              <p>As "Nomura Hitoshi: Perceptions — Changes in Time and Field" 
              shows, the 64-year-old artist has attempted to reveal and encapsulate the unseen 
              forces of nature that move and shape our universe, often with the same kind of 
              mystical bent that drove the greatest minds of ancient thought, in his 40-year 
              career.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The exhibition is also notable because of the museum's attempt to 
              make contemporary art accessible to the wider public. Nomura is the subject of 
              volume four of NACT's free bilingual booklet, "Door to Contemporary Art," a 
              series that is carefully written to explain art to general readers.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The best starting point for the exhibition, and the works that 
              begin the book, are Nomura's "Tardiology" series (1969/2009), for which the 
              artist constructed large towers from corrugated cardboard that were then left to 
              the mercy of gravity and time (and occasionally the weather) to sag, bend, and 
              topple. For this exhibition, a 7.15-meter-high tower has been constructed inside 
              the exhibition space, with earlier towers presented through photography. Using 
              this remarkably simple method, Nomura has effectively demonstrated the power of 
              gravity over time.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Time is Nomura's frequent refrain, with photographic 
              installations featuring the astronomical rhythms of sun, moon, stars and comets. 
              But some of his most thought-provoking pieces are more down to earth. "The Ten 
              Million Years Tree Graft" series (2000-2009) breathes new life into fossils by 
              grafting fossilized trees, with the wood grain still discernible, into freshly 
              cut blocks of camphor wood.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">More often, however, the exhibition feels like a crash course in 
              science. "The Brownian Motion of Eyesight" (1972-1982) references the random 
              movement of microscopic particles suspended in gas or liquid, first discovered 
              by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1827. This is thought to be generated 
              by the "kick" of the atoms that compose the particles. For this work, Nomura put 
              himself in the shoes of a microscopic particle afflicted with Browning motion. 
              Using a camera with a time-elapse function, he randomly and continuously took 
              photos over a 10-year period, with each snap symbolizing a jerk of "Brownian" 
              motion.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Although the results are incredibly boring to look at, this is a 
              thought- provoking work. Also, you may enjoy sitting down at the special table 
              and being handed one of the many volumes to peruse with a set of white gloves to 
              don so that none of the "precious" photos are damaged.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Much more effective, as an artwork, is "The Sun on Lat. 35° N" 
              (1982-1987). Initially, this looks like a large pair of eyes made from some kind 
              of coil. The wonder increases when you realize that this actually consists of 
              365 photographic images of the daily trajectory of the Sun across the sky. These 
              have been laid side-by-side. In each photo, the curve of the Sun's trajectory 
              varies slightly. By perfectly aligning these trajectories and joining them 
              together, Nomura has revealed the pattern the sun creates over the year: The 
              vernal and autumnal equinoxes create relatively straight lines, while summer and 
              winter are represented by ever tighter spirals.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">An equally interesting artwork is "Moon Score" (1975-1979). By 
              photographing the moon at fixed times and places on film marked with five lines 
              — like music paper — Nomura effectively turned each image into a single item of 
              musical notation. This then provided the basis for him to perform and record 
              these "moon scores," creating sounds that seem to have properties of 
              composition.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">While it is easy to criticize this constant search for an 
              underlying pattern in the universe as mystical mumbo-jumbo, it should be 
              remembered that some of the greatest scientists have been inspired by similar 
              notions. In his book "The Sleepwalkers" (1959), Arthur Koestler points out that 
              the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler arrived at his laws of 
              planetary motion via an esoteric belief that the orbits of the planets were 
              related to the six perfect solids; while Isaac Newton was well known for 
              dabbling in alchemy.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The beauty and appeal of Nomura's art is dependent on evoking a 
              sense of awe and magical wonder for the universe around us. Without this, the 
              exhibition would just be a random collection of photos, cardboard boxes, random 
              recordings, fossils, meteorites and assemblages. Luckily, for the enjoyment and 
              enlightenment of visitors, Nomura proves to be something of a sorcerer.</p>
