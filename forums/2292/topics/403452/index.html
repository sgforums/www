Half-truths, flat-out lies or the omission of important information will eventually come to the surface and crush the personal and professional reputation you've worked so hard to build. <br><br><strong>Be someone you would want to do business with. <br></strong>That means you shouldn't interrupt others, ignore common courtesy, talk incessantly about yourself or monopolize anyone's time. Get rid of any "you owe me" attitudes, and don't hurt others to get ahead. The people you are trying to impress will be turned off by any or all of these traits - and they won't want to do business with you. <br><br><strong>Be confident, not cocky. <br></strong>Steer clear of promising what you can't or won't deliver. Take an actual interest in others - sincerity can be spotted a mile away, while insincerity can be spotted from an even farther distance. Listen to others carefully, consider what they have to say and respond in a thoughtful, intelligent manner. If you ever indicate to someone that you think they don't know what they're talking about, you've lost that person as a contact. <br><br><strong>Don't think that you can network only by using the internet.</strong> <br>The web is a great tool for conducting research and staying in touch, but you also have to get out and meet people. <br><br><strong>Approach networking with a long-term perspective. <br></strong>It's easy to be shortsighted by getting to know only the boss; however, getting to know co-workers and other colleagues will take you farther in the long run. You never know who you might end up working for - if you've ignored a colleague early in your career who winds up as your boss down the road, you'll have a rocky road to tread. Instead, look at every contact as someone who can - and will - impact your professional life over the long term. <br><br>Along those lines, keep up with people all the time. Don't just contact friends or others when you need something; contact them when you don't need anything. This method keeps you from seeming shallow, and will help you retain more contacts over time. <br><br><strong>Don't spread yourself too thin.</strong> <br>Your time is valuable, and as you network, both your social life and your professional life are likely to get busier. Carefully choose the people, companies and organizations you want to devote your time to so that you can really commit to them. <br><br>Keep your cool at networking events. For example, avoid or limit alcohol. You'll retain good judgement, not say something you'll regret the next day and create a stronger impression of reliability than someone who doesn't avoid alcohol.</div>
