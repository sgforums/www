              <p>by Morris Kline</p>
              <p>I read this book after wasting 4 years of my 
                  precious youth getting an engineering degree. This book changed the way I
                   look at Mathematics. No, it is not just some formulas which one 
                  manipulates to solve problems. Mathematics, as Morris Kline puts it, 
                  arises from the search for an understanding of our physical world. He 
                  employed the example of the motion of the moon around the earth to show,
                   using simple high school mathematics, how Newton arrived at his laws. 
                  Believe me, he explained it better than most Physics textbooks do. He 
                  explained how Calculus arose from the need to solve everyday 
                  maximization/minimization problems and pointed to the fact that the 
                  inventors of Calculus were after all mortals like us. </p>
              <p>I lament 
                  the flippant manner in which engineering math is being taught to 
                  engineering undergraduates. Most of these engineering professors are not
                   specifically trained in applied mathematics. They may have taken some 
                  graduate-level courses in engineering math but that alone does not 
                  qualify them to teach the subject. IF you are an engineering 
                  undergraduate and if you think engineering math seems more like a 
                  disparate set of techniques with no apparent link to your core modules, 
                  you are not alone. Why, for example, would a civil engineer be 
                  interested in complex variable theory? When I was an undergrad, I didn't
                   know either because the lecturer failed to show any link of complex 
                  variables to physical problems. To sum up, the knowledge of mathematical
                   methods has not been brought fully to bear on its applications to 
                  physical problems. Every Engineering professor ought to get a copy of 
                  Morris Kline's 'Mathematics and the Physical World' and start reading!</p>

              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sir Isaac Newton, the famous seventeenth-century mathematician and scientist, though not generally known as an alchemist, practiced the art with a passion. Though he wrote over a million words on the subject, after his death in 1727, the Royal Society deemed that they were "not fit to be printed." </span></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The papers were rediscovered in the middle of the twentieth century and most scholars now concede that Newton was first an foremost an alchemist.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> It is also becoming obvious that the inspiration for Newton's laws of light and theory of gravity came from his alchemical work. </span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If one looks carefully, in the light of alchemical knowledge, at the definitive biography, <em>Sir Isaac Newton</em> by J. W. V. Sullivan, it is quite easy to realize the alchemical theories from which he was working.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Sir Arthur Eddington, in reviewing this book, says: "The science in which Newton seems to have been chiefly interested, and on which he spent most of his time was alchemy. He read widely and made innumerable experiments, entirely without fruit so far as we know." One of his servants records: "He very rarely went to bed until two or three of the clock, sometimes not till five or six, lying about four or five hours, especially at springtime or autumn, at which time he used to employ about six weeks in his laboratory, the fire scarce going out night or day. What his aim might be I was unable to penetrate into." </span></p>
              <p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The answer is that Newton's experiments were concerned with nothing more or less than alchemy. (from<em>Alchemy Rediscovered and Restored </em>by A. Cockren)...</span></p>

              </p><p>The British oligarchy praises Newton as the founder of modern science. But, at the same time, they have been unable to keep secret the fact that Newton was a raving irrationalist, a cultist kook.</p>
              <p>Among the oligarchs, it was the British economist Lord John Maynard Keynes and a fellow Cambridge graduate who began to open the black box of Newton's real character. Was Newton the first and greatest of the modern scientists, the practitioner of cold and untinctured reason? No, said Keynes, Newton was not the first of the Age of Reason.</p>
              <p>He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last wonderful child to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Keynes based his view on the contents of a box. What was in the box?</span></strong></p>
              <p>The box contained papers which Newton had packed up when he left Cambridge for London in 1696, ending his Cambridge career and beginning his new life in London as member and president of the British Royal Society, director of the mint, resident magus of the new British Empire.</p>
              <p>Inside the box were manuscripts and papers totalling some 1.2 million words.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> After Newton's death, Bishop Horsley was asked to inspect the box, with a view to publication, but when he saw the contents, he recoiled in horror and slammed the lid. </span></strong></p>
              <p>A century passed.</p>
              <p>Newton's nineteenth-century biographer, Sir David Brewster, looked into the box. He decided to save Newton's reputation by printing a few selections, but he falsified the rest with straight fibbing, as Keynes says.</p>
              <p>The box became known as the Portsmouth Papers. A few mathematical papers were given to Cambridge in 1888. In 1936, the current owner, Lord Lymington, needed money, so he had the rest auctioned off. Keynes bought as many as he could, but other papers were scattered from Jersualem to America.</p>
              <p>As Keynes points out, Newton was a suspicious, paranoid, unstable personality...</p>

              Western Germany in the late eighteenth century.</p>
              <p>I think you will see, if you make a list of the great geniuses
              in the history of Europe, that they are clustered in that period.

              <p>The greatest musician, Beethoven -- or, if you dispute it, two
              or three great musicians. Great philosophers and poets, Herder,
              Goethe and others. It was a very great period, a period much worth
              studying...</p>

              <p>Yes indeed Germany had a concentration of some of the most brilliant scientists and mathematicians prior to WW2. At that time, It was the center of the world for science, mathematics, music, ballet, philosophy, etc. Of course, there were other great scientists residing at other parts of the world. But the concentration in Germany was too conspicuous to ignore. What was it in their culture that made them excel in science and math?</p>

              <p>Euler is my favourite. Newton was not only a genius physicist but also a competent mathematician. I remember Bernoulli once announced an open problem on Variational Calculus:</p>
              <p>`To find the curve connecting two points, 
              at different heights and not on the same vertical line, along which a
              body acted upon only by gravity will fall in the shortest time'.</p>
              <p>The problem remained open for six months. Only the most competent mathematicians of the day sent in their solutions. Newton (not known to be a mathematician) solved it in a day.</p>

              <p>The sad fact is that those who get loads of high praises <em>in public</em> are those who derive "practical maths" and claim it to be applicable in everyday life.</p>
              <p>Once you delve into the subject proper, you'll see beyond the maths and see instead the foundations upon which the maths were built on.</p>
              <p>It is not entirely correct to say that the basic principles are mathematical. Stuff like Arkelof's lemon markets, which is an impressive paper on asymmetrical information, uses some maths to prove that signalling (eg. phdguy getting phd to prove himself) improves the economy and individuals and helps explain why we are obsessed with certs and all. But the basic intuition is practically common sensical and the maths is a justifying component, not the main building block.</p>
              <p>THIS is also economics, but sad to say, hardly one that the public sees. Freakonomics is another load of bull-crap.</p>
              <p>Part of the reason why people have come to associate economics, which really is a study of HUMAN BEHAVIOUR, with maths, is also due to the society's unhealthy obsession with the financial market, and its constant drive to find EQUATIONs that would derive the "best result".</p>
              <p>Understandably, many of them failed simply because the assumptions (much maligned stuff also) obviously do not hold in the real world. A good example is the famous now discredited Black-Scholes formula. </p>
              <p>Does that mean Economics is useless? It doesn't. Anything you learn should be done so with a pinch of salt. That's all. Assumptions do not make it entirely unrealistic. It allows us to home in on intriguing factors. Most papers (that publics do not see) make their points, but cover their backsides because the writers know when the papers fail. The public sees the point, but not the cautions the writers usually include.</p>

              <p>Game Theory.</p>
              <p>A rather interesting model that offers an insight into how we take into account other's actions when we make decisions.</p>
              <p>The beautiful thing about it is its simply underlying principle and yet, it is applicable in so many aspects of our lives as far as decision-making is concerned.</p>
              <p>A good example is how many of us only hear of demand and supply, but it is actually a model that fails to take into account the dynamic nature of out decisions and how others actually have a bearing as well.</p>
              <p>Game theory can help correct that by including other factors and even jealousy (!).<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
