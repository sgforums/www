              <p>that's because foreign phds have both creativity and textual intelligence. whereas most of the asian phds only know how to swallow textbooks and notes, go for exams and physics olympiad, when the westerners are using the time to invent and discover new things.</p>
              <p>i wonder if u have wasted your time abroad. attending classes taught by westerners, but never learn to understand their mentality and working values.</p>
              <p>perhaps u should spend your time inventing something and help singapore get our first nobel prize. we are still one of the few developed countries that have not gotten a single medal yet.</p>

              <p>to your first sentence, that's what alot of people thought after completing their masters. they haven't yet entered the real academic world. amateurs only talk about passion. most people who continued with phd wish to end up teaching in the universities or be researchers. they dont know what its like and how it works there.</p>
              <p>when u get your phd cert, u are just a Dr. u are not a prof and cant hold a teaching position in the uni. so most ppl went to do further research with the science agency. the seniors and old birds there will direct your research, so most of the time u end up doing what they want u to do, right?</p>
              <p>this is why most newbies start feeling the lost of their passion as they could not do what they wanted, but end up doing what people want them to do. on top of that, i understand that there is a certain force that pushes u to churn out research papers like a printing machine, right? and the results of these research papers must be 'correct' and desired by your mentors, right?</p>
              <p>i have a relative, after completing his science phd, worked and toiled like cow for 5 years. his salary is only $3k per month. can u imagine a guy in his mid 30s earning that and cant afford to have car and children? i think even a normal degree graduate earn more than him at the same age.</p>

              <p>isolated examples can't always be generalized. The '3K' you mention is too much of an exaggeration. Sometimes, it depends on the discipline. I heard stories on how researchers in the life &amp; biological sciences earn very little here in USA. Maybe your relative belongs to this discipline?</p>

              <p>my relative went to USA to do his studies and after graduation immediately came back to sg to work. so the 3k is measured in sgd, not usd. he is purely being underpaid. i believe his discipline belongs to one of the lower earning group, because if not he might consider staying on in the states like u...</p>
              <p>however i am not very sure of the research field in usa, heard that the gov grants quite a good amount of money to supply research? my other relative has been doing research in one of the european countries for quite a long time. in his country the gov supports them quite alot and they are allow to team up with other researchers freely. however, the similarity with both of them is that their pay is damn low.</p>
              <p>tell your prc colleague that he should be glad his country is producing nobel laureates, especially those still holding to the prc citizenship. i dont understand why u guys like to compare physics olympiad with nobel prize. in my opinion it is as if u are comparing caviar with salmon sushi.</p>
              <p>i am not going to say the school's name, as i am now in a tussle with them. they refuse to let me go and dont want to publish my transcript. however i discontinued paying fees and attending lessons, because i am offered by a much better university abroad which gave me better conditions.</p>
