              <p>to be honest, its quite hard for them to take other route out unless they have contacts and $ capital to start their own company.</p>

              <p>I have told many before. I have an army friend who started a company 2.5 yrs ago with $100 (not $100k, a hundred dollars only), and is now grossing $600k revenue annually. Contacts? No. That guy started with selling at SgForums and HWZ marketplace.</p>
              <p>Another army fren combined with his uni fren to come out with $10k, use SPRING Singapore's scheme to get additional $40k (for &lt;26 yrs old) and NUS scheme to get free office. Start of 2011, his company was worth $3mil (Singtel bought a stake). Contacts? No, just his prowess in selling his idea to SPRING.</p>
              <p>The $500k annual income PhD tutor started off earning $200 a month. Contacts? Built by himself. Capital? Zero.</p>
              <p>Are these isolated examples? No. I can rattle off more. What's the difference between these people and the example you raised? These people don't give up, they don't resign themselves to their limited circumstances. The first guy failed in two businesses before succeeding. Heck, he don't even have a uni degree. The 2nd did only moderately well in school, but had good business sense and started reading up during army days. The 3rd quitted an engineering job due to extreme low pay and no future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So to be extremely honest with you, while it is hard to break out of the box given limiting circumstances, it isn't anything impossible. And to be even more critical, if someone resigns himself/herself to not doing anything because of the extremely lame reason of "its quite hard for them to take other route out
                                      unless they have contacts and $ capital to start their own
                                      company", that person deserves to be just normal. And yes, to just resign to fate and continue with it as well. Nothing wrong if such a person is happy with the situation, but obviously, from your posts, your relative isn't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I have said earlier</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>It's always easier to spend time to complain, criticize, give
                                      unsolicited and unprofessional advice than to actually spend time
                                      to do the job.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I would like to add too that it is always easier to put the blame on your current situation to others than to attempt taking action to rectify it.</p>
