            <div class='col-md body'>10 Reasons Your Period is Late<br><br>Nothing strikes fear into the heart of any woman like a missed period, unless she is trying to get pregnant. Am I pregnant? Pregnancy is the first thing that we think of when our period is delayed. But is pregnancy the only reason for people to have a late period? Here are the 10 most common reasons that you missed your period:<br><br>1. Stress<br>Stress can affect many things in our lives, including our periods. Sometimes we're so stressed out that our body produces hormones that halt our bleeding. Working with your doctor or midwife can help you figure out what you need to do to relax and get back on schedule.<br><br>2. Illness<br>A sudden, short illness or even a longer illness can cause your periods to be delayed.<br>This is usually temporary.<br><br>3. Change in Schedules<br>Changing schedules can really throw off your body clock. This is particularly true if you go from days to nights at work or vice versa.<br><br>4. Change in Medications<br>Perhaps you're trying a new medication and a delayed or absent period is the cause. Be sure to talk to your doctor or midwife about this side effect. It is very common with some methods of birth control.<br><br>5. Being Overweight<br>Carrying around too much weight can hormonally shift your cycles and even stop them. Most women will see a return to normal cycles and fertility with the loss of some weight.<br><br>6. Being Underweight<br>If you do not have enough body fat you will not have regular periods, sometimes you can eve cause your periods to stop all together. This is called amenorrhea. Typically a weight gain will help you have your periods return. This is a frequent cause of a missed period in women who work out to an extreme or are professional athletes.<br><br>7. Miscalculation[<br>The menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman. While we say that the average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, that is not true for everyone. Sometimes our period is believed to be late when in all actuality we have simply miss calculated. If you have irregular menstrual cycles, but know when you ovulate, look for your period about two weeks after you ovulate. That may help you keep an easier track of your periods.<br><br>8. Peri-Menopause<br>Peri-menopause is the period of time where you are transitioning from reproductive age to a non-reproductive age. Your periods may be lighter, heavier, more frequent or less frequent - but mostly just not normal. If you do not wish to get pregnant, be sure to continue to use birth control because you are likely to still be fertile at least some of the time.<br><br>9. Menopause<br>Menopause is when you have reached the point in your life where you will no longer ovulate or menstruate. Menopause can be a natural life event or may happen surgically through hysterectomy or through chemical such as chemotherapies.<br><br>10. Pregnancy<br>Finally! Yes, your missed period might be because you're pregnant! A simple pregnancy test can usually help you determine if you have missed your period because you are pregnant. The urine pregnancy tests and blood pregnancy tests look for the hormone hCG.<br><br>What to do next?<br><br>If you are pregnant, you should call to make a prenatal appointment with your midwife or doctor. It normally takes a bit to get you in so call right away.<br><br>If you have taken a pregnancy test and it is negative. Most tests advise you to wait another week and retest. If the second test is negative or if you have a good idea of why your period is missing, then you can and should call the doctor or midwife sooner for a physical exam. They may also do blood work and can sometimes prescribe medications to help bring on a tardy period, like Provera.<br><br><a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/amipregnant/a/missedperiod.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/od/amipregnant/a/missedperiod.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sexuality in Pregnancy<br><br>The body undergoes so many changes during pregnancy, and your sexuality is no different. Here is a look at the physical and emotional changes that might occur in each trimester:<br><br>First Trimester<br><br>Emotional Changes:<br><br>* You and your partner may find your desire for sex increased because for once you do not have to think about birth control.<br>* You may find that you are conflicted about sex as your mental images of yourself changes to a more motherly view.<br>* Some women find themselves preoccupied by the thought of sex, including dreams and strange fantasies.<br><br>Physical Changes<br><br>* Your breasts may be sensitive, causing your either increased pleasure or pain. The first trimester is when your breast undergo the fastest changes.<br>* Nausea and fatigue may diminish your sexual appetite.<br>* Threatened miscarriage may limit the amount of intercourse or orgasms you may have.<br>* Orgasms may seem to linger, causing a feeling of tension in your vagina and clitoris.<br><br>Second Trimester<br><br>Emotional Changes:<br><br>* Many women feel sexy with their new figures, particularly if they are feeling less sickly than in the first trimester.<br>* Dads may be fearful of hurting the baby, or of the baby "knowing" what is going on, particularly once the baby has started moving and he can feel the movements.<br>* Some dads are jealous of the baby's closeness with the mother.<br><br>Physical Changes<br><br>* The vagina is more lubricated and the clitoris and vagina are more engorged.<br>Many women will become orgasmic or multi-orgasmic for the first time during pregnancy because of this added engorgement.<br><br>Third Trimester<br><br>Emotional Changes:<br><br>* Mom may be concerned that her body is repulsive to her partner, or that her figure may never return.<br>* To the contrary, most men are actually aroused by their wife's blossoming figure. Communication is essential for a healthy sex life, at all points of life.<br>* Mother is becoming more fatigued making timing difficult.<br>* Positioning. Well, all I can say is be creative! Everyone has a different belly, so try different positions until you find one that works for you both. Remember mom shouldn't lay on her back, she needs to be at least tilted to one side. Woman on top positions are great for the end of pregnancy as are spooning or rear entry.<br><br>Physical Changes<br><br>* Uterus will occasionally have spasms lasting upwards of one minute during orgasms, this is different from contractions.<br>* Contractions may occur near your due date after sex for about half an hour.<br>* Because of all the engorgement in the vagina and clitoris, orgasm may not relieve the sexual tension you feel.<br>* If your baby's head is deep in the pelvis you may have pain or spotting during or after sex, this is normal. Try using shallow penetration (rear entry position offer this benefit).<br>* Sex will not start labor if your cervix is not ripe, so the average woman does not have to worry about preterm labor.<br><br>Remember this special time in your lives, and enjoy yourselves fully during pregnancy. There are very few things a pregnant woman can't do sexually. If you are having problems your practitioner may advise you to limit intercourse or orgasm, but the one thing that should never be done is to blow air into the vagina, it may cause a placental air embolism.<br><br><a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/sexuality/a/aa082498.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/sexuality/a/aa082498.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Breast Changes in Pregnancy<br><br>You may have heard that one of the first pregnancy symptoms many women have is changes to their breast tissue. It is true that your breasts will respond to you being pregnant by changing in preparation for breastfeeding. Here are some of the more common changes in your breasts during pregnancy:<br><br>* Sore Breasts<br>Early in the first trimester you may notice that your breasts are sore or tender. For some women this is also a sign of an impending period, so it may go unnoticed. You may have a slight tenderness when you touch your breasts or you can have the severe pain whenever you wear a bra. Both variants are normal and are usually most intense in the first trimester. This is one of the reasons that sex in the first trimester is often avoided by some women. Sex in pregnancy is safe, you may just want to avoid having anyone touch your nipples.<br><br>* Nipple Changes<br>Your nipples may become larger and darker as your pregnancy progresses.<br>You may also notice small, goose bump or pimple like white areas on your areola. These are normal. They are called Montgomery's tubercules.<br><br>* Larger Breasts<br>Towards the end of the first trimester or the beginning of the second trimester you may notice that your breasts begin to grow. This is again the tissues inside the breast preparing for nursing. Towards the end of pregnancy you will want to be fitted for a nursing bra to help accommodate the larger breasts.<br><br>* Leaking Colostrum<br>Colostrum is the first milk your body makes. It will provide your baby with everything he or she needs to start life, including a dose of immunities and protection from jaundice. Towards the end of pregnancy some women may find that their breasts leak this golden color fluid. Or you may notice that your nipples have a film or caked substance, this is all colostrum. You can use a breast pad if it becomes noticeable or if it makes you feel more comfortable.<br><br>* No Breast Changes<br>You may be one of the women who have only slight symptoms or no symptoms of breast changes in pregnancy. Don't panic. It has nothing to do with your ability to have a successful pregnancy or breastfeeding relationship.<br><br><a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/symptomsofpregnancy/a/breastchanges.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/od/symptomsofpregnancy/a/breastchanges.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some pregnant women crave pickles...<br><br>Pregnancy Cravings.<br>The thoughts of pregnancy and cravings tend to go hand in hand. The mere mention of pickles and ice cream brings to mind a gloriously pregnant woman with her feet propped up munching on deliciously salty pickles while also scarfing down some equally delectable ice cream.<br><br>While many pregnant women will never even begin to desire something as stereotypical as ice cream and pickles, many do have cravings during pregnancy. Some studies show that up to 68% of women will have a craving at some point during pregnancy.<br><br>Cravings can mean different things to different people. It might be the simple, "Gee that smells really good, I'd like to eat some." While others are down right driven to find whatever they crave.<br><br>We tend to think that if our body is craving it that it must be something we need for our health.<br><br>This may have some basis in truth, particularly depending on what we are craving. If we're cravings fruits and vegetables, chances are we aren't too concerned about the desires. Though we probably are equally unconcerned about the desire to eat a chocolate malt after every meal.<br><br>Cravings can border on the harmful side if they begin to alter your diets variety severely or if you crave, harmful, non-food substances like clay, laundry starch or other items. This condition is called pica.<br><br>Psychologically speaking, part of our cravings may simply be that we believe pregnant women should eat certain things. Or sometimes it's survival, as in I can't keep anything else down!<br><br>Watch what you're craving, be sure your diet is balanced. Eating a variety every week is one way to do this as opposed to eating the same meals over and over. Keep a food journal if necessary to help keep track of your meals. Be sure to discuss any problems with your nutrition with your doctor or midwife.<br><br><a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/nutritioninpregn/a/aapickles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/nutritioninpregn/a/aapickles.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stretch Marks and Skin Changes in Pregnancy<br><br>So, you think your skin has changed since you've become pregnant?<br><br>The answer is probably.<br><br>The integumentary system goes through several alterations due to both hormonal and mechanical changes. Some of these may have been blown off as old wives tales, while others you may never have heard of before.<br><br>Stretch Marks<br><br>Striae gravidarum, or stretch marks are probably the most discussed of the skin changes during pregnancy. Nearly every woman fears them or thinks about them. They appear in 50 - 90 of all pregnant women, usually showing up in the later half of pregnancy. While the majority will be on the lower abdomen they can also be found on the thighs, hips, buttocks, breasts and arms of women.<br><br>These are most commonly seen as small depressions in the skin. They tend to be pinkish in light skinned women, and in dark skinned women they will be lighter than the surrounding skin.<br><br>They reflect the separation of collagen of the skin. While not painful the stretching of the skin may cause a tingling or itchy sensation.<br><br>While many people will swear by certain creams or lotions, the truth is there's not much you can do about stretch marks, you'll either get them or not. There are some factors that you should know contribute to stretch marks:<br><br>* Family (If your mom or sister has them, guess what?)<br>* Weight Gain (Rapid or excessive will make these worse.)<br>* Nutritional Status (Well hydrated and healthy skin stretches better.)<br>* Ethnicity (African American women get them less.)<br><br>So, what now? Well, eventually they do fade after you have the baby, becoming silver lines. While most women don't think about them much, or consider them badges of motherhood, others want them removed. There are new techniques and surgeries being explored all the time. Talk to your dermatologist or plastic surgeon if you are concerned.<br><br>Mask of Pregnancy<br><br>Melanotropin is secreted in greater quantity during pregnancy, this can cause a pigmentation to occur over the nose, cheeks, and forehead of an expectant mom. While it is not caused by sunlight, this will aggravate the situation. 45 - 70 of women will experience this beginning in the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy. This will fade after the birth. Most women use make up to cover this if it becomes a problem. This is also called chloasma.<br><br>Linea Negra<br><br>This is a darker line extending from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus (fundus), usually showing up for first time moms around the third month. Multiparous women (had more than one child) will often see it earlier. While not all women experience this line, don't believe the rumors that it means a boy baby is on the way.<br><br>Acne<br><br>Thought it was gone for good? Think again, while many women actually find that the hormones of pregnancy relieve their acne and leave them with that "glowing" skin of pregnancy, many women find their skin more oily and susceptible to acne break outs. Here's where the high school remedies come into play... Actually ensure you are drinking plenty of water, wash your face, avoid things that cause you to break out. Basically do what works, but it doesn't have to be fancy.<br><br>Spider Veins<br><br>These can appear most commonly on the face, neck, chest, arms, and legs. They are caused from increased estrogen level in your body. They are often star shaped and slightly raised. They are slightly blue and do not turn white with pressure. 65 of the Caucasian women and 10 of the African American women will experience these, which do usually fade after the birth.<br><br>Palmar Erythema<br><br>A mottled or reddening of the palms of the hands. This is caused by increased estrogen levels during pregnancy. About 60 of Caucasian women will experience this, with about 35 of African American women too.<br><br>Other Facts<br><br>* Some women will have accelerated nail growth.<br>* Others will notice a thinning of their nails.<br>* Excessive hair growth may occur in unwanted places, fine or coarse. (Hirsutism)<br>* Excessive sweating.<br><br><a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/stretchmarks/a/skinchanges.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/od/stretchmarks/a/skinchanges.htm</a></div>
