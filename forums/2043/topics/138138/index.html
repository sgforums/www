            <div class='col-md body'>Everything went well in my pregnancy and hubby and I were looking forward to my 2nd baby who is expected to be deliver tomorrow.<br><br>But unexpected situation happened when I went for my routine check-up in my 36 weeks of my pregnancy. My baby's heartbeat has stopped and he was dead.<br><br>We were very devasted when we heard the news and there were noting that we can do about this. The next procedure was that I had to give birth to him to end this pregnancy.<br><br>Finally, on 30 May, I  gave birth to him naturally. The cause of his death was clear. He was strangled by his umbilical cord around his neck in my womb. I carried him in my arms and took a last look at him.  He looked just perfectly normal like any other newborn but the only thing was that he wasn't moving and breathing anymore. After 2 mins, I passed him back to the mid-wife and told myself that I had to let him go.<br><br>It has been three weeks after this incident. I missed him dearly but I have to be strong for my son and family members. I will try to conceive again when I have recover and ready.<br><br>I learn that I should never take things for granted from this incident. I should have been more careful.</div>

It's totally quiet.<br><br>When I feel about the baby's inactivity the day before, I had the bad feeling that something must have happened to my baby. But as you know, we always feel that we are not that unlucky and such things will never happen to us.<br><br>To think back, it's really scary and devasting feeling that I will never forget easily. It's even more hurting than anything else. It's the fear that I gonna carry thru next pregnancy till my baby is able to be delivered healthy and alive.</div>
