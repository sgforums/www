            <div class='col-md body'>Aug 1, 2005<br>It's official - Faye's married<br><br>BEIJING - Faye Wong can no longer deny the rumours. The Chinese pop diva and actor Li Yapeng held a wedding reception for their families on Friday.<br><br>The couple, whose wedding has been the subject of rumours for a year, registered their marriage in Urumqi in Xinjiang the day before, reports had said earlier.<br><br>On Friday, cameramen snapped pictures of the two emerging from a Beijing restaurant, dressed in wedding clothes. The cameramen had rushed to the eatery around 1pm, a report carried by Sina.com said.<br><br>At about 3pm, Wong and Li emerged, their faces shielded by umbrellas. But his face came into view as they boarded a waiting vehicle.<br><br>Li, 34, was in a black suit while Wong, 35, wore her hair long and donned a flowery, white dress.<br><br>His brother Yawei and mother walked in front, both sporting a red flower pinned to their clothes. But Wong's daughter Jingtong, eight, from her previous marriage to rocker Dou Wei, was not seen.<br><br>Li said on Saturday that the couple had planned to announce their wedding after their honeymoon. They plan to hold wedding banquets for their friends in Beijing and Hong Kong.<br><br>But he denied rumours that Wong is pregnant. The singer was recently said to have cut down on smoking and drinking in preparation for a baby.<br><br>In May, her manager had said she would be taking a long break from making movies, touring and recording.<br><br>It is the second marriage for Beijing-born Wong, who divorced Dou in 1999. She was in an on-off, four-year romance with Hong Kong star Nicholas Tse before dating Li in late 2003.<br><br>For China-born Li, the marriage, his first, potentially makes him wealthier than before, Apple Daily Taiwan said.<br><br>The TV star of Chinese serials like Legend Of The Condor Heroes had previously dated women, like actress Zhou Xun, who reportedly are bigger earners.<br><br>Wong is the wealthiest China singer according to Forbes magazine and is reportedly worth at least S$20 million.<br><br>Li, by comparison, is 56th on its list with S$1.4 million, said Apple. According to Chinese law, marital assets become joint property if records of a couple's assets are not separately registered.<br><br></div>

[file photo]<br><br>The news was revealed Tuesday by a close friend of the couple surnamed Wang who said the pair had gone to Europe to marry at a registry office.<br><br>"They might choose France or Switzerland because Wong loves these two places very much. In October last year, Wong, accompanied by Li, went to France to do a commercial and they had a wonderful tour there," Wang said.<br><br>If the couple had decided to get married in Europe, they might have done so to avoid the prying eyes of China's paparazzi, Wang said, adding that simple marriage registration procedures in France and Switzerland might have been another reason.<br><br>Wong had previously told close friends that she wanted to get married in a foreign country.<br><br>However, Li's best friend, popular actor Wang Xuebing, said he knew nothing about Li's marriage plans.<br><br>If the rumor is true, it will be Wong's second marriage while Li's first.<br><br>Wong and Li are among the most talked-about celebrity couples in China and their courtship has long been a popular topic.<br><br>After divorcing Dou Wei, a famous rocker, Wong had an affair with Hong Kong singer Nicolas Tse. Li's former girlfriends include model Qu Ying and actress Zhou Xun.<br><br></div>
