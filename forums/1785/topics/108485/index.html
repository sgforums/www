            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cindy-My Crazy Lover</strong><br><br>Originally posted in The Bar<br>17 October 2004<br><br>I knew Cindy some eight years ago. At that time she was struggling with rent and stuff and was working in a club. The very first time I met her she was telling me about how some bad and drunk customer was in forcing her to do a blowjob in the loo...<br><br>Cindy was a lesbian at the time and was seeing a butch who was quite attractive.<br>The night I met her she went back with me to my place, after the 'niceties' we made love. It wasnÂ’t anything great, no fireworks or anything but it was ok..<br><br>Cindy was cute in the way that she had the sweetest smile and she could cuddle up like nobody I had known. Sometimes the cuddling up beats the sex by a mile.<br>She was an Ice Queen and was cool about anything. If we went out somewhere, ordered beer and the beer was slow, Cindy would walk up to the refrigerator and take the beers out, open them and bring them over. DidnÂ’t matter if it was the Hyatt or anywhere else.<br><br>Over the next few days, she stayed with me and we spent lots of time together. This was the time when Geri Helliwall had a hit called -- Lift me up--<br><br>I found out she had a small share in a boutique which was doing ok.<br>Without fail, she would meet me after work and we did good things together (that a couple should do) like movies, dinners, getting drunk etc<br>Pretty soon we were really attached and everyday we were together. When the weekends came we just laze together, made love the whole day and went to catch movies and stuff.<br><br>The day came when her butch came around...I had a long chat with her and although disappointed she left quietly. Cindy was shaken as she wasnÂ’t sure of what she wanted, but pretty soon she was back to her old loving ways.<br><br>One day after a long lousy day at work I joked that we should get another girl to join us to 'spice things up'. I was only joking, but the next day Cindy called me at 3 in the afternoon and said "let's go" and i said where? To go look for a girl to make love with us!! I was a bit shocked because all the girls I had been with never agreed to it.<br><br>"But we have to be careful because of all the aids going around" she said. "We should find someone more" high class".  I just nodded my head but boy was I excited.We went around a few bars and Cindy made a few phone calls and pretty soon we were drinking with Sonia.<br><br>Sonia's super sexy with long legs and she was just out of a relationship with a drug jerk off who treated her bad. Sonia is super cute and to today I still see her sometimes although she has moved out of Singapore.<br><br>Cindy, Sonia and me we a good sex trio and I have to say the sex was better with Sonia around. On the other hand, Cindy was getting really jealous of her. When Cindy went to work, Sonia and me would sleep, drink and make love the whole day. ThatÂ’s the problem with threesomes, they almost always never have a happy ending.<br><br>Anyway, the three of us were together for over two years, and I can say those were interesting times. Because of Cindy's lesbian past, it was even more interesting as there was a good variety of love making.Looking back I have to say those were happy times, the three of us together.<br><br>Sonia was (and is) always screaming sex, no need to go out, stay in and make love all day long thatÂ’s Sonia... and with her to die for legs, I still lust for her...<br><br>As the happy days of work and sex went by I noticed a change in Cindy. She would spend more time away from the apartment, disappear with no notice and give strange excuses for her absence. One particular occasion I remember was when she called me from the office at 8pm and said she was on the way back, she came back the next day, I wasnÂ’t mad or angry waiting for her just worriedÂ…<br><br>IÂ’m not possessive or anything (and was happy just being with Sonia) so I didnÂ’t question her. The next day over an Italian dinner she must have felt a bit guilty or something and said she didnÂ’t come back because she had to wait for the courier to come pick up some important samples, the courier guy was late and she just slept in the office. I told her it was no problem and that I cared for her and just to take good care of herself whatever she was doing.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cindy- My Crazy Lover  - contd-<br><br>Cindy also suddenly became quite flush with cash, she started buying all sorts of stuff for the apartment. She would pay all the bills, buy all the groceries and booze. I started to get an uneasy feeling, although she had a good job as a designer for a firm making stuff for children like sleeping bags (she had sold her share of her little boutique), she was always just getting by. It was only some time later that I found out she had been sleeping with her ang mo boss for quite some time.<br><br>Cindy was always very liberal with sex, what with her preference for anal and rough sex so I guess it was only natural that she would Â“move onÂ” and have multiple partners. Also I guess with her time spent working at the clubs (not that I hold anyoneÂ’s history against them) her overall view of sex was that it was just that, just sex. It was ok but the only worrying bit was she started to come back with bruises all over and looking like something the cat dragged in. She confided with Sonia that the sex had become rougher and rougher with her new boyfriend.<br><br>One day her boss called me from out of the blue. We had a very cordial gentlemanly discussion and he said he wanted to marry Cindy. I wished him all the best of luck and told him not to worry about me. The funny part of the phone call was when this asshole asked me if he was in danger of getting any sexually transmitted disease Â“not that he was saying I was sickÂ” .. what an asshole.<br><br>At this time Sonia and me were very close and because of CindyÂ’s disappearing acts we were becoming more and more of a couple. Soon Cindy moved out and visited now and then and on these visits we still had good fun the three of us<br><br>Cindy married her big fat ugly boss, I was posted to Bangkok and Sonia went with me there. We got a nice Condo downtown, set up house and started our new life in Bangkok. I would go to work and Sonia would hang around, go to the gym downstairs and go swimming. When I got home she would have the bathtub filled &amp; dinner ready. Quite the little housewife she was becoming. She was quite happy but was a bit pissed because she couldnÂ’t speak Thai and had problems communicating.<br><br>Weekends were spent at a little hotel in Hua Hin overlooking the beach and we would take long walks on the beach, get drunk &amp; make love on the balcony. IÂ’m sure we made voyeurs out of some people living in the adjacent condo.<br><br>Sonia was getting real bored, she had no mahjong kaki and didnÂ’t want to go out much because of the language problem. The other ladies in the condo were mostly wives of Jap expats (who didnÂ’t speak much English) so she didnÂ’t really fit quite in with them. After about 6 months she told me one day she wanted to go to Jakarta to see some friends. (Sonia is Indonesian Chinese) I said ok but was quite sad because I knew she would not be coming back to Bangkok soon.<br><br>Present Day<br><br>Cindy is still married to the same guy, Sonia is still in Jakarta and IÂ’m living all alone. I still visit Sonia every month or so and am still very much in love with her. Living alone is ok and I still have flings every now and then. And I still have some very nice ladies staying over for a couple of days or so.<br><br>But itÂ’s never the same. Those were good times we had Cindy, Sonia and me. The days of easy lovemaking without a care in the world, the wild drinking and also the happiness we found staying together.<br><br>I will always have happy memories of my Crazy Lover Cindy and sweet, sweet Sonia.<br><br>- The End -<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Dying Between Her Thighs</strong><br><br>Originally posted in The Bar<br>5 October 2004<br><br>We were halfway through the bottle, in the background Linkin Park was screaming they belonged somewhere.<br><br>She looked at me with her dark smoldering eyes complimented by smoky grey eye shadow and motioned me to move closer, as if to tell me a secret and whispered into my ears Â“tonight you are going to die between my thighsÂ” and parted her legs ever so slightly.<br><br>We got the check and moved down to the front lobby, I asked for a king size bed and the cute little thing behind the counter obliged and handed me a key.<br><br>It seemed like forever before we were in the room, not a second to waste. She grabbed me, pushed me to the wall and hitched up her skirtÂ… my hand-phone rang, muttering curses I answered it breathlessly Â“Ya, Left HereÂ”, it was Joanne and she was pissed mad Â“go look at your carÂ” she hissed. Â“I punctured all the tires, next time go get a room someplace elseÂ”.<br><br>I had forgotten that Joanne was singing in the lobby lounge, she probably saw us getting into the lift. I was roasted, roasted before I could die between those heavenly thighs.<br></div>
