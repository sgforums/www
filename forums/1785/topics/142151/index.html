            <div class='col-md body'>When a relationship between two individuals is discussed, do we mean the dynamic that goes on in private between these two individuals, or the relationship which interacts with the world around it?<br><br>Of course, the relationship is present in public or private, but the degree to which the couple identify with it, and give up their individual identities to become it, is of utmost improtance. There are no hard and fast rules for such surrender to the relationship.<br><br>In some cases, or at certain times in the life of a relationship, it will be neccessary for the couple to pull back and affirm his or her own individual identity once more, perhaps even to the point of setting out once again on his or her own path. However, peak experiences between two people are only really possible through surrender....that is, giving up a good measure of individual ego in service of the relationship.<br><br>Each person will get something back that is much more valuable.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">LOVE</span><br><br>It should be noted that love means different things to different people. In addition, every type of relationship probably involves some sort of love, to a greater or lesser extent.<br><br>In most relationships, psychological projection, replaying scripts from childhood acting out, and a whole host of emotions including jealousy, anger, a desire to dominate and control, nurturing and protective impulses, violence, narcissism, idolatry, and even worship struggle for the ascendancy. Maddening, exalting, thrilling and frustrating, the promise of love continues to drive human beings into these situations in their search for the perfect partner.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">MARRIAGE</span><br><br>In an age in which over half of marriages end in divorce, it is puzzling why so many people still get married. What is even more puzzling is why they take the oath to love each other exclusively in the light of statistics on infidelity. Yet marriage is a powerful social institution, and the raising of children within the conjugal family unit is still the widely accepted norm.<br><br>It cannot be assumed that love is always the main motivating factor in marriage or the one that holds such units together. The emphasis in this area is on pointing out matchup strengths having to do with shared values that are of a more practical, financial, social, intellectual or aesthetic nature.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">FRIENDSHIP</span><br><br>Deep friendship has elements of love and marriage built into it. Two friends can be extremely self- sufficient and not in need of much external input. Should such friends also be engaged in professional ventures with each other, they may in fact spend much more time together than lovers or spouses. If one makes a list of close friends, it is quite likely that their birthdays are not spread out equally around the year but are clumped into certain areas.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">FAMILY</span><br><br>Family relationships. Here some of the most possessive and destructive drives of human beings come out, whereby many parents are too prone to push their children to make up for their own failures and inadequacies. Parents and children are urged to build bonds of trust and acceptance, because sooner or later they will have to confront their problems and come to some sort of peace with each other.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">WORK</span><br><br>Most work relationships are fortuitous; two individuals are thrown together in an office or other work unit and have to make the best of it. However, it may be useful for personnel officers to check on whether two people working closely have compatible personalities. Certain work relationships are more likely to develop into productive friendships than others.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Keys To A Good and Lasting Relationship</span><br><br>1. Listen to what your partner is saying.<br><br>2. Truly share. Solely giving or taking is not the answer, but only a combination of the two in equal measure.<br><br>3. Give unconditionally. To give while expecting a return or certain results is the same as paying for something.<br><br>4. Kindness, understanding, trust and consideration are worth more than all the selfish pleasure you can gain. If you are in it only for what you can get, forget about meaningful relationships.<br><br>5. Don't let anyone treat you abusively. Demand respect.<br><br>6. By refusing to make decisions, express disapproval or take a stand, you may really be just avoiding taking responsibility for your own actions. Fear of rejection is usually behind such an agreeable facade.<br><br>7. Beware of possessiveness and claiming behavior. Your partner is his or her own person and should never be treated as an object or possession.<br><br>8. Refuse to allow others to push your buttons. One trick is to grow a whole new set of buttons that cannot be pushed so easily.<br><br>9. Much can be learned from self-observation. In the midst of an argument, try backing off and observing yourself. By being both the observer and observed, you will increase your awareness.<br><br>10. Control your aggressive and violent side. At the same time, seek outlets for your feelings and do not repress them. Working out differences through calm discussion is often the best way.<br><br>11. Learn to postpone your gratification through patience, trust, and understanding.<br><br>12. Acceptance is important but does not imply agreement. Agree to disagree. Do not insist that you and your partner must see eye to eye.<br><br>13. Try to distinguish between needs and wants. What you seem to want most is not what you really need, in most cases.<br><br>14. Be sensitive to kairos, the right time for an action to take place. What will work well under one set of circumstances will be entirely wasted under another.<br><br>15. Respect your partner's space.<br></div>
