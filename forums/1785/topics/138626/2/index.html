            <div class='col-md body'>One day in class the teacher brought a bag full of fruit.<br>"Now class, I'm going to reach into the bag and describe a piece of fruit, and you tell what fruit I'm talking about.<br><br>Okay, first: it's round, plumb and red." Of course, Johnny raised his hand high, but the teacher, wisely ignored him and picked Deborah, who promptly answered "An apple." The teacher replied, "No Deborah, it's a beet, but I like your thinking."<br><br>Now for the second. It's soft, fuzzy,and colored red and brownish." Well, Johnny is hopping up and down in his seat trying to get the teacher to call on him. But she skips him again and calls on Billy. "Is it a peach?" Billy asks. "No, Billy, I'm afraid it's a potato. But I like your thinking," the teacher replys.<br><br>Here's another: it's long, yellow, and fairly hard." By now Johnny is about to explode as he waves his hand frantically. The teacher skips him again and calls on Sally. "A banana," she says. "No," the teacher replies, "it's a squash, but I like your thinking."<br><br>Johnny is kind of irritated now, so he speaks up loudly. "Hey, I've got one for you teacher; let me put my hand in my pocket. Okay, I've got it: it's round, hard, and it got a head on it." "Johnny!" she cries. "That's disgusting!" "Nope," answers Johnny, "it's a quarter, but I like your thinking!"<br><br></div>

His father sees it and says, "Johnny, how many times do I have to tell you not to fight with the other boys?"<br><br>"But Dad, it wasn't my fault. We were all in church saying our prayers. We all stood up and my teacher in front of me had her dress in the crack of her butt. I reached over and pulled it out. That's when she hit me!"<br><br>"Johnny," the father said. "You don't do those kind of things to women."<br><br>Sure enough, the very next day Johnny came home with the other eye black and blue. Johnny's father said, "Johnny, I thought we had a talk!"<br><br>"But Dad," Johnny said, "It wasn't my fault. There we were in church saying our prayers. We all stood up and my teacher in front of us had her dress in the crack of her butt. Then Louie who was sitting next to me saw it and he reached over and pulled it out.

I might consider a nuclear  attack or a serious personal injury or illness, or a death  in your immediate family but that's it, no other excuses  whatsoever!"<br><br>A smart-ass guy in the back of the room raised his hand  and asks, "What would you say if tomorrow I said I was  suffering from complete and utter sexual exhaustion?"  The entire class does its best to stifle their laughter and  snickering.<br><br>When silence is restored, the teacher smiles  sympathetically at the student, shakes her head, and  sweetly says, "Well, I guess you'd have to write the  exam with your other hand."<br></div>

As they passed a barnyard<br>of mules, goats, and<br>pigs, the husband asked sarcastically,<br>"Relatives of yours?"<br>"Yep," the wife replied, "In-laws."<br><br>WORDS<br>A husband read an article to his wife about how<br>many words women use a<br>day... 30,000 to a man's 15,000.

God<br>made me beautiful so you<br>would be attracted to me;<br>God made me stupid so I would be attracted to<br>you!<br><br>WHO DOES WHAT<br>A man and his wife were having an argument about<br>who should brew the coffee<br>each morning.<br>The wife said, "You should do it, because you get<br>up first, and then we<br>don't have to wait as long to get our coffee."<br>The husband said, " You are in charge of cooking<br>around here and you should<br>do it, because that is your job, and I can just wait<br>for my coffee."<br>Wife replies, "No, you should do it, and besides, it<br>is in the Bible that<br>the man should do the coffee."<br>Husband replies, "I can't believe that, show me."<br>So she fetched the Bible, and opened the New<br>Testament and showed him at<br>the top of several pages, that it indeed<br>says.......... "HEBREWS"<br><br>THE SILENT TREATMENT<br>A man and his wife were having some problems at<br>home and were giving each<br>other the silent treatment. Suddenly, the man<br>realized that the next day,<br>he would need his wife to wake him at 5:00 AM for<br>an early morning business<br>flight. Not wanting to be the first to break the<br>silence (and LOSE), he<br>wrote on a piece of paper, "Please wake m e at<br>5:00 AM." He left it where he<br>knew she would find it.<br><br>The next morning, the man woke up, only to<br>discover it was 9:00 AM and he<br>had missed his flight. Furious, he was about to go<br>and see why his wife<br>hadn't wakened him, when he noticed a piece of<br>paper by the bed.<br><br>The paper said, "It is 5:00 AM. Wake up."<br></div>
