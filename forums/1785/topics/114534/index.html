            <div class='col-md body'>The trap that people fall into is to think they become special by obtaining much knowledge. Their hearts succumb to the security from being different from others, or on the other hand, from being the same as others. Both of these are meaningless. The one to compare with Is oneself. It is not to compare oneself with others. Today's self, rather than yesterday's. Tomorrow's self, rather than today's.<br><br>Luna<br>Nagoya City, Aichi<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you respect someone, and feel exactly the same, and like the same people, and do the same things, you would be nothing more than a puppet. Everyone has a different experience of life, and the things they have learned are also different. Learning is necessary in order to look at something from different angles, but even then, people feel and think according to the wisdom they have gained in their lives.<br><br>What is beautiful is beautiful, what is splendid is splendid, what I like is what I like. I have come to this point just by that. I've lived my life for no more than about eight years though. No matter what others say, I cannot throw away the feeling that I am happy. This is because no matter how humbly I listen to what others say, it is not for others to decide how I feel.<br><br>Luna<br>Funabashi City, Chiba<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When people feel that they know more facts than others, they wish to convey them.<br><br>Then when their trials do not go smoothly, they feel discontent.<br><br>For the person conveying, it is self-evident, so sometimes they feel irritated about why people do not understand.<br><br>The more you try to impose on people anything that is different from their common sense, the more strongly they tend to feel like denying it.<br><br>So even if it is frustrating, something imposed on others cannot become the truth.<br><br>If you want to share with others what you are aware of, please just show it and do not point out mistakes.<br><br>Just take action and show it yourself. As long as you feel you have to correct people or to point out their mistakes, even the things you thought you had become aware of cease to be the truth.<br><br>If you simply have the will to simply convey and to show yourself, and as long as the awareness is not something that comes from ego or attachment, then someday people will become aware.<br><br>Luna<br>Morioka City, Iwate<br></div>

It is all right.<br><br>Of course at that time it is also important to think of the people around you, but you and those people were originally one.<br><br>Please feel what goes on around you. If you always remember this, you will have no problem.<br><br>You can look back once in a while. You can even worry.<br><br>But do not be afraid.
