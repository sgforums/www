They said that it was possible that the plane was in trouble soon after the pilot began the drill for take-off but he could not abandon it.<br><br>Another pilot told the news channel here that the aircraft was possibly overloaded and had difficulty attaining the required height.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-09-06/6c.jpg"><br>ESCAPING DEATH: A survivor of the plane crash in a Medan hospital yesterday with his family at his bedside. -- AFP<br>All eyes will now be set on the probe. The jet's blackbox has already been found, the head of the National Transport Safety Committee, Mr Setyo Raharjo said.<br><br>Seven committee members are also now on site to investigate the crash, he said.<br><br>The crash, meanwhile, has raised fresh concerns about aviation safety in Indonesia.<br><br>In December, a plane operated by Lion Air, a budget airline, skidded off the runway in Solo killing 26 people on board.<br><br>Indonesia's worst crash was in September 1997, when a Garuda Airbus smashed into mountains near Medan, killing all 232 people on board.<br><br>It had flown from Medan's Polonia airport when the sky was clouded with thick smog from forest fires in Riau.<br><br>salim@sph.com.sg<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>STRING OF AIR DISASTERS<br>YESTERDAY'S plane crash in Medan was the sixth deadly one this year - all involving small airlines. In one particularly horrific nine-day stretch last month, three disasters took place. The crashes were:<br><br>Aug 23: A Tans airline Boeing 737-200 crashed on an internal flight in Peru, near the city of Pucallpa. At least 40 people died.<br><br>Aug 16: A Colombian plane operated by West Caribbean Airways crashed in a remote region of Venezuela, killing all 160 people on board.<br><br>Aug 14: A Helios Airways flight from Cyprus to Prague, with 121 people on board, went down north of the Greek capital Athens, apparently after a drop in cabin pressure.<br><br>July 16: An Equatair plane crashed soon after take-off from Equatorial Guinea's island capital, Malabo, west of the mainland, killing all 60 people on board.<br><br>Feb 3: The wreckage of a Kam Air Boeing 737 flight was found in mountains near the Afghan capital Kabul, two days after the plane with 104 people aboard went down.<br><br>The above crashes led to several countries, including France and Belgium, publishing blacklists of airlines banned from their territories for safety reasons.<br><br></div>
