            <div class='col-md body'>Crystal Palace have granted Aston Villa permission to use on-loan keeper Gabor Kiraly in the FA Cup on Saturday.<br><br>Eagles boss Peter Taylor has confirmed that Villa will be able to field the Hungarian shot stopper in the third round clash against Manchester United as part of his emergency loan move.<br><br>Kiraly joined Martin O'Neill's side in December after injuries to both Stuart Taylor and Thomas Sorensen, and will now get the chance to add to his five appearances at Old Trafford after Taylor's decision.<br><br>"If Aston Villa need Gabor for the FA Cup, then we are willing to allow him to play for them," said Taylor.<br><br>Meanwhile O'Neill has revealed that youngster Gabriel Agbonlahor has been nursing an ankle injury in Villa's last two games against Charlton and Chelsea.<br><br>The forward has been in impressive form so far this season and his boss is delighted with the contribution Agbonlahor has made in recent months.<br><br>"We have been tested to the limit and Gabriel in the last two games has played through the pain barrier after hurting his ankle early on against Tottenham," revealed O'Neill.<br><br>"In normal circumstances we would rest him, but the opportunity has not been there. We have less chance to rotate than most.<br><br>"If you had said to him at the start of the season that he would play eight to 10 games then I am sure he would have taken that.<br><br>"But he has not missed a single minute of a single game and he has been really excellent for us.<br><br>"He has had to grow up very quickly and has responded in the right way. I have been delighted with him."</div>
