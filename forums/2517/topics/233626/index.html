            <div class='col-md body'>Milan Baros has claimed he was close to joining Chelsea before making the switch to Lyon.<br><br>The Czech Republic international left Aston Villa for Lyon on Monday to link up again with former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier.<br><br>Baros claims he was sounded out about a move to Chelsea by Jose Mourinho after the Premiership meeting between the two sides on January 2.<br><br>However, the move broke down because of Shaun Wright-Phillips' reluctance to move to Villa in a swap deal.<br><br>"I agreed [to the move] with Chelsea. It was practically a finished thing," Baros told Czech daily Sport.<br><br>"Everything broke down over the fact Wright-Phillips did not want to go to Aston Villa.<br><br>"And coach [Martin] OÂ´Neill told me that without any replacement, he would not let me go as he would not have any strikers left."<br><br>Baros admitted he was interested in a move to Chelsea after being approached by Mourinho<br><br>"We just spoke about the match," added Baros.<br><br>"Just after the game in the tunnel he told me that he wanted me to join the team and asked me if I was interested. I told him so. But it did not happen in the end."<br><br>When asked if he was sorry the move did not come off, Baros replied: "I would be sorry if I went to a worse club, but now I am at Lyon."<br><br>Baros also aimed a swipe at Villa saying he was happy he had left the club after struggling to find his best form during his time at Villa Park.<br><br>"I was injured, the club fought against relegation in the first season," said Baros."They are close to the bottom again.<br><br>"This does not help an individual and it is difficult to shine. And we did not play in Europe.<br><br>"I do not want to make excuses, Aston Villa was not a good contract for me and I am glad it is over."</div>
