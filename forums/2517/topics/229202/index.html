            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho insists he will not pay 'crazy money', as he looks to bolster his defence.<br><br>The Blues have been strongly linked with a move for Manchester City star Micah Richards, as they look to strengthen their defence.<br><br>Chelsea's defensive problems increased on Tuesday night, with Khalid Boulahrouz facing a month out after picking up a knee injury against Aston Villa and Ricardo Carvalho facing a suspension.<br><br>Mourinho admits he is keen to bring in a new defender, but is adamant he will not be paying over the odds for any player with reports suggesting City are demanding Â£18 million for Richards.<br><br>"The game against Macclesfield is a problem for us, we don't have players to play and it is a problem," said Mourinho.<br><br>"You know I keep saying it is clear, it is obvious that we need (a defender). We start the season with only three central defenders and in this moment, we only have one and even Ricardo is suspended for the game against Wycombe.<br><br>"So against Wycombe, we don't have one central defender, so it is obvious we need (a defender).<br><br>"But I am telling you with the reality of the English market, I prefer to play with assistant Baltemar Brito as a central defender.<br><br>"He is 55, he was good central defender and I would rather play him than pay the crazy money that people are looking. I promise you, I prefer that.<br><br>"It is everybody, not just Manchester City.<br><br>"We didn't even speak with any club, but just because of the smell that Chelsea needs one central defender at least puts people dreaming or thinking we are stupid.<br><br>"I would love an Aston Martin, but if you ask me (for) Â£1million for an Aston Martin, I tell you, you are crazy because they cost Â£250,000."<br><br>Mourinho also admitted Chelsea made a mistake in allowing William Gallas to leave the club, as they never really replaced him.<br><br>"I take some responsibility (for the defensive problems)," added Mourinho.<br><br>"When Gallas had gone, he had gone on the last day and when he goes, we had no time to replace him.<br><br>"It was in difficult circumstances and it was the club's responsibility to do it and of course, I am part of the club."</div>
