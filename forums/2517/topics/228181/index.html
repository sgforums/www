            <div class='col-md body'>Marcel Desailly says Chelsea have lost an on-field manager in injured captain John Terry.<br><br>The England captain is likely facing up to a month on the sidelines, as he tries to recover from successful back surgery in France on Thursday.<br><br>Terry has already missed Chelsea's last four games with the back problem, and Chelsea legend Desailly feels his absence is a major blow for Jose Mourinho's side.<br><br>"I know the influence John has on the team," the former Nantes, Marseille and Milan defender told The Sun.<br><br>"Although Didier Drogba has been the difference in many games this season, John is probably the most important player at the club.<br><br>"He is the manager on the pitch. He's not afraid to take responsibility because he is the man.<br><br>"When the team is in trouble, he is able to lift his level and show the other players the spirit they should have.<br><br>"He knows how to correct the team when something goes wrong.<br><br>"This might even mean doing the opposite of what Mourinho has told them - but John is not afraid to do that because he's the one who sees the reality on the pitch.<br><br>"And he is very important in the dressing room. He is strong and defiant and manages to organise everything. He provides stability for the team."<br><br>Desailly thinks Terry has the capabilities of emulating the legendary career of Milan centre-back Paolo Maldini.<br><br>"I want John to reach the same level as Paolo, who I played with at AC Milan," added the France World Cup winner.<br><br>"He has been at the very top level for 20 years and John is capable of doing the same.<br><br>"I cross my fingers that he can get over this injury and go on to become the best defender in the world. I think he can do it.<br><br>"He can really be the image of Chelsea, making new players understand the spirit of the club and the story of where it has come from."</div>
