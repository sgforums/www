            <div class='col-md body'>Gombak United chairman John Yap has hailed Ishak Zainol as a Â‘strategicÂ’ signing for the club as it plots for a strong showing in the coming S.League season.<br><br>The 26-year-old, who moved from league champions SAFFC in December, will be making his return to the club where he started his professional career five years ago.<br><br>During that period, which also saw him play for Sengkang Marine and Tanjong Pagar United, Ishak matured into a competent defensive midfielder for both club and country.<br><br>And Yap is confident that taking Ishak back in will unlock a new set of possibilities for Gombak, who will now have expanded options in both central defence and midfield.<br><br>The Bulls, who finished eighth last season, often found themselves limited on cover in the middle, crossing their fingers on the uninterrupted availability of Nigerian anchor Obadin Gabriel Aikhena and Thai playmaker Theerawesin Seehawong.<br><br>The backline too has been an area of concern, with only three orthodox central defenders available, leaving the team vulnerable to manpower shortages there as well.<br><br>The addition of Ishak could solve both problems at a stroke, allowing Gombak coach Salim Moin to tweak his midfield as required for more offensive bite or defensive steel.<br><br>The prospect clearly brings much delight to Yap, who sees Ishak as pivotal to the clubÂ’s target of finishing in the top half of the 12-team table this year.<br><br>Â“Gabriel and Theerawesin were a very good combination last year, but we were caught short whenever one of them was injured or suspended,Â” he told sleague.com.<br><br>Â“And with only Precious (Emuejeraye), Winston (Yap) and Jaslee Hatta in central defence, we also looked short-handed there. Ishak coming in will allow us to either move Gabriel into defence or shift Theerawesin to the right to cover for Ruhaizad (Ismail).<br><br>Â“The decision to sign Ishak is actually very strategic. Looking at our squad last season, I realized we didnÂ’t really need to make that many new signings.<br><br>Â“But what we were missing the whole season was a player who would give us the flexibility to change things around. Getting Ishak will put things in place for our team, and I think weÂ’ll play much better football.Â”<br><br>IshakÂ’s move to Gombak comes after a disappointing 2006 season at Choa Chu Kang, where he became an increasingly marginal member of SAFFCÂ’s title-winning squad.<br><br>A virtual ever-present for the Warriors in 2005, Ishak managed only 17 starts for the team last season, and was mostly limited to inconsequential cameo appearances after July.<br><br>Failing to hold down a first-team place at club level had an effect on his international career as well, as the midfielder who was capped 12 times faded out of national coach Radojko AvramovicÂ’s plans after his last call-up against Malaysia in May.<br><br>The decision to move thus represents an excellent opportunity for Ishak to re-establish himself in the local football scene. In Yap, he has a chairman sympathetic to his cause.<br><br>Â“Ishak didnÂ’t get to play much towards the end of last year, because Therdsak (Chaiman) and John Wilkinson worked so well together in midfield for SAFFC,Â” noted Yap.<br><br>Â“Over at my side, I think his chances of playing would be a lot higher. He wonÂ’t be guaranteed a place in the first eleven, but I think he will have an impact on the midfield.<br><br>Â“Ishak is a talented guy who isnÂ’t just good defensively, but can also shine as a playmaker. His arrival will give us tremendous range in our options.<br><br>Â“Whether he will be successful here depends on him, but I am hopeful he can establish himself and get the chance to get back into the national team.Â”<br><br>Gombak are expected to make at least one more signing before the closure of the transfer window in early February, with Yap identifying the attack as an area that could use some strengthening.<br><br>Forward Tan Kian Chong has been released after injuring his knee in November, while the club has yet to agree terms with Alfred Emuejeraye, who had a heavy hand in many of GombakÂ’s 48 league goals last season.<br><br>The former Grasshoppers Zurich striker, currently on trials in England, has asked for a salary that Yap described as Â“very demandingÂ”.<br><br>Yap is nonetheless optimistic that there is still room for negotiation, although he is already looking for backup options from Nigeria should the 23-year-old not return.<br><br>The club is also understood to be in talks with Agu Casmir, who had earlier declared his decision not to stay at Woodlands Wellington, for whom he had scored 17 goals in 2006.<br><br>Should Casmir sign for the Bulls, his physical presence will significantly boost a team that already features Ojimi Gabriel Obatola, Ruhaizad Ismail and Norfahazly Kamsan.<br><br>Â“We struggled through some games early last season, and things only got better when Alfred arrived and improved our scoring,Â” reflected Yap.<br><br>Â“One more signing in that area will round off the whole team very nicely. I want to make sure that the teamÂ’s firepower is absolutely stronger than it was last year.<br><br>Â“I feel Agu is more misunderstood than what is presented publicly. Looking at the boy and whether he can fit in and be happy here, I think there is still a fair chance, so itÂ’s worth trying to sign him up.<br><br>Â“A combination of him, OJ and Alfred will spell catastrophe for our opponents. I will definitely not be fearful about our team not having goals, thatÂ’s for sure.Â”<br><br>Gombak are also looking at beefing up their Prime League squad by exercising the option to sign up to two foreigners below the age of 23, as is allowed under the 2007 rules.<br><br>One prospective signing is PreciousÂ’ younger brother Emmanuel, who has already donned Gombak colours in the Centre of Excellence Under-18 league last year.<br><br>EmmanuelÂ’s entry is expected to compensate for the loss of Goh Swee Swee, who has moved to Home United after top-scoring for the Bulls with six Prime League goals.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve signed a few boys from the Gombak academy, and IÂ’m looking at signing Emmanuel,Â” revealed Yap.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s played for me at Under-18 level and scored quite a number of goals. He is very enthusiastic and urging me to promote him, but IÂ’ve told him to wait while I get all the terms and rules in place first.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve had quite a few players featuring in the Prime League who are exceptionally good, like Armanizam (Dolah), Idros (Jamid) and Syed Karim. Some of them have featured for us once or twice in the S.League, and I hope theyÂ’ll keep on growing.Â”</div>
