            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson is concerned by Wayne Rooney's dip in goalscoring form, but still expects his 'big game player' to shine in Sunday's clash with Arsenal.<br><br>The England striker has eight goals so far this season, but has cut a frustrated figure since his last strike against Manchester City on 9 December.<br><br>"Â“He is a big-game player," said Sir Alex. "You could say, in a lot of cases, it was bad luck. In the cup game against Villa he had nine attempts at goal.<br><br>"In the last game (also against Villa) he had a fantastic strike which hit the bar. He just needs a little break. I'm concerned by it."<br><br>Only a combination of near misses, outstanding saves and battered woodwork have contrived to deny Rooney a hatful of goals in recent weeks.<br><br>The Gaffer wants Rooney to start picking up a succession of single goals rather than the sporadic gluts in which they have come so far this term.<br><br>"What he needs to do is get these odd goals," conceded Sir Alex. "He has had spells of two and three. He needs to get into scoring a goal a game. If he can do that he would make a big difference in the title run-in."<br><br>Despite his lack of fortune in front of goal, Rooney's application levels have never wavered below outstanding all season - a trait which delights the Boss.<br><br>"It is an example of a great player. He is prepared to work as hard as everyone else. It tells the rest of the players 'although I'm a great player, I work as hard as anyone'. It's a fantastic attitude and example.<br><br>"He is working his socks off the boy. He has a terrific attitude and we are happy with that."</div>
