            <div class='col-md body'>Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill will come face to face with veteran striker Henrik Larsson once again when Villa meet Manchester United in the third round of the FA Cup.<br><br>Larsson played under O'Neill and gave him sterling service during his time as Celtic boss.<br><br>The two will now be reunited - though on opposing teams - on Sunday after Larsson joined Premiership leaders United on a three-month loan deal earlier this week from Swedish side Helsingborgs. He is expected to go straight into the side.<br><br>O'Neill believes the 35-year-old Swede can be successful during his loan period in England but admits he did not consider trying to tempt him to Villa Park for fear of affecting the relationship he had with the forward.<br><br>"Henrik has been and still is a quality player," O'Neill said. "He is also not too old either.<br><br>"I can see exactly why Sir Alex Ferguson has gone for him because he will need a number of quality players in January-February and Henrik is certainly that.<br><br>"He owes me absolutely nothing and I am hoping that is reciprocated as well. I wish him all the best and he will do wonderfully well.<br><br>"Those days with Henrik at Celtic have passed and if it was only to get him for a couple of months, it is not eventually where I want Aston Villa to go.<br><br>"It doesn't mean I wouldn't want some experienced players around me. But I don't really want to ruin a decent relationship that I had with him.<br><br>"He might have arrived here and maybe found life wasn't so rosy and maybe I didn't pick him in games. I really don't want a Henrik Larsson knocking on my door every single day saying I should have started games."</div>
