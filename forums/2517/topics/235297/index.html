            <div class='col-md body'>Massimo Maccarone has launched an outspoken and barbed diatribe in the direction of England coach Steve McClaren, a man he played under at Middlesbrough.<br><br>The Italian striker, who has now returned to his homeland with Siena after a disappointing five years in England, believes McClaren's time on Teesside was characterised by false promises, which were all too often broken.<br><br>Quoted in Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, Maccarone has not minced his words in issuing a candid assessment of both McClaren's management style and character.<br><br>"The 'magnificent' McClaren is surely the most hypocritical and false person I have had the misfortune of meeting," he told Gazzetta dello Sport's official website.<br><br>"He disgusted me by leaving me on the bench for the 2004 League Cup final after having told everyone I was his number one and he was counting on me.<br><br>"At the end all he could do was mutter 'I know, I know'.<br><br>"Only in England can someone with such evident limits become the head of the national team."<br><br>Maccarone did not reserve his scorn for McClaren alone, with current Boro incumbent Gareth Southgate also feeling the rough edge of the player's tongue.<br><br>"When he (Southgate) was a player all he did was tell me I had to resist McClaren's mistreatment," he added.<br><br>"He had promised me he would give me a run of six to eight games. He never kept it (the promise). Maybe that's the English way of doing things but for me a promise is a promise."<br><br>Maccarone's agent, Paolo Fabbri, has been quick to play down his client's outburst, of the opinion that perhaps some of these comments have been taken out of context or misconstrued.<br><br>"I am really doubtful whether Massimo would be so rude as to criticise Steve McClaren and Gareth Southgate in this way," he said.<br><br>"Yes, he was very upset not to play more often, any player would be, and yes, he might have specific points to make about McClaren and Southgate on a technical level - but I do not believe his frustrations go beyond that.<br><br>"When he knows what is being said in his name, I am sure Massimo will be pretty upset because it is just not his style to be so rude and make comments of such a personal nature."</div>
