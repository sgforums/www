He could be an exciting player for us."<br><br>The deal is subject to a work permit being granted and is unlikely to be the only transfer activity at The Riverside this month.<br><br>"We're progressing on a couple of fronts," Southgate added on the club's website. "We will have a couple of players moving on but there's nothing completed yet.<br><br>"If we can get quality that improves us we will strive to do that."</div>
