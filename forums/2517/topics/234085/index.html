            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has bristled at suggestions from Arsene Wenger that Manchester United lack stamina, branding the Frenchman's reputed comments as 'petty'.<br><br>Following Arsenal's late 2-1 win over United on Sunday, Gunners midfielder Mathieu Flamini claimed that Wenger had told his troops that their great rivals would tire in the final stages.<br><br>The implicit indication that his team cannot last the course has angered Ferguson, and the Scot has now reignited a war of words with Wenger which has largely lain dormant since the arrival of Jose Mourinho in England.<br><br>The United boss has accused his Arsenal rival of being 'petty', and making the comments in order to inflate his own sense of self-worth.<br><br>"In the game against Arsenal, (was it) a lack of concentration? 'Yes'," said Ferguson.<br><br>"From a winning position, we were all gutted. It was disappointing, but in terms of the stamina side of it, it's absolute nonsense.<br><br>"I thought it was a bit petty, coming out with that nonsense.<br><br>"There's absolutely no evidence. In terms of endurance and that kind of thing, we are well in control of that.<br><br>"I'm not sure [why he said it]. I think it's maybe making him look great again. 'I'm the great Arsene Wenger'.<br><br>"If they'd lost the game 1-0, what could he have said? Which they should have done."<br><br>However, Wenger has strongly denied questioning United's stamina, instead insisting that he merely told his players to remember how Emmanuel Adebayor scored late on in the 1-0 win at Old Trafford earlier in the season.<br><br>"I did not say they crumble in the last 20 minutes," said Wenger.<br><br>"At half-time [last Sunday] it was still 0-0. I said: 'Continue to play until the last minute because remember at Old Trafford, we scored in the last five minutes'.<br><br>"Of course, after there was a big analysis that they concede more goals in the last 20 minutes - but most of the time, that is because they lead and teams have a go at them.<br><br>"Manchester United are top of the league - and if they are top of the league, that means they do not collapse."</div>
