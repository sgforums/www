            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Martins stuns Spurs in thriller</strong><br><br>Obafemi Martins inspired Newcastle to record a 3-2 victory at Tottenham Hotspur in a game that was the very definition of a five-goal thriller.<br><br>The Magpies looked destined for defeat in the face of some determined and inventive attacking football from Spurs, but summoned the necessary character to record their first win in four games and move into 11th place in the Premiership after instigating a superb turnaround.<br><br>Martin Jol's side had already seen Paul Huntington reply to Jermain Defoe's opener when Dimitar Berbatov seemingly struck the decisive blow on 54 minutes, but Martins awoke from his slumber to transform the game in the space of 90 seconds.<br><br>The summer signing from Internazionale rifled a stunning effort past Paul Robinson on 72 minutes before then playing in Nicky Butt for the unlikely winner in what was a non-stop game at White Hart Lane.<br><br>Spurs' irresistible attacking play forced Shay Given to make a series of saves within the first 15 minutes as the North Londoners threatened to overwhelm their Geordie opponents.<br><br>Steed Malbranque and Berbatov were both denied by the Magpies' stand-in captain, but Given reserved his best save for Defoe when he somehow clawed the England striker's downward header off the line.<br><br>However, on 14 minutes Spurs made the inevitable breakthrough after quarter of an hour of relentless attacking, and whilst their efforts certainly merited a goal, the strike itself was highly contentious.<br><br>Malbranque found acres of space down the left hand side and as he flicked the ball across goal Defoe simply slotted past Given from close range despite appearing to be in an offside position.<br><br>Inside two minutes the scoreline changed again, but remarkably it was Newcastle, with their first chance of the game, who silenced the previously jubilant White Hart Lane crowd.<br><br>Young defender Huntington, following in the footsteps of David Edgar who scored from left-back against Manchester United, drilled a shot in off Paul Robinson from a tight angle after his header from a set-piece had only bounced back off Antoine Sibierski at the back post.<br><br>The goal came like a bolt from the blue and knocked Spurs off their stride, but Malbranque tried to recapture their swagger when he lofted the ball just wide from nearly 35 yards after Given had rushed out of his box to clear.<br><br>In an open, attacking game that was a superb advert for all that is best about the high-octane Premiership, Sibierski and Martins both went close, whilst Given continued to sparkle at the other end as he got down quickly to block Aaron Lennon's effort.<br><br>In the last five minutes of the first half Berbatov began to exert more influence on the game with two more shots at Given's under-siege goal, and the efforts continued to come thick and fast as Defoe tried to chip the shot-stopper from 25 yards before fizzing another shot wide.<br><br>Both sides had adrenalin coursing through their veins following a breathless first 45 minutes, and tempers boiled over after the half time whistle as Pascal Chimbonda and Butt became involved in a physical confrontation which saw yellow cards issued to both players.<br><br>Given had also become infuriated with the antics of Berbatov and Chimbonda as he tried to take goal-kicks, and as both teams trudged down the tunnel both sets of players started jostling to add to the drama of an lively evening at White Hart Lane.<br><br>Young Magpies midfielder Matty Pattison went close with a header from James Milner's deep cross early in the second half, but Spurs got the second goal their efforts clearly deserved through Berbatov on 54 minutes.<br><br>The Bulgarian's bouncing volley evaded both Given and Solano, and came immediately after the Peruvian had produced a fantastic sliding block to deny Teemu Tainio.<br><br>Soon after, Defoe blasted a shot from outside the box as Given was again forced to stem the tide of Spurs' attacks, and Tom Huddlestone joined in with a shot that flew only inches wide after taking a deflection off Dyer.<br><br>However, inside two minutes The Magpies turned the game on its head and Martins was the catalyst with a superb finish on 72 minutes.<br><br>After playing a square ball to Dyer the Nigerian striker drifted out to the left side of the Spurs box, and after receiving the ball back from his colleague hit a stunning  shot into the top corner that seared past Robinson like laser-guided missile.<br><br>The former Internazionale man was instrumental in Newcastle's third just a minute later, as he played a neat reverse pass to Butt who slid his shot past the dumbfounded Robinson for a barely believable lead given Tottenham's previous dominance.<br><br>Jol threw on Robbie Keane in a bid to find an equaliser, and the Republic of Ireland international quickly saw a goal-bound effort blocked by the arm of Solano as The Magpies rode their luck.<br><br>Berbatov also headed just wide and Defoe went closer still when he rattled the post with a venomous shot after 80 minutes, but despite their multitude of chances Spurs could not take what would have been a deserved point in a game that will live long in the memory.</div>

It is a matter of opinion but it is Shay for me.<br><br>"Nicky Butt, I can say now, has been in bed with a heavy dose of flu for five days, has lost nine pounds in weight before the game.<br><br>"I don't think many players could get off their sick bed and play the way he played, he was magnificent, and of course Oba Martins scored the goal that showed you what Oba Martins is all about - unstoppable."</div>
