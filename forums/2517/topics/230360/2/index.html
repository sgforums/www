I don't want them to go down," Roeder told the Mirror.<br><br>"I have never wished them any ill-will despite everything that has happened.<br><br>"What hurt most of all is I am a kid from East London. My own turned on me.<br><br>"I didn't think they scratched the surface deep enough or showed enough intelligence to see the problems I had when I was at the club.<br><br>"This weekend's game is not about me against West Ham though.<br><br>"It is about Newcastle and the three points we need, for different reasons, every bit as much as they do. We can never fully repay how badly we let our supporters down in the FA Cup against Birmingham.<br><br>"The greatest pleasure I get when we get three points is sending them home happy or down into the town to enjoy themselves. I'll be thinking about them, not West Ham's fans."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Magpies fight back for point</strong><br><br>Newcastle produced a superb fightback as they came from two goals down to claim a home point against West Ham.<br><br>The Hammers raced into a two-goal lead thanks to goals from Carlton Cole and Marlon Harewood and they threatened to run riot just as Birmingham had done in midweek.<br><br>However, James Milner reduced the arrears on the stroke of half-time and, having dominated the second half, a penalty from Nolberto Solano secured a point for the home side.<br><br>Returning skipper Scott Parker attempted to rally the Newcastle troops with a pre-game huddle, but it failed to have the desired effect as The Magpies looked short of confidence in the early stages and Yossi Benayoun should have done better when lashing wildly over the bar from 12 yards on eight minutes.<br><br>The powerful figure of Harewood escaped the attentions of Peter Ramage and forced a save from Shay Given, who moments later clasped a free-kick from Nigel Quashie as West Ham called the tune in the early stages.<br><br>Newcastle were made to pay for failing to stamp their authority on the game as Cole popped up on 18 minutes to score West Ham's first away goal in the Premiership since August.<br><br>A devilish corner from Luis Boa Morte caused panic in the Newcastle box, Calum Davenport climbed high and headed back across goal for Cole to volley home from close range.<br><br>Newcastle at least reared their head above the parapet after slipping behind and Obafemi Martins had a weak header saved by Roy Carroll.<br><br>Harewood served notice of his threat on 11 minutes and Newcastle failed to heed the warning as the powerful striker doubled West Ham's lead on 22 minutes.<br><br>George McCartney played the ball into the forward, he rolled Ramage far too easily for Newcastle's liking before advancing on goal and stabbing a low shot beyond Given.<br><br>Ramage's misery was compounded on the half-hour mark as he was forced off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury, but shortly after the defender's exit The Magpies fashioned three good chances.<br><br>A neat ball from Milner resulted in Kieron Dyer volleying just over, shortly afterwards Martins tricked his way past Davenport but sliced his shot wide and moments later Alan O'Brien hit the outside of the post with a fine drive.<br><br>Although Newcastle continued to frustrate the St James' Park faithful by giving the ball away, they still created chances and after Roy Carroll had saved from Nicky Butt, The Magpies reduced the arrears on the stroke of half-time.<br><br>Milner had been Newcastle's brightest spark in the first half and he cut onto his left foot and arrowed a shot into the far corner. The goal angered The Hammers, though, as the effort went through Parker's legs before finding its target and he was clearly in an offside position in front of Carroll, but the goal was allowed to stand.<br><br>Newcastle were much more urgent after the break, but it took a slice of luck to hand them the chance to draw level as Boa Morte unfortunately handled after slipping in his own area.<br><br>Solano took the responsibility from 12 yards and confidently tucked the ball home to level the scores.<br><br>The goal brought about a total shift in momentum and Carroll had to be at his best to deny Martins who had been teed-up superbly by Dyer.<br><br>West Ham still carried an aerial threat and Davenport thought he had made himself an instant hero when heading home from a corner, but the debutant was denied a goal for a foul on Paul Huntington.<br><br>Given will be sick of the sight of the claret shirts of West Ham as he was forced off through injury for the second time this season.<br><br>He suffered a serious stomach injury at Upton Park and on this occasion it would appear as if he damaged his groin when attempting to claim a cross.<br><br>Newcastle continued to drive forward and Solano found Dyer with a great cross, but the midfielder was unfortunate to see his effort cannon off the woodwork.<br><br>Substitute Matthew Etherington passed up a decent opportunity for West Ham as, having rounded Steve Harper, he dallied and was crowded out by defenders.<br><br>Carroll has reclaimed the West Ham number one jersey in recent weeks and he proved exactly why in injury-time as he did superbly to thwart Martins with a fine one-handed save as The Hammers took a point back to East London.</div>

"An incident has happened and it is touch and go whether Scott Parker is in a position where he is interfering with their goalkeeper.<br><br>"It would be good to sit down with Keith Hackett (referees' chief) to clear up these grey areas with the offside rule.<br><br>"I am not absolutely certain and people around the game are not certain and it would be nice to have it clarified to stop this controversy."</div>
