            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fulham too good for sorry Toon</strong><br><br>Fulham ensured Newcastle's trip to the capital was a disappointing one as Chris Coleman's men claimed a well deserved 2-1 win at Craven Cottage.<br><br>Newcastle handed a debut to Oguchi Onyewu, but he failed to shore up their defence as Heidar Helguson and Brian McBride claimed a goal apiece.<br><br>The margin of victory could have been greater as Fulham threatened to run riot, but they were caught out late on as Obafemi Martins netted a consolation, and this result will leave Magpies chief Glenn Roeder with much to ponder having failed to really strengthen his squad in January.<br><br>Fulham were dealt a blow prior to kick-off as keeper Antti Niemi had to pull out after damaging his back in the warm-up and was replaced by Jan Lastuvka, but the Czech had a fairly quiet advent to the game as The Cottagers set the tempo.<br><br>Carlos Bocanegra should have done better than heading wide of the post on five minutes having been allowed the freedom of the Newcastle box by Stephen Carr, while Brian McBride drilled a shot wide from distance as Fulham's forwards provided Magpies debutant Onyewu with a tough baptism.<br><br>Newcastle took some 20 minutes to fashion a chance, but it was hardly worthy of the name as Kieron Dyer sliced well wide from Damien Duff's low cross.<br><br>The chance did at least hand Newcastle a foothold in the game and Martins was a constant threat with his pacey running, but they still failed to warm Lastuvka's hands as Scott Parker fired over following a neat turn 25 yards from goal.<br><br>James Milner has been a shining light for Newcastle in recent weeks and he produced a terrific piece of wing play just before the break when tricking his way past Franck Queudrue and threatening to go run amok in the Fulham box, only to be crowded out just as he was about to tee-up Martins.<br><br>Carr's failure to pick up Bocanegra early on almost cost his side dear and a serious misjudgement with a back header was nearly pounced upon by Fulham, but Steve Harper was able to clear his lines.<br><br>Newcastle came within a whisker of opening the scoring moments before the break as Lastuvka made a fine save from Taylor and Onyewu, who settled in well following a shaky start, saw his follow-up effort blocked on the line by fellow American Bocanegra.<br><br>With little inspiration on show, it was no surprise that an error opened door. Nicky Butt inexplicably played a backpass into the path of Helguson who accepted the present with glee as he clipped a shot over Harper.<br><br>Newcastle's response was a free-kick from Milner which flew a foot wide, while at the other end a swerving drive from Michael Brown fizzed narrowly off target.<br><br>Referee Phil Dowd could well find himself on Titus Bramble's Christmas card list, as the official chose to mete out only a yellow card to the defender after he had felled Helguson with the striker set to run in on goal.<br><br>Carr, who was disappointing all afternoon, failed to heed an earlier warning as he allowed Bocanegra to run free in the box and it took a clearance on his own line from Milner to spare his blushes.<br><br>The reprieve was only brief, however, as substitute Papa Bouba Diop, who was only in the squad due to the injury to Niemi, brushed aside the challenge of the hapless Carr before teeing up McBride to slot home.<br><br>Good goalkeeping from Harper and some wayward finishing from Fulham kept the scoreline respectable and Newcastle claimed the scantest of consolations as Martins collected a long ball from Nolberto Solano before slamming home.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Roeder rues display</strong><br><br>Newcastle boss Glenn Roeder was disappointed with his side's display in the 2-1 defeat to Fulham.<br><br>Heidar Helguson and Brian McBride were on target as Fulham dominated the second half at Craven Cottage.<br><br>Obafemi Martins netted a late consolation for Newcastle, but it did not mask a disappointing display from The Magpies.<br><br>"It was a flat performance overall, we set our standards higher than that," he told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"There was not a lot in the first half, at half-time the main thought was to make sure we don't get off to a bad start and work our way in, but that plan went up in smoke when we conceded a poor goal.<br><br>"Nicky Butt has been brilliant for us, but his short backpass has ended up with Helguson knocking the ball over Steve Harper.<br><br>"We found it difficult to pick ourselves up and the second goal was disappointing from a defensive point of view.<br><br>"Stephen Carr was disappointed that he got out-muscled - but there can't be many more powerful players than Diop.<br><br>"We scored a late goal, but we are disappointed."</div>
