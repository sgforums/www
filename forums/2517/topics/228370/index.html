            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson says Manchester United fans are still to see the very best of Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>The 21-year-old has already scored 10 goals this season and produced some sparkling displays as United have built up a four-point lead at the top of the Premiership.<br><br>And Ferguson, who already rates the Portugal international as one of the best players in the world, believes the best is yet to come.<br><br>"He's 21 and I think he will get better," said the United boss.<br><br>"He's showing maturity that we hope all young players start to show and the realisation of their potential as they start to get older.<br><br>"There are very few players who can play wide and attack players like he does. Defenders are not used to handling that type of player. That's why he is such a danger."<br><br>Ronaldo's form has been an even bigger bonus for United particularly in the light of his involvement in the sending off of Wayne Rooney during England's World Cup defeat by Portugal.<br><br>But Ferguson stood by his man then and is now reaping the rewards.<br><br>"We had good experience of that because David Beckham went through the same thing. He survived. The most important thing was to play well and Cristiano has done that," Ferguson added.<br><br>The United boss celebrates his 65th birthday on New Year's Eve and admits retirement is not on his mind.<br><br>"It is just another birthday, but the thing about 65 is that it is a landmark in terms that people do collect their pensions then," he added.<br><br>"I am waiting for the envelope to come through the door. But I feel good and I feel fresh."</div>
