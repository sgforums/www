            <div class='col-md body'>Peter Kenyon says Chelsea are on their way to overtaking Manchester United as the world's biggest football club, ahead of their crunch game on Sunday.<br>Blues' chief executive Kenyon also said they will have to quit Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"By 2014 we want to be internationally recognised as the number one club," he said. "But I think it's pretty clear we can't get to where we want to here."<br><br>But United winger Cristiano Ronaldo hit back, saying Chelsea would fall apart if boss Jose Mourinho left the club.<br><br>He said: "Mourinho is a great coach and he is Portuguese, so I can't speak badly of him.<br><br>"I would like to see what would happen if he were to leave Chelsea. Perhaps they would stop getting good results."<br><br>United go into Sunday's Old Trafford showdown three points clear of champions Chelsea and Ronaldo believes that while United have improved from last season, the Blues have not moved forward.<br><br>"Chelsea are about the same as last year," added Ronaldo. "Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack haven't changed them in terms of their superiority to everybody else.<br><br>"They have to work harder to win games and they only just do enough to win.<br><br>"The rivalry between us and Chelsea exists, but there isn't the same passion as the Manchester derby games or matches against Arsenal or Liverpool."<br><br>Kenyon, meanwhile, does not think Sunday's eagerly-anticipated contest will have any bearing on the outcome of this season's Premiership title.<br><br>"Sunday is not the deciding game, as much as we try to build it up," added Kenyon. "I think we still have a long way to go in the season.<br><br>"I think the team is the best team we've had in the three years I've been here.<br><br>"In depth, I think the squad is tremendous, and I don't actually think we've seen the best of Chelsea at this stage in the season."<br><br>United's Dutch goalkeeer Edwin van der Sar, however, reckons it is the biggest game of the season.<br><br>"It doesn't get much bigger than this," said Van der Sar.<br><br>"When we played them at home last season we were 10 points behind, now we are three ahead, so it goes without saying we are in a better position.<br><br>"I am sure everybody will put what happened against Celtic on Tuesday to the back of their minds and be ready to try and get the result we want against Chelsea."<br></div>
