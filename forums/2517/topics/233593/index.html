            <div class='col-md body'>Carlos Queiroz has labelled stories linking Cristiano Ronaldo with a move to Real Madrid as 'fantasies', in the process reiterating Manchester United's utmost desire to keep the player at Old Trafford.<br><br>Reports emanating from the Spanish press continue to suggest Real Madrid are planning to launch a huge bid in the summer, in an attempt to convince United to sanction the departure of a player now widely regarded as amongst the game's finest.<br><br>On the contrary, Queiroz claims United are preparing a contract extension for the 21-year-old, whose existing deal binds him to the club until 2010.<br><br>"No (to a possible transfer). In addition to that, we are speaking with him about renewing his contract," Queiroz told Marca.<br><br>"The club have a clear policy. It is not necessary that a player has to finish his contract before we think about renewing it.<br><br>"(Ryan) Giggs has been with us for 14 years and he has renewed his contract many times. This club do not need the agents to recognise the work of the players.<br><br>"We anticipate things ourselves and that is what we are going to do with Cristiano."<br><br>Following his World Cup histrionics involving team-mate Wayne Rooney it had been thought Ronaldo had burnt his bridges somewhat in England but Sir Alex Ferguson brokered a reconciliation between the pair and United have not looked back since.<br><br>This season has seen Ronaldo largely rid himself of the 'show-boater' tag which he was synonymous with earlier in his career, as a final product has now been added to an array of flamboyant skills.<br><br>While United would be loath to even consider his possible departure, Madrid are notoriously vigorous in their pursuit of primary targets. This is not, though, something which unduly concerns Queiroz - who remains staunchly convinced United will be able to keep hold of a player who he believes was 'born' to become the world's finest.<br><br>"It is natural that the media talk about Cristiano Ronaldo with Real Madrid," he added. "He is a great player and Madrid are a great club, but it is just speculation.<br><br>"They are fantasies. The football that he is playing in Manchester is an example that he is happy here and he has his head at United. He has talent and is the best in the world.<br><br>"He is always the first to arrive at training and the last to go. Many times when the session has finished, we shower, eat and then we look at the pitch and he is still training.<br><br>"He is a player who has a divine gift. He was born to be the best in the world."</div>
