            <div class='col-md body'>New Uefa president Michel Platini is determined to push ahead with his controversial changes for the UEFA Champions League.<br><br>The former Juventus and France star succeeded the incumbent Lennart Johansson after winning election to the post at Uefa's Congress in Dusseldorf, Germany on Friday.<br><br>Platini campaigned on the promise to amend the limit of Champions League places for each member country to three clubs each.<br><br>The proposals are expected to meet stiff resistance from the likes of the Football Association and the Premier League in England, who are sure to be keen to have the status quo of four places available for their top clubs.<br><br>Platini, however, is keen to move forward with his ideas, despite the opposition he is likely to face.<br><br>"The new format of the Champions League is for 2009," Platini said.<br><br>"I talked about finding a better equilibrium for the number of clubs and that's for (season) 2009/10.<br><br>"The final decision will be (by Uefa's executive committee) in April, so we have a few months still to see which way we will go, but I would like a better equilibrium, it is very close to my heart."<br><br>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger thinks Platini will struggle to fulfil his task of making changes to the current Champions League format.<br><br>"I am scared that he based his programme on something which he will not be able to deliver - because he cannot decide that, that has to be voted," Wenger said.<br><br>"What will happen when they [the smaller teams] go one round further and go out early in a group stage? The competition will lose interest, that is all that will happen.<br><br>"It is not because we have one more team from Serbia instead of having one from England that the turnout is a bit better.<br><br>"I believe that the competition should be organised with the best teams playing each other.<br><br>"What people want to see is the best teams on television, to see Real Madrid against Arsenal, or Milan against Bayern Munich, that will not change."<br><br>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson echoed the sentiments of his Gunners counterpart.<br><br>"The only way you could get rid of the fourth team is by reducing the competition or bringing in more teams from other countries," said Ferguson, who reacted with surprise when reporters told him of Platini's election at Friday's United press conference.<br><br>"The way it is at the moment, with the top countries entering their top teams, you get some fantastic games.<br><br>"It is a fantastic tournament and you are playing all the best teams. I don't think a lot needs to be done to it."</div>
