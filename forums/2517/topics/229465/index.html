            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle United manager Glenn Roeder has revealed that he has mounting problems in midfield ahead of the North East club's FA Cup tie with Birmingham on Saturday.<br><br>The Magpies have already had to cope with an injury-ravaged defence in recent weeks and now Turkish schemer Emre is a doubt for the third round tie against the Championship side.<br><br>The former Internazionale midfielder damaged his groin in the 2-2 draw with Manchester United on New Year's Day and his participation in the cup game is firmly in the balance.<br><br>With captain Scott Parker suspended, and Nicky Butt also a doubt alongside confirmed absentees Charles N'Zogbia and Damien Duff, Roeder is scratching his head as he ponders how to solve the injury crisis that is sweeping his squad.<br><br>"Emre is feeling his groin and it is touch and go whether he will make it at Birmingham City on Saturday," revealed Roeder.<br><br>"Obviously, we knew at Everton on Saturday that when Scott Parker was booked, he would not be able to play at St Andrews.<br><br>"But Nicky Butt is desperate to play having been on loan there last season and he is hoping the ankle injury which kept him out against his other old club Manchester United on Monday will be okay."<br><br>Newcastle have fielded an extremely inexperienced defence over the festive period and Titus Bramble's comeback from a calf problem has now been delayed due to injury.<br><br>"Titus Bramble came in for what we hoped would be a very light training session yesterday, but he had all the symptoms of the flu," Roeder added.<br><br>"Taking into consideration our current situation, we soon packed him back off home.<br><br>"It is almost at the stage where we will be saying `will the last man standing please turn out the lights' - and it looks as though the way things are going, that man could be me."</div>
