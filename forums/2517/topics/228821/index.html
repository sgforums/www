            <div class='col-md body'>Glenn Roeder has paid tribute to Nicky Butt for his performance at centre-back in Newcastle's 3-0 defeat to Everton.<br><br>The midfielder showed his versatility as he moved into the back four after Peter Ramage was substituted due to injury in the first half.<br><br>Due to a lack of fit defenders Butt may be called upon to play at centre-back against former club Manchester United on New Year's Day, but Roeder is confident he will turn in another good display.<br><br>"I don't think Sir Alex needs any help with what I'm going to do, but all I'll say is that I thought Nicky Butt showed against Everton why he has so many things as a footballer," praised Roeder.<br><br>"I thought some of the headers and tackles that he got in would rub off on our young central defender, Steven Taylor.<br><br>"It was a perfect demonstration of how to play centre-back."<br><br>Roeder, who believes Butt has been one of The Magpies' most consistent players this season, was delighted with his reaction when asked to fill in for Ramage<br><br>"Whatever you ask him to do, he does it without complaint and he does it well," he explained.<br><br>"I just said 'Nicky, I want you to play centre-back', and he said 'okay, boss'. I wouldn't have expected anything else from Nicky Butt.<br><br>"He's a top, top man and people didn't think he had a future at Newcastle, but he's turned out to be a very important and influential player for us this year.<br><br>"I'd like to think a lot of that is because he's got a lot of confidence in me. He knows I believe in him."</div>
