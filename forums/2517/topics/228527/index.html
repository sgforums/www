            <div class='col-md body'>Sheffield United pulled further clear of the relegation zone with a well-deserved 1-0 victory over an off-colour Arsenal in the final Premiership game of the year.<br><br>The Gunners were missing several of their first-choice starting XI and looked a shadow of their best side as they fell victim to one of the biggest shocks of the Premiership season so far.<br><br>Christian Nade netted the crucial goal but there were heroic performances all around him, not least from Phil Jagielka, who had to play in goal for the last half hour after Paddy Kenny was substituted.<br><br>Sheffield United were even more under-strength than Arsenal and were actually lucky not to have conceded two or three goals in the first few minutes as The Gunners missed a glut of chances to open the scoring.<br><br>Tomas Rosicky mis-hit an ambitious attempt to lob Paddy Kenny after the Blades goalkeeper had crazily come rushing off his line to head clear, but both men regained respectability moments later as Kenny brilliantly dived to his right to parry the Czech's blistering shot.<br><br>Gilberto was unchallenged in the six-yard area as he met a Robin van Persie corner and would have been disappointed to hit his header into the ground and see the ball bounce over the crossbar.<br><br>Julio Baptista also wasted a good opportunity as his poor control allowed Nick Montgomery to make a fine saving tackle.<br><br>The Blades started to gain a foothold in the game after 15 minutes and, although Jeremie Aliadiere tested Kenny with a powerful left-foot drive, they carved out the better chances for the remainder of the first half.<br><br>Arsenal's midfielders were not able to find their usual passing rhythm, while their defence lacked composure whenever the ball was delivered into dangerous areas.<br><br>Sheffield United were rewarded for their endeavour when Nade conjured a goal out of nothing, but the warning signs had been apparent minutes earlier when Alan Quinn fired tamely at Jens Lehmann following a neat move.<br><br>Nade made no such mistake in the 41st minute as he cleverly turned Kolo Toure by letting Quinn's pass run straight through his legs and then coolly curled his shot past Lehmann, who had sprinted outside his area in an effort to narrow the angle.<br><br>The game became more stretched after half-time as Arsenal probed forward in search of an equaliser and United, to their credit, kept looking to attack on the break.<br><br>Kenny was in obvious discomfort for several minutes before Warnock admitted he had to be withdrawn after 60 minutes, with Michael Tonge coming on as there were no goalkeepers on the substitutes' bench and Jagielka taking the gloves.<br><br>Quinn could have given United some breathing space just after the hour mark as he forced Lehmann into action from tight on the right, while Nade saw a goal ruled out for offside.<br><br>At the other end Jagielka was protected brilliantly by his defence and even showed some ability with a couple of impressive punched clearances, but Arsenal's reluctance to shoot from distance was criminal.<br><br>Van Persie looked Arsenal's likeliest saviour as his trickery caused problems, but there was little help on offer from his team-mates.<br><br>The introduction of Cesc Fabregas failed to add any impetus to a lacklustre display, and the Spaniard picked up his fifth booking of the season to rule him out of Arsenal's FA Cup clash with Liverpool.<br><br>Aliadiere finally had the right idea eight minutes from time as he unleashed an effort from outside the area which flew wide, before Jagielka brilliantly tipped van Persie's scuffed close-range effort over the crossbar.<br><br>Five minutes of stoppage time were signalled but it was The Blades who came closest to scoring as they held on for three points.</div>
