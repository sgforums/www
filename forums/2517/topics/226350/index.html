            <div class='col-md body'>Gordon Taylor has called on The Football Association to clamp down on managers commenting on other clubs' players.<br><br>Jose Mourinho caused a stir over the weekend after questioning the integrity of Andrew Johnson following Chelsea's 3-2 win at Everton.<br><br>The Blues boss insinuated that the striker dived in an attempt to win a penalty, but Everton have responded by asking The FA to take action.<br><br>Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Taylor is concerned by the current trend and does not believe players should be a target of criticism from other clubs' bosses.<br><br>"Jose likes to be controversial to say the least and there is certainly a lot of publicity attached to it," Taylor told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"I get a little bit worried sometimes about the way managers are too keen to make points about other clubs' players.<br><br>"I think The FA are quite concerned they shouldn't comment about the 'impartiality' of referees when they think a decision has gone against them etc, and as a result we've had a number of charges against managers.<br><br>"It's the same with my members. As regards The FA, if they're going to make sure managers don't talk about referees and their impartiality or judgement on them, or their integrity, the same thing should apply to other clubs' players.<br><br>"There are enough people out there in parts of controversy and it's for the game, the crowd, the analysts and the media to make comments and judgements.<br><br>"When those from within the game are biting at other managers' players, and again people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones as it can then happen on their own doorstep with their own players.<br><br>"It has to be acknowledged that a manager is responsible for his own players and it's only going to create antagonism and resentment to a manager and to players when they hear such comments coming from other managers."</div>
