            <div class='col-md body'>Kanu has denied suggestions that he wants to quit Portsmouth and secure a move back to his former club Ajax.<br><br>The 30-year-old has denied talking to his ex-club and he insists he is more than happy with life at Fratton Park.<br><br>"I don't know why they keep on saying that about Ajax - there's nothing happening," he told The News.<br><br>"I'm a Portsmouth player, I love the supporters, I love the club and definitely I want to be here. It's just up to the management to show their own commitment.<br><br>"I don't know who these people are that keep going on about Ajax, Ajax, Ajax. I haven't even heard from Ajax.<br><br>"I don't know where it's coming from. It's annoying because it's not true.<br><br>"The fans want to know the truth and the truth is I am grateful to Portsmouth, to Harry, to the management, to the supporters.<br><br>"They have taken me in and since then I have been playing for them and I want to stay."<br><br>Kanu did reiterate that he wanted a longer term contract in order to secure his future.<br><br>"I have said before that it's difficult to travel for two hours from London to Portsmouth and then train and then go back.<br><br>"But if I can have a commitment from the club then I can settle down, have a house here and be relaxed.<br><br>"I want a longer contract. If you have six months of a one-year contract, you don't know what's going to happen.<br><br>"It's just for the management to say 'okay' and then give you more years on your contract so you can relax.<br><br>"It depends on the management how long it is and then we'll take it from there.<br><br>"I hope to start talks soon."<br><br>Meanwhile, Pompey boss Harry Redknapp insists he wants to bolster his defence in the transfer window after losing Noe Pamarot to injury.<br><br>"I haven't got a clue if I'm going to be bringing in a player or not.<br><br>"I keep looking, but I don't know whether I'll be able to bring anyone in. I've not got a clue about money.<br><br>"Hopefully we can get one or two in because losing Pamarot leaves us a bit short at left-back, with Dejan Stefanovic still a long way from fitness, too.<br><br>"We've got only two spare defenders - Andy O'Brien and Andy Griffin. Andy Griffin wants to go to Stoke, Stoke want him, but I can't let him go."<br><br>One fresh addition to the Pompey squad comes in the shape of Svetoslav Todorov who has returned from his loan spell at Wigan.</div>
