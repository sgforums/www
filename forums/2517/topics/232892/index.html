            <div class='col-md body'>Neill spoke with the Hammers on Friday with regard to a move to Upton Park, and has already confirmed he intends to sign a deal with the London club.<br><br>Hughes was forced to do without skipper Neill for their 3-0 win at Manchester City, a victory that enabled Blackburn to climb back into the top half of the Barclays Premiership table for the first time in three months.<br><br>But Hughes, who lost Holland defender Andre Ooijer with a suspected broken ankle during the game, insists he does not plan on letting his skipper leave unless he finds a replacement.<br><br>He said: Â“We will have to wait and see.<br><br>Â“I cannot really tell you one way or the other what is happening on that.<br><br>Â“We allowed Lucas to go down and speak to West Ham yesterday (Friday), and he had a medical while he was down there.<br><br>Â“As I have always said I want to know we are not going to be weaker as a consequence of Lucas leaving, so exactly as we were.<br><br>Â“We are not going to let Lucas join unless we get a replacement, and nothing as yet has been agreed.Â”<br><br>The Australia international confirmed his plan to join the Hammers in an interview with SydneyÂ’s Sunday Telegraph.<br><br>Neill said: Â“People who have raised their eyebrows at me for making this decision are in for a surprise because West ham have a shopping list of players which almost blew me away.<br><br>Â“It was an extremely hard decision but I know it's the right one. West Ham moved heaven and earth to sign me.<br><br>Â“I supported them as a kid and I know people are going to give me stick for not choosing them.Â”<br><br>Neill was persuaded to join West Ham by chairman Eggert Magnusson.<br><br>He added: Â“It took me all of two minutes to be convinced I wasn't making a mistake when Mr Magnusson told me about his plans for the club.<br><br>"What he said almost knocked me off me feet.<br><br>"He told me I'm the first of many (new signings) earmarked for the club.<br><br>"I can be part of something big here. West Ham are very well supported. They just happen to be at the wrong end of the table at the moment but I hope to play my part in helping remedy that.<br><br>"They were two minutes away from winning the FA Cup final last season and have not suddenly become a bad team.Â”<br><br>Neill claims he has a get-out clause built into his deal should the Hammers be relegated and admits: Â“It's a calculated gamble. It won't be a glamorous three months but once we secure safety people won't question my motives any more.<br><br>Â“I believe I will have the last laugh. People will soon be talking about West Ham in a very different way.Â”</div>
