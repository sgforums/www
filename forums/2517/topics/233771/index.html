            <div class='col-md body'>Andrei Shevchenko has revealed that he is learning to love life in English football.<br><br>The Ukrainian superstar has failed to settle as well as many expected following his Â£30million move from Milan to Chelsea last summer.<br><br>Tension between Shevchenko and boss Jose Mourinho was understood to be strained after his exclusion from the first team.<br><br>However, Shevchenko looks to have built bridges with Mourinho and is insistent that he is now settled in London and his love affair with Milan is definitely over.<br><br>"President Silvio Berlusconi is a person who remains in my heart, so as all officials, players and Milan supporters. So as with Italy, I love it, but my life now is in England", he explained to Gazzetta dello Sport.<br><br>On his relationship with Mourinho, Sheva stressed he followed and believed in whatever the Portuguese tactician decided.<br><br>"I don't look at the things posted in the papers. Mourinho is the coach, he has his style and I must adapt myself to the team, not the opposite," he opined.<br><br>Shevchenko has even been tipped as a possible future Chelsea coach, as he is close friends with owner Roman Abramovich - but he insists he does not know what he will do when his playing days are over.<br><br>"It's not true, and especially as I've never thought about what I'll do," he said.<br><br>"I have a contract until 2010 and it seems to me that is quite far away."<br><br>The Eastern Wind, as he is known, admits he loves the differences between England and Italy.<br><br>"I like the English at the stadium. Here the audience is part of the spectacle with the players," he said.<br><br>"In Italy it's different and not only because there are architectural obstacles. It's a matter of culture.<br><br>"Here players deserve respect for the talent they have, but they are part of a community.<br><br>"But also the doctor who saves lives or the person who cleans the roads in which we walk every day, they get respect too. I like this sense of community."<br><br>The Chelsea man also spoke about Ronaldo's possible arrival at Milan.<br><br>"Ronaldo is a really great player," he said.<br><br>"He has been and he will remain a phenomenon. The age of 30 doesn't count. Should he be physically fit, and has the will to play, the age doesn't count.<br><br>"What counts is motivation, and I think Ronaldo still has a lot."</div>
