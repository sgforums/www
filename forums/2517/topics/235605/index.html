            <div class='col-md body'>A stoppage-time free-kick from Morten Gamst Pedersen saw Blackburn Rovers defeat a plucky Sheffield United 2-1 at Ewood Park.<br><br>Defeat was harsh on the visitors who had looked set to claim a well-earned point after Ewood Park old boy Jon Stead had immediately cancelled out Pedersen's first-half strike.<br><br>Rovers looked uncertain in defence in the opening exchanges and United had two glorious opportunities to claim a lead inside ten minutes.<br><br>Rob Hulse turned and saw a shot deflected on to a post and Nick Montgomery volleyed wide inside the area when he really should have done better.<br><br>Stead shot over the bar but the only noteworthy incident from an attacking sense for Rovers had been a 17th minute injury to Matt Derbyshire - the striker being replaced by the returning Jason Roberts.<br><br>With little warning, Rovers claimed the lead in the 22nd minute. Brett Emerton cut inside on the right-hand edge of the area and delivered a cross for Pedersen to head past Paddy Kenny from six yards.<br><br>Within three minutes United were level as Stead scored on his return to Ewood Park. The two Blades striker combined in style - Hulse flicking on and Stead, having shrugged off the attentions of full debutant Christopher Samba, fired past Brad Friedel.<br><br>Pedersen should have restored Rovers' lead ten minutes before half-time but the normally assured striker dragged his shot wide after running on to Ryan Nelsen's ball over the top.<br><br>The peep of referee Andre Marriner's whistle punctuated the remainder of the half with the high number of free-kicks an indicator of the competitive edge to the game, even if it was not conducive to free-flowing football.<br><br>Rovers had the greater share of play in the second half. Superb skill from David Bentley saw the midfielder close on goal but Kenny was equal to the winger's shot.<br><br>An impressive overhead kick from Hulse flashed just wide of goal at the other end, but the tempo had dropped after a frantic first half.<br><br>The roof was raised though when David Dunn was reintroduced for his second Rovers debut on the hour - the midfielder taking the field in place of Aaron Mokoena.<br><br>Roberts and Benni McCarthy combined but the former shot wide, while Bentley crossed for Pedersen to head at goal but straight at Kenny.<br><br>Hughes introduced a third striker in Shabani Nonda, as Rovers pressed but United had their moments too - Stephen Quinn volleyed over from the edge of the area, while Samba cut out Stead's cross when danger threatened.<br><br>Rovers were reduced to ten men after Stephen Warnock was shown a second yellow card on his home debut following a foul on Derek Geary but claimed the winner after Dunn was brought down on the edge of the area and Pedersen stepped up to curl in a sumptuous left-footed free-kick.</div>
