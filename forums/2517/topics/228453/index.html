            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United defender Patrice Evra insists he never considered leaving even when he found it hard to break into the team.<br><br>Evra has started to show something of his true form after a difficult start to his Old Trafford career last season.<br><br>The Frenchman arrived from Monaco last January, but he struggled to establish himself as a regular in Sir Alex Ferguson's first-team plans.<br><br>Evra has emerged as United's first-choice left-back this term and the classy defender has thanked Sir Alex Ferguson for keeping faith in him.<br><br>"I never knew Guy Roux, but I believe Alex Ferguson and him have almost the same methods," Evra told L'Equipe.<br><br>"Ferguson is very close to his players and protects them. He is the father of our team. He knew I would endure a difficult time at first, but he was thinking to the future. He said: 'Pat, next season I will ask you your best'.<br><br>The 25-year-old revealed he never thought of leaving United and he also paid tribute to fellow Frenchmen Louis Saha and Mikael Silvestre for helping him settle into life at Old Trafford<br><br>"I never thought about leaving. I am obstinate, leaving would have been a defeat, and asking myself too many questions about my level would have been dangerous.<br><br>"I thank Louis Saha and Mika Silvestre for their help. Since the first day, Mika welcomed me and helped me a lot during daily life. I have never saw such a professional player like him."<br><br>Evra also revealed that Ferguson has been encouraging him to be more attack-minded.<br><br>"I have not changed my style in football, I just feel more powerful than before and that gives me more trust," continued Evra.<br><br>"After a match when I didn't take enough attacking risk, Ferguson told me: 'Pat, why did I buy you?' I replied: 'To attack.' He said: 'So, what are you doing?'<br><br>"I have to find the right balance, but the technical staff want me to participate in attacks."</div>
