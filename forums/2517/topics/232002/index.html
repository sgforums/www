            <div class='col-md body'>LA Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas has rejected speculation that David Beckham could be moving to MLS ahead of schedule.<br><br>After signing his mammoth Â£128million deal with the American side, Beckham was immediately axed from the Real Madrid first team, leading to suggestions that a January transfer could be in the pipeline.<br><br>Spanish media had reported on Monday that the former England captain's lawyers were attempting to negotiate an early release from his contract at Real, but MLS commissioner Don Garber strongly refuted such claims.<br><br>With Los Merengues unhappy at the manner of Beckham's decision to join LA Galaxy, he looks unlikely to ever appear for the Spanish side again, but Lalas insists the star's future employers have no plans to hasten his arrival in California.<br><br>"Our position is unchanged with regards to David Beckham. We look forward to welcoming him in the summer and we respect his chance to honour his contract with Real Madrid," said Lalas.<br><br>"All our plans are that we will welcome David here in the summer.<br><br>"It would not be proper for an official from another club to comment on his situation in this context.<br><br>"We've made a point of letting him focus his attention and letting him focus on his team."<br><br>Lalas has also hit out at suggestions that Beckham's decision to move to MLS was an easy option for the final years of his career.<br><br>"Beckham is coming to the Premier club in the US, the jewel of Major League Soccer. LA Galaxy has very high standards for any of our players, not just David," Lalas added.<br><br>"[Those suggestions] are representative of a lack of knowledge that exists about the USA and the level of the soccer.<br><br>"It's rather insulting to the players and the teams we have over here. I think it's much competitive than many leagues around the world and David will be challenged in ways he has never been before and he's going to help elevate things."</div>
