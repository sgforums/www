            <div class='col-md body'>Champions Chelsea continued their winning ways at Charlton, but were made to fight all the way by the Premiership strugglers at The Valley.<br><br>It looked like being a routine outing when Frank Lampard fired the visitors ahead with a trademark long-range strike just 18 minutes into the contest.<br><br>However, The Blues failed to double their advantage, giving Charlton hope, and while The Addicks failed to bag a leveller they could easily have snatched a point.<br><br>Chelsea wasted little time asserting themselves on the contest, penning Charlton back in their own half by controlling the early possession.<br><br>Michael Ballack tried a snap-shot from the edge of the box which was deflected over while Didier Drogba dragged his left-footed effort well wide of the far post.<br><br>Charlton attempted to hit back, but with Marcus Bent cutting a lonely figure up front The Addicks had few outlets to disperse the incessant Chelsea pressure.<br><br>Wayne Bridge, who was in for the injured Ashley Cole, was causing all sorts of problems down the left-hand side with the home team continually fending off dangerous crosses.<br><br>Chelsea eventually made their dominance pay when Lampard capitalised on an Amdy Faye mistake by lashing a right-footed shot past Scott Carson from outside the box.<br><br>Faye did well to initially halt Andrei Shevchenko's run, but he failed to clear the danger and Lampard, who is deadly from long-range, made no mistake with the half-chance.<br><br>The Blues nearly added a quick-fire second with Shevchenko just heading Bridge's cross over in the middle, while Drogba's long-range strike was collected by Carson at his near post.<br><br>Charlton nearly squared matters when Talal El Karkouri's cross looked destined for the far post only for the alert Petr Cech to tip the goal-bound effort over for a corner.<br><br>The sight of goal gave Alan Pardew's side renewed hope although El Karkouri's free-kick did not have the purchase to beat Cech, while Bryan Hughes also had an effort on goal.<br><br>The champions finished the half in the ascendancy with Drogba lashing a left-footed effort high and wide before Lampard's stinging free-kick was superbly kept out by Carson.<br><br>Pardew changed things around at half-time by upping their firepower with the introduction of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink for the ineffective Dennis Rommedahl.<br><br>The switch gave Charlton added impetus, but in truth Chelsea always looked comfortable at the back, even with captain John Terry on the bench.<br><br>Chelsea, and Lampard in particular, continued to probe away at Charlton, but never really looked like adding that crucial second that would settle the contest.<br><br>A one-goal advantage is often not enough and Pardew's troops nearly made the visitors pay when Faye collected Bent's neat lay-off and raced towards goal before seeing his effort palmed over by Cech.<br><br>Faye continued to look Charlton's likeliest avenue for a goal although his finish from the angle after getting the better of Claude Makelele was not good enough to beat Cech.<br><br>Jose Mourinho had seen enough of the home side's resurgence and immediately made a double switch by taking off Shevchenko and John Obi Mikel for Shaun Wright-Phillips and Salomon Kalou.<br><br>Kalou nearly made an immediate impact, but his first-time shot from Drogba's left wing cross struck the base of the post with Carson rooted to the spot.<br><br>Fellow sub Wright-Phillips nearly wrapped up the points with a fine low drive only for Carson to make a fine save at full stretch in the dying stages.<br><br>Terry did make his return late on as Chelsea held on to close within three points of league leaders Manchester United, although The Red Devils do have a game in hand.</div>
