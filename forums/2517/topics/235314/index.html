            <div class='col-md body'>Jermain Defoe has told skysports.com that he is at the peak of his form and ready to prove his worth to Steve McClaren, if given opportunity to impress against Spain in midweek.<br><br>England host Spain at Old Trafford on Wednesday and having re-established himself on the international scene, Defoe is eager to cement his place in McClaren's thoughts.<br><br>This season has seen Defoe banish not just his disappointment at having his playing time at White Hart Lane restricted last term, but also his World Cup heartache at being left out of Sven Goran Eriksson's final squad for Germany.<br><br>Answering those that have doubted him in the best possible way, Defoe has plundered an impressive 14 goals from 23 starts and is now looking for a chance to shine on the international stage.<br><br>"It's been a while since we last met up," Defoe told skysports.com. "You look forward to meeting up with the rest of the boys, and the banter that goes with it.<br><br>"To play a part in the game is always special, it's always an honour to play for your country.<br><br>"It was hard. I was over there in Germany and had to come home but I'm a strong character, got over it and thought 'right, next season I'll put things right and enjoy my football again'.<br><br>"The lucky thing was that the first game I think was in September (against Andorra) and I got in and scored a couple and after that I was over it.<br><br>"When you're in the team and playing you're happy.<br><br>"I think if you keep working hard for your club then you'll get your chance and if I can get the chance in this game, then I'll definitely be ready."<br><br>Defoe believes that his return to form is primarily down to the fact he is now regularly starting games, with his blossoming partnership alongside Dimitar Berbatov bearing impressive fruit.<br><br>"I've always said I need a run in the team, not just two games or three games," he added. "You can't get a rhythm or feel sharp unless you get a run in the team.<br><br>"But this season there's been one or two injuries and I've had to play the games and I've really enjoyed it. I feel really fit at the minute. I've got a rhythm and it's really important, especially as a forward.<br><br>"I enjoy playing with Berbatov. The kind of player I am, I like to play off a big man and Berba can hold it up.<br><br>"I can gamble and he can flick it on. It seems to work when I play off a player I can gamble on, it's the same with Mido too."</div>
