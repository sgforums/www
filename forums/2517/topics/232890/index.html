            <div class='col-md body'>Long-serving Manchester United trio Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs have been paid a remarkable compliment by manager Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>Â“They are the spirit of this club,Â” he said ahead of the crucial Barclays Premiership clash with Arsenal on Sunday.<br><br>The three have all played a big part in pushing United to the top of the table in their bid to regain the high ground from Chelsea.<br><br>Ferguson recognises their massive contribution to the cause over the years.<br><br>He said: Â“They are the spirit of the club because of their longevity and their loyalty.<br><br>Â“The three are regular players. The only reason why they donÂ’t play, apart from injury, is rest.<br><br>Â“They have been here since they were 13 and are now in their 30s.<br><br>Â“That means all three have been at the club for about 20 years. It is amazing.<br><br>Â“I do not think many teams can boast an achievement like that.<br><br>Â“When players see how contented the three are, it gives them confidence that they are in the right place.<br><br>Â“The impression I get is that most of the players here are happy.Â”<br><br>The spin-off is a boost for UnitedÂ’s recruitment drive, as Ferguson explained.<br><br>He said: Â“From a young local boyÂ’s perspective looking at United and one day maybe playing for the club, these three players are great examples.<br><br>Â“It gives them ambition to go on and better themselves.Â”<br><br>The trio are all expected to figure at the Emirates Stadium and Ferguson is pleased with the squad he has at his disposal.<br><br>United are looking at a mirror image of 1999 when success in the Champions League, Premiership and FA Cup was famously achieved.<br><br>He said: Â“Success is always measured by success. Every team at United has to do win and hopefully we are doing that.<br><br>Â“We have a good strong squad, who are getting better in terms of experience.<br><br>Â“You look at us and there is good energy, good speed and good ages in the team.<br><br>Â“I have no fears about looking ahead with this group of players.<br><br>Â“We have been fortunate so far when it comes to injuries and that helps enormously.<br><br>Â“When you have your best players, you have a better chance of winning.Â”</div>
