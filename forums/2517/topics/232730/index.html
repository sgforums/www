            <div class='col-md body'>David Moyes claims he has cleared Andrew Johnson's name against accusations of diving by launching a video campaign.<br><br>The Everton boss, who has regularly had to fend off criticism of Johnson this season, feels his striker has been unfairly singled out.<br><br>Everton have compiled a video showing ten clips of debatable incidents that have not gone their way this season and have sent the video off to be reviewed by footballing authorities.<br><br>They have been informed that eight of the ten incidents should have been penalties, and Moyes believes this proves Johnson's innocence.<br><br>"We set out to clear Andy's name and I believe we have done that," he said.<br><br>"The last thing I want to do is moan and complain about decisions that have gone against us but we have got to a stage here when it is more than just moaning.<br><br>"We have a Christmas video of many incidents that have not gone our way and we have included in that the Reading goal last weekend which was clearly offside.<br><br>"We have also had, in the game against Blackburn, an incident when the ball is punched off Lee Carsley's head and we did not get the penalty.<br><br>"Now we have done something about it. We have had the correct people in here to see it and I have got to say that of 10 incidents shown of possible penalties, we were told by the correct people that eight of those are definite penalties and the other two were very close.<br><br>"Why is it always Andy? Maybe people talk too much, people on radio stations and other managers, people have too much to say sometimes."</div>
