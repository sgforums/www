            <div class='col-md body'>Wigan Athletic manager Paul Jewell has warned Lee McCulloch he will not be leaving the JJB Stadium unless the club receive 'an unbelievable offer'.<br><br>McCulloch, who only signed a new three-year contract last summer, officially handed in a transfer request to Jewell, citing 'family reasons'.<br><br>Jewell this week slammed as 'derisory' and 'insulting' a Â£750,000 bid from the Scottish Premier League side, bearing in mind Wigan paid Â£700,000 for McCulloch nearly five years ago.<br><br>"I don't want to keep unhappy players but I don't want to let players go for nothing either," said Jewell.<br><br>"He's come through the ranks as a Championship player, a Premier League player and now an international player, so he has a market value.<br><br>"He was happy to sign a three-year contract in the summer; now if he wants to leave - and I desperately don't want him to - and it is right for us, then he can go.<br><br>"At the moment I've not spoken to the chairman (Dave Whelan) about it and I haven't got a figure in mind because I really don't want him to leave.<br><br>"But it's up to Rangers to come up with a proper bid, or Celtic, or Kilmarnock - whoever. It has to be something that's fair.<br><br>"Every player has their price, it doesn't matter who he is, but unless it comes up to scratch then he will be staying here."<br><br>Jewell added: "Walter Smith knows my stance on it.<br><br>"As far as I'm concerned, nothing is going to be done unless it is an unbelievable offer - and even then, I probably won't consider it."<br><br>Jewell is particularly unhappy at the involvement of the agents in this latest saga, particularly as McCulloch is currently only represented by the Professional Footballers' Association.<br><br>However, John Viola has been speaking on McCulloch's behalf, leaving Jewell to add: "I know who represents Lee until March.<br><br>"They are the same people who were involved when he signed his new contract in the summer.<br><br>"But I've had this fellow from Scotland (Viola) who has come onto me this week claiming he is Lee's agent, but he isn't.<br><br>"I think Lee has forgotten to tell him he's contracted to somebody else.<br><br>"Last week I had another agent who rang on Lee's behalf and it was not the same agent who rang me this week.<br><br>"I think it all depends on what day it is as to who is Lee's agent!"<br><br>Jewell, though, insists McCulloch is available for selection for the Barclays Premiership clash with Everton on Sunday when the Latics will aim to end a bad run of six successive league defeats.<br><br>"He's every chance of playing," said Jewell.<br><br>"People can have their differences with the club, or with me. I don't really care. He is paid by us to play for us.<br><br>"We both know each other well enough, and if he tries his best, then not a problem. If he doesn't, he's got a problem."</div>
