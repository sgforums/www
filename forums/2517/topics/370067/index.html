              <p>Hey guys... anyone still remember how SIngapore wanted to get
                                      into the world cups for Goal 2010?<br> <br> I will of course be proud as a singaporean if Singapore really gets
                                      into the World cup. Who don't wish his own country to be in his
                                      world cup.I still remember a few years ago... There were so much
                                      promises and so muching fundings given to the local football
                                      players...<br> <br> But till date... Where are we? Is Goal 2010 just a fade? Just an
                                      empty promise to Singaporeans? Pls share ur views.....</p>

              <p>Watching the exhibition match between Liverpool and the Singapore Team was such a pain, even as it was an exhibition friendly match with Singapore 0 and Liverpool 5 - when Malaysia fared better with a score of 1-2 against Manchester United.</p>
              <p>For more then 40 years - since the late Coach Choo Seng Kwee - the standards of football in Singapore has been dismal and erratci at best, even when there were the golden players in the team such as Quah Kim Song, Mohammed Nor of 1970s, Fandi Ahmad, K.

              <p>Singapore produced better players when the Malaysian Cup was an annual prize that produced more cutting football standards against staunch rivals from Selangor, Pahang and Perak.</p>

              <p>Personally, I think they have tried their best. We have progressed to the dont know what stage which we need to face to top teams like japan and bahrain etc. Its a much better situation than previously when we got kicked out just by facing thailand or malaysia.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I think that the 2010 goal is not realistic at all. The local soccer team to me, does not seem to have fight in them except of few of them, like the mustafic fahrudin and daniel bennett. The others are just like there to make up the team, and playing casually, trying too many tricks with no end products (imitating premier league teams' kind of play but with s-league kind of skill). Shi Jiayi is a player which I admire, he has the skills and vision, but is often under-utilised. Furthermore, I think we need to replace Aleksandar Duric. He is old, but he is the best which we have. Indran Sahdan is going downhill. Mohd Nor Ali is getting old. Noh Alam Shah our best player by far, is crazy when he attacked his own team mate bennett knee-ing him in the head.</p>
              <p>Most of the performing singapore players are usually those that are imported. Real Singapore players need to stand up and be counted for. Most importantly, our players need to bulked up alot. They are simply too small size. Even the Korean Youth team looks fitter and stronger than our team. I believe we would have lost to that Korean Youth team as well.</p>
              <p>Yes, we might have lost to Liverpool 5-0, but this was a half fucked liverpool. Imagine, Kyut, torres, gerrard and alonso played from the start, then 5-0 would be a great successful night for us.</p>
              <p>Our singapore players need to bulk up, increase the urgency in their play, increase their speed, increase their passing and definitely not to play anymore long balls to poor Aleksandar Duric. We need to play the ball on the ground as singapore players are short.</p>
              <p>But on the other hand, we must know singapore players are not full time players. Therefore they are not supposed to train full time. I believe if we really want to go to the world cup, the sporting community should take a look at selecting few real soccer talents from the singapore sports school, and other schools, scouting for real young talented players (even those that play street soccer with friends - you never know when you will find a gem), etc. When these talents players are scouted and gathered, then pay them full time and let them train full time on soccer. But I know, it is impossible because soccer is a short career. How much can we pay these players? $5000 a month?? Then when their career ends, they will have no education and no jobs.</p>
              <p>Therefore the government need to balance studies and trainings. The players need to be committed and train as hard as they can. Half hearted players would never work for me.</p>
              <p>I believe if we are seriously looking at the world cup then World cup 2018 or 2022 would be more ideal for us. If we can match japan and korea by 2022, then we would have taken a giant step ahead.</p>
              <p>To end, i would say that comparing our current team with the team that took part in the malaysia league, the current team is miles behind the 90's team. If malek awab, david lee, lim tong hai, nasri nasir, abas saad, fandi ahmad, jang jung, sundramoorthy, elister edward, lee man hong, steven lim, s.subramanium and kadir yahya (and maybe even quah kim song and friends) then we would have given japan and korea a real fight.</p>
              <p>How i miss watching the singapore team during the 90's cheering them over their 4-0 win over pahang in the malaysia cup. Playing against teams like sarawak, kedah, pahang and thrashing teams like Negri Sembilan, Johor and Penang. But these are all memories of the past.</p>
              <p>Maybe we should just bring back the coach from the past.. PN Sivaji and sack our current coach.</p>

              <p>Like the Swiss Standard of Living that was promised to
              Singaporeans, what is said by the PAP Ministers will soon fade off
              when the relevant Minister changes ministry.</p>
              <p>Watching the exhibition match between Liverpool and the
              Singapore Team was such a pain, even as it was an exhibition
              friendly match with Singapore 0 and Liverpool 5 - when
              Malaysia fared better with a score of 1-2 against Manchester
              United.</p>
              <p>For more then 40 years - since the late Coach Choo
              Seng Kwee - the standards of football in Singapore
              has been dismal and erratci at best, even when there were the
              golden players in the team such as Quah Kim Song, Mohammed Nor of
              1970s, Fandi Ahmad, K. Kanan, and V Sundramoorthy in the 1980s.</p>
              <p>Singapore produced better players when the Malaysian Cup was an
              annual prize that produced more cutting football standards against
              staunch rivals from Selangor, Pahang and Perak.</p>
              <p>With the S-League, football standards seems to display the
              stunted growth that is a result of in-breeding, even with the
              injection of foreign football players.</p>
              <p>Since the last surprise at the Tiger Cup ASEAN football
              league, Singapore has slipped into its usual doldrum.</p>
              <p>Sponsorship from APB and Nestle-Milo do not seem to have
              produced any results despite the various efforts at grooming local
              talents, and the millions spent with the launch of a Sports
              Institute.</p>
              <p>Accountability and due diligence - seems to be
              consistent missing in the Singapore mindset that starts at the
              top.</p>

              <p> actually what seems to have killed singapore was when it was kicked out of the malaysia cup...seeing the videos of the malaysia cup finals where singapore played, the amt of support singapore received was unbelievable. a standard tat has nvr been achieved again since.</p>

              <p>It was wishful thinking to believe that the S-League can bring the sparkle into the football scene in Singapore.</p>
              <p>So much has been spent in bringing "foreign talent" to join the various Singapore football clubs - that unashamedly adopt names to associate themselves with the more professional English FA League Clubs, than any names resembling Singapore.</p>
              <p>If only the bravado displayed - in associating the local Singapore clubs with the more professional English FA League Clubs - could have produced half the diligence and imagination of the football talents in the bottom half of the English League table - Singapore football standards would have been different today.</p>
