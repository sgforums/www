            <div class='col-md body'>National team captain Aide Iskandar has signed a two-year deal with Geylang United, the club confirmed on Thursday.<br><br>The announcement concludes a month-long period of negotiations between both parties, after Aide was released by RHB Singapore Cup winners Tampines Rovers.<br><br>The central defender is the second signing for the EaglesÂ’ backline, following the recruitment of Sengkang PunggolÂ’s Dennis Lim in mid-December 2006.<br><br>Geylang coach Lim Tong Hai was pleased to have secured his former international teammateÂ’s signature, which both hope will help plug the teamÂ’s defensive gaps as they eye a top-half finish in the 2007 S.League season.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re definitely looking forward to him strengthening the heart of our defence,Â” said Lim.<br><br>Â“We now have about six players in the defensive department, and each of them can play in different positions. That is quite a good number for that area.Â”<br><br>Â“IÂ’m glad to have finalized the transfer to Geylang, where IÂ’ll be able to work with Tong Hai again,Â” remarked Aide in a separate interview.<br><br>Â“He used to be my colleague on and off the field, and it will be a great experience for me to work with him again. He has drilled discipline into a much-improved Geylang team in the last few months, and I hope to help him take it further by being a leader in his team.Â”<br><br>Aide will be facing a different challenge at the Bedok-based club, after winning glory on numerous occasions with Home United and Tampines.<br><br>Having spent ten years with the Protectors since the S.LeagueÂ’s inauguration in 1996, he then moved to MalaysiaÂ’s Johor FA before becoming a mid-season signing for the Stags last year.<br><br>With two S.League titles and five Singapore Cup final victories to his name in that time, Aide will be looked upon to bring some of that winning energy to the two-time league champions, who have since descended towards the tail end of the table.<br><br>The aspirations of the Geylang faithful have been acknowledged by the 31-year-old, who hinted that his latest club contract could well be his last in a career that has seen him build as much as enjoy an abundance of success.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve come to Geylang sharing the same ambitions as Tong Hai and (club chairman) Patrick Ang,Â” he said of his decision to join the club, which finished second from bottom in 2006.<br><br>Â“TheyÂ’re trying to rebuild this team into one of the top S.League sides, and I would love to try my best to bring Geylang back to the dominating heights they were at before.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m still feeling good at 31, and I want to have a good performance for Geylang in the next two years. From there, though, IÂ’ll see how it goes, depending on whether I can keep my body injury-free.<br><br>Â“I play as a sweeper, and thatÂ’s one role where it helps getting older and wiser. I have to take care of my body and be careful, though, and if I do things right and help bring the club to success, I can then end on a high.Â”<br><br>AideÂ’s arrival coincides with the exit of S. Rajendran, who had handed in a transfer request in December after the club had initially stated he would be staying.<br><br>The centreback, who had joined the Eagles at the start of 2006 after an impressive spell at Balestier Khalsa, missed the middle portion of the season through injury and could only feature in half the clubÂ’s games.<br><br>Also leaving the club is long-serving second-choice goalkeeper Faizal Ali, who is taking time out of football to treat a persistent back injury.<br><br>Faizal played in just two S.League games this season, appearing as a substitute for Hassan Sunny against Tampines and SAFFC.<br><br>Â“We sat down with Rajendran and had a talk, where we told him what we wanted and he told us what he wanted,Â” said Lim as he discussed the two departures.<br><br>Â“Once we all came to an understanding and had all that sorted out, we came to a decision on what was best for us. That is why we have parted amicably, although I have no idea where he might be moving to.<br><br>Â“Faizal, on the other hand, has been with us for some time, and unfortunately his back has been troubling him of late, and he would like to get that done. That is why we have decided to look for another goalkeeper to replace him.<br><br>Â“We wonÂ’t be continuing with Faizal; he has been with us on one-year contracts in the past, so thatÂ’s ended now. But we have got Fajar Sarib from Balestier Khalsa to replace him as backup goalkeeper, and weÂ’re looking forward to working with him.Â”<br><br>Besides Fajar, Geylang have also brought in striker Fadzuhasny Juraimi from Home United to partner Hafiz Rahim. In addition, Bae Jin Soo, who joined the club midway last season, will be staying for 2007.<br><br>The Korean, who featured as striker when he first turned out for Paya Lebar Punggol in 2005, has since been converted into a right-sided midfielder, where he has stood out in the EaglesÂ’ last few matches last season.<br><br>Bae can expect some competition for his first-team place from Lau Meng Meng, who is on the verge of being promoted from the clubÂ’s Prime League squad as he turns 24 later in the year.<br><br>Lau is one of just two players not eligible to stay as a Prime League squad member due to age restrictions, the other being left-sided midfielder Che Mukammil, who can also play in defence.<br><br>With a surfeit of options on that flank, Lim is uncertain whether to offer Che a senior contract with little guarantee of him seeing action at S.League level.<br><br>Â“Meng Meng will probably sign senior terms with us soon, but IÂ’m still in the midst of talking to Che,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“Part of that is because I have two guys on the left already, namely Syed Thaha and Razali (Johari). If I sign Che, IÂ’ll have three on the left, which is a bit questionable.<br><br>Â“Having one fellow play with two sitting on the bench is a bit awkward, so I still have to talk to Che about it and see how he feels.Â”</div>
