            <div class='col-md body'>Rafa Benitez was clearly frustrated by Everton's tactical approach following a Merseyside derby that ended 0-0 at Anfield.<br><br>Liverpool enjoyed the better of the play throughout but ultimately failed to score as they failed to put pressure on second-placed Chelsea.<br><br>Everton were good value for their point after producing a battling display at the home of their great rivals, but Benitez was irked at what he perceived to be negative tactics from the men in blue, whom he described as a 'small club'.<br><br>"I'm really disappointed because we have seen one team that wanted to win, and one team that didn't want to lose," Benitez told PremPlus.<br><br>"We tried to keep going, keep going forward, but it was really difficult because they were defending and playing counter attack.<br><br>"When you play against eight players behind the ball, narrow and deep, you cannot create many clear chances. You just keep trying.<br><br>"It is how they want to win points, you cannot say anything about this.<br><br>"We were trying. When you play with the small clubs it is difficult, they play deep."<br><br>Liverpool are still waiting to hear whether Javier Mascherano will receive Premier League clearance to begin his Anfield career following a move from West Ham, but Benitez had no news regarding the eligibility of the Argentinian.<br><br>"I don't have any idea. We are waiting. With confidence, but waiting," Benitez added.<br><br>Of a wider significance at Anfield is the news that American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks could be close to sealing a takeover of the historic club after talks with DIC fell through last week.<br><br>Benitez for one is hoping that talks are resolved quickly to put an end to the intense speculation about the future of the club.<br><br>"If it's next week it will be better, then we can start talking again about football."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but everton didn't defend all the time.. they had attacks too..<br><br>just that the team was disciplined enough to all pull their own weight in defense... they all came back to defend when necessary..<br><br>can't call that negative football.. negative football is refusing to attack but packing the defense...<br><br>frankly, the commentators were right.. rafa played 3 forwards and they crowded each other out... if he had pulled them back a little bit more, he would have forced the defenders to come out and open up the everton back.. giving his players more space to move, to create attacking chances..</div>
