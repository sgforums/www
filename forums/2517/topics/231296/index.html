            <div class='col-md body'>Milan have confirmed that they would have taken David Beckham, had he decided to remain in Europe.<br><br>The former England captain confirmed on Thursday that he was quitting Real Madrid and he had agreed a move to America with MLS outfit Los Angeles Galaxy.<br><br>Beckham had a host of clubs interested in securing his signature and Milan have admitted that they would indeed have been in the market for him.<br><br>"It was a possibility for him to come to Milan," Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani told Gazzetta dello Sport.<br><br>"Now it has been decided he goes to Los Angeles. If he had decided to remain in Europe, we would have taken him.<br><br>"Instead he has chosen a different life and an adventure in the American championship."<br><br>Galliani also revealed that Milan would be adopting a new approach in the future - with the emphasis on youth development, and he compared it to being more like Arsenal, rather than Chelsea.<br><br>"We will be more similar to Arsenal than that of Chelsea," he continued.<br><br>"We have the intention to look for young people and discover new talents, like a Ronaldinho when he was taken from Gremio - he should not be in Paris Saint Germain or in Barcelona.<br><br>"At this point Italian football pays for the economic differences between leagues like Spain."<br><br>Galliani also revealed his disappointment that Juventus were not in Serie A.<br><br>"Without the Bianconeri in the championship, it is poorer - they are lacking and want their return," he said.<br><br>"It is like in Spain if they were without Real or Barcelona, or in England without Manchester United."</div>
