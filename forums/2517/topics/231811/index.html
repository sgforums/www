            <div class='col-md body'>Stuart Pearce has drawn a line under his efforts to land Shaun Wright-Phillips, having been quoted a huge price by Chelsea.<br><br>The England international has found opportunities scarce since swapping Manchester for the capital and he has now emerged as one of the most sought-after players in the January transfer window.<br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is, though, reluctant to offload any of his squad, as talk continues to suggest he will not be allowed to add to his own ranks, with only a weighty offer likely to see the sanction of any departures.<br><br>City, along with the likes of West Ham and Aston Villa, had been seen as being strong suitors but it seems Pearce has conceded defeat in his club's bid to be reunited with a favourite son.<br><br>"We've been quoted a price which is a million miles away from our budget so that's the end of it really," he told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"If there's going to be any deals to be done I think you need to knock the head off with straight finance, if they want to sell the boy.<br><br>"The message I have received from Chelsea is they do not want to loan the likes of Shaun, and I am sure the rest of their players as well."<br><br>With Mourinho's admiration for Micah Richards well documented, a possible exchange deal had been mooted, but Pearce is adamant that he has received no contact from Chelsea.<br><br>"They've never contacted us," he added.<br><br>"I'm still fielding speculation about speculation that they were going to ring us, which they haven't. So that's where we stand."</div>
