            <div class='col-md body'>Everton assistant Alan Irvine believes Victor Anichebe could one day be as good as Chelsea striker Didier Drogba.<br><br>The 18-year-old is beginning to force his way in to David Moyes' starting line-up on a regular basis and recently bagged a brace against Newcastle.<br><br>Irvine has revealed that The Toffees are trying to model Anichebe on Drogba, and has backed the Nigerian youngster to become as good a player as the former Marseille man.<br><br>"We are putting together clips of strikers like Drogba to show him on a regular basis and if we can turn him into someone who is an all-round striker like Drogba it would be fantastic," Irvine said.<br><br>"Victor has got a lot to learn right now but he is very keen to learn and he is developing all parts of his game. Who knows, maybe one day he will be as good as that, and that would be a great credit to him."<br><br>Anichebe is likely to continue his run in the starting line-up in the FA Cup at the weekend, a competition Everton want to go far in.<br><br>However, they must first get past Blackburn on Sunday and Irvine admits he would have preferred an easier tie first up.<br><br>"It is an important competition and one we would love to have a good run in but that has not happened recently and it is another tough game for both sides on Sunday," he said.<br><br>"Obviously at this stage of the competition you hope to get a home draw against a team from a lower division. Neither side would have asked for this one at this stage, but at least we are at home."<br><br>Meanwhile, Irvine is refusing to get too excited by the prospect of additions to the Everton squad during the transfer window.<br><br>He added: "Everyone thinks when the transfer window opens all sorts of things happen straight away but it is not like that. January is a very difficult time to sign players.<br><br>"Generally if you are trying to sign players they are needed at their clubs at the time so you end up having to pay a premium. I think there is a lot more hype to it than there is action."</div>
