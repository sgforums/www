            <div class='col-md body'>Torrential weather conditions got the better of the tie at Vicarage Road on Saturday as the match between Watford and Wigan was abandoned due to a water-logged pitch.<br><br>As the rain poured down on Vicarage Road, two sides in poor form looked to pick up some much-needed points at the bottom end of the table.<br><br>Watford, looking for only their second win of the season, had lost their last three games in a row and Wigan, who had not won in four games were only four points above the drop zone.<br><br>Emile Heskey gave Wigan the lead midway through the first half scoring his sixth goal for Wigan completely against the run of play despite appeals for offside.<br><br>The equaliser came just before the first half whistle with a great header from 20-year-old Tamas Priskin scoring his first Premiership goal for The Hornets on his first Premiership start leaving it 1-1 at half-time.<br><br>But the rain continued to pour down in the second half of the game with pitch conditions deteriorating all the while and speculation growing as to whether the game should continue.<br><br>After speaking to the fourth official, referee Steve Tanner made the decision to grind proceedings to a halt for ten minutes to see if conditions improved<br><br>Despite the rain easing off the game was abandoned shortly after due to a heavily water-logged pitch.<br><br>Wigan manager Paul Jewell felt the right decision was made to abandon the game for the safety of the players, adding: "We just couldn't continue playing in those conditions.<br><br>"I would hate to have to be talking about a serious injury to one of my players. Both (Watford boss) Adrian Boothroyd and I were in agreement. We did not want anyone to be hurt."<br><br>Referee Steve Tanner added "The heavens opened up today and the game was abandoned for the players' safety.<br><br>"In our opinion the players may have been put at risk should the game have continued.<br><br>"We decided to give it ten minutes to see if conditions cleared, and having spoken to the grounds men they made it very clear that the pitch would not improve.<br><br>"The decision was then made to abandon the game."<br><br>Watford manager Adrian Boothroyd agreed with the referee's decision, adding: "The players could have been at risk should the game have continued.<br><br>"The fans pay good money to watch good football and you can't really play good football when the ball is stuck in a puddle," he added.</div>
