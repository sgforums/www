            <div class='col-md body'>Roberto Mancini has played down speculation that he will succeed Jose Mourinho as Chelsea boss.<br><br>The Internazionale manager has been touted by some as a future incumbent of the Stamford Bridge hot seat following the uncertainty that has surrounded Mourinho's position in recent weeks.<br><br>Inter are riding high in Serie A after claiming a club record 14 consecutive wins and Mancini's coaching pedigree can not be questioned.<br><br>But the Italian is happy at the Nerazzurri and claims quotes attributed to him recently have been misleading.<br><br>"It's like if a good player who plays in a great team is wanted by another big club. It is satisfying because it means that I am doing a good job," said Mancini.<br><br>"I have never spoken to anyone and I certainly haven't said those comments," Mancini added, when asked if he had expressed an interest in moving to Chelsea.<br><br>"I cannot deny something that I haven't said.<br><br>"If the press comment on some quotes that I may have said two years ago, for example, that I would want to coach in England after my adventure with Inter finishes, it's a different story."<br><br>Inter president Massimo Moratti has already stated his determination to keep Mancini at the club long-term, and the coach - whose existing contract expires in 2008 - appears keen on the idea.<br><br>"When things are going well, it's not good to make alterations," said Mancini.<br><br>"Are there grounds to continue with this project? I think so, there's no problem whatsoever.<br><br>"Will I be able to remain at Inter like, for example, Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United?<br><br>"I think this is very difficult in Italy - he (Ferguson) has been at Manchester for 20 years. For us, we would have to win practically always.<br><br>"In Italy, if you win for four or five straight years and then you fail in the sixth year to win something, things happen."</div>
