            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool got the New Year off to a flying start with an impressive 3-0 win over Bolton at Anfield.<br><br>Two superb second half goals from Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard, and Dirk Kuyt's late strike, gave Rafa Benitez's men all three points against a disappointing Bolton side.<br><br>The win helps Liverpool leapfrog Bolton into third spot in the table and ends Bolton's good run of form.<br><br>Liverpool looked to impose themselves on Bolton from the off and Gerrard had the first shot in anger after just two minutes with a shot from the edge of the area which flew wide of the target.<br><br>Bolton looked happy to sit back and defend early on, but they almost got through on 14 minutes when Nicky Hunt broke free down the right only for Jamie Carragher to clear his cross from reaching Nicolas Anelka.<br><br>Tal Ben Haim was booked by referee Graham Poll on 20 minutes for hauling down Kuyt in full flow as the Dutchman tried to lead a Liverpool counter attack.<br><br>Liverpool came close to breaking the deadlock on 28 minutes when Steve Finnan worked a one-two with Jermaine Pennant on the edge of the box and the Republic of Ireland international fired in a rasping shot which Jussi Jaaskelainen superbly tipped onto and over the crossbar.<br><br>The home side continued to call the tune and Gerrard tried his luck from long-range on 31 minutes, but his effort flew well wide.<br><br>A minute later Xabi Alonso missed a good opening when Pennant teed up the Spaniard on the edge of the box and the midfield schemer clipped his shot just wide of the far post.<br><br>Mark Gonzalez wasted a shooting opportunity on 33 minutes when he found space on the edge of the box, but the Chilean dragged his right-footed shot horribly wide.<br><br>Crouch had a half chance soon after when he glanced Finnan's inviting cross wide of the target.<br><br>John Arne Riise had the last noteworthy shot of the first half when he blazed a half volley from the edge of the box over the top as Bolton restricted Liverpool to efforts from long-range.<br><br>Liverpool picked up where they left off at the start of the second half and Gonzalez had their first chance after the restart when he headed Pennant's cross over the top.<br><br>Ivan Campo was the next man to go in the book when he was cautioned for a blatant push on Pennant.<br><br>Liverpool made the breakthrough they deserved on 61 minutes with a brilliant overhead kick from Crouch.<br><br>Pennant sent over a cross from the right and Crouch showed superb agility to volley his effort into the bottom corner past Jaaskelainen in what was a carbon copy of his goal against Galatasaray earlier in the season also down at The Kop end.<br><br>Two minutes later Liverpool doubled their lead as Gerrard celebrated his recent MBE with another classy goal.<br><br>Kuyt combined with Pennant down the right and the Dutchman picked out Gerrard arriving in the box with his cross and the Liverpool skipper smashed an unstoppable volley into the top corner to spark wild celebrations among the home side.<br><br>Bolton defender Abdoulaye Faye was lucky not to be sent off on 65 minutes when after being booked for fouling Crouch he kicked away the ball in frustration, but Poll decided to only warn the Senegal international rather than hand him a second yellow card.<br><br>Crouch had a great opening on 70 minutes when Finnan picked him out inside the box, but the giant striker drove his shot straight down the throat of Jaaskelainen.<br><br>Bolton tried to respond and substitute Ricardo Vaz Te saw his corner kicked away from right in front of the near post by Pennant and from the following corner Faye headed over the top when well placed.<br><br>Crouch really should have added a third on 76 minutes when Pennant's cross found him unmarked inside the box, but the striker wastefully headed the ball over the crossbar.<br><br>Kuyt was denied a goal ten minutes from time with a powerful run and shot which Jaaskelainen tipped over the crossbar.<br><br>From the resulting corner Jaaskelainen produced a flying save to deny his fellow Finn Sami Hyypia a goal from his powerful header.<br><br>Kuyt got the goal his performance deserved on 83 minutes when substitute Luis Garcia played him in on goal and the Dutchman held off Ricardo Gardner before slotting his shot into the bottom corner past Jaaskelainen.<br><br>Crouch should have grabbed a fourth in the dying seconds when Finnan again picked him out inside the box, but with only Jaaskelainen to beat he headed straight at the keeper.</div>
