            <div class='col-md body'>West Ham boss Alan Curbishley hit out at referee Graham Poll after ten-man West Ham were denied victory in a six goal thriller at Upton Park.<br><br>Curbishley claimed Poll failed to spot a foul in the build-up to Philippe Christanval's controversial injury-time leveller.<br><br>"I was disappointed with the goal," Curbishley told Sky Sports. "I thought there was a foul on Christian Dailly in the build up, but it wasn't to be.<br><br>"He got most things right today Graham Poll, but when we desperately needed him I don't think he got it right.<br><br>"I think the challenge, it might have been Voltz or Brown, went into Christian Dailly with his arm and he could have quite easily give a foul."<br><br>Tomasz Radzinski opened the scoring after 16 minutes for Fulham, but Bobby Zamora levelled before the break.<br><br>Yossi Benayoun then put the Hammers ahead with a marvellous individual effort within 20 seconds of the restart, only for Brian McBride to head Fulham level on the hour.<br><br>Benayoun then pounced to make it 3-2 with his second before Christanval's hammer blow late on.<br><br>"You couldn't make up what's happened to us today," moaned Curbishley.<br><br>"It was cruel I think. We desperately needed to hold on to the three points and it would have been a big three points for us. The players have done everything, I think the fans saw that."<br><br>"I've been here four weeks and in charge for seven games. I have had loads of things to contend with, beating Man Utd, losing 6-0 to Reading, players injured, there's a lot of things I've had to take in, today's another one."<br><br>West Ham's hopes of victory were not helped after Zamora was shown a second yellow card for a challenge on Carlos Bocanegra 14 minutes from the end.<br><br>"He's on a yellow card you've got to be very careful, I think it was needless challenge," added the former Charlton boss.</div>
