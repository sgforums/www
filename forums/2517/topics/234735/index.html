            <div class='col-md body'>Frank Lampard has paid tribute to his team-mates for staying strong despite the internal ructions which have threatened to derail Chelsea's season.<br><br>In recent weeks the reigning champions have had to contend with daily reports of a growing rift between manager Jose Mourinho and owner Roman Abramovich, as well as rumours of dressing room disputes.<br><br>However their Portuguese manager's future now looks to be on steadier ground, until the summer at least, and The Blues are keen to focus all their efforts on closing the six-point gap that separates them from leaders Manchester United.<br><br>Chelsea's bid for a third consecutive title has stalled with just one win in their last five games, but Lampard believes the spirit the squad have shown off the pitch will translate into positive results in the coming weeks.<br><br>"It's important to keep that togetherness when things aren't going so well, and when people are saying things from the outside, and we have stayed very strong," Lampard told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"So I give credit to the lads, we are a strong bunch.<br><br>"As soon we drew a couple of games over Christmas people wanted to start saying things, it's part of being at the club, but it is very important as a player that you don't take your eye off the ball and start getting concerned about things off the pitch.<br><br>"[You] make sure you train well and play well and that is what we are trying to do."<br><br>Lampard also denied that intense media pressure would have an effect on Mourinho, who stated at the weekend that he expects to see out his contract at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"The manger is not a stupid man, far from it, and he will understand it," Lampard added.<br><br>"We have all been in the game long enough to know that it is not always plain sailing and good results, so that is not a problem.<br><br>"We have to keep looking at the bigger picture, we are in four competitions and we want to win them all."</div>
