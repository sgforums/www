            <div class='col-md body'>Kevin Phillips scored twice in the final three minutes to hand West Brom a thrilling 3-2 win over Luton.<br><br>Luton seemed set to secure their first away win since September after coming from a goal behind to lead, but Phillips stabbed home late on and then headed home in injury-time to move The Baggies to within seven points of Birmingham.<br><br>The Baggies made a bright start to the contest and Richard Chaplow fired an early warning of their intent when striking a post from 20 yards.<br><br>Luton, who have lost key players in the transfer market, were not overawed and Warren Feeney saw a shot deflected inches wide.<br><br>Feeney's pace was a problem for West Brom but he should have done better when shooting wide from six yards.<br><br>West Brom were the dominant force, though, and Phillips tested Dean Kiely from the edge of the box, while Chaplow headed just wide following a good cross from Phillips.<br><br>The contest seemed set to end goalless at the break, but no-one had told Jason Koumas who showed his class when gliding between two defenders and curling a shot into the bottom corner.<br><br>The home side were the dominant force at the start of the second half, but they were made to rue wasteful finishing from Phillips and Diomansy Kamara as Keith Keane drew Luton level on the hour.<br><br>The midfielder cut in from the right and exchanged passes with Steve Robinson before tucking his shot into the corner.<br><br>Luton came into the game without an away win since September, but they took confidence from Keane's goal and Adam Boyd and David Bell combined to provide Warren Feeney with a simple tap in.<br><br>West Brom never gave up and their persistence was rewarded on 88 minutes as Phillips held off a clutch of Luton defenders before stabbing home, although The Hatters felt they should have been awarded a free-kick for a foul on Bell in the build-up to the goal.<br><br>The Baggies were awarded a free-kick in injury-time and Phillips climbed high to head beyond Kiely to pinch what had appeared a most unlikely victory three minutes earlier.</div>
