            <div class='col-md body'>And so the EPL is come round again with all the attendant ooh and ahhs coming out of the woodwork.<br><br>Then weÂ’ll have all these Brit wannabees, wearing their favorite team colors parading them as if they were really from West Ham or Tottenham, rubbing shoulders with them white guys at the pubs and watering holes as if that would make them more Brit or justify the support .<br><br>I was having a drink in a pub quietly on my own, when an English guy come to me and starts questioning me on the local madness for English football.<br><br>He says these things<br><br>1)	heÂ’d prefer live football to televised anytime<br><br>2)	That to support our local teams because thatÂ’s what football is all about-local<br><br>3)	That we donÂ’t really deserve to support the English teams cos weÂ’re not local-ie we were not born there and that many many Singapore fans of English football pick their clubs because they were successful at the of time of selection.<br><br>4)	That if we the local fans were to go to say West Ham ( he is a west ham fan) and say proudly that youÂ’re a west ham fan, theyÂ’d tell you to go f**k off because you were not born there.<br><br>And the worst part is they donÂ’t even play good football ( except for Man U and Arsenal)<br><br>Me and my friend counted the average number of passes each of the top teams and they come up woefully short.<br><br>Except for Man U and Arsenal, the rest can hardly hold on to the ball. Is this football?<br><br>I guess in the end,in the final analysis, only the women have any REAL reason to be watching - eye candy.<br><br>PS I have been watching this wretched thing they called English football for many years and the best scene I ever saw was this. It come on a news clip about a small club (i forget the name) in some real cellar division, and they'd just lost the game and got relegated.<br>There was a girl in the stands, alone, and she must have been about what, 15/16 and she was weeping,almost uncontrollably. Now thats the best image I have about football.<br>Alone and crying for that ugly child.(the football club) Now how many of you have got the guts to support the newly promoted ( i dunno who they are)</div>
