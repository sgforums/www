            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes keeper Petr Cech could make a shock playing return in January.<br>The 24-year-old was not expected to play again this season after fracturing his skull in a collision with Reading's Stephen Hunt in mid-October.<br><br>But Mourinho said: "I could bet he is not far from being back.<br><br>"A lot of people, including myself, thought he wouldn't play this season but now the doubt is which month he is back - January or February."<br><br>The Czech international had emergency surgery to insert two metal plates in his head after he was injured in the match at the Madeksji Stadium on 14 October.<br><br>However, he has made good progress in his recovery and recently revealed he would return to full training early in 2007.<br><br>Midfielder Frank Lampard said he and his team-mates have been taken aback by the speed of Cech's return.<br><br>"He's looking great, really good," said Lampard.<br><br>"His recovery has been immense. You don't see him for a couple of weeks and then all of a sudden he's back to old Pete really.<br><br>"It's good to see him training, even if it's tentative training with the headgear.<br><br>"Let's hope he's on the way to full recovery - the sooner the better."<br><br>Earlier in December, Cech insisted he had no fears about returning to action.<br><br>"Everyone is asking if I am afraid when I am back. But Carlo Cudicini said the main thing: 'How can I be afraid of something I don't even remember?'" he said.<br><br>606 DEBATE: What are your thoughts on a possible Cech return in January?<br><br>"That is exactly what it is going to be with me because I don't remember anything from the game. I don't even remember the injury.<br><br>"I woke up three days later and I had already 30 stitches on my head and it was difficult for me. But that game I don't remember so I don't think I am going to be afraid.<br><br>"Last week I spent a whole day in Oxford with the surgeon for some consultations and some tests. We are still waiting for the report from that but as far as I am concerned, we are looking very positive and very well.<br><br>"The brain is working very well and I haven't lost anything I had so for the moment it is looking very well."<br><br>Good luck, Man Utd!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
