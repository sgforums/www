            <div class='col-md body'>David Beckham insists that the chance to make history, rather than record amounts of money, is the main motivation behind his decision to move to MLS.<br><br>The former England skipper revealed on Thursday that he will travel to the United States at the end of the season on a five-year deal worth a staggering Â£128million, swapping galactico status for a place amongst the LA Galaxy.<br><br>Apart from earning far more than any other professional footballer on the globe, the move to the United States will present the Real Madrid midfielder with the chance to become an ambassador for the game in a country where Baseball, Basketball and American Football reign supreme.<br><br>Beckham will be following in the footsteps of former world stars such as Pele, George Best and Johan Cruyff when he goes to collect his record paycheque in the summer, but the 31-year-old is hoping to establish a more lasting legacy than the now defunct NASL which eventually collapsed in 1984.<br><br>"Of course it's a huge amount of money... it's an amazing amount of money," Beckham told ABC News regarding his Â£70,000-a-day deal.<br><br>"I said yesterday and some people laughed at me, but this move for me is not about the money, it's about hopefully making a difference in the US with the soccer and that's what I'm going there for.<br><br>"I'm going for the life of course, for my kids to enjoy it and my wife to enjoy it, but the main thing for me is to improve the soccer and to improve the standard and to be part of history really.<br><br>"I think soccer can be a lot bigger in the US. From a young age kids are brought up with soccer - they're brought up with soccer to a certain age and then they seem to go into other areas.<br><br>"Hopefully that's what I'll be there for, to pass my experience on to them."<br><br>After cultivating his superstar status in Manchester and cementing his place as a global icon in Madrid, Beckham admits he is looking forward to the challenge of expanding his brand in California.<br><br>"Moving there as a family is a thing for us, it's a big plus," Beckham added. "We've spent four years in Spain, obviously we lived in England before that.<br><br>"Now we're moving to a totally different country with a different culture, a culture that we will embrace and we're looking forward to embracing."</div>
