            <div class='col-md body'>The signs should have been taken seriously when George Burley left the club last October, after 11 unbeaten games in charge. He seemed to be doing well, winning the manager of the month award twice in a row.<br><br>However, his departure revealed an uneasy relationship with club owner Vladimir Romanov. The Lithuanian businessman later sacked two board members and brough in some of his associates, including his son Roman.<br><br>Graham Rix was later appointed manager of the Edinburgh club, but soon lost his job. Reports had surfaced that Rix told players Romanov was pulling the strings. Former FBK Kaunas manager Valdas Ivanauskas was named caretaker-manager, but subsequently got the job on a permanent basis when Hearts finished second in the SPL.<br><br>Last month, Ivanauskas went on leave, citing health concerns. His duties were covered by sporting director Eduard Malofeev. Before the match against Dunfermline, Romanov warned his players that they would be transfer-listed if they did not perform well. Club captain Stephen Pressley issued a statement voicing the players' unhappiness with the way the club was run. His revelation of "significant unrest" at the Tynecastle dressing room was supported by goalkeeper Craig Gordon.<br><br>Two days ago, Pressley was stripped of captaincy. Teammate Paul Hartley, who was at Pressley's side when he read out the statement, was dropped to the bench.<br><br>Belarussian Malofeev remains in charge despite not winning any matches. Ivanauskas looks set to return when he recovers, much to the fans' annoyance.</div>

It was only a matter of time before he got back to doing that."<br><br>Mikoliunas was recruited from Kaunas almost two years ago and Gordon said: "When he first came to the club, the fans took him to their hearts straight away and he looked a really exciting prospect.<br><br>"He is a young boy and he is going to learn, but that goal will do his confidence the world of good and hopefully he can kick-start his season.<br><br>"At times, he has been given a bit of stick by our own support.<br><br>"By his own admission, he has not been playing as well as he would like."<br><br></div>
