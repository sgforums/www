            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Carragher: Rafa will give us the one we want.. the league title.</strong><br><br>THE CHAMPIONS League, the FA Cup twice, the League Cup twice, the UEFA Cup, the European Super Cup twice and the Community Shield twice. Most players would be happy with this glittering haul of silverware, but not Jamie Carragher.<br><br>Carragher has won just about everything during his Liverpool career, everything except the Premier League title. Margaret Thatcher was still clinging to power in No.10 and Richard Gere was starring in Pretty Woman the last time the trophy was paraded around Anfield way back in 1990.<br><br>Like most Kopites, Carragher thought this season might be the one when they ended their title wait and no one is more disappointed than him when he looks at the table and sees the Reds trailing Manchester United by 13 points.<br><br>Carragher is as uncompromising in his ambitions as he is on the pitch and he admits he is "desperate" to get his hands on that Premiership trophy. And as he sat speaking at Liverpool's Academy in Kirkby. "Oh yeah, of course I think he can do it," said the Scouser. "He's a proven title winner because of what he did with Valencia where he beat Real Madrid and Barcelona twice. "That's quite similar to here with Manchester United and Chelsea and they are above us at the moment.<br><br>"Hopefully we can bring some players in during the summer and we can change that and take it to the next level. "Rafa is the man to do that and you only have to look at the job he's done in two-and-a-half years - he's won the Champions League, the FA Cup, the European Super Cup and the Community Shield.<br><br>"If you look at what he's done since he's been here, Chelsea are the only club who can compare - and they've had more financial backing than us. Since he's been here, he's probably done better than any other manager in the league.<br><br>"Everyone is desperate to win the league. I'm like the fans and I'm desperate to win it. It's the last thing I need to tick off in my career. I won't be happy until we've done that."<br><br>Carragher, 28, admits Liverpool are playing for third place and while this will represent some success after the poor start they made, he admits he had hoped for much more this season. "At the moment we have to be looking at third place and we can't really be thinking about the other two now," he said. "We have to make sure we get that third place and close the gap on the top two.<br><br>"But I wanted a little bit more out of the season than to just finish third and I'm a bit disappointed. "I thought at the beginning of the season - like a lot of fans I spoke to in the street - that we might get a bit closer. I thought we might give the top two more of a run for their money.<br><br>"But you look at the consistency of Manchester United and Chelsea and they only lose two or three games. That's what champions do."<br></div>
