            <div class='col-md body'>Nicky Weaver admits he will have to maintain his form to keep Andreas Isaksson out of the Manchester City side.<br><br>Isaksson was expected to be Stuart Pearce's first choice this season, but the Swede missed the start of the campaign due to injury following his arrival from Rennes.<br><br>Weaver grasped his chance between the posts, after an injury-plagued few seasons, but is aware he cannot afford to let his standards drop.<br><br>"I've just missed the one game this year and I'm absolutely delighted to be playing week in, week out," Weaver told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"Andreas Isaksson's fit now and putting pressure on me, so I know I have to keep performing to stay in the team."<br><br>City suffered a first home defeat of the season in losing 2-1 to Tottenham on Sunday and Weaver accepts the performance was not up to scratch.<br><br>He added: "I thought in the second half we did okay and perhaps could have drawn in the end.<br><br>"But the damage was done in the first half. We've got to improve over the Christmas period."<br><br>Joey Barton scored City's goal in the defeat and Weaver believes the midfielder is worthy of a call-up to the England squad.<br><br>Weaver concluded: "I think he's our leading scorer now and he deserves everything he gets.<br><br>"He has worked very hard at his game and has matured a lot as a lad as well.<br><br>"Over the last 18 months as a player he has certainly developed and if he keeps improving he's certainly got a chance."</div>
