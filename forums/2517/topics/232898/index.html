            <div class='col-md body'>The Royals director of football Nicky Hammond confirmed on the clubÂ’s official website, www.readingfc.co.uk, that an approach had been made for the 25-year-old centre-back, whose contract with the Eircom League club runs out in November.<br><br>Having just seen striker George OÂ’Callaghan move to Ipswich - not to mention the Royals picking up both Kevin Doyle and Shane Long last season at a bargain price - Cork are determined to hold out for a sizeable fee.<br><br>However, under the terms of his deal, Bennett would be free to talk to other clubs from June.<br><br>While the 6ft 2ins defender is happy enough to continue playing where he is, a chance to challenge himself in the English top flight is a big lure.<br><br>Â“I am in the dark, but it would appeal to me. Anybody with a career wants to further their ambitions as I do. This is the Premiership - so who would not want that?Â” Bennett told the Reading Evening Post.<br><br>Â“Reading are flying and Kevin Doyle, Shane Long and Stephen Hunt are all doing well, but I am under contract here with Cork.Â”<br><br>Steve Coppell is keen to bring new faces in during the January transfer window but Hammond maintains the Berkshire club will not be held to ransom.<br><br>Â“We are still working hard to strengthen the squad,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“We have had offers on the table for players and discussions are ongoing - but it is not proving easy. The market is inflated.<br><br>Â“We realise there is a premium to be paid if you want players in January but by the same token we have to make the right call.<br><br>Â“Some of the fees being asked are absolutely ridiculous.Â”<br><br>Leading scorer Doyle hopes to be back in action sooner rather than later following his hamstring problem.<br><br>Scans have revealed the damage is not as bad as first thought, and the 10-goal Irish striker could return towards the end of February.<br><br>Doyle said: Â“I am a quick healer and hopefully I will be back within one month.<br><br>Â“My aim now is to come back quicker, better and stronger than ever.Â”<br><br>With Dave Kitson, Bobby Convey, John Halls, Aaron Brown and skipper Graeme Murty also stepping up their rehabilitation, Coppell could have a welcome selection poser as he prepares for the visit of Sheffield United this weekend.</div>
