            <div class='col-md body'>Ashley Young has told skysports.com of his delight at having scored on his Aston Villa debut against Newcastle, although he concedes personal joy was tempered considerably by his side's loss.<br><br>While Villa went down to a 3-1 defeat at St James' Park on Wednesday, the performance of club record signing Young gave ample reason for encouragement.<br><br>The talented forward got his Villa career off to the best possible start, with his first goal in claret and blue going some way in paying off his lofty price tag.<br><br>"I was pleased to score on my debut, especially at a ground like St James' Park - of course it was good," he told skysports.com.<br><br>"But I was disappointed not to get the three points, I thought given the chances we could have got at least a draw.<br><br>"You want to get out there and score goals and that's what I did on Wednesday.<br><br>"It's totally different being at Villa than at Watford - different styles of play. It was nice to be at a new club and playing in a new position, which I wasn't really used to."<br><br>Also making his debut in the North East was fellow new boy John Carew, and with the big Norwegian and Young working well in tandem, Villa's starlet is predicting bright times ahead.<br><br>"Going off the other night I thought things went well," he concluded. "I thought the partnership worked well with John.<br><br>"I played just off Carew, which is the position the gaffer sees me in. But just as long as I'm in the starting line-up it doesn't matter really matter where I play.<br><br>"I just want to establish myself, playing every week. That's the priority. Hopefully things can go on from here."</div>
