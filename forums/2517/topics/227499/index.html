The Addicks are second from bottom of the Barclays Premiership, seven points from safety.<br><br>The final straw for the Charlton board appears to be the results of the last week. They crashed out of the Carling Cup quarter-finals, losing 1-0 at home to League Two side Wycombe after a dismal display on Tuesday.<br><br>That was followed by a 2-0 defeat in the Premiership at Middlesbrough on Saturday. Pardew's first match in charge will be Wednesday evening's London derby with Fulham at the Valley, live on Sky Sports.<br><br>A club statement announcing the news added that no further comment will be made until Charlton hold a press conference at their Sparrows Lane training ground at 1.30pm on Boxing Day.<br><br>In a remarkable turn of events, Pardew was replaced at West Ham earlier this month by Alan Curbishley, who managed Charlton for 15 years before resigning at the end of last season.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pardew's transfer pot nearly empty</strong><br><br>Alan Pardew's appointment as Charlton Athletic manager has been tempered by the news that he will have "virtually nothing" to spend in the January sales and his chairman, Richard Murray, last night said the board would have to club together in order to make any new signings.<br><br>Pardew takes over at The Valley 16 days after being sacked by West Ham and replaces Les Reed, who left Charlton after 41 days in charge, despite signing a two-year contract last week. The 45-year-old inherits a side nine points from safety and with only one win since early November but is hampered by the fact that Iain Dowie, Charlton's manager at the start of the season, dipped into next season's budget with an Â£11.2m spree last summer.<br><br>"We've got virtually nothing to spend, so the directors have got together and said 'we'll try and help a little'," Murray said. "We're not all like Roman Abramovich unfortunately; we're small businessmen in our own fields but we'll put a little bit together so at least he can try to strengthen. We'll wheel and deal and there will be a little bit of money so we can bring maybe three or four signings in to freshen things up."</div>
