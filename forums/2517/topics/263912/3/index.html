I guest it was a draw 0-0 and it really turned out a 1-1 draw.<br><br>I don't know why Australia is what the English language media love.<br>I don't fancy them winning the Asian Cup even months ago. They can go as far as the semi final, maybe but not winning the cup. I don't think so. They're over-rated just because they have some players in Europe, especially the English Premier League and Bresciano in the Italian Serie A. Even if they're in the EPL, it doesn't mean that they're stars. I don't think they're stars like what the newspaper portray them to be. I think they're just average players in average clubs like Blackburn Rovers and Everton. Yes Cahill scored the equalizer in injury time to level but overall it's just a bit of luck and to me, they're not super stars. They're beatable. Other teams just need more confidence. Iraq might be able to beat them. Thailand might also be able to do it. Who knows right?<br><br>If the Aussies have stars from those Everton, Blackburn teams, we have a star in Man Utd, Tottenham Hotspur, Reading and Middlesborough. No big deal at all.<br><br>You're in Japan now, I don't think you can even find the articles talking so much about how good is Australia right? It's the same in Korea. We don't care how good or bad the Aussies are because we know on a good day, we can beat them. We don't think we're better but we think it's 50-50.<br><br>Simple over-rated. I bet and I won. Anyway, the media is biased, especially those English-language media. I really don't like those English media, to be frank.<br><br>Which team really worth respect is Vietnam. They really did well. Good start, good work. Well done. If Qatar and Japan are not careful, they can lose to Vietnam too.<br><br>Did the TV in Japan show the Qatar - Japan game live?<br><br>Tomorrow China - Malaysia. Some Malaysians said that Malaysia will beat China 1-0 or 2-0. I don't think so.<br><br>My guess is Malaysia 0-3 China. China can score at least 2 goals. Malaysia is no match for China. They're shorter and smaller. The Chinese are faster, taller and bigger.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Cheers Ninja!</div>

Yasuyuki Konno latched on to a through ball from Kengo Nakamura on the left side of the box before sending a low cross with the outside of his right foot to Takahara at the far post, and the Eintracht Frankfurt man made no mistake.<br><br>In the 81st minute, Quintana, who operated alone up front for most of the game, threatened the Japanese goal with a free kick which was just over the bar.<br><br>But seven minutes later he had more luck after he was impeded by Yuki Abe and he picked himself up off the turf to fire through the wall and past Kawaguchi.<br><br>The game ended on a sour note for the Qataris, however, when Hussein Yasser was sent off for a lunge at Hideo Hashimoto and coach Musovic was also sent to the stands for protesting too loudly over the call.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Group B News<br><br>Draw leaves Musovic surprised<br>Jul 9, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>HANOI Â– Jubilant Qatar coach Dzemaludin Musovic was as surprised as anyone after his team earned a late draw with defending Asian Cup champions Japan at My Dinh Stadium on Monday.<br><br>Sebastian QuintanaÂ’s 88th minute free kick cancelled out Naohiro TakaharaÂ’s opener from the 61st minute to give the Asian Games gold medallists a share of the points in the Group B encounter.<br><br>Â“I didnÂ’t expect us to draw today,Â” said the Bosnian coach. Â“Japan have very good individual players and I also didnÂ’t know how my players would react after the training camps and friendly games.<br><br>Â“But in friendly game, you cannot see the complete image of the team, you have to wait and see how they will react during the competition.Â”<br><br>Musovic praised his players for their performance against Japan, a team who he had lauded in the build up to the game but said he was not going to overreact ahead of his sideÂ’s second game, against surprise group leaders Vietnam.<br><br>Â“I am satisfied with the result and with the way my team tried to play today in this game,Â” he said. Â“It is hard for players to adapt to playing in the first game.<br><br>Â“I am taking one game at a time. We are in an excellent position now, but it is only one game. We must now play well against Vietnam and also in the last game against the UAE, because this will decide who will qualify, but we now have a lot of motivation.Â”<br><br>However, despite the result, the evening was spoilt for Musovic in injury time when he was sent from the bench after complaining to Australian referee Matthew Breeze, who had just sent off Hussein Yasser for a lunge on Japan substitute Hideo Hashimoto.<br><br>Â“I was near to the incident,Â” said Musovic. Â“I was in a better position than the referee. He [Yasser] tried to make contact with the ball, and it was not his intention to foul.<br><br>Â“We will now lose a player for the next game. The referee must realise it is the last minute and also it was an attacking player who did not make many fouls during the game.Â”<br></div>

I will have to decide at the end of the group how significant his result is,Â” said Osim.<br><br>Japan must now re-group for FridayÂ’s meeting with the United Arab Emirates as OsimÂ’s side look to follow-up their AFC Asian Cup victories in Lebanon in 2000 and China three years ago.<br><br>Â“It would have been easier to lift the team if we had won,Â” added Osim.  Â“Today we could not show our true potential, we did not play very well. I was surprised how my players played. They played good football; the problem is that Japan has not reached our true level of playing beautiful and efficient football.<br><br>Â“We must learn how to take our chances when we create them in front of goal.<br><br>Â“There is not just one reason for this, if we had just two reasons like mentality and performance, it would be a lot easier.<br><br>Â“Winning is not easy, but each game is different. We must now concentrate on the next game.<br><br>Â“Vietnam now have the best chance to qualify mathematically, they know what they want and they have a special motivation go through. We are still challengers, but Vietnam are top at the moment and they are a very dangerous team, we must be careful against them.Â”<br><br>Osim also played down concerns over the fitness of Satoru Yamagishi, who was replaced with 17 minutes remaining by Naotake Hanyu, insisting the midfielder was just feeling the affects of the humid Hanoi conditions.<br></div>

For us, we do have our own advantages and we will hopefully utilise them to qualify.Â”<br><br>Despite HanÂ’s positive outlook, China head coach Zhu Guanghu has already come under intense pressure from the Chinese media during a less than convincing build-up to the 14th edition of AsiaÂ’s premier tournament, a spell that saw his side labour to wins over Singapore and Palestine.<br><br>With nothing but the best expected from a team who finished as runners-up to Japan when they hosted the Asian Cup three years ago, Han was nevertheless confident that China are fully focussed on the task ahead.<br><br>Â“I think that our three opponents are exactly the same for us, they all represent important matches for us,Â” he explained.<br><br>Following MondayÂ’s training session at the Bukit Jalil Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, a China team official announced that front man Qu Bo, a former Tottenham Hotspur and Blackburn Rovers trainee, had been forced to leave the pitch after damaging a foot.<br><br>Team doctors are expected to assess his injury later on Monday, before making a decision on whether or not the Qingdao Zhongneng forward is fit enough to play against Malaysia.<br><br></div>

Nanthakumar has revealed that the AFC Asian Cup co-hosts are in a confident mood ahead of their opening Group C clash with China on Tuesday.<br><br>Speaking after the Malaysians had enjoyed a brisk training session at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium on Sunday evening, Nanthakumar, a key figure throughout PerakÂ’s impressive domestic campaign, felt that the South East Asian side are more than capable of improving on the narrow 1-0 defeat they suffered at the hands of China in a qualifier for the 2006 World Cup three years ago.<br><br>Â“Today went well and we will now see what happens on Tuesday, We are very confident going into the game against China,Â” said the talented 29-year-old who is equally at home playing in midfield or at the heart of defence.<br><br>Â“We lost (the World Cup qualifier) 1-0, but this year we are better prepared and our preparations are going very well. We have slowly improved.Â”<br><br>Nanthakumar, whilst clearly relishing the challenges that come with playing at AsiaÂ’s premier tournament, was also keen to point out that Malaysia would have to be at the top of their game if they were to emerge successfully from a tough group which will also feature Uzbekistan and a much fancied Iran side.<br><br>Â“We will be fighting very hard in order to win the (first) match with China,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“We must work hard in the game because China have a lot of experienced players, so we have to try very hard. For me, Iran are a strong team because they have already played in a World Cup. Whatever happens we will fight for a win.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile Malaysia head coach Norizan Bakar told the assembled media that, with a fully fit squad to choose from, he was looking forward to his charges rising to the occasion.<br><br>Â“This is the time for the team to do their best. People say Malaysian football is in decline but we are trying our best," declared the one-time Perlis and Penang boss.<br><br>Â“The players are the performers and when they get to this stage they have to perform at their level best.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Group C News<br><br>No favourites for Cup, insists Zhu<br>Jul 9, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - Speaking ahead of his sideÂ’s AFC Asian Cup 2007 Group C opener against Malaysia on Tuesday, China head coach Zhu Guanghu has insisted that any of the teams currently gathered in South East Asia are capable of winning the tournament.<br><br>With 16 sides vying for glory in this yearÂ‘s competition, Zhu revealed that whilst the spirit in the China camp is high, their bid to win the countryÂ’s first Asian Cup title had not been made any easier by being drawn to play one of the four co-hosts in their opening game.<br><br>Â“The opening match is always a difficult one, especially when you have to play the hosts. I do however think that all the teams in the final 16 are very strong teams,Â” Zhu said.<br><br>Â“Every one of the teams playing here is capable of qualifying for the quarter-finals and even the semi-finals, and of course, we have prepared very well for tomorrowÂ’s match.<br><br>Â“We respect every opponent, especially Malaysia. I have noticed that they have changed their tactics slightly and have recruited some taller players. We will try our best to conquer all the difficulties that there are here. Our players are ready.Â”<br><br>Zhu was quick to point out that that the tough playing conditions he has already witnessed in South East Asia may force his side to adjust their tactics somewhat.<br><br>Â“It is different playing here in the Asean region with the hot and humid weather. The Vietnam and Thailand matches have also told us that, as did our recent friendly match against the Thais.<br><br>Â“Because of this, we may play a different style in order to win the game. Our style depends on our opponents as well. There has to be a balance, sometimes we must play defensively and sometimes we must attack.Â”<br><br>Despite seeing striker Qu Bo hobble off during a brief training session at Bukit Jalil on Sunday night, Zhu remained convinced that his decision not to bring prolific marksman Li Jinyu to South East Asia was the right one to have taken.<br><br>Â“Qu is having a final diagnosis on his injury at a local hospital. We are not happy about this as he is an important member of our team,Â” Zhu explained.<br><br>Â“However, when we selected the team it was based on both the playersÂ’ performances during the domestic season as well as our teamÂ’s tactical needs.<br><br>Â“We also have a teamwork requirement. I agree that Li is a good player but for these reasons, we decided not to pick him.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group C News</strong><br><br>Norizan ready for battle<br>Jul 9, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia head coach Norizan Bakar has issued a rallying cry to his troops on the eve of his sideÂ’s AFC Asian Cup 2007 Group C opener against China, urging them not be overawed by their more illustrious opponents.<br><br>With media interest reaching fever pitch ahead of TuesdayÂ’s clash at Kuala LumpurÂ’s Bukit Jalil Stadium, Norizan was adamant that the time was right for the co-hosts to step up to the mark.<br><br>Â“We know very well that we are the hosts and that we are going to play some great finalists in the Asian Cup,Â” explained the former Perlis and Penang boss.<br><br>Â“Having said that, most of the players in this team have already played against big teams before. At this moment in time, I suppose everybody wants to play with great players.<br><br>Â“The question now of course is whether my players want to be outdone by the good players or whether they are going to try and stop the good players.<br><br>Â“We have to play China, we have to play Uzbekistan and we have to play Iran, the question is simple: are we going to be outplayed by them or do we want to show them that we are on the same level?Â”<br><br>With MalaysiaÂ’s steely determination to succeed apparent, Norizan also conceded that whilst he has taken heart from the positive performances of fellow hosts Thailand and Vietnam, the Malaysian squad had also been fired up by recent criticism of their somewhat indifferent build-up to the Asian Cup.<br><br>Â“The Vietnam and Thailand results have given us encouragement, but in fact we have also been motivated by ourselves because of what has been said about the standard of football in our country.<br><br>Â“Now is the time, in fact now is the best time, for the players and the team as a whole to show everyone that we can perform. We will see how motivated the players are tomorrow against China.Â”<br><br>With 23 fully fit professionals to choose from, Norizan revealed that no matter which of his players take to the pitch, Malaysia will be fighting on a united front.<br><br>Â“In my mind I have settled on my starting eleven for our first match against China tomorrow,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“The players also know that regardless of who starts and who does not, we will all be representing our country and there will be no problems at all with our teamwork.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group D News</strong><br><br>Verbeek staying focused on task in hand<br>Jul 9, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>While the public focus has been on who has not made the trip to Indonesia for the AFC Asian Cup 2007, Korea Republic coach Pim Verbeek has been quietly and patiently preparing his team for their attempt to claim a third continental title.<br><br>Despite their phenomenal World Cup qualifying record, the Koreans have not claimed the Asian Cup since the second tournament way back in 1960, when they successfully defended the title they won in the competitionÂ’s inaugural year, four years previous.<br><br>In the build-up to the tournament, hopes were high that finally the Koreans would make a significant impact on the finals after almost 20 years of failing, even, to reach the final.<br><br>With players attached to clubs such as Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, and others dotted around the rest of Europe, the Koreans looked like a realistic bet to be in serious contention for the title.<br><br>Then the news filtered through that Old Trafford midfielder Park Ji-sung would miss the tournament because of a knee injury; Lee Young-pyo, SpursÂ’ left-back, was next to withdraw while ReadingÂ’s Seol Ki-hyeon was not far behind.<br><br>There was worse to come. Former Excelsior Rotterdam midfielder Kim Nam-il Â–the Korean captain and a key performer in the centre of the park Â– pulled out just days before the team started their final preparations for the tournament.<br><br>Suddenly, it seemed as if KoreaÂ’s hopes had been decimated, struck down by an injury jinx that robbed the team Â– and the tournament Â– of some of AsiaÂ’s most talented and high profile competitors.<br><br>But while other coaches would have seen the withdrawals as a negative, the Dutchman remains philosophical about the situation and is focused on the task in hand.<br><br>Â“Normally, losing these players would be a big problem because they bring experience and confidence to the team and they bring fear to the opponents and we know that,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“But it gives the younger players the possibility, because they know they can be a starting member of the national team. They have a lot of promise.<br><br>Â“Also, in the positions where we have lost players, we donÂ’t have better players than Park Ji-sung and Seol Ki-hyeon, otherwise theyÂ’d be playing in England too. But on the other hand the younger players bring a lot of passion and energy to the team.Â”<br><br>Despite the loss of the majority of their star names, KoreaÂ’s final preparations have gone well. Wins over Iraq and Uzbekistan have set them up well for the finals and their first appearance, which comes in Jakarta on Wednesday when they face Saudi Arabia.<br><br>That has left Verbeek confident that the team can finally end the nationÂ’s long run without success at the Asian Cup this summer.<br><br>Â“I have the strongest feeling that the boys are ready to win the tournament because we donÂ’t have so much to do apart from football,Â” he said. Â“All they do is training, sleeping, training sleeping. So itÂ’s quite boring for the players, but they have done well.<br><br>Â“They have worked very hard and we have a lot of young players who have not played at World Cups or whatever and they all think about how, in 2010, itÂ’s the World Cup and we are 22, 23, 24, 25.<br><br>Â“I have 17 players who are 25 years old or younger, so for the future itÂ’s good and all those players will all want to sell themselves. They all want to go abroad and they know this is a big tournament.<br><br>Â“The older players, the more experienced players, all know that this is probably their last tournament and so they want to win the Asian Cup. They are very determined to have success over here.Â”<br><br>While Verbeek has chosen not to bring 2002 World Cup hero Ahn Jung-hwan to Indonesia or former Asian Young Player of the Year Park Chu-young, he has included veteran goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae in his squad in what looks to be the Suwon BluewingsÂ’ custodians last stab at continental glory.<br><br>Â“LeeÂ’s one of the players who have not won the Asian Cup and he wants to win it,Â” said Verbeek. Â“He brings a lot of experience and energy to the team.<br><br>Â“Ahn Jung-hwan, of course we miss a player like that, but on the other hand I have three very interesting strikers. I have Lee Dong-gook, who hasnÂ’t played 90 minutes for six months, but he played 45 against Iraq and 45 against Uzbekistan and he can play at least 45 minutes and heÂ’s still a good striker.<br><br>Â“Cho Jae-jin, I think is one of the best strikers in Asia. And we took on quite an old, unknown player called Woo Sung-yong from Seongnam. HeÂ’s good. Very strong, tall and with good scoring ability, so I always have the ability to bring an extra striker onto the field, so IÂ’m not so worried about it.Â”<br><br>Perhaps the toughest task for Verbeek and his coaching team is managing expectations back in Korea, where success is almost seen as a foregone conclusion.<br><br>But the 51-year-old, who worked under both Guus Hiddinnk and Dick Advocaat at the last two World Cup tournaments, believes the Koreans are right to set their sights on lifting the trophy on July 29.<br><br>Â“In Korea they think we are going to win, as always, because in Korea its black or white, thereÂ’s nothing in the middle,Â” he said. Â“The first two days they talked about us missing players but after that they forget, so I think itÂ’s good that we didnÂ’t win by too many goals against Uzbekistan because I think we might have raised expectations too much.<br><br>Â“Expectations are always high in Korea but I made a target to get to the semi-final, and if we get to the semi-final then anything can happen. ThatÂ’s what we are going for.<br><br>Â“We came here to win the Asian Cup and not just to participate. Korea should only be playing to try and win the Asian Cup.Â”<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group D News</strong><br><br>Macala wary of Indonesian threat<br>Jul 9, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>JAKARTA Â– Bahrain coach Milan Macala believes his side will need to be at their best if they are to beat Indonesia in their AFC Asian Cup 2007 Group D opener on Tuesday.<br><br>The impressive starts made by co-hosts Vietnam and Thailand Â– who won against the United Arab Emirates and drew with Iraq respectively Â– have the 54-year-old Czech coach in wary mood before the clash at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium and he is keen to avoid another upset.<br><br>"VietnamÂ’s win against the UAE is not good news for us," said Macala. "Our match against Indonesia will be our first match in the tournament and they will have big support behind them and I'm sure that the stadium will be completely full.<br><br>"After only three matches, we saw that there are no weak teams in the tournament and all the teams are good which means that the tournament will be nice.<br><br>"We all saw how Australia, the favourites, celebrated their draw against Oman who had three clear chances to win. We also saw how UAE had good chances to win against Vietnam but they lost.<br><br>"The co-hosts of the tournament proved that they will not be here to make up the numbers and despite that Indonesia want to beat us, they have a big pressure and they will take this game very seriously."<br><br>Macala took charge of the Bahrain side after leading Oman to the final of the Gulf Cup in January and his new team is looking to build on a successful three-year spell, during which they reached the semi-finals of the 2004 Asian Cup and fell just short of qualifying for last yearÂ’s World Cup finals.<br><br>However, that success has had a significant impact on MacalaÂ’s ability to prepare his team for the tournament.<br><br>"We had different preparations from the 2004 Asian Cup, when Bahrain finished in fourth place," he said. "After the Asian Cup many players left Bahrain and went on to play their club football in Qatar or Kuwait.<br><br>"This gave us a big problem as we had a camp in Austria and we remained in the first 10 days without our players who play in Kuwait.<br><br>"The other problem that we had is that the players have different status as some of them are tired while the others had good rest. This is because the football season ends at different times in Qatar, Kuwait or Bahrain."<br><br>The former Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman coach is hoping the lessons his players have learned over the last few seasons have prepared them for the trials that lie ahead of them at this yearÂ’s tournament.<br><br>Â“The players now are more experienced as they have played abroad,Â” he said. Â“They all have experience and good spirit while we have five players from the Olympic team. In brief, the team is a mixture of experienced players and youngsters.<br><br>"When you play football matches with good spirit and good preparation, all you need to have is to play with concentration because if you lose your concentration you will lose the match.<br><br>"Our late arrival to Jakarta is not important at all because I knew that we would have enough time to prepare the team before the first match. We had a camp in Malaysia and we are ready.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Group D News<br><br>Lee Woon Jae named Korea captain for Saudi clash<br>Jul 10, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>JAKARTA Â– World Cup veteran goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae will captain Korea Republic during his sideÂ’s AFC Asian Cup Group D opener against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday.<br><br>Korea coach Pim Verbeek has handed the armband to the Suwon Bluewings goalkeeper, who has returned to the national team squad after spending a period on the sidelines.<br><br>Â“We have a lot of very good goalkeepers in Korea but Woon-jae is by far the most experienced,Â” said Verbeek. Â“We took a very large selection with us and the coaching staff and players are very pleased to have Woon-jae.<br><br>Â“He will start tomorrow and he will captain the team.Â”<br><br>Lee, who was one of the heroes of KoreaÂ’s run to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup finals on home soil, struggled for form throughout the latter stages of 2006 and only played a minor role in qualifying for the Asian Cup finals.<br><br>But he has returned to reclaim his position between the posts and will lead the team in the absence of regular captain Kim Nam-il, who misses the tournament through injury.<br><br>LeeÂ’s experience will be important for the Koreans after Verbeek was forced to bring a relatively young squad to Indonesia after the withdrawal through injury of England-based trio Park Ji-sung, Seol Ki-hyeon and Lee Young-pyo.<br><br>Verbeek is hoping his side can end a series of disappointing results, both against Saudi Arabia and in the Asian Cup.<br><br>The Koreans have not beaten the Arab side in a competitive fixture since 1989 Â– although they did down the Saudis in Riyadh in a friendly in 1994 - while they have not won the Asian Cup in 47 years, when they lifted their second title in 1960, four years after claiming the inaugural championship.<br><br>Â“Saudi is always a tough opponent and I have heard its 18 years and Korea have never won against Saudi, so itÂ’s our target to finish that,Â” he said. Â“The first game in the tournament is very important but the most important thing is that you get out of the group and go to the next round and we will do everything we can to get to the final.<br><br>Â“Saudi is one of the candidates, they are strong physically, experienced and IÂ’m sure they had much longer preparation than us. It will be a good game and a good test to see where we are.Â”<br><br>And while Verbeek believes the hot and humid conditions will take their toll on all the teams, he is confident the Koreans will battle through the pain barrier to achieve their goal of winning the tournament.<br><br>Â“From the start of our training camp I explained that the climate is one of our enemies, but IÂ’m so long in Korea now that I know my players and one of the strengths of Korean football is that the players will never give up,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“Of course they will struggle but they will never give up. It wonÂ’t be easy because itÂ’s a different climate than we are used to.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As expected, China won.<br><br>Actually I guessed China 3-0 Malaysia. Well, it's 5-1. Still won my bet giving 1.5 goals to Malaysia.<br><br>Know why I guess 3 goal margin? It's because in major tournaments or qualifying, most of the time, 3 teams from Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore (sorry about that, my opinion according to historical fact), when meeting teams like China, Korea or Iran, they tend to fall behind by on average of 3 goals. It's in the historical record. If you bet on this, you'll be right most of the time.<br><br>I remember some years back, China trashed Malaysia 4-0 without much difficulty. So I won in this bet. Believe it or not, for years, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore have never been able to match these teams. Some might call it jinx, but I feel that size and skill of players do play a big part.<br><br>A few days back in ESPN Sportscenter, during an interview with former Malaysian player Dollah Salleh and malaysia under 23 coach, they said that Malaysia is strong and would be able to beat China 1-0 or 2-0. Well, I didn't think so. My guess was 3-0. I don't see them beating the Chinese. A draw is already an achievement, really. The GAP is there.  It'll take some years before Malaysia can catch up. They should improve their technic and if possible, groom newer generations to be taller and stronger. It's hard for them to breakthrough with some players with heights of 165cm to challenge men of 180 - 185cm tall.<br><br>Indonesia beat Bahrain 2-1. Well done to Indonesia. They managed to take their few chances well. Bahrain is stronger physically and had several chances but they wasted them. They should blame themselves for wasting the chances to get 3 points. Next 2 games will be tough - against Saudi and Korea.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something to add, Malaysia started their league much earlier than China. Professional league started in Malaysia earlier than China's C-League. I remember that in the earlier days, The professional Malaysians got trashed by Chinese amateurs who were working as civil servants (China only fully turned pro in the late 90s). That was back in the early 90s.<br><br>Football Association of Malaysia should think more and make changes to improve. Otherwise it's a waste of millions of dollars. Groom more taller, stronger and bigger players. Trust me, size do matter. You can afford to have 2 or 3 smaller guys in a team of 23 players but not 80% of the team with heights of less than 175cm.<br><br>This is my frank opinion.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am happy for the Indonesians cuz its not always you get to hear good news in Indonesia and they deserved  the full credit for playing with 11 men instead of 12.If you had watched the Japan vs Qatar game you could see how technical Japan has become cuz we dont have a Maradona or a Lineker but J-leaguers with wild imagination and creativity and this is already enough to give Osim the hard on&gt; <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Ok what happened Malaysia (Apa macam?)? Did they try to play attacking football and got screwed at the back or were they really outclassed in all department?<br>Jaewoon ,I have to disagree with you on the 3 goal margin rule because its like a game of chess and if you make the wrong move you simply get thrashed(see Malaysia boleh).Singapore learned that lesson years ago and is now like 1 or 2 goals behind the rest of Asia big guns..... the gap is closing.When I saw them play defensive football against Japan at Jalan Besar and Tokyo I knew that their trouncing days are over.I dont know how Singapore lost in the qualifying round but I think did they put up a good fight against Iraq and China before bowing out.With more money pump into soccer developement you would be surprise to see how Singapore will fare again next time.You mentioned Dollah Salleh from Malaysia but I remember a Shukor Salleh who is considered one of their Soccer Legends  who also played along side the legendary Moktar Dahari (one of Asia best in the 70s).Ok its getting late and thanks again for the scores and update.<br></div>

Professional league started in Malaysia earlier than China's C-League.
