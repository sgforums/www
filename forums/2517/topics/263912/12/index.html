            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Iraqi celebrations inspire Sabri</strong><br>Jul 25, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR Â– Iraq goalkeeper Noor Sabri says that the celebrations in Iraq following the national teamÂ’s progress to the semi-finals of the AFC Asian Cup have served as inspiration to himself and his teammates.<br><br>Having faltered at the quarter-finals of the previous three tournaments, Iraq finally reached the last four for the first since 1976 with a 2-0 win over Vietnam in Bangkok last Saturday, triggering off mass celebrations back home.<br><br>But while the football team has brought a measure of relief to the people of the war-torn country, Sabri himself admits that the spirit of the players has also been lifted by the scenes of celebration.<br><br>Â“Of course there is daily communication with our friends and families in Iraq and we are aware through the internet and television of the widespread celebrations in Iraq after our victory against Vietnam in the quarter-finals,Â” the Iran-based keeper said.<br><br>Â“We have seen our friends, families and all of our people celebrating our victory and that has lifted our morale.<br><br>Â“Despite the critical condition in Iraq now, our people have been paying great attention to our football games.<br><br>Â“For the past 31 years, we havenÂ’t got to the Asian semi-finals because we have always been stopped at the quarter-finals. But now we have made it so this is something historic for football in country.<br><br>Â“This is something good to support the people in Iraq and victory in the semi-final would bring greater happiness to the people.Â”<br><br>Sabri said that Brazilian Jorvan Vieira, who was appointed as IraqÂ’s national coach only two months ago, has to take some credit for the job of bringing together the team for the tournament.<br><br>Â“Coach Vieira has managed to build a wonderful relationship with the players in a short time,Â” said Sabri.<br><br>Â“It has not been easy for us because when we gathered in Amman for our preparations we had injuries and were tired after a long football season. But with the help and support of the staff and the coaches, we have managed to come together and unify the team.<br><br>Â“We have experienced players and good support and I believe we can achieve our target and bring happiness to our people and pride to our country. We have to thank our coach for making that happen.Â”<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lee Chun Soo ready to lead by example</strong><br>Jul 25, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR Â–World Cup star Lee Chun-soo has declared himself ready to play a key role in leading Korea Republic to SundayÂ’s AFC Asian Cup final with victory over Iraq on Wednesday evening.<br><br>Lee was struck down by a severe fever on the eve of his teamÂ’s opening game against Saudi Arabia in Jakarta, limiting his role to that of a substitute as Pim VerbeekÂ’s team were held to a 1-1 draw.<br><br>Since then he has become increasingly involved in the teamÂ’s run to WednesdayÂ’s semi-final against Iraq, although he has fallen short of his own usual stellar standards.<br><br>But despite feeling the physical effects of the penalty shootout win over Iran in the quarter-finals, Lee is determined to make a significant impact as the Koreans seek to win their first title in 47 years.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m almost completely recovered now,Â” he said. Â“I played against Iran for 120 minutes, so that means that physically IÂ’m a little bit tired but there will be no problems playing against Iraq.<br><br>Â“Because of the stress and the pressure on my shoulders I fell sick with the fever and cold. But itÂ’s got better and IÂ’m getting better and better and so is the team, so IÂ’m pretty sure that the next game will be good.<br><br>Â“We have come together to win the Asian Cup. We had a difficult game against Iran, which that was tough. We were happy after winning and in order to win the Asian Cup we have to win against Iraq and we have to go to the final and IÂ’m sure we can win against Iraq.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sure it will be more difficult game than Iran because we are physically drained but if we concentrate better than in the previous games we are sure we can win the game against Iraq.Â”<br><br>Lee has dismissed any thoughts of being in the running for the tournamentÂ’s Most Valuable Player award and is instead focused on achieving his own goals, as well as those of the team.<br><br>Â“I havenÂ’t thought about individual awards and I have a different target, which is to go to Europe and play for a club there,Â” said the Ulsan Hyundai winger.<br><br>Â“There are so many good players in the tournament and in our team and also around the Asian region. In our team there are many players who deserve to get the individual award.<br><br>Â“I only want to focus on my own future after we have been successful at the Asian Cup.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Endo desperate to make amends</strong><br>Jul 25, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>HANOI Â– Perhaps more than any other player on the Japan squad, Yasuhito Endo is determined to steer his team to SundayÂ’s AFC Asian Cup final.<br><br>Despite being a key member of the squad that lifted the trophy in China three years ago, Endo was not on the field in Beijing as the Japanese successfully defended their title against the hosts.<br><br>A red card in the first half of the semi-final win over Bahrain meant Endo was left watching from the stands as Zico and his team celebrated JapanÂ’s third Asian Cup win in four tournaments.<br><br>Â“I might have been unlucky,Â” says Endo of the game, which Japan eventually won in extra-time. Â“I was sent off even though I didnÂ’t touch the opponent.<br><br>Â“We are still in the semi-finals and if we can get a good result there IÂ’d like to show what I can do in the game which draws the greatest attention throughout Asia and want to celebrate our Cup win with my team mates.Â”<br><br>The last three years have been a continuous learning curve for the Gamba Osaka midfielder, who has played 26 times for Japan since the last Asian Cup, including during the qualifiers for the World Cup.<br><br>He has also featured in the AFC Champions League for Gamba, where he won the J.League title in 2005, but he suffered the disappointment of being left on the bench during JapanÂ’s appearance at last summerÂ’s World Cup in Germany.<br><br>But while Zico favoured his Europe-based stars at the biggest events, the arrival of new coach Ivica Osim has seen Endo come back into favour and the Bosnian is taking advantage of EndoÂ’s growing experience.<br><br>Â“The way we play now is different from before,Â” he says. Â“The basics are more or less the same: we pass the ball around. But we move around more, and I feel that my movement has increased.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve got more self-confidence now. I had confidence before, too, when I played in the previous Asian Cup, but that was my first Asian Cup and, in some ways, I was figuring out what it was like to play.<br><br>Â“That was probably because I hadnÂ’t played so many games in the national team. Now IÂ’ve got more experience and I know I should take a leadership role in our team. ThatÂ’s different from the last time and I see myself under less pressure this time around.Â”<br><br>In addition to success at the Asian Cup, the set-piece specialist has his sights set on the FIFA ConfederationsÂ’ Cup, with the winner of the continental championship earning a place in a competition.<br><br>Endo has already experienced playing in the tournament when Japan were drawn with the hosts in France in 2003 and he is relishing the prospect of doing so again.<br><br>Â“I had a very good time then as I thought I played well against France,Â” said the 27-year-old. Â“ItÂ’s best to gain confidence by playing in a game like that.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ll be able to get another opportunity to play in the Confederations Cup in South Africa if we can win the Asian Cup. That will be a good rehearsal for the 2010 World Cup.<br><br>Â“The Asian Cup is a big tournament, worthy of challenging for the third straight success. IÂ’d like to win it here and get there.Â”<br><br>Endo has been an ever-present so far for Japan, scoring once and setting up two in the defending championsÂ’ 4-1 win over Vietnam while also converting his spot-kick in the penalty shootout win over Australia in the quarter-finals, when two saves from Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi took Japan through.<br><br>Â“In the shootout, you need to have a bit of luck but itÂ’s more like a competition of mentality and we overcame that, plus Yoshikatsu-san blocked their shots for us,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“I think we have become capable of playing with self-confidence at big moments like that, after having got through some experiences.<br><br>Â“I know we are still far from accomplishing what we think we can achieve with our football. But the more we play the game, the better we understand each other. WeÂ’ve been able to change the pace, speeding up and slowing down when needed while playing in the heat. ThatÂ’s good.Â”<br><br>If Japan do reach the final, it will be EndoÂ’s first in an international tournament since the FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria in 1999, when Japan finished as runners-up after losing to Spain.<br><br>Â“The only final I played in was the one at the World Youth Championship,Â” he says. Â“IÂ’d love to be in the final of the Asian Cup and prove what I can do there. If I can go and find something beyond that, that would be great.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Yeom eyes greater glory</strong><br>Jul 25, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR Â– His budding professional football career may have been in jeopardy a little over a year ago but after a remarkable 12 months, Korea Republic winger Yeom Ki-hun has got plenty of reasons to smile.<br><br>Having made his professional debut for K-League side Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors at the start of the 2006 season, Yeom was involved in a car accident last June that left him wondering whether he would have to call time on a career that had barely begun.<br><br>But the tricky left winger returned just two months later and helped to inspire Jeonbuk to an unlikely victory in the AFC Champions League, scoring three goals on their run to the championship including the crucial opening goal in the 2-0 victory against Syrian side Al Karama in the first leg of the final.<br><br>Looking back on that time, Yeom feels that the accident probably helped him to focus on becoming a better player.<br><br>Â“When I had the accident, I felt that it could be a very serious blow to me as I had just started my professional career and I was still a rookie in the K-League,Â” recollects Yeom, who still carries a scar of the accident on his right forearm.<br><br>Â“But during the time that I was recovering, I was able to think about the things that I should do and the movements that I could make during the game.<br><br>Â“Because I was able to think more about the game, I began to visualise things better on the field and maybe thatÂ’s why I was so successful afterwards.Â”<br><br>YeomÂ’s impressive form for Jeonbuk earned him a call-up to KoreaÂ’s U-23 squad for the Asian Games last December, creating a dilemma for the youngster, who also had the opportunity to play for his club at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan.<br><br>He eventually opted to go to Doha but despite returning without a medal after a 1-0 defeat to Iran in the bronze medal game, Yeom has few regrets about his decision.<br><br>Â“If I think about it now, it would have been a good experience to play for my club in a big tournament like the Club World Cup,Â” he says<br><br>Â“But I felt that it was also a great honour to be a representative of my nation in Doha. Playing for my country at the Asian Games meant a lot to me.Â”<br><br>Playing under national coach Pim Verbeek in Doha may also have served YeomÂ’s cause well as he found himself in consideration for the national team when the Dutchman was selecting his squad for the Asian Cup.<br><br>Â“This time last year, I was still just a K-League rookie, so I never imagined that I would be selected to play for my country at the Asian Cup,Â” he says.<br><br>Â“The only thing I was concerned about was that I should work harder than the others because I was a rookie.<br><br>Â“I was very focussed on working to establish myself as a professional player and I never imagined that I would progress so quickly to the national team.Â”<br><br>Yeom is naturally pleased with VerbeekÂ’s policy of utilising young players in the Asian Cup.<br><br>Â“I appreciate that young players like me have been given a chance to play in the Asian Cup,Â” the 24-year-old says.<br><br>Â“It is not the usual thing for young players to get the experience of playing in a big tournament like this but perhaps it is for that reason that all of us are working really hard and are highly motivated.<br><br>Â“All of us have the belief that if we work hard in training and the matches, we will get a chance to play here.Â”<br><br>While proud of his success at club level, Yeom admits that winning AsiaÂ’s biggest national team competition would be an even greater achievement for himself.<br><br>Â“It was quite an honour to be a member of the Jeonbuk team that won the AFC Champions League but personally, it would be a greater honour for me to play my country and win the Asian Cup.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s the target for our team and thatÂ’s why weÂ’re here to train and prepare everything. If we were to win the Asian Cup, it would be the greatest honour for me.Â”<br><br>While he ultimately dreams of a chance to play in Europe, Yeom says that his focus is firmly on his country and his current club at this time.<br><br>Â“It would be my ultimate target to play for the biggest teams in the biggest leagues in the world.<br><br>Â“But for now, it is important for me to focus on my own performances in the K-League and to show that I am a good player for Jeonbuk and Korea.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Congratulations to Iraq ,Bye Bye Corea.<br>I actually thought the Iraqis were a better team tonight from the first whistle to the last kick .Why did the Korean players have to put on a shocked look? They should have taken their chances well and not use the penalty shoot out as their reserve parachute.Although the Koreans played well tonight there is still not enough firepower up front.Ok good luck next time .<br>Japan must prevail in the second game.My prediction .......no PK<br></div>

It's because of the Southeast Asian attitude. If the home team is not playing, they won't wanna watch.<br><br>If Singapore is one of the hosts, Singaporeans won't wanna go to the stadium too unless Singapore is playing and winning.<br>Or when Japan is playing. Singaporeans tend to support Japan. Do you know the reason? I think even if Korea is in Singapore, I don't think Singaporean fans will support Korea.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Remember 2004 in China? Even when China wasn't playing, the stadiums were full of spectators. During the Busan Asian Games 2002, there were quite a significant amount of crowd too.<br><br>I may be wrong but I guess it's the Southeast Asian attitude.</div>
