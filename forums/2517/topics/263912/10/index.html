            <div class='col-md body'>Ninja, congratulation.<br><br>See? Now you know. This is what I say. The Australians are nothing to be afraid of. And I'm right about it.<br>Over-rated group of players by the English-language media. Before the Asian Cup 2007 started, the media kept focusing on them and disrespected the rest of Asia's powerhouses. Now they know. This is their first time in the Asian Cup, they better be humble. They can't under-estimate the Asian players.<br><br>Now they know the true color. They now realize that they were wrong. Serve them right. Australia is not Asia's best. Now guys, especially some Australian and English supporters, I have this message for them -----&gt;" you might have more players playing in England, Italy and other European leagues, but it doesn't mean that your team is more superior. And no racism and disrespectful remarks please. Never underestimate Asians. You're still new here in in our continent Asia, it's not as easy as your original OCEANIA region where you can trash the likes of New Zealand, Fiji, Samoan Islands, Papua New Gunea or some tiny islands in the pacific. And I'm very sure that you might have joined Asia but you might not even qualify for the next World Cup in 2010. Blaming the Southeast Asia humidity is useless. Stop these excuses. It's summer now. It's as hot and humid in Korea, China and Japan as well. It's also hot in America and parts of Europe too. It's summer, expect this type of weather please."<br><br>Ninja, you know, there's this Australia guy I met a few days ago told me that his country would definitely win the Asian Cup which DOESN"T even belong to them but when I told him that it's not easy and that they better respect the top Asian countries but he asked me to "kiss his ass" instead. This Australian guy is so rude and disrespectful. I feel he's racist. Well, I didn't wanna argue with him. Let's see how his team is humiliated after talking so much. I wanna see Korea punish them too but no chance to meet them though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Well done to your Japan team. Congratulation once again.<br>Now hope you support us tomorrow. I know Iran is better than us now but we have to put this behind and not afraid of them as well. Just try our best.<br><br>Fairplay.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Let's Support Asian Football<br><br>Jaeyoon<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iran Presents Ultimate Test<br><br>By Kim Tong-hyung<br>Staff Reporter, Korea Times<br><br>After sneaking into the knockout rounds with a 1-0 victory against Asian Cup co-hosts Indonesia, the South Koreans are now bracing themselves for a quarterfinals match against their old foes Iran.<br><br>Pim Verbeek's boys have yet to find their form in the tournament, never scoring more than once in any of the three group stage matches and showing an alarming tendency to tail off in the second-half, squandering early leads to both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.<br><br>Meeting Iran on a one-way street doesn't inspire any confidence, a country that has repeatedly proved itself as Korean football's biggest nemesis in international competition for the past two decades.<br><br>The Iranians seem relieved of facing a familiar opponent they had much success against recently, instead of a surging Saudi Arabia that is peaking at the right time.<br><br>``It is interesting that we are playing against them (South Korea) in the Asian Cup quarterfinals again but hopefully we can win this match again,'' said Iran midfielder Andranik Teymourian, who plays for the Premiership's Bolton Wanderers.<br><br>Despite declaring themselves as the team to beat in Asian football time after time, the South Koreans have won the Asian Cup only two times and nearly a half-century has passed since their last title in 1960. And Iran has much to do with their futility of trophies.<br><br>Iran beat Korea 2-1 in extra time in the 1972 finals to lift their second consecutive Asian Cup trophy. In the 1996 tournament in United Arab Emirates (UAE), Iran blasted Korea 6-2 in the quarterfinals, which is still considered among the country's most embarrassing moments ever in football.<br><br>The loss resulted in the sacking of manager Park Jong-hwan, hailed as the Korean equivalent of Vince Lombardi before the drubbing, leaving him with a tainted reputation as an underachiever who wasted what was then considered as the best national squad ever, with all-time talents such as striker Hwang Sun-hong and midfielder Hong Myung-bo in their primes.<br><br>Korea seemed to solve its Iran jinx in the quarterfinals of the 2000 tournament, beating them 2-1 on a double by Lee Dong-gook, a striker now playing for Middlesbrough and also starting for the current national squad. However, Iran returned the favor in the 2004 tournament, beating Korea 4-3 in a dramatic game.<br><br>Verbeek says that his squad has enough talent to beat Iran this time around, but the Taeguek Warriors' uninspiring play in the past three matches makes his words less convincing.<br><br>The Dutch coach had employed a similar defensive-minded game plan in all of the three group stage matches, packing the midfield with five players to dominate possession and slowdown the pace of the game, while taking what the opponent's defense gives them on the attack.<br><br>However, it would be hard to qualify the strategy as a success, which resulted in a shortage of goal-scoring opportunities with most of the midfielders playing deep to cover for a shaky defensive line.<br><br>Verbeek could only hope that his team breaks out of his funk against Iran, which owns what clearly is the tournament's most potent midfield lineup.<br><br>Bayern Munich midfielder Ali Karimi scored five goals in the 2004 tournament and seems to be back in top form.<br><br>The former Asian Player of the Year will be supported by other Europe-based players such as Teymourian, Eintracht Frankfurt 's Mehdi Mahdavikia and Osasuna's Javad Nekounam, forming a unit capable of terrorizing Korea's enlarged midfield.<br><br>Iran will also trot a proven finisher upfront in Hannover 96 striker Vahid Hashemian.<br><br>Verbeek is likely to be forced to keep his 4-5-1 formation to cope against Iran's superior firepower, meaning that the Koreans will have to be more clinical in front of the net since there could be long minutes between goal-scoring chances.<br><br>He would have to find someone to provide composure in front of the net, as the dismal play of forwards Lee and Cho Jae-jin, both looking uncomfortable in the role as lone striker has grown into the team's biggest concern.<br><br>Lee, No.2 on the Asian Cup's all-time scoring list with 10 goals, looked disturbingly hesitant in his limited appearances in the tournament, although he showed a hint of aggressiveness off the field with his rambling complaints about lack of touches.<br><br>Cho, who won the starter's job over Lee, is out proving what his critics have always said about him __ a player gifted with the physique of a great striker but not the senses.<br><br>Ulsan Hyundai midfielder Lee Chun-soo has clearly been Korea's best player so far with his relentless attack on the right flank, and his set-piece prowess could be crucial for the team, especially with the strikers struggling to break out of their funk.<br><br>Perhaps Verbeek would wish to screw Ulsan Lee's head atop Cho's body to solve Korea's scoring woes. Mad-science could hardly be an option, but the Dutch coach seems to be running out of ideas to coax the team into playing better than the sum of its parts.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kawaguchi the hero as Japan progress<br>Jul 21, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>HANOI - Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi was the hero for defending champions Japan as they eliminated Australia 4-3 in a penalty shootout to progress to the semi-finals of the AFC Asian Cup.<br><br>Kawaguchi saved from both Harry Kewell and Lucas Neill as JapanÂ’s quest for a third successive Asian Cup title stayed alive with Yuji Nakazawa scored the winning penalty emphatically past Mark Schwarzer.<br><br>The Japanese rekindled memories of their last appearance in the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup, when they knocked out Jordan in similar fashion before going on to win the title. Ivica Osim's side will now take on either Saudi Arabia or Uzbekistan in the semi-final next Wednesday in Hanoi.<br><br>It was a brave performance, though, from the Australians who played the entire extra-time period with just 10 men after Vince Grella was sent off 14 minutes from the end of normal time.<br><br>The score at that stage was 1-1 after John AloisiÂ’s 70th minute opener was cancelled out less than two minutes later when Naohiro Takahara struck from close range.<br><br>Aloisi scored for the Socceroos with just 20 minutes to go when he pushed home a corner from substitute Kewell after the ball had somehow managed to cross the six-yard box untouched.<br><br>But AustraliaÂ’s lead lasted less than two minutes when Takahara capitalised on Mark MilliganÂ’s miss-hit clearance before turning and firing past Schwarzer, via the goalkeeperÂ’s right post.<br><br>JapanÂ’s hopes of progressing improved further as time was running out when referee Kuwaiti Saad Khameel Al Fadhli sent midfielder Grella off when he hit Takahara in the face with a flailing arm as both went up for a header, but OsimÂ’s team were unable to take full advantage.<br><br>Not surprisingly, the champions controlled possession but they lacked the creativity to breach the tightly packed Australian defence.<br><br>The game went into extra-time but the Australians put up a dogged defence and successfully kept the Japanese at bay, even though there was a scare for the Socceroos with just seconds remaining.<br><br>A lofted cross into the penalty area was met by Shunsuke NakamuraÂ’s flying volley, but SchwarzerÂ’s reflex save to his right kept the ball out and took the game into a penalty shootout.<br><br>Kawaguchi guessed correctly to deny Kewell and Neill while Nakamura and Yasuhito Endo converted successfully before Tim Cahill put Australia on the board.<br><br>Yuichi Komano made it 3-1 and Nicky Carle kept Australia alive with his spot kick. The pressure increased on Japan when Takahara put his effort over the bar and when David Carney scored that left Nakazawa to go head-to-head with Schwarzer.<br><br>The veteran defender, however, was equal to the task to send Japan into the semi-finals once again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Younis double takes Iraq to final four<br>Jul 21, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>BANGKOK Â– Two goals from skipper Younis Mahmoud saw Iraq defeat Vietnam 2-0 in the AFC Asian Cup quarter-finals at the Rajamangala Stadium on Saturday as the West Asian nation reached the final four of the continentÂ’s premier competition for the first time since 1976.<br><br>Mahmoud opened the scoring with just two minutes gone but Vietnam rallied and kept the Iraqis at bay until the Al Gharafa striker curled home a 64th minute free-kick to seal the win.<br><br>Iraq coach Jorvan Vieira was without the suspended Qusay Muneer and fellow midfielder Saleh Sadir while defender Khaldoun Ibrahim dropped to the bench. Haitham Kadhim and Karrar Jassim Mohammed came into midfield and Haidar Abdul Amer started in place of the Iran-based stopper.<br><br>After going down 4-1 to Japan in their final group match Vietnam coach Alfred Riedl opted to start with two up-front as Binh Duong dangerman Nguyen Anh Duc came in for midfielder Phan Van Tai Em, who didnÂ’t make the trip to Bangkok due to his wedding ceremony. Midfielder Phung Cong Minh came in for Nguyen Minh Chuyen while Chau Phong Hoa replaced Phung Van Nhien in defence.<br><br>Riedl had stated that his team were the underdogs and any hopes that Vietnam would cause an upset suffered a massive blow within 90 seconds when Mahmoud put Iraq one up with his second goal of the tournament, heading home a Nashat Akram free-kick curled in from the left.<br><br>Vietnam struggled to find a foothold and didnÂ’t create anything until the 18th minute when Le Cong VinhÂ’s shot was blocked for a corner before the Song Lam Nghe Anh striker tested Noor Sabri a minute later with a long-range shot that was taken comfortably by the Iraq keeper.<br><br>In the 32nd minute Iraq were forced into making a substitution with Ahmad Abid Ali replacing Haitham Kadhim, who never fully recovered from a crunching tackle from Cong Minh four minutes earlier, which earned the combative 21-year-old the first yellow card of the match.<br><br>On the stroke of half-time Vietnam came close to drawing level when Nguyen Vu Phong burst through the centre and played a one-two with Phong Hoa but the Binh Duong wingerÂ’s drive across the area was cleared by substitute Ahmad Abid Ali before Cong Vinh could knock the ball home from close range.<br><br>Five minutes after the interval Ali Hussein Rehema was fortunate to escape a booking when he pulled down Cong Vinh and the Iraqis escaped further punishment when Noor Sabri palmed clear the resulting free-kick swung in by Vu Phong.<br><br>Iraq doubled their advantage in the 64th minute and again it came courtesy of Mahmoud as the 2006/07 Qatar League top scorer exquisitely swept home a free-kick, awarded after a foul on Karrar Jassim.<br><br>Mahmoud almost completed his hat-trick in the 78th minute but his downward header following Mahdi KarimÂ’s cross from the right was kept out well by Duong Hong Son and the man of the match had to be content with taking his tournament tally to three.<br><br>Iraq, who bowed out of the last three Asian Cups at the quarter-final stage, head to Kuala Lumpur to face either neighbours Iran or Korea Republic in the semi-finals on Wednesday.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Verbeek backs young charges</strong><br>Jul 21, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR Â– Korea Republic coach Pim Verbeek agrees with the view that Iran are favourites for SundayÂ’s AFC Asian Cup quarter-final clash in Kuala Lumpur but the Dutchman remains confident that his side can pull off a victory against Amir GhalenoeiÂ’s team at Bukit Jalil National Stadium.<br><br>Speaking at the pre-match press conference on Saturday, the Dutchman described the opinions that he has heard since the Korean team arrived in the Malaysian capital on Thursday night.<br><br>Â“Since our arrival in Kuala Lumpur, most of the people we have talked to have said that Iran are one of the strongest teams and that they are one of the favourites to win the Asian Cup,Â” said Verbeek.<br><br>Â“I think that theyÂ’re right because they are an experienced team, they have a lot of foreign-based players and so far theyÂ’ve played well.<br><br>Â“I expect it will be a very tough game and my team has to play its best football tomorrow in order to go through to the next round.Â”<br><br>But while Verbeek admitted that the quality of the individual Iranian players was greater than his own, he believes that the strong team ethic of the Koreans will help to carry them through.<br><br>Â“I think if you look at the quality of the players, their experience and the way that they have played so far, than I can only say that Iran probably have better players than us.<br><br>Â“But although we may not have better players, we have a very strong team and I think we will win the game tomorrow.Â”<br><br>The meeting in Kuala Lumpur will be the fourth straight time that Korea and Iran have clashed in the Asian Cup quarter-finals, the Koreans winning their clash in Lebanon in 2000 2-1 but losing 6-2 in the United Arab Emirates in 1996 and 4-3 in China three years ago.<br><br>However, Verbeek is reluctant to discuss the past encounters between the two sides.<br><br>Â“What happened in the past is not interesting to me because we have a completely new selection of players now.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re not so worried about the statistics of our last game Â– thatÂ’s for the media.<br><br>Â“For us, itÂ’s important to prepare ourselves for the strong points and the weak points of the Iranian team. ThatÂ’s what we doing at the moment and, of course, we will do everything to win tomorrow.Â”<br><br>One card that the Koreans do have up their sleeves is the presence on their staff of Afshin Ghotibi, an Iranian-American assistant coach with an in-depth knowledge of Iranian football.<br><br>Â“We are always very well prepared to play against whatever opponent we are playing against,Â” Verbeek explained.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a fact that Afshin knows everything about Iranian football and in big games like this, itÂ’s good to know everything about the opponent, about their system and the strengths and weaknesses of individual players.<br><br>Â“So I think itÂ’s definitely an advantage to have him with us.Â”<br><br>Despite missing a number of key players through injury and having to field a number of inexperienced youngsters in this yearÂ’s tournament, Verbeek remains clear about his goals for the Asian Cup.<br><br>Â“Nobody at the KFA has to tell me what to do here because we came here to win the Asian Cup,Â” he stressed.<br><br>Â“That means that we have to win all of our important games and one of the most important games will be tomorrow. So thereÂ’s no misunderstanding about that.Â”<br><br>The Dutchman also defended his selection of players for the Asian Cup.<br><br>Â“I selected the best players and while a lot of those players are still very young, they can play very good football.<br><br>Â“For them, playing in big international games like this with big pressure can only make them better and better.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think the challenges come much bigger than Iran. We played well against Indonesia but we have to play even better tomorrow evening to go through to the next round.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some coaches will definitely lose their jobs after this competition and Pim Verbeek surely wouldnt want that to happen to himself .The relationship between coach and team must be strong,the trust must be there which incidently failed to explain why Osim walked out to the dressing room just before the penalty shoot out.He probably thought Japan would falter so from bochup at extra time he became bosim but all is understandable now.Dont know how good the present rapport between the Dutch coach and Korean players is right now but this time the 'PIMP' backside is on the line and oreddy there is a long queue of KFA officials grinning with their pants down <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iran pay penalty as Korea progress<br>Jul 22, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - IranÂ’s hopes of a first AFC Asian Cup title in 31 years were dashed on Sunday evening after Team Melli were beaten by Korea Republic in a tense penalty shootout at a rainy Bukit Jalil National Stadium.<br><br>The match went to penalties after a lively and physical quarter-final encounter between two familiar foes had finished goalless and goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae emerged as the hero for the Taeguk Warriors, stopping attempts by Mehdi Mahdavikia and Rasoul Khatibi to give his side a 4-2 victory.<br><br>Korea, who face Iraq in the semi-finals at the same venue on Wednesday, avenged a 4-3 defeat suffered to the Iranians at the same stage in China three years ago.<br><br>The two teams had also met in the quarter-finals of the previous two Asian Cups with the Koreans winning 2-1 in Lebanon in 2000 and Iran scoring a 6-2 win in the United Arab Emirates in 1996.<br><br>Korea coach Pim Verbeek made two changes from the side that beat Indonesia 1-0 with forwards Lee Dong-gook and Yeom Ki-hun replacing Cho Jae-jin and Choi Sung-kuk.<br><br>Meanwhile, Iran coach Amir Ghalenoei made three alterations from the side which beat Malaysia 2-0 with Rasoul Khatibi, Mehrzad Madanchi and Mohammed Nosrati replacing Reza Enayati, Eman Mobali and Ferydoon Zandi.<br><br>The Bukit Jalil Stadium was far from full for the clash between two superpowers of Asian football but the two sets of supporters created a rousing atmosphere that was mirrored on the pitch by robust play from both sides in the early exchanges.<br><br>The Koreans had the first real opening in the sixth minutes when they were awarded a free kick for Mohammed NosratiÂ’s challenge on Yeom Ki-hun but dead ball specialist Lee Chun-soo failed to take advantage, firing his effort from 20 metres over the crossbar.<br><br>The Koreans did much of the early probing but their high defensive line was nearly caught out on two occasions, Khatibi flagged offside both times as he looked to burst clear from midfield.<br><br>Yeom Ki-hunÂ’s strong running caused plenty of problems for the Iranians and he very nearly forced an opening on 23 minutes when he made a mazy run through the heart of the Team Melli defence only to stumble on the soggy pitch as he closed in on goal.<br><br>A minute later, goalkeeper Hassan Roudbarian had to dive low to his left to keep out a low shot by Kim Sang-sik which took a slight nick off Lee Chun-soo on the edge of the Iran box.<br><br>Iran were struggling to contain the pace of the Koreans but Mehdi Mahdvikia almost caught out the east Asians with a quick break on the half-hour, turning Kim Chi-woo inside the Korean box before dragging his attempt wide.<br><br>As the half came to a close, it was the Iranians who enjoyed the best chances, with Ali Karimi denied by the feet of Lee Woon-jae on 42 minutes after receiving a neat pass from Vahid Hashemian, while Mahdavikia saw his goal-bound shot blocked by Kim Jin-kyu in the six-yard box.<br><br>Lee Woon-jae was called into action once again early in the second half, punching clear under challenge from Hashemian on the edge of his six-yard box.<br><br>On the hour, the Koreans nearly broke the deadlock when Yeom Ki-hun gathered the ball on the edge of the Iranian box after Nosrati had missed a header. The Jeonbuk Motors failed to connect cleanly but his shot bounced dangerously towards goal, forcing Roudbarian to desperately palm the ball aside.<br><br>The cut and thrust continued with Cho Jae-jin heading over after Kim Chi-woo had crossed from the left byline.<br><br>Khatibi nearly punished hesitant goalkeeping by Lee Woon-jae midway through the second half, as he beat the Korean skipper to a long ball played down the left flank only to be taken out by a crunching tackle by Oh Beom-seok, who received a yellow card for his troubles.<br><br>For all of the endeavour of the two teams, there were few clear-cut chances in the second half until the closing minutes when Javad Nekounam fired a fierce drive from 30 metres straight at Lee Woon-jae before Zandi put in a low cross from the left flank to fellow substitute Enayati, who put his shot wide at the far post.<br><br>For the second time in this yearÂ’s Asian Cup, extra-time was required but there were precious few chances in the extra frames with the Koreans going close on 99 minute when Choi Sung-kukÂ’s corner kick was flicked across goal by Kang Min-soo.<br><br>Nekounam then squandered an opening right before the teams changed ends, firing wide from the edge of the box after receiving an excellent layoff from Karimi.<br><br>Mahdavikia forced Lee Woon-jae into a diving stop early in the second extra period but with both sides tiring on the heavy pitch, a penalty shootout became almost inevitable.<br><br>Iran brought on goalkeeper Vahid Taleblou in place of Roudbarian in the dying seconds for the shootout and his lanky frame kept out Kim Do-heonÂ’s third attempt for the Koreans.<br><br>However, Lee Woon-jae kept out attempts by Mahdavikia and Khatibi, allowing Kim Jung-woo to roll home the winning kick, sending Korea through to a last four meeting with Iraq.<br></div>
