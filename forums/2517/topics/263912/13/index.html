They should have taken their chances well and not use the penalty shoot out as their reserve parachute.Although the Koreans played well tonight there is still not enough firepower up front.Ok good luck next time .<br>Japan must prevail in the second game.My prediction .......no PK<br></div></blockquote>Ninja, I disagree with you. They are not trying to use the penalty shoot-out to win. Verbeek didn't even want a penalty shoot-out. Because you don't have Korean soccer information and news about what the players and coaches said. The reports in the news over the internet are all in Korean sites. Most reports in English are only surface report. Thus many players are not known to people outside Korea. Actually they hate penalty shoot out actually because it's depend only on luck. You might win once but you can't win the second time. Nobody likes it.<br><br>Like I said before, it's the wrong tactics and wrong players selected so far that resulted in the lack of good opportunities in front of goals.<br>Scoring goals in the past wasn't a big problem. I believe you know that if you have watched the Korea starting from the 80s till a few years ago.<br><br>Now the problem of scoring is a bit of a similar to what Italy used to experience before in the late 90s when they were finding it hard to score goals. That's what we call goal drought.<br><br>Anyway, we're all out. It's time to rebuild and look forward to the Beijing Olympic 2008 qualifying and World Cup South Africa 2010 qualifying.<br><br>Good luck to you Ninja.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All the friends here, this weekend we will see through the end of the Asian Cup 2007. This forum might also be less active shortly after the final game. It's been such good time sharing opinion and discussion with one another.<br><br>I really thank all of you for supporting this forum and make this forum a success. On many occasions, I do see friendly forums become fighting, swearing and cursing forums. That's unhealthy and ungentleman. Some people are just there to stir trouble or provoke anyone they see. That's childish also.<br><br>Therefore I'm very glad that all the members here are so supportive of one another. I started this forum and I would like to thank Shortninja who is currently living in Japan now for being so supportive and act as a co-host of this forum while I was away in Bangkok 2 weeks ago for a few days.<br><br>I would like to thank contributors like a_Lost_9uy, pervertboi, boredtulan, hiphop2009, Cristiano@Red_Devils.com, xfool, omgukilledkenny, adolez, Manager 433, Lazerlordz, weiqimun, borgkilla, DC+, HyuugaNeji, jiaweiwei87 and 798 even though it's only 1 to 3 contribution from each of them. I really appreciate as long as you have supported this forum. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Next, I also have to give credits to dragg, 4getmenot and crazy monkey for their active contributions too.<br><br>SumOne, ordinaryguy32 and Short ninja, without the 3 of you, our forum would have frozen 2 weeks ago. I'll not forget your support. I know that all three of you are really nice.<br><br>Short Ninja, Korea-Japan soccer battle will continue to produce healthy rivalry. You're a great friend of mine over here although in Singapore, I don't have many locals who support me and my team. You have more.<br><br>Now I'm in Singapore, besides my friends, I hardly see Singaporeans who support Korea. I believe 80% of the members here are supportive of Japan, (which until now, I find no convincing reason why it's so <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) It's ok, this is for people who support Asian football. But if there are people who support Korea, I'll be happy to know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, once again, I thank all of you!!!<br>Please continue this forum at least until the final whistle of the final.<br><br>Good Luck to the team you support!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Now we know that several key players a re not even onboard this round due to injuries, who knows how far it would have gone if there were. Whats missing in this korean team is a striker who can score, and if they do find one, then korea will emerge from its past glorious shadow to pose a challange to the middle east teams again..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Korea, Japan Vie for Third Spot<br><br>By Kim Tong-hyung<br>Staff Reporter<br><br>With its dreams for an Asian Cup trophy shattered by Iraq, South Korea will look for the consolation prize of a third-place finish against defending champions Japan in Jakarta this evening. The winner of the match will be awarded with an automatic spot in the next Asian Cup.<br><br>Tonight's match-up is what many Asian football fans had hoped and expected for the final, which would have added another page to one of the greatest regional rivalries in the sports world.<br><br>However, the Taeguk Warriors finally saw their luck run out against a spirited Iraqi team, losing 4-3 on penalties, a deserving conclusion to a streak of five, uninspiring performances that saw the team score only three goals in that span.<br><br>Japan, which looked much more potent than their East Asian rivals, had the misfortune of running into a football juggernaut in Saudi Arabia in the semifinals.<br><br>For South Korean manager Pim Verbeek, who predicted a title ahead of the tournament, it would be important for his players to show they still have a pulse, with his future with the national team hanging by a thread.<br><br>It's questionable whether the team could finally find its form, which would still be a game too late.<br><br>With injuries wiping out nearly half of his starting lineup ahead of the tournament _ including midfielders Park Ji-sung (Manchester United), Lee Young-pyo (Tottenham), Seol Ki-hyeon (Reading) and Kim Nam-il (Suwon Samsung) _ Verbeek opted for a defensive approach, packing the midfield with five players to cover a four-back defensive line while sending out a lone striker as the offensive point-man.<br><br>It would be hard to qualify the 4-5-1, or 4-2-3-1 and whatever the Korean press chose to call it, as a success.<br><br>Although the enlarged midfield allowed the Koreans to hold a larger share of possession, and thus grind the game down to a slower pace as they prefer, it clearly compromised the offense as goal-scoring chances were rare with the target man finding himself isolated for long stretches.<br><br>Verbeek's forwards had to be clinical with the sporadic chances they got from the net, and they failed miserably. Middlesbrough forward Lee Dong-gook, Asian Cup's second all-time scorer with 10 goals, played with an alarming lack of urgency that defied, or perhaps explained, his deer-in-the-headlights expressions.<br><br>Shimizu S-Pulse forward Cho Jae-jin is proving once again that is gifted with the body of a great striker but not the head.<br><br>It bears further watching whether Verbeek would try switching two a 4-4-2 for the Japan match to find an answer to the team's scoring doubt, which would give him the opportunity to pair Lee or Cho with Ulsan Hyundai winger Lee Chun-soo, who stepped up as perhaps Korea's best player during this tournament with his relentless attack on the right flank.<br><br>The two-man front would be a worthy experiment, especially with defensive backs Kim Chi-woo and Oh Beom-seok displaying enough skills and pace to support the attack in transition. The talents of holding midfielders Kim Jung-woo and Son Dae-ho also suit better to the defensive roles they would likely be assigned to under a 4-4-2 system.<br><br>However, Verbeek would be reluctant to play a transition game against Japan, and compromise their share of possession with a smaller midfield, considering the opponent's potent attack led by the brilliance of star-striker Naohiro Takahara and playmaker Shunsuke Nakamura.<br></div>
