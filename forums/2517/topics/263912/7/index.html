            <div class='col-md body'>Something to add. What's the big deal with some Australian players in the EPL? To me, they're not stars. Only some people out there obsessed with EPL would say they're stars.

            <div class='col-md body'>If there is anything left in Australia they need to whip Thailand in their next game and that is something we wouldnt want to see.It is either you have what it takes to be a Champion and its is getting obvious the Aussies dont or just take part and enjoy the nightlife in Bangkok.In the other game Japan beat UAE easily but became complacent when playing against 10 men also Osim was smart enough to let the boys kick the ball around instead of trying to humiliate the Arabs cuz they were getting to be sre losers.Some of the players were mere passengers and didint contribute much but at the end of the day we won.Thats it Japan,one step at a time ......steady as she goes and likewise Thailand too.</div>

If we tie again, the final game against Indonesia will be tough.''<br><br>Bahrain, on the brink of being disqualified after losing to co-host Indonesia 1-2, are desperate to stay alive.<br><br>Verbeek will stick to a 4-3-3 formation as in the first match.<br><br>Japan's Shimizu S-Pulse forward Cho Jae-jin, who satisfied the coach with several good performances against Saudi Arabia, is expected to play as a lone striker and revived Middlesbrough forward Lee Dong-gook, who played for nine minutes in the first match, will be used as a joker.<br><br>The 28-year-old English Premier Leaguer has recorded 10 goals in the past two Asian Cups.<br><br>Kim Jung-woo of Nagoya Grampus Eight will play central midfield and Yeom Ki-hun of Chonbuk Motors and Choi Sung-kuk of Ulsan Tigers, who headed in a goal in the opener, will be positioned as wing forwards.<br><br>As for Lee Chun-soo, suffering tonsillitis, he is not likely to start but is expected to be substituted during clutch time.<br><br>Defenders Kim Sang-shik and Lee Ho, who came off a one-game suspension due to yellow card accumulation in the preliminary round, will be assigned next to Kim Jung-woo.<br><br>In the four-back, Kim Chi-woo and Oh Beom-seok, whose active participation was helpful to the team's offense against Saudi Arabia, will play on each flank but speculation that the experienced and defensive-minded Kim Dong-jin of Russia's Zenit St. Petersburg and Song Chong-gug of Suwon BlueWings will make the starting roster cannot be ruled out.<br><br>Chunnam Dragons duo Kim Jin-kyu and Kang Min-soo are expected to play defense at center and captain Lee Woon-jae will keep Korea's goal post.<br><br>Meanwhile, Bahrain has a formidable two-top combination of Ala'a Hubail and Jaycee John Akwani.<br><br>Hubail was the leading scorer at the last Asian Cup with five goals and Akwani, born in Nigeria, acquired Bahraini citizenship last January.<br><br>Midfielder Mohamed Hubail, older brother of Ala'a, whose forward run is brilliant, is dangerous to watch.<br><br>However, as the team is low in transition in offense and their defense is suffering, a fast counterattack and space-penetrated passing would be the main factors in beating their rivals.<br><br>Meanwhile, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have agreed not to use the current training stadium due to poor lawn maintenance.<br><br>Because of the poor pitch conditions, Korean attackers practiced only volley shots and headers to prevent injuries while a few players from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain also suffered ankle injuries during training.<br><br>As a result, the Asian Football Confederation has accepted their request and has moved training sessions to Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.<br></div>
