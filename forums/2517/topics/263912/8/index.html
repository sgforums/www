            <div class='col-md body'>Upcoming games you dont want and my predictions.<br><br>Indonesia Vs Korea.Korea to win by more than 3 goals that is if we are talking about the same Korea who were semi finalist in 2002.Iran is going to take it easy on Malaysia and so expect something like 2 or 3 goals.Saudi and Bahrain is 50/50 case and I woundnt mind putting my money on Bahraiin if offered 1 ball or 1/2 and 1 ball.Uzbekistan and China will be the game to watch.They are about even but I will be rooting for China because Its easier for us to play the Chinese than the Uzbeks.We were very lucky playing all these teams 4 years ago but with the present line up we are going to need even more luck this time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group A news</strong><br><br>Ta-Ta Thailand<br>Australians end dream of place in quarter-finalsPublished on July 17, 2007<br><br>Australia squeezed into the second round of the Asian Cup tournament following a 4-0 drubbing of hosts Thailand in their Group A encounter at Rajamangala National Stadium yesterday.<br><br>It was a remarkable turnaround by pre-tournament favourites Australia given that an early elimination was staring in their faces before the game after they could only claim a point from their previous two matches.<br><br>With their backs against the wall, Graham Arnold's men, who had previously looked a shadow of the side that nearly dumped eventual champions Italy in last year's World Cup, managed to recapture their form in what was the most perfect time to seal the result they needed for qualification.<br><br>The hosts might curse their luck for having to face the Aussies in the last match when they were on the verge of qualifying for the quarter-finals of the continent's top competition for the first time since 1972. The scenario Thai fans most feared turned into reality as the beleaguered Aussies staged a timely and miraculous recovery from the brink.<br><br>The result left Australia level on points with Thailand but Arnold's side clinched the qualification thanks to their better head-to-head record.<br><br>The Australians join Iraq, who topped the group despite a draw with Oman in the group's other match, in the last eight.<br><br>Having witnessed his side flounder in their last hurdle to make history, coach Chanvit Pholchivin was left bemoaning their luck.<br><br>"Not disappointed much, this is a football game. The rain made it difficult for us. Our centre-half [Kiatprawut Saiwaeo], who is good in high balls, was injured so it was hard for us," said Chanvit.<br><br>"We messed up our scoring chances. Australia are lucky that there was rain and our good player was injured. The game was quite close but when we conceded a goal, everything became terrible. No matter what we tried, it didn't go right."<br><br>Chanvit's men approached the game in high spirits on the back of their impressive performances, which saw them register their first ever victory in regular time over Oman, a convincing 2-0 triumph, on Thursday.<br><br>After an eye-catching performance in the Oman match, in which he was the architect of both the goals, young star striker Teeratep "Leesaw" Winothai earned his place in the line-up.<br><br>Leesaw and Suchao Nutnum were a couple of alterations Chanvit made to the side that faced Oman. They came in place of veteran Terdsak Jaiman and Datsakorn Thonglao.<br><br>With Leesaw and Kiartisak "Zico" Senamuang up front, Sutee Suksomkit reverted to the role of left-side midfielder, the position the experienced forward had previously adopted.<br><br>The visitors brought in John Aloisi, who came in place of Liverpool star Harry Kewell, to join Mark Viduka.<br><br>The heavy rains, which fell hours before the kick off, barely dampened the spirits of the home fans as they turned up at the stadium in large numbers. The 40,000-strong crowd created an electric atmosphere, with sounds of drums and bugles reverberating around the venue, befitting the game, which was branded as one of the most important matches in Thai football.<br><br>Just two minutes into the match, the warning bell rung for the Thai team when Viduka found space inside the penalty box and fired an angled shot that forced a good save from Thai goalie Kosin Hathairattanakul, who parried it behind.<br><br>Chanvit's side, however, almost opened the scoring in bizarre fashion six minutes later when Sutee attempted to cross the ball but his effort nearly crept into the top far corner, with keeper Mark Schwarzer already out of position.<br><br>Midfielder Tawan Sripan warmed Schwarzer's hands soon after with a fierce 35-yard free-kick, which required two attempts from the Aussie custodian to gather the ball.<br><br>Just before the half way of the opening period, the partisan crowd was silenced when burly Australian defender Michael Beauchamp thumped a powerful header from a David Carney free-kick into the back of the net.<br><br>The setback failed to rattle the home team as they quickly regained their composure. Moments later, the Thai team threatened the visitors twice, with Suchao first testing with a long-distance attempt, and later Zico failing to connect Sutee Sukha's dangerous cross at the goal mouth.<br><br>The home team finished the half strongly and got another scoring chance on the stroke of half-time but Sutee sent his set piece harmlessly wide.<br><br>Thailand picked up where they left off in the first half and pushed the Aussies on the back foot after the restart, knowing a draw would be sufficient to see them through to the last eight.<br><br>In the 53rd minute, the hosts thought they should have awarded a penalty. Schwarzer spilled Leesaw's venomous drive from outside the box and Zico was brought down when he pounced on the rebound but the referee waved play on.<br><br>Ten minutes from time, the Australians scored again when Viduka produced a piece of brilliance. The former Middlesbrough striker chested the ball down, held off his marker before firing a rising drive which deflected into the roof of the net as Suree tried to block the shot.<br><br>Any hopes of an unlikely comeback were extinguished three minutes later when substitute Tim Cahill floated in a delightful cross to Viduka who leapt above the Thai defence to plant a downward header into the net, much to the joy of a large group of travelling fans.<br><br>Substitute Kewell wrapped up the scoring in stoppage time with a clinical finish when he latched onto Cahill's defence-splitting pass and raced into the area on the right side before firing the ball past helpless Kosin.<br><br>In Hanoi, defending champions Japan advanced to the Asian Cup quarter-finals in style with an easy 4-1 win over co-hosts Vietnam who also went through for the first time in nearly half a century.<br><br>JEF United forward Seiichiro Maki headed home twice, Shunsuke Nakamura found the net and Yasuhito Endo added another to give Japan their second straight win after a dismal 1-1 opening draw with Asian Games gold medallists Qatar.<br><br>Vietnam, playing in their first Asian Cup finals for 47 years, have stunned everyone with their performances here and with the United Arab Emirates beating Qatar 2-1 in the other group B match, they make the last eight. "We were nervous at the outset and our opponents were aggressive. Lucky or not, we were able to catch up early in the game and it made our life easier," Japan coach Ivica Osim said. Despite the defeat, Vietnamese coach Alfred Riedl was over the moon.<br><br>"It is a sensation for Vietnamese football," said the Austrian. "Only very few people had expected this."<br><br>Kitinan Sanguansak<br><br>The Nation<br></div>

Only a few people could have expected this result,Â” said the Austrian, who is in his third spell as Vietnam coach.<br><br>Â“We are very happy about this, of course,Â” he added.<br><br>It was a good finish to the evening for the Vietnamese which had threatened to go sour after an excellent beginning to the match played before a capacity crowd in Hanoi.<br><br>The co-hosts took a lead in the seventh minute through an own goal by Keita Suzuki but a brace by Seichiro Maki and a goal apiece by Yasuhito Endo and Shunsuke Nakamura saw the Japanese record a comfortable win.<br><br>Â“I had a little hope, of course, but not to win the match, only to keep that lead as long as possible to maybe get a draw,Â” said Riedl.<br><br>Â“But I knew that the Japanese wouldnÂ’t stop playing attacking football, and they scored their goal just a few minutes later.<br><br>Â“The third match is more difficult, and I was expecting that because I know the difference between the Japanese players and the Vietnamese players. Despite the heat and everything, they have more physique and better technique. They can play better under pressure.Â”<br><br>Riedl had been hoping for good news from the other match.<br><br>Â“Before the game, I thought the bigger chance to advance to the quarter-finals would be the result from the south. In the north, our match, our chance of getting a point was small. But in the south, anything was possible.Â”<br><br>His prayers would be answered when UAE turned around a half-time deficit to beat their Gulf rivals.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m happy because they (UAE) did something,Â” he said. Â“They were behind 1-0 according to my information but they continued working to make it a draw and even to win the match.Â”<br><br>Vietnam will travel to Bangkok to meet Group A winners Iraq in the quarter-finals but Riedl is unconcerned about having to play the knockout stage tie away from home.<br><br>Â“It will depend not on the venue, but the performance and what you can do against a strong opponent.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think we have a problem with our fitness in Thailand. Vietnam may surprise again. You never know.Â”<br></div>

The ball fell at the feet of Do-heon but his attempt was hacked away by Rashed Al Dosari.<br><br>With 15 minutes on the clock, Chun-soo was well placed to reclaim the lead for the Koreans when substitute Cho Jae-jin headed the ball into his path, but the Ulsan Hyundai manÂ’s miss-kick caused Ahmed no problem.<br><br>However, as Korea pushed forward looking for the winner, the gaps started to appear in their defence and eventually Bahrain took advantage when substitute Talal Yusuf forced the ball through to Abdullatif and he made no mistake with a fine right-foot finish.<br><br></div>

Â“They have to win also.<br><br>Â“We canÂ’t wait on anything because we have only one point. There will be 85,000 people, both teams have to score to win the game so I think it will be very interesting.Â”<br><br>VerbeekÂ’s team looked to be on course to at least add a second draw to the one earned against Saudi Arabia in their opening game after dominating much of the game only for the Bahrainis to take all three points, their first of the competition.<br><br>The manner of the defeat had taken its toll on the Korean players, said their coach.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not a surprise that the players are completely finished if you have a start like this, scoring the early goal,Â” he said. Â“In the last 20 minutes of the first half we played well but we lost concentration and they got the goal just before half time.<br><br>Â“But in the second half I thought we were much better and I was waiting for us to score, and I never expected Bahrain to score and if we hadnÂ’t given this goal away they would never have scored so IÂ’m disappointed.Â”<br><br>Despite the defeat, Verbeek praised the performance of his players and he is hoping his team can stay in the competition.<br><br>Â“The coach is always responsible for the result,Â” he said.

IÂ’m 100 percent convinced that we can win by two goals and then life becomes completely different.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group D News</strong><br><br>Bahrain pulls off Jakarta shocker<br>2007.07.17, Korea Herald<br><br>Korea's Asian Cup hopes are hanging by a thread after a shock 2-1 defeat inflicted by Bahrain in Jakarta.<br>Despite taking an early lead in the Indonesian capital, the 2002 World Cup semifinalists find themselves in last place in Group D with one game remaining. Korea must win that match against host Indonesia to have any chance of making the quarterfinals.<br><br>A week ago that wouldn't have seemed too much of a tall order but the Southeast Asians showed what they are capable of in front of 90,000 home fans and Korea seemed incapable of holding onto a lead.<br><br>While Korea controlled most of the game, the team's age-old problems remain - an inability to convert possession into clear chances and a defense that is always liable to lose concentration at crucial times.<br><br>Indonesia had lost 2-1 to the Saudis the previous evening and after that frenzied atmosphere created by its partisan and passionate fans, there was a slightly anticlimactic feel to the proceedings in a largely empty arena.<br><br>The locals may not have been thrilled by the prospect of Korea-Bahrain but the 7,000 Korean fans inside the huge Gelora Bung Karno Stadium didn't care - they were celebrating a goal after just three minutes.<br><br>Coach Pim Verbeek made no less than five changes to the team that drew 1-1 with Saudi Arabia four days earlier and his decision paid dividends almost immediately as two of the new players were involved in the opening goal.<br><br>Lee Chun-soo, recovered from a fever, saw his cross deflect off a red-shirted Bahraini defender and loop toward the left-side of the penalty area where Kim Do-heon was loitering. The Seongnam midfielder is known for his spectacular goals and didn't disappoint with a smart volley into the far corner.<br><br>Much of the remainder of the first half was flat with neither side able to find any rhythm or create any clear chances. After letting a one goal lead slip in the opening game with Saudi Arabia, Verbeek stressed in the pre-match press conference that his players needed to learn how to "kill teams off."<br><br>More study is needed as Bahrain, who had hitherto threatened little, equalized three minutes before the break.<br><br>Salman Ali ran onto what was a simple free-kick over the top of a static Korean defense line and, from the left edge of the six-yard box, the 29-year-old defender let the ball bounce once before firing a low shot past Lee Woon-jae at the near post.<br><br>There was more urgency showed by both teams after the break. Lee Dong-gook went close for the Taeguk Warriors while goalkeeper Lee was almost caught out by a cross that drifted uncomfortably close to the far corner of his goal.<br><br>Ten minutes after the restart, Korea was left wondering how it wasn't ahead as two successive shots, the first from Lee Dong-gook and the second from Kim Doo-hyun, were blocked on the line by Bahraini defenders with the goalkeeper nowhere to be found.<br><br>Korea started to gain control of the game but was struggling to seriously trouble Bahraini goalkeeper Abdulrahman Ahmed.<br><br>Lee Chun-soo should have scored with 15 minutes remaining. A header from substitute Cho Jae-jin found the attacker alone just four meters from goal but Lee completely misfired with only the keeper to beat.<br><br>With five minutes remaining, Bahrain took a shock lead that delighted the neutrals at the stadium. A loose ball fell to Ismael Abdullatif just inside the box and the striker's fierce shot gave the goalkeeper no chance.<br><br>It was a dismal night for Korea who needs to rise to the occasion on Wednesday or face an early return home.<br><br>By John Duerden Contributing writer<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group D Special Report - Korea</strong><br><br>Lee Ho ready to make necessary sacrifices<br>Jul 16, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>By Michael Church, PA Sport<br><br>Korean football is renowned for its long line of top quality central midfielders, and Lee Ho is hoping to become the latest to take on the self-less role that allows the rest of the team to perform.<br><br>Players such as Yoo Sang-chul, Lee Eul-young and Kim Nam-il have been the bedrock upon which the Korea Republic national team has been built for much of the last decade.<br><br>But with the old guard now having either hung up their boots or on the verge of doing so, Lee is ready to step up and take on the task.<br><br>Â“Those guys were players I used to watch and I really admire them because they achieved a lot for Korean football,Â” he said of the generation who led Korea to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup.<br><br>Â“They always stayed behind the other players and they were the ones who worked and sacrificed themselves for the team. I want to follow the way they played for the team.Â”<br><br>Of the old guard, only Kim remains active with the national team and, had it not been for a late injury, he would have captained the side at the AFC Asian Cup finals.<br><br>However, despite KimÂ’s absence in Indonesia, Lee has already had the opportunity to play alongside the former Excelsior Rotterdam midfielder and he is hoping his more illustrious partnerÂ’s experience will rub off on him.<br><br>Â“Kim Nam-il has a lot of experience,Â” he said. Â“He controls the team and controls the tempo of the game. He provides great leadership and heÂ’s the perfect role model for a young player.<br><br>Â“If I can learn from him as quickly as possible that would be ideal because he has done so much for Korean football.<br><br>Â“I want to earn as much experience as possible so that one day soon I can become a player like Kim Nam-il and be essential to the team.Â”<br><br>Last yearÂ’s World Cup finals in Germany formed part of LeeÂ’s education, and his performances there convinced Korea boss Dick Advocaat to take the 22-year-old with him to the Russian Premier League side Zenit St. Petersburg.<br><br>His first six months with the club were a success, featuring 18 times in the starting line-up, but since then he has struggled to earn a place in the team as Zenit have moved to the top of the Russian league standings.<br><br>Â“It was always my dream to go abroad and I realised that playing outside would make me a much better player and so I made a decision to go abroad after I got a proposal to do so,Â” said Lee.<br><br>Â“The football style in Russia is a European style and although it canÂ’t be compared with something the English Premier League, it is tough and itÂ’s much tougher than the Korean league. Of course when it comes to the individual skills and technique, itÂ’s difficult to compare but when it comes to one-on-one situations, itÂ’s pretty tough.<br><br>Â“After the World Cup I went straight to the Russian league and played a lot of games but this year unfortunately I havenÂ’t had a chance to play a lot of games in the Russian league, so IÂ’m losing a lot of match fitness and rhythm so compared with this time last year I have lost a lot of sharpness.Â”<br><br>Adapting to life in Russia has been a challenge for Lee, who openly admits to having had difficulties with the language and, despite being with the club for a year, he has struggled to settle in.<br><br>Â“Being so far away from home is quite difficult because you have to focus on yourself for the training sessions and also for normal life,Â” he said. Â“ItÂ’s all new and you have to learn.<br><br>Â“I was told by the club that going outside the team accommodation, I was told not to go out too often because of the security situation so I usually stay at the club, although I do the odd tourist thing. So I havenÂ’t seen much of the city.<br><br>Â“In order to survive in a foreign country, you must have good football skills but the other important thing is the language, you need to understand the language. ThatÂ’s what IÂ’ve realised. Also for your private life, when you go outside the club you have to speak the language as well. You need that to stay and survive in other countries.<br><br>Â“Not many Russian people can speak English and thatÂ’s part of the reason I was struggling because if they could speak English then I could spend more time going out and make friends, but because of the language itÂ’s a struggle.Â”<br><br>As a result, Lee is considering trying somewhere new, with reports in Korea suggesting he may return to the K-League Â– where he previously played for Ulsan Hyundai Â– or try his luck in the J.League.<br><br>However, LeeÂ’s first objective is not to return to Asia.<br><br>Â“I havenÂ’t decided yet but most likely after the Asian Cup itÂ’s likely that IÂ’ll decide to move,Â” he said. Â“IÂ’m a football player and I like to play, so if I leave IÂ’ll go to a club where I know I will get to play.<br><br>Â“The primary target for me is to stay in Europe and if thatÂ’s not possible then IÂ’d still like to play somewhere that IÂ’ve never experienced before. It doesnÂ’t matter where it is, as long as I can play. ThatÂ’s the most important thing.Â”<br><br>Before that, though, heÂ’s hoping he can play a part in helping the Koreans win the AFC Asian Cup title for the first time in 47 years as coach Pim Verbeek looks to rejuvenate the team in preparation for the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa.<br><br>Â“Quite a number of players are playing in England and they are doing a good job and that has raised the reputation of Korean players and itÂ’s higher now than before,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“Because of that Korean players are getting more confidence and our coach is doing a good job and when it comes to the changing of the generations heÂ’s trying to pick younger players who have great talent and give them experience. I think weÂ’re on the right track with regards to the World Cup in 2010.<br><br>Â“Of course there are things we have to improve, such as our form when we play in away games. Those are difficult for us and 2010 is an away game for us as well and we have to work on that because those games will be difficult.<br><br>Â“The Asian Cup, because itÂ’s a tournament, will help. It will give the players more experience and that really helps.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group D news</strong><br><br>Korea Either Wins or Packs<br><br>By Kim Tong-hyung<br>Staff Reporter<br><br>With its Asian Cup dreams now hanging by a thread, South Korea heads into tonight's final group match needing a big win over surging co-hosts Indonesia, and a deafening home crowd of 90,000 certainly doesn't help.<br><br>The Koreans declared themselves as tournament favorites arriving in Jakarta but a 1-1 draw against Saudi Arabia in the opener and an embarrassing 2-1 defeat to underdogs Bahrain have left the Taeguek Warriors with bruised egos, shattered confidence and sore bodies.<br><br>Since its superb World Cup run in 2002, it's hard to deny that Korean football has regressed considerably in depth of talent, and so far, national team manager Pim Verbeek seems to have failed to make the tactical adjustments to coax the squad into playing better than the sum of its parts.<br><br>The Dutchman, once hailed as a national hero as a coach for Guus Hiddink, now finds himself under fire, with some local newspapers speculating that the always-petulant Korean Football Association (KFA) will soon come calling for his head.<br><br>And it looks like some of his best players have already started tuning him out. Middlesbrough forward Lee Dong-gook, who started in the Bahrain match, claimed to the media that the team was out-coached on the pitch and complained about the lack of touches.<br><br>Nonetheless, Verbeek is confidence of his team's chances of advancing to the knockout stage, although going through Indonesia was clearly not the way he wanted to do it.<br><br>"I am expecting a great game. Clearing the home team by two goals in front of a crowd of 90,000 is a big challenge to both the players and coaches,'' said Verbeek in a news conference in Jakarta Tuesday.<br><br>He also added that there will be no big changes in strategy from the previous two games, with the wide midfielders joining the lone striker on the attack when the team has the ball.<br><br>Indonesia presents an ultimate test to Verbeek's optimism. At least on paper, the co-hosts represent the least talented bunch of the four in Group D.<br><br>However, their 2-1 win over Bahrain in the opener and impressive performance in the 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia, which they gave up the heart-breaker in stoppage time, clearly shows the fitness and determination of the Indonesian players, as well as how far their frantic, foot-stomping home crowd of 90,000 could carry them.<br><br>Indonesia is expected to adopt a similar strategy the Saudis and Bahrain employed against Korea __ pounding the ball to the flanks and taking advantage of the slow Korean defenders.<br><br>Fleet-footed Saudi forward Malek Maaz tortured the Korean defense throughout the game before drawing the game-tying penalty in the second-half on an ill-advised foul by right-back Oh Beom-seok.<br><br>The Chunnam Dragons duo of Kim Jin-kyu and Kang Min-soo __ who Verbeek trusts as central defenders __ failed to recover for their defensive miscues that led to the two goals against Bahrain.<br><br>Indonesia seems to have the personnel to attack Korea in the same way. Pint-sized forward Bambang Pamungkas could give Korean defenders nightmares with his pace and trickery, while skipper Ponaryo Astaman gives the team a creative playmaker in the midfield.<br><br>Korea could take comfort in the fact that the Indonesians will be without holding midfielder Eka Ramdani due to accumulated bookings. Attacker Elie Aiboy, who scored the equalizer against Saudi Arabia, could also miss the match as he is nursing a knee injury.<br><br>Stemming the Indonesian attack is one thing, scoring against them is another. Coping with the loss of Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung and Suwon Samsung's Kim Nam-il, Verbeek has packed the midfield with five players for the effectiveness at keeping position.<br><br>However, with the midfielders forced to play deep most of the time to cover for defensive jitters, and forwards Lee and Cho Jae-jin struggling in their roles as lone striker, creating enough goal-scoring chances has become a problem for the Koreans.<br><br>Verbeek hopes to clear Indonesia by at least two goals, which would give them insurance should Bahrain beat Saudi Arabia in their group stage finale, and he has to be wondering where the offense will come from.<br><br>The Dutch coach is likely to start Cho as a lone striker, who does a better job than Lee in winning the ball in air and holding it up until the support arrives, with the Middlesbrough forward, the better finisher of the two, readied as a second-half substitute.<br><br>Ulsan Hyundai midfielder Lee Chun-soo has clearly been Korea's best player so far with his relentless attack on the right flank, and Verbeek could only hope that his set-piece prowess results in a goal this time, especially with his strikers looking out of touch.<br><br>Kim Do-hyeon, who scored the goal against Bahrain but otherwise had an ineffective game, is penciled as the offensive point man in the center midfield, while Seongnam Ilhwa teammate Kim Sang-shik hopes to replace the role of Suwon's Kim as the deep-lying playmaker.<br><br>Song Chong-kuk and Kim Dong-jin, defensive backs who were blamed largely for the loss to Bahrain, are not expected to get the call against Indonesia, as their games could be more fitted to a 4-4-2 style which requires full-backs to be more involved in the offense.<br><br>This means that Oh and Kim Chi-kyu, defenders with limited attacking skills, will man the flanks against Indonesia, and Verbeek expects a better performance by the duo than from the Saudi match.<br><br>The hostile home crowd at Jakarta's sweltering Gelora Bung Karno Stadium is not only a concern for Verbeek's boys. The Korean embassy in Jakarta has warned Korean football fans not to wander outside their designated area in the stadium and recommended them not to wear the Korean football team's uniform or red shirts.</div>
