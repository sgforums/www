Ali KarimiÂ’s well timed run into the Malaysian box was checked illegally by Hussain Khaironissam according to referee Muhsen Basma. Javad Nekounam, scorer of IranÂ’s equaliser against China in a 2-2 draw, tucked away the resulting penalty with ease.<br><br>The Malaysian woodwork was rattled again only moments later when Rahman RezaeiÂ’s delicate headed cross was thumped against the bar by Hashemian.<br><br>Malaysia came close to equalising after 44 minutes when Shukor AdanÂ’s thrusting run down the right flank saw him find space to fire in a shot that brought the best out of Roudbarian to send the home team into the break in a buoyant mood.<br><br>With Malaysia continuing to fight for every blade of the Bukit Jalil National Stadium turf, Iran had to wait until the 58th minute for their first serious attempt of the half, TeymourianÂ’s effort being tipped away acrobatically by Azizon.<br><br>Substitute Rassoul Khatibi duly headed horribly wide from only five yards before he was booked for attempting to win a penalty with a dramatic dive.<br><br>A long range pile driver from Hashemian was then gathered well by Azizon as Malaysian bodies continued to thwart Iran, a terrific team spirit that was epitomised in the 71st minute as Hamzani Omar reacted brilliantly to deny Khatibi a clear attempt on goal.<br><br>Javad KazemianÂ’s lobbed effort on 75 minutes looped agonisingly wide before IranÂ’s superior possession was turned into something more tangible three minutes later when Teymourian converted a Mehdi Mahdavikia pass with unerring accuracy to beat Azizon at his near post.<br><br>KarimiÂ’s last gasp shot was turned onto the bar by Azizon, the save proved to be the last meaningful action of a game which Iran may have won but from which Malaysia emerged with plaudits galore.<br><br></div>

IÂ’m proud of the players because from the very beginning until the last game they played at their best level even though we knew our opponents would be tough.Â”<br><br>Indonesia came into the event as rank outsiders but caused an early upset when they defeated Bahrain 2-1 before losing in injury time to Saudi Arabia. A win over the Koreans would have saw them go through to the last eight for the first time.<br><br>However, despite their exit, Kolev believes Indonesia will benefit from their participation in the event and sees a bright future ahead.<br><br>Â“There are so many lessons that we have learnt, I canÂ’t explain them all but IÂ’m sure it will mean that we are a much better team in the future because of all the hard work we have done,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“We started training two-and-a-half months ago and it was not enough time but hopefully we can stay in good shape and have a good team in the future.Â”<br><br>The former Myanmar coach hailed his teamÂ’s battling qualities as they tried to pull themselves back into the game.<br><br>Â“The level of the Korean team and the Indonesian team is different,Â” he said. Â“Korea is slightly higher but IÂ’m proud of the Indonesian players especially in the second half of this game and to keep the score at 1-0.<br><br>Â“The Indonesia team is not like England or Germany or France, who can change their strategy in every game. Coming into the game we had so many injuries so I could only maximise what I had.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  I feel so disappointed with Korea. It's true that they won but they played badly. This is one of the worst performances of Korea I've seen in years. It's hard to accept that. It's embarassing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>The problem lies with a few reasons.<br><br>1) the formation is not right. It's rather negative football, with only 1 lonely striker of Cho Jae Jin up front. Facing strong teams using this formation might work better but against Indonesia, they should be more confident despite the Indonesians having supporters at home.<br><br>2) Head coach  Pim Verbeek selected the wrong players for big games. How can he use the inexperience and young rookies with only 4 to 6 caps, especially on both defensive flanks. Kim Chi Woo on the left and Oh Beom Seok on the right. Really a mistake. On a few ocassions, if Indonesia had taken their chances well, they might be able to upset Korea. And I won't be surprised.  Both defenders are not bad but they are too inexperience and lacking confidence, resulting in several mistakes made. Left back position should be given to the 185cm tall Russia-based Kim Dong Jin and right-back should be given back to Suwon Bluewing's Song Chong Guk (28 years old), the 2002 World Cup player who has played for Feyenoord in the Netherlands. Seriously, I don't even agree to some of the players he's selected.<br><br>3)Wrong selection on the shortest guy, Choi Sung Kuk. He's been put to play on right winger position. He doesn't even produce great result to his club. Maybe only ocassionally. So I don't know why he can be selected for national team. His bad habit is dribbling too much and his lack of height is really a  problem, especially facing long balls or cornerkicks. Even if selected, he shouldn't be in the starting 11.<br><br>4) The refusal to select Ahn Jung Hwan, who has vast experience over the years in Europe and Japan. He's back in Korea playing for Suwon Bluewings. He might not have played a lot recently but with him in the national squad, he can boost up the morale of the young team. Remember what he did to USA and  Italy in the 1-1 draw and 2-1 win in 2002. He's a little bit like Inzaghi, who can just score suddenly out of nowhere although most of the time, he's offside.<br><br>5) Lee Eul Young, one of the main veterans of 2002 and 2006, at 31 now, should be included as he's a tough guy. Played his games in the Belgium league before. In the absence of captain Kim Nam Il, the team needs another experienced guy to lead the youngsters, especially in defense.<br><br>Well, afterall, we miss the services of Seol Ki Hyeon, Lee Young Pyo, Kim Nam Il and Park Ji Sung. I believe if they're around, the team would be different. It'll be more attacking and more confident in attack. Lee Dong Gook would have more chances created for him.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> I'm a little worried about the future of Korean football if these guys are not around. It's a transitional period now and we can understand the difficulty at times for the team but we can see some problems occuring. It's time to for the KFA to do something.<br><br>For the next game against the Iranians in KL, Malaysia, coach Verbeek has better do something to change the style of play. Or else they're gonna lose to the strong Iranians.<br><br>Look at China. It's a disappointment to see them crash out of Asian Cup 2007. I thought they would have qualified with the way they started earlier....<br><br>Guys, thanks for your support.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

He's back in Korea playing for Suwon Bluewings. He might not have played a lot recently but with him in the national squad, he can boost up the morale of the young team. Remember what he did to USA and  Italy in the 1-1 draw and 2-1 win in 2002. He's a little bit like Inzaghi, who can just score suddenly out of nowhere although most of the time, he's offside.<br><br>5) Lee Eul Young, one of the main veterans of 2002 and 2006, at 31 now, should be included as he's a tough guy. Played his games in the Belgium league before. In the absence of captain Kim Nam Il, the team needs another experienced guy to lead the youngsters, especially in defense.<br><br>Well, afterall, we miss the services of Seol Ki Hyeon, Lee Young Pyo, Kim Nam Il and Park Ji Sung. I believe if they're around, the team would be different. It'll be more attacking and more confident in attack. Lee Dong Gook would have more chances created for him.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> I'm a little worried about the future of Korean football if these guys are not around. It's a transitional period now and we can understand the difficulty at times for the team but we can see some problems occuring. It's time to for the KFA to do something.<br><br>For the next game against the Iranians in KL, Malaysia, coach Verbeek has better do something to change the style of play. Or else they're gonna lose to the strong Iranians.<br><br>Look at China. It's a disappointment to see them crash out of Asian Cup 2007. I thought they would have qualified with the way they started earlier....<br><br>Guys, thanks for your support.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Glad Korea made it.<br>You really know your football, and that's commendable.<br><br>Now that China's out, I'm rooting for Japan and Korea to do well, and Vietnam to give a good account of themselves against Iraq.<br><br>Iran would be tough though...</div>

They kicked us out in 1996, in 2000, we met them and we won and in 2006, they knocked us out of the quarter final. We were leading 3-2 until 2 Iranian goals turned the score to 4-3. We also met Iran in the Olympic and we beat them. In 1990's Asian games, Korea were favorites to be the gold medalists but after dominating the entire 90 mins against the Iranians in the semi final, we ended up losing 1-0 in extra time with a Iran counter attack.  I remember that year, Korea had beaten Singapore 7-0 in the group stage. Singapore also lost 5-1 to China. (Singapore had arguably a so-called dream team of what Singapore fans refer to as Fandi Ahmad, Sundram Moorthy, Malek Awab, K. Kannan, Hasnim Haron, David Lee etc.. and yet were trashed like what Malaysia is experiencing now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) In 1990, Japan was still a minor in Asia. They were still wearing white or red. I can still remember. They even had hard times beating any Southeast Asian teams. Ramos, Miura Kazuyoshi were the stars in Japan during those days but not good enough.<br><br>Back to Iran-Korea rivalry..... So I don't understand why we always have the fate to meet Iran. And I have to say that Iran tend to obstruct us from going further in major competitions.<br><br>Japan is lucky that they always don't meet Iran in tournaments. Otherwise, Iran might post an obstacle for Japan too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

We have to overcome Iran tomorrow and your side has to overcome Australia today before we have a higher chance to meet.<br><br>Anyway, do you find that Korea tend to not get good results against west asian teams? However when Korea meets Japan, the statistics tell us that Korea beats Japan most of the time. Japan can always defeat other countries but tend to have difficult times against Korea. Soccer is a strange game.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good Morning Jaeyoon.By 1990 all those Singaporean names that you mentioned earlier were already over their prime but only their names refused to shrink and hence they were thrashed in the Asian arena.I moved to Japan in 1992 when J-league was just about to start and later taught in a Secondary School where Hidetoshi Nakata was our star midfielder.Yes,I was a fan of Verdi Kawasaki featuring Ramos,Miura and more than half the National team played for that club.At that time the National Jersey was white and we drew more than we win and lost more than we drew. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>Now lets talk about the existing teams and how I  feel about playing with them.Iran for us is "Iranai" which in Japanese means (I dont need) because they can be heartbreakers when it comes to a semi final or final.When we play korea in korean soil its almost impossible to beat them but when they come to Tokyo we usually show them who is the boss.In a neutral environment I agree that Korea is half a pace faster and makes better kimchi.<br>The Aussies has got players names that is bigger than Godzilla but this is not the World Cup and I suspect some players are more loyal to their clubs than national pride at this level of competition.No one wants to risk injury.Our quick short passes is sure to give the kangaroos some headaches.They can guard Maki,Nakamura &amp; Takahara for all they want but a solitary is going to come from someone like Kaji or komano from outside the box.Anyways good luck to both our teams as we try to clear the highest hurdle and who knows maybe a Korea -Japan Final?<br></div>
