Goalkeeper Ignatiy Nesterov parried the ball away from goal, but only as far as Yasser Al Qahtani, who slotted home from 12 yards out.<br><br>Just two minutes later Uzbekistan almost snatched an equaliser when Server Djeparov smashed his effort from the edge of the penalty area but, with Yasser Al Mosailem well beaten, the ball came back off the Saudi keeperÂ’s left upright.<br><br>The brisk opening continued in the 11th minute when Nesterov pulled off a fine save from Saad Khariri, the Al Ittihad midfielder flicking Abdulrahman Al QahtaniÂ’s free kick towards goal with his head.<br><br>Uzbekistan captain Maksim Shatskikh caused problems throughout the opening period and 19 minutes into the game he tried his luck from distance, only for Walid Abdrabh Jahdali to deflect the shot wide via the post.<br><br>Three minutes later the Uzbeks were to be frustrated again, this time as Aziz Ibragimov steered DjeparovÂ’s corner wide. But in the 28th minute Rauf InileyevÂ’s side thought they had finally pulled level.<br><br>DjeparovÂ’s free kick was saved by Al Mosailem, and Shatskikh fired high into the net on the rebound. However, the assistant referee ruled the effort out for offside.<br><br>Yasser Al Qahtani almost doubled Saudi Arabia's lead in the 31st minute only to pull his shot wide while Malek MaazÂ’s header was also just off target three minutes later.<br><br>An end-to-end half finished with Vitaly Denisov firing a powerful shot from the left across the face of goal, narrowly missing the far post.<br><br>The Uzbeks continued their quest for the equaliser within four minutes of the restart when DjeparovÂ’s cross was met by Ibragimov, but his downward header came back off the woodwork.<br><br>But as they became increasingly desperate, the gaps started to appear at the back. InileyevÂ’s side had two warnings Â– from Taisser Al Jassam and Al Mousa Â– in the minutes before the Saudis doubled their advantage.<br><br>Al Mousa started and finished the move that ultimately won the game for the Saudis, laying the ball off to Khaled Aziz, who found Yasser Al Qahtani and his perfect pass split the Uzbek defence and Al Mousa finished in style with 15 minutes to go.<br><br>Solomin, however, finally found the back of the net for the Uzbeks six minutes later when he bundled the ball over the line after Hayrulla Karimov's header had hit the crossbar and Geynrikh thought he had done enough to take the game into extra-time only for his right-foot shot to come back off the frame of the goal.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Verbeek hails Korean spirit</strong><br>Jul 23, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR Â– Korea Republic coach Pim Verbeek spoke glowingly about the spirit of his players on Sunday after they defeated Iran in a penalty shootout to reach the semi-finals of the AFC Asian Cup.<br><br>The two sides battled to a goalless draw in a tense and pulsating quarter-final at a rainy Bukit Jalil National Stadium before the Koreans claimed a 4-2 shootout victory thanks to two penalty saves by goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae.<br><br>Verbeek, an assistant coach for Korea at the last two World Cups was delighted that his youthful side were able to overcome an experienced Iranian squad that were considered favourites to lift the Asian Cup.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s clear that IÂ’m very proud of my team tonight. Our selection worked very hard against a strong opponent for 120 minutes to get the result,Â” the Dutchman said.<br><br>Â“I was there also with the Korean team at the World Cup in 2002 and 2006 and I never have seen a Korean team play without vitality and with spirit.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s one of the great qualities of Korean football and that why itÂ’s very good to be coaching Korean players, especially the young players that we have here.Â”<br><br>Despite neither side being able to find the net in regulation and extra time, the Korea coach felt that his sideÂ’s win was not undeserved.<br><br>Â“We were in control and we didnÂ’t give many chances away,Â” he explained.<br><br>Â“Organisation-wise I think we did very well defensively and I am just very glad to be going to the semi-final.<br><br>Â“To be honest I donÂ’t think that either team had a better game. But if our players had played a bit more with their head and less of their heart, maybe I thought that we could have made better use of our wide players tonight.Â”<br><br>But despite his delight, Verbeek was keen to stress that his side had not achieved anything yet at the tournament.<br><br>Â“The players have done well but we have still won nothing yet.<br><br>Â“We have reached the semi-final but that is still nothing. We have to go to the final and then try to win the Cup.Â”<br><br>The Koreans will now turn their attention to this WednesdayÂ’s showdown against Iraq in Kuala Lumpur as they seek to reach the Asian Cup final for the first time since 1988.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m more worried by the fact that we have one day less rest and that we played 120 minutes tonight,Â” Verbeek said.<br><br>Â“I think that we only have three days rest to bring the players physically and mentally back, and there will be no time for training sessions.<br><br>Â“We have played Iraq recently and although it was only a friendly, we scored three goals against them. But thatÂ’s history and now itÂ’s a new game and a new challenge.Â”</div>

Still the offensive lack punch.Japan on the other hand is comfortable with the J-league 3-5-2 formation.The weakness I see in Japanese players will be their  indiviidual playing style which is so predictable but we are never short when it comes to set plays and quick one -two passes.I hope to see clear victory from these two teams in the semifinals.After that Kimchi or Sushi I let you decide&gt; <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Actually they played well and missed several chances. Otherwise they might be able to beat the Saudis.<br><br>Credit to Uzbekistan. I respect them. They're back to the best. Only luck was not with them.<br><br>PS: do you guys know that Uzbekistan was once a force in Asian Football? They won the Asian Games gold medal in 1994, beating China 4-2 in the final and Korea in the Semi final 1-0. I remember the star player like Azamat in those days. Then the late 90s and early 2000s saw their football slumped to a new low. Well, they might be back to their best again.<br><br>We'll see more of them in the coming years. So the force is not only from the over-rated Australia but also the Uzbeks who are coming back strong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But that doesnÂ’t mean that you have to change your backline. I donÂ’t believe it is necessary to change our defenders as they have abilities,Â” the 66-year-old said.<br><br>Â“If I keep the same team or change the team around, I will get criticized if we fail anyway. But I as coach will take all the responsibilities if we lose tomorrow,Â” he added.<br><br></div>

Â“They have good strikers, they have individual skill and are dangerous.<br><br>Â“They have a tough defence, good balance and are well organised and it is also very difficult to defend their set plays. ItÂ’s not an easy game.<br><br>Â“They have good players so we have to play our best football to get to the final and thatÂ’s what we are going to do.Â”<br><br>The Koreans, who finished second in Jakarta-based Group D, are chasing their first Asian Cup title since 1960 and a place in the final for the first time since 1988, when they lost to Saudi Arabia.<br><br>A rematch of that final 19 years ago is on the cards should VerbeekÂ’s team dispose of Iraq and the Saudis overcome defending champions Japan in Hanoi, although the 51-year-old is not looking beyond his teamÂ’s next opponent.<br><br>Â“There are no easy routes to the final,Â” he said.

They beat Australia and we will never underestimate a team like Iraq. ItÂ’s not an easy game.Â”<br><br>VerbeekÂ’s team have scored only three goals in their four matches so far, finishing second in Group D after drawing with Saudi Arabia, losing to Bahrain and defeating Indonesia to progress by the slimmest of margins.<br><br>The Koreans then held Iran to a goalless draw after 120 minutes in the quarter-final before winning a penalty shootout against the three-time champions.<br><br>Â“I think so far we have had a tough tournament,Â” said Verbeek. Â“We had a difficult group with Saudi Arabia, one of the other semi-finalists. We had to overcome 90,000 fantastic fans in Indonesia and we played one of the contenders to win the title in Iran and we had to play 120 minutes.<br><br>Â“We have had one day less rest than Iraq and in the game I saw against Vietnam they had an easier game than us, so it will be a tough game but we will make it a hard game for Iraq. If you get to the semi-final you have to do everything to win the tournament, thatÂ’s why we came.Â”<br></div>
