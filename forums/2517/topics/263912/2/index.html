            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SumOne:</div><div class="quote_body">About Singapore winning in Asean, well, it's no easy feat to win any Cup Competition, and you do need a bit of luck sometimes to even get to the final. You are kind of belittling the competition with some of the things you say. I think credit still should go to the current Singapore team to take their chances, they are not undeserving winners in any sense. To come from 1-0 down to draw the match in a hostile Thai enviroment is by no means any easy feat. Add to that the small number of supporters who actually went for the match. Credit should be given where it's due.</div></blockquote>Thank you for your opinion. No, I'm not belittling the competition. They deserve some credit of course. You need a bit of luck. In competitions, sometime the best team doesn't win. On many occasions, the favorites would end up defeated. People can say they're unlucky or didn't perform up to expectation or wasted their chances. Right?<br><br>And about your comment on <strong>hostile</strong> Thai environment, I don't agree with it. I believe this is what the Singapore media's bad habit of over exagerating the situation after that 1st leg's incident. That's something a lot of foreigners always feel about the Singapore's media or government (sorry, don't mean to put politics in but it's true). They tend to portray other countries' situation as 'dangerous', 'messy', 'hostile' or something negative that affect Singaporeans' feelings about other countries. ( Nothing is good about others except Singapore.)<br><br>According to the fact at that time, from my numerous contacts in Bangkok, the Thai people were living everyday as usual. The Thai fans weren't hostile. Bangkok environment was as usual. Nothing negative or dangerous. It's the media that scared Singapore supporters and the team and play down on Thailand. Thus many supporters from Singapore canceled their trips.  In fact I find Thai people very disciplined and friendly citizens. Otherwise millions of foreigners won't be visiting, living and working there every year.<br><br>In fact, when I was in the National Stadium watching the games that Singapore played in, the Singapore fans appeared to be more hostile to the away teams. They would always curse out all the local vulgar terms loudly on the away teams. Even when it's true a foul by Singapore players on the opponent players, the local fans in Singapore would just curse out those 'CB', 'referee Kayu', 'KNN', 'FCUK U' kind of words on the referees or the opponent players. How do we justify that then?<br><br>In Korea, I've watched international football games and I can assure you that I have never seen Korean supporters curse and swear out loud at opponent teams or referees like what some Singapore supporters do. Unless there is some injustice over the referee's decision or unsporting conduct/naughty behavior by players of another countries. Despite that, the supporters continue to cheer without the disturbing curse and swear which we often hear when we enter the Kallang National Stadium in Singapore. So I don't know what those 'curse and swear' supporters really want.<br><br>Overall, if you talk about hostile environment, in my opinion, Singapore's National Stadium is more hostile if I'm a foreigner supporting my country and sit in one of the designated corner of the National Stadium. I remember how everytime, the foreign supporters got harassed or cursed by the local Singapore supporters when they didn't do anything wrong. That's unsporting.<br>I don't see that in Korea. Supporters just sing out loud, cheer the Korea National Team throughout the match without harassing the foreign supporters in another corner holding foreign flags.<br><br>Maybe it's due to education or media's influence on the supporters, I'm not sure. But I think that if you refer the Thailand-Singapore game earlier this year as hostile environment, I don't agree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Of course the majority of the fans support the home team but they're not dangerous. Many people in Bangkok are educated and they have their own set of values and buddhist teachings they received since young.  So give the Thai supporters some confidence and credits. We can't base our judgement on what the media says. And as you know, some reporters are disliked by readers....They're biased. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Especially those from newspapers like The New Paper.<br><br>I have been to Thailand on many occasions and have many friends there. I think they're OK. They don't take the 1st leg's controversial penalty to heart. It's a game after all. Many supporters were unhappy during that time but after a while, they would forget it and look forward to the Asian Cup which will start today.<br><br>And please, do not classify Thailand as a places like Indonesia or England where the fans can be very too passionate to the extent that crowd trouble sometimes occur.  Indonesia's domestic league games sometimes see players chasing after players or even referees, the supporters even become violent.<br><br>I'm not Thai but I feel injustice for the Thais if the media influence the people, telling them negatively about the usually friendly people.<br><br>Anyway, if you have a chance, welcome to Korea to watch an international match between Korea and another country, you'll see for yourself and know what I mean.<br><br>SumOne, have a Nice Day!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

That means it's 21:30 (9:30pm) in Seoul/Tokyo time and 20:30 (8:30pm) in Singapore/KL time.<br><br>I don't know about Japan's TV schedule and whether they will show. You might like to check with your TV operator. In Korea, we have live telecast over channels. And in the cable channels, we have ESPN Korea and Startsports as well. There'll be live telecast like many other Asian countries.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I'll tell you more about the Korea team later.

Sutee Suksomkit scored a nice penalty kick 5th minute.<br><br>Later, midway through the 1st half, a freekick from outside the Thai penalty box on the right resulted in a header by Iraqi star Younis Mahmud. 1-1 the score. several shots by the Iraqis were dangerous but my Man of the Match, Thai keeper, Kosin Hathairattanakool, saved all the shots. He really played well.<br><br>In the 2nd half, Thailand played with more confidence. They emerged as the side that dominated the 2nd half.  Several chances could have been resulted in at least a goal by the Thai side but again, the Iraqis defended well.<br><br>Credit to both sides. Both sides share a point each.<br>I think Thailand can continue and will be better in the 2nd game against Oman. I have confidence in them<br><br>Iraq should be respected for their good play too. Remember, their country is war-torn. They have suffered so much. Let's hope this Iraq team can do their country proud. I wish they can perform well against Australia in the next game.<br><br></div>

In the first half we were too tense but we played better after the break.<br><br>"The one disappointing aspect of our play today was that we did play too well defensively.

Â“But it was good to check what it would be like to play here in such conditions like this.Â”<br><br>Japan goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi added: Â“The heat and humidity are more than what I expected. But we can get used to it and donÂ’t have to be nervous about the game conditions.<br><br>Â“Many of us have experienced playing in worse conditions than this. We should adjust our physical fitness well first to get ready for our first match.Â”<br><br>Osim earlier said that he will form a team around the players who are capable of playing in the heat and high humidity.<br><br>Â“I just told our players to take this [training game] seriously so that they can see how much they can do under the circumstances in a different type of climate,Â” he said. Â“Some players ran well and some didnÂ’t. WeÂ’ll just have to take our games in the condition given to us.Â”<br><br></div>
