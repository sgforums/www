Â“At that time, the Saudi Arabia players were tired and that gave them a break to recover.<br><br>Â“The weather conditions were not good but the same applies on the Saudi players and this is not an excuse. At the end of the day, it is a good result.Â”<br><br>However, Woon-Jae's counterpart Al Qahtani disagreed and insisted his side hand the upper hand in the game and deserved to claim all three points after clearing several clear-cut scoring chances.<br><br>Â“We dominated the game but we couldn't score from the chances that we had," he said. Â“This is football; if you score goals you will win.<br><br>Â“It may be true that the Koreans havenÂ’t beat us in a competitive fixture in 18 years and the Saudi national team previously had the upper hand when the two sides met.<br><br>Â“However, today we had new young players who played their first game in such a big competition and they had a good game.Â”<br><br>Al Qahtani, who scored his 28th international goal against Korea, produced a quiet display on Wednesday, with strike partner Malek Maaz providing the majority of the attacking threat.<br><br>Â“You should ask the AFC who gave me the MVP Award," said Al Qahtani. Â“I have recently returned from injury and my fitness is still not 100% and I now have a slight cramp in my leg.Â”<br><br>Saudi Arabia will now look towards SaturdayÂ’s meeting with co-hosts Indonesia, who claimed a 2-1 victory over Bahrain in their Group D opener.<br><br>Â“We will prepare very well for our next match and will look at the tape of Indonesia's match against Bahrain,Â” added Al Qahtani.<br></div>

Vietnam and Indonesia did a good job in taking their chances and we will try to do the same.<br><br>Â“Each team in our group has one point so tomorrowÂ’s game will be very tense.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group A News</strong><br><br>Oman edge Iraq, says Thai skipper Tawan<br>Jul 11, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>BANGKOK Â– Thailand skipper Tawan Sripan believes that Oman may prove to be a bigger threat than Iraq when the 2007 AFC Asian Cup co-hosts meet the Gulf Sultanate in their crucial Group A clash on Thursday.<br><br>The BEC Tero Sasana midfielder based his opinion on OmanÂ’s performance against pre-tournament favourites Australia during which the Socceroos needed an inspirational display from keeper Mark Schwarzer and a stoppage-time Tim Cahill equaliser to salvage a point and deny Gabriel CalderonÂ’s side the first major shock of the tournament.<br><br>Â“Looking at Oman in the first game it appears to me that they have better individual technique than Iraq,Â” said Tawan at the pre-match press conference on Wednesday.<br><br>Â“They are a very fast team but we are also fast and we will try not to feel the pressure and will play with determination,Â” continued Tawan, who scored with a trademark free-kick as Thailand defeated OmanÂ’s Gulf rivals Qatar 2-0 in a warm-up match held four days before they took on Iraq.<br>The Thais also needed an inspired performance from their goalkeeper, Kosin Hathairattanakool, to keep them in their opening match against an Iraqi side that were rampant in the first-half but tired badly in the second period.<br><br>IraqÂ’s undoing was the heaviness of the Rajamangala pitch that took a battering from a torrential downpour that at one stage threatened to wash out both the official opening ceremony and the tournament curtain-raiser.<br><br>Thailand handled the underfoot conditions well and could have taken all three points after laying siege to the Iraqi goal in a barnstorming last 10 minutes. But at the very least, Tawan believes that the experience of the conditions will stand them in good stead should the July monsoons make a repeat performance at the Rajamangala on Thursday.<br><br>He added: Â“The condition of the turf played an important role in the game against Iraq. Now we have the experience of playing in the wet conditions we will be able to adapt quickly.Â”<br><br>Thailand are playing Oman for the second successive Asian Cup after the two sides met in Chengdu in the group stage of China 2004.<br><br>The Omanis, then under current Bahrain coach Milan Macala, emerged 2-0 victors thanks to an 11th minute own goal from Rangsan Vivatchaichok and a 49th minute effort from Imad Ali, who set up OmanÂ’s opener against Australia in an MVP award-winning performance.<br><br></div>

So we cannot talk about it right now because if our tactics are known to our opponent then it will not be successful.<br><br>"It was a very tough game today as both teams needed three points. As you all saw it was a very technical game because to play too fast or too slow would not be good.<br><br>"We have four points and we have a great chance to progress to the second round."<br></div>

Quintana gathered the loose ball off the rebound but shot wide.<br><br>Most of VietnamÂ’s efforts in the second half were on the counter attack, Phung Van Nhien curling an effort narrowly wide after surging into the Qatari box and Cong Vinh firing across the face of goal after winning possession off Mostafa Abdulla.<br><br>Qatari pressure finally paid off in the 79th minute when a low shot by substitute Ali Afef deflected off a Vietnamese defender and looped up towards the six-yard box where an onrushing Quintana powered in to head the ball home.<br><br>The Middle Eastern side turned up the pressure in the closing minutes with Ali Afef heading wide in the 82nd minute and then hitting the underside of the crossbar two minutes later after he was found unmarked in the box by Quintana.<br><br>With time running out, Seyd Bechir and Mostafa Abdulla also headed off target before Majadi Siddiq shot wide with the final effort of the game.<br></div>

But I am proud of the Oman players.Â”<br><br>Calderon pointed the finger at the referee arguing that most of the refereeÂ’s decisions went against his side and in favour of Thailand.<br><br>Â“We had four yellow cards and Thailand had zero,Â” he said referring to first-half bookings for defenders Hassan Yousuf Madhafar, Said Shoon and Juma Abdullah Al Wahabi as well as striker Imad Ali, who was a shadow of the player that picked up the MVP award against Australia.<br><br>Â“We believe there was a foul in the build-up to one of their goals and we should have had a corner-kick but the referee gave the ball to Thailand,Â” continued Calderon<br><br>Â“For me it is clearÂ…this is not fair play.Â”<br><br>While the 47-year-old, who took over the managerial reigns from Milan Macala in April, feels that his team was the victim of some poor refereeing he also accepts that Oman must play up their game when they take on Iraq in their final group match on Monday.<br><br>Â“Maybe the referee made a few mistakes but the Oman players didnÂ’t play well.<br><br>Â“I said that we have three finals. We drew the first, lost the second and now win must win the third.Â”<br></div>
