            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Group D news</strong><br><br>Korean performance pleases Verbeek<br>Jul 11, 2007<br>PA Sport<br><br>JAKARTA Â– Korea Republic coach Pim Verbeek was satisfied with his teamÂ’s performance despite seeing Saudi Arabia come back from going a goal behind to earn a draw in their AFC Asian Cup opener.<br><br>Choi Sung-kuk had given the Koreans the lead with a header in the 66th minute only for Yasser Al Qahtani to equalise from the penalty spot 11 minutes later as the two Group D favourites shared the spoils.<br><br>Â“We had a nervous start and for the first 15 minutes the Saudis were the better team,Â” said the Dutchman. Â“But after that we got control of the game and in the second half we were the better team and scored a very good goal.<br><br>Â“We had more chances and I think with the penalty, the goal we gave away, was an unlucky moment in the organisation of the back line.<br><br>Â“Overall, though, I was pleased with the performance of my players against a very strong team like Saudi Arabia.<br><br>Â“Of course, I wanted to win like any coach or any player but I have to admit that a draw was the best result for both teams.Â”<br><br>The Koreans looked to be in control of the game and heading for their first win in a competitive game over the Saudis in 18 years when Australian referee Mark Shield awarded the Arab side a penalty after contact between Malek Maaz and Oh Beom-seok.<br><br>VerbeekÂ’s players protested the decision before Al Qahtani sent Lee Woon-jae the wrong way in the Korean goal and the 51-year-old refused to be drawn into a debate over the legitimacy of the decision.<br><br>Â“I couldnÂ’t see it,Â” he said. Â“I was 70 metres away so I had no idea if it was a penalty or not. But itÂ’s not up to me to say anything about the referee. He makes the decision and itÂ’s done. If it was not a penalty thereÂ’s nothing I can do about it.Â”<br><br>A power outage five minutes from the end of the game stopped play for almost 25 minutes and upon the resumption the Saudis almost scored the winner when Saad Al Harthi hit the side netting with just seconds remaining.<br><br>That, though, would have been rough justice on a Korean side that controlled much of the game. However, Verbeek was impressed by the Saudis, who were playing their first competitive game under coach Helio Anjos.<br><br>Â“TheyÂ’re a strong team, very skilful and also good in defence and very well organised,Â” he said. Â“We didnÂ’t create so many chances but still, I think we did very well against what I think is one of the best teams in this tournament.Â”<br></div>
