That is why we wanted to make a good start this season.<br><br>"We have achieved that now. Hopefully, we can cash in on it."<br><br>Ferguson has also challenged his side to maintain their consistency to keep up the pressure on faltering Chelsea.<br><br>"They have not been tested like that before but if we can maintain our consistency, we will do it," added Ferguson.<br><br>Ferguson also hailed the contribution of Cristiano Ronaldo this season describing the Portuguese winger as the best player in the Premiership.<br><br>"We think Cristiano is the best in this league and have done so for a while," said Ferguson.<br><br>"The important thing for him is to be accepted.<br><br>"They still boo him away from home, like they did at Aston Villa last week.<br><br>"But those same fans are petrified whenever he gets the ball."<br><br>Ferguson also revealed that there is no problem in the relationship between Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney following all the talk over their World Cup bust-up.<br><br>"There is no battle between the two of them, they are the jokers in the dressing room and we have all been subject to their pranks," said Ferguson.<br><br>"I don't think Cristiano's form matters to Wayne because he has quite a laid-back, carefree attitude to life. He just gets on with it and enjoys himself."<br><br></div>
