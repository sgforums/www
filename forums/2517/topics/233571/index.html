            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho believes Andrei Shevchenko has finally 'got the message' following the Ukrainian's well taken brace against Wycombe, which helped Chelsea to the Carling Cup final.<br><br>Chelsea's record signing has cut a forlorn figure for the majority of this season following his Â£30million arrival from Milan and he has been cast as a key protagonist in the reported frosting of relations between Mourinho and Roman Abramovich.<br><br>Despite having thrown his full backing behind Shevchenko in the first part of the season, Mourinho has since grown exasperated by his misfiring striker and prior to selecting him for Tuesday's night's 4-0 success at Stamford Bridge, had banished him to the bench.<br><br>While the inevitable speculation which emanates from West London, with regards the internal disputes apparently prevalent, is unlikely to ever disappear entirely, Mourinho is keen to state his relationship with Shevchenko is no different to that which he holds with any other player and that he has no problem with him on a personal level.<br><br>On the contrary, the Portuguese tactician is hopeful that Tuesday night's impressive display, albeit against League Two opposition, could prove to the spring board Shevchenko needs to kick-start his career in England.<br><br>"Sheva gave us what we need and it is not easy to do it with a click of the fingers," said Mourinho. "This is Chelsea, it is a Jose Mourinho team with specific qualities and a specific philosophy.<br><br>"In football, in some issues, it is very simple. One of the principles in my work is that the best players during the week, the ones that work more and perform game after game, are the players that get on the pitch.<br><br>"What I do with him, I do with every player. For me every player is the same, it doesn't matter if he cost Â£30million and the other Â£300,000, it doesn't matter.<br><br>"Players have to work and perform, if they work and perform I love them, if they don't work and perform, I don't.<br><br>"I am very happy that Sheva got the message and I am very happy with what he did. If somebody thought I was not playing him because I have a personal situation with him - it is a very silly thought.<br><br>"It is a thought from somebody that doesn't understand the game. I want to win so I have to play the players I think are best for the team. I don't play them because they have beautiful eyes, or they are the first ones into training or the last to leave the showers.<br><br>"It is not easy. He came here after seven years with another club, he has a different manager and colleagues. Their philosophy and mentality is the same as mine because they have been with me for three years."<br><br>Mourinho was, though, willing to concede he has been frustrated watching Shevchenko struggle to replicate his Serie A form in the Premiership.<br><br>"The process is a frustration for everybody, especially for him and for me," he concluded.<br><br>"But the personal relationship was always there and I think that is very important. One thing is professional issues and another thing is personal issues. The human relationship was always present. That is why I always kept faith that he could do it."</div>
