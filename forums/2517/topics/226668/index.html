            <div class='col-md body'>Southend's Carling Cup fairytale came to a heart-breaking end in the quarter-finals as they were beaten in extra-time by Tottenham at White Hart Lane.<br><br>The Shrimpers were hoping to cause their second major upset of the season after beating Premiership leaders Manchester United in the last round, but a 115th minute Jermain Defoe goal ended their dream.<br><br>Despite a confident start from the underdogs, their more famous hosts gathered momentum and were the dominant side in the first half.<br><br>Their best chance came on 23 minutes, when the in-form Defoe played a delicate ball in from the left and strike partner Mido volleyed against the underside of the bar from six yards.<br><br>The Egyptian striker is currently playing second-fiddle at White Hart Lane to big-money summer signing Dimitar Berbatov, but he was making a rare start here.<br><br>But he had earlier sparked one of the game's main talking points when he appeared to elbow Shrimpers defender Spencer Prior when challenging for a header.<br><br>The experienced former Leicester man had few complaints about the incident, but things went from bad to worse for him when he limped off with an unrelated injury after just 25 minutes.<br><br>One of Southend's big heroes from the last round, goalkeeper Daryl Flahavan, was called into major action for the first time on 34 minutes. This time Benoit Assou-Ekotto crossed from the left and Defoe headed goal-bound, but the keeper was equal to it with a great flying save.<br><br>But as the second half began, the home fans were starting to get impatient and their team stepped up their efforts to kill the tie.<br><br>Once again, Flahavan produced a good stop to deny Steed Malbranque four minutes into the half after a neat passing move, before Paul Stalteri went close with a rasping 30-yard drive.<br><br>After Danny Murphy and Defoe both had chances after the hour mark, Southend's big moment arrived on 75 minutes.<br><br>Defender Efe Sodje sent a looping header agonisingly wide from Steven Hammell's cross, giving the thousands of travelling fans real hope of an upset.<br><br>It forced Spurs manager Martin Jol to throw on his trump card, Berbatov, for Murphy on 77 minutes, going with three up-front.<br><br>The change had no impact as the game went into extra-time, although Flahavan pulled off his best save of the match to deny Mido in the last minute of the initial 90.<br><br>The keeper continued his heroics until Defoe converted a Mido cross five minutes before penalties to send them home heartbroken.<br></div>
