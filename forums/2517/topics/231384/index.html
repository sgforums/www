            <div class='col-md body'>Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster has revealed that he once considered turning his back on football.<br><br>Two-and-a-half years ago Foster was not even a regular in Stoke City's reserve side and had doubts about whether he could be a success.<br><br>"It was my third or fourth year as a third or fourth-choice goalkeeper," he recalled.<br><br>"I was playing the odd reserve game here and there, and you get into the mindset of thinking 'if Stoke can't see enough quality to play me then why would anybody else?<br><br>"It was a poor, poor feeling. You don't feel good about yourself and you have no confidence. It wasn't what I wanted to do and I was having second thoughts, to be honest."<br><br>Foster was snapped up by Manchester United in July 2005 and has been loaned out to Watford for the past 18 months, and he insists it is hard to feel negative at Vicarage Road.<br><br>Watford are ten points away from safety in the Premiership but Foster manages to stay in high spirits around manager Adrian Boothroyd.<br><br>Foster is full of respect for Boothroyd and his mentality of always striving for improvement.<br><br>"Aidy Boothroyd is the most positive person I've ever known. Talk to him and you'll never come away down. I love that attitude," he praised.<br><br>"He doesn't believe in second best, he hates losing and there's always something that can be done better.<br><br>"Whenever I come back from United, he's asking me for pointers and tips. He wants to be the best."</div>
