            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsenal v Charlton preview</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Thierry Henry could make an early return to the Arsenal team for Tuesday's visit of Charlton Athletic.<br><br>The Gunners captain has not played since late November due to a hamstring-related problem, but is under consideration for the Emirates Stadium encounter.<br><br>Arsene Wenger is short of options up front, with Robin van Persie doubtful and Julio Baptista joining Emmanuel Adebayor on the injured list.<br><br>Adebayor remains sidelined with a thigh injury, while Baptista picked up an ankle complaint in the 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United.<br><br>Van Persie also hurt his ankle in that game and will be assessed prior to kick-off, while Theo Walcott is still struggling with a back injury.<br><br>That could prompt a return for Henry, with Wenger assessing his fellow Frenchman's fitness. Jeremie Aliadiere could keep his place in attack.<br><br>Wenger will also check on Alexander Hleb's condition with the midfielder nursing a shin injury, which kept him out at Bramall Lane.<br><br>Emmanuel Eboue remains absent with an ankle injury and Johan Djourou has a hamstring problem. Cesc Fabregas could be restored to the midfield.<br><br>The match also has the intriguing sideshow of Wenger meeting up with Alan Pardew for the first time since their Upton Park touchline bust-up two months ago.<br><br>Pardew has since been sacked by West Ham, but has quickly found himself back in football and picked up four points from his first two games in charge of Charlton.<br><br>He could have a big headache, though, for the match amid reports top scorer Darren Bent is out for four weeks with a knee injury.<br><br>If the rumours prove to be true, then Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is likely to partner Marcus Bent in North London.<br><br>Saturday's match-winner against Aston Villa - Bryan Hughes - could be rewarded with a starting spot, possibly at the expense of Radostin Kishishev.<br><br>Charlton are still without captain Luke Young, who is out until February with a knee injury, so Osei Sankofa is set to continue at right-back.<br><br>Andy Reid is also missing again with a hamstring injury, while Amdy Faye remains doubtful after sitting out the last two games.<br><br>Jerome Thomas featured as a late substitute against Villa, but may have to settle for a place on the bench again.<br><br>Skysports.com Prediction: 3-1<br>Arsenal have won nine of the last 10 meetings and should pick up another three points.<br><br>Player to watch: Gilberto Silva<br></span><br><br>Start ur predictions/comments/discussions for this match now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thierry Henry netted on his Arsenal return in a 4-0 win over relegation-threatened Charlton.<br><br>The Addicks had been giving a battling performance at The Emirates, but were hit for six when Henry netted from the penalty spot after Osei Sankofa was given his marching orders.<br><br>Charlton were always going to be up against it a man light and things went from bad to worse with Justin Hoyte adding a second before Robin van Persie's second half brace wrapped up a comfortable win.<br><br>The three-point haul lifts The Gunners into fourth in the Premiership ahead of Bolton while Alan Pardew's side remain second from bottom six points adrift of safety.<br><br>The visitors had the first effort of the game when Dennis Rommedahl lashed wide although The Gunners were soon on the front foot when Gilberto fired over from distance.<br><br>Wenger's troops were soon looking dangerous and only Bryan Hughes on Charlton's goal line prevented Philippe Senderos' goal-bound header nestling in the far corner.<br><br>Charlton failed to clear the danger and seconds later a superb save from Scott Carson kept Cesc Fabregas' stinging shot out from van Persie's neat through-ball.<br><br>Arsenal continued to turn the screw, but while Henry's deft header from Fabregas' neat lofted pass beat Carson it just clipped the bottom of the post to safety.<br><br>Disaster struck for The Addicks on the half hour mark when Sankofa needlessly hauled back van Persie after Fabregas' deflected shot struck the crossbar.<br><br>Not only was the young defender shown the red card by referee Mike Riley, but Henry made no mistake from the penalty spot to give The Gunners a deserved lead.<br><br>The former Juventus ace dispelled any rumours surrounding his relationship with manager Wenger by celebrating his strike with his fellow Frenchman on the sidelines.<br><br>Charlton tried to respond, however, Marcus Bent's effort from the edge of the box was far too ambitious and the under-worked Jens Lehmann watched the ball fly over.<br><br>Henry nearly had his second of the game from a free-kick, but the impressive Carson made a fine finger-tip save to keep out the France international's drilled set-piece.<br><br>Just before the interval the North Londoners pressed home their advantage from an unlikely source. Hoyte played a neat one-two with Henry before slotting home past the onrushing Carson for his first Premiership strike for Arsenal.<br><br>Arsenal would have added a third through van Persie immediately after the restart when he was played onside by Talal El Karkouri, but Carson was quickly off his line to snuff out the danger.<br><br>Darren Ambrose did keep Lehmann awake with a low drive, although it was a brief rest bite as seconds later Tomas Rosicky went agonisingly close to netting his first Premiership goal when his shot struck the post.<br><br>Henry thought he had his second of the game when he tapped home from Alexander Hleb's unselfish square-ball, but the striker was deemed offside when replays hinted he was level.<br><br>Carson, who was outstanding on the night, then blocked van Persie's touchline shot and was well placed to collect Fabregas' placed shot from Henry's through-ball.<br><br>Henry looked destined to bag his second of the game with a curling shot into the far post after being teed up by Hleb, but Carson made a superb save away to his left to push the effort wide.<br><br>The third finally arrived in the 76th minute when van Persie got in on the act by scoring from the penalty spot after Souleymane Diawara was adjudged to have held Henry's shirt in the box.<br><br>Arsenal did not let up and ruthlessly added a fourth with virtually the last kick of the game through van Persie's clever chip over Carson, who did not deserve to concede four on the night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pards: van Persie was offside</strong><br><br>Charlton Athletic boss Alan Pardew felt Arsenal's penalty should not have been, as Robin van Persie was offside in the build-up to the spot-kick.<br><br>The Dutch forward was standing behind The Addicks' back-line prior to Cesc Fabregas's deflected shot that struck the crossbar, however, Mike Riley still pointed to the spot after van Persie fell to the ground after clashing with Osei Sankofa.<br><br>Sankofa was given his marching orders as a result and Pardew feels van Persie's great starting position made for a harsh outcome.<br><br>"My view at the time was van Persie was offside. The first decision should have been offside. He had an advantage on my full-back. I'm aggrieved by that.<br><br>"It was always going to be tough, but down to ten men we could only give an honest account of ourselves. The four goals was a bit of a shame.<br><br>"We'd threatened a couple of times after the break. I was happy with our honestly. I was pleased with some of the things I saw.<br><br>"(Scott) Carson was fantastic by the way. It could have been more if it wasn't for him. 60 minutes to play at Arsenal at full strength with 10 men was difficult."</div>
