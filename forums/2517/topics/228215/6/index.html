            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wenger: Trotters have style</strong><br><br>Arsene Wenger has insisted there is much more to Bolton Wanderers than a direct style and a robust physical approach ahead of the FA Cup fourth round meeting of the two sides on Sunday, live on Sky Sports 1.<br><br>In many of the recent meetings between the two sides, Bolton have been painted as the Beast to Arsenal's Beauty, but Wenger insists that aesthetic pleasures are not anathema to Sam Allardyce's footballing philosophy.<br><br>The two managers are hardly the closest of friends, having had a number of disagreements over the years, but the Frenchman has offered some generous praise to his rival by stating that The Trotters are unfairly characterised as long-ball merchants - a complaint Allardyce has made many times in the past.<br><br>Bolton have lost only once in their last seven games against The Gunners and Wenger is under no illusions about the size of his team's task at The Emirates Stadium in the third successive year that the two sides have met in the FA Cup.<br><br>"They are always a good character test - but they are a good side as well. People sometimes forget that," said Wenger.<br><br>"Okay, they might have minimal resources, but they have people like Nicolas Anelka and El-Hadji Diouf - they are not minimal resource players.<br><br>"Bolton can play. You cannot say that (Gary) Speed is not a football player. Nor (Ivan) Campo, or (Kevin) Nolan, or Anelka, or Diouf. They are football players - good football players.<br><br>"Chelsea wanted (Tal) Ban Haim - it is not just because he can kick the ball, it is because he is a good football player. That is why they get results."<br><br>The Gunners lost 3-1 at The Reebok Stadium in the Premiership in November, but Wenger is sure that his team have the necessary spirit and character to avoid a repeat result on home turf.<br><br>"We have not had the best of games every time we got up there to Bolton, but we were a bit unlucky this season," he added.<br><br>"They scored two amazing goals and we had the best part of the game.<br><br>"Maybe one or two years ago, we were not ready to face this type of opponent, but the team has improved a lot on this side."</div>

Some people say we do it unfairly and then every time we play them they claim that they are more prepared for us," Davies said in the Daily Star.<br><br>"Yet we beat them fair and square 3-1 here in November.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gunners book Chelsea date</strong><br><br>Arsenal set up a heavyweight Carling Cup final clash with Chelsea but needed extra-time to see off Spurs.<br><br>Mido's late equaliser which cancelled out Emmanuel Adebayor's opener sent the tie into an extra half-an-hour but Jeremie Aliadiere's strike followed by a Pascal Chimbonda own goal put the result beyond doubt.<br><br>In spite of Spurs' endeavours, it was hard to deny the Gunners youngsters deserved their place in Cardiff after dominating both games for long periods.<br><br>But it took the introduction of Czech playmaker Tomas Rosicky to provide the vital ingredient to see off the visitors' challenge.<br><br>England winger Aaron Lennon was left on the bench for Tottenham due to illness with Martin Jol opting for Steed Malbranque and Hossam Ghaly on the flanks.<br><br>But midway through the first half it became apparent confusion over the original teamsheet meant Lennon could not play any part, leaving Spurs with just four substitutes.<br><br>Jol started with Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe in attack, with Egypt striker Mido on the bench.<br><br>Keane had a great opportunity after 10 minutes. The Irish international broke the Arsenal offside trap and latched onto Michael Dawson's long through ball but Almunia was off his line quickly to smother<br><br>Three minutes later, Kolo Toure missed a golden chance to put the hosts ahead. Denilson's shot was fumbled by Paul Robinson into the path of the onrushing Toure but his instinctive prod went wide of the upright.<br><br>Adebayor and Jeremie Aliadiere both missed the target when well placed as Arsenal looked to gain the upper hand.<br><br>At the other end, Malbranque met Ghaly's cross with a firm header that skipped off the turf but narrowly wide of Almunia's right-hand post.<br><br>There was an early flashpoint as the second half got underway. Ghaly and Abou Diaby went down in a heap in the penalty area and scuffled as they got to their feet. A number of players ran in to intervene before referee Alan Whiley pulled out yellow cards for both the Spurs winger and the Gunners midfielder.<br><br>As the game continued, Walcott appeared the hosts' best outlet but time and again the teenager failed to take the right option when well placed.<br><br>And with 62 minutes gone, the 17-year-old was replaced by Rosicky with Arsene Wenger looking for a bit more quality in the final third.<br><br>Before Walcott had left the pitch, the Gunners were forced into another change when defender Armand Traore went down injured, Gael Clichy taking his place at left-back.<br><br>The addition of the Czech international and the French youngster gave Wenger's men fresh impetus. Denilson, a threat throughout, cut in from the left and fired a shot into the side-netting while Rosicky created mayhem on the opposite flank, forcing Chimbonda to bring him down at the expense of a yellow card.<br><br>It was no surprise that Rosicky was involved in the opening goal. His powerful shot was parried by Robinson but the Spurs defence failed to clear their lines. The ball broke again for the Czech midfielder who played in Adebayor to slot past the visting keeper with ease.<br><br>As Adebayor celebrated with Thierry Henry, who was not even in the squad for the game, Arsenal brought on Cesc Fabregas to try and seal the tie. The visitors responded and replaced Malbranque and Ghaly with Mido and Tom Huddlestone.<br><br>And just as Rosicky's introduction had an immediate impact, so did the appearance of the Egyptian target man. Denilson commited a foul out on the left and Mido rose to nod home Jermaine Jenas' perfect free-kick.<br><br>Mido almost sent Spurs to the final in injury time but his left foot shot curled agonisingly wide of Almunia's right-hand post.<br><br>Deep into added time, Denilson nearly sent Arsenal to Cardiff only to be denied by Robinson who also reacted quickly to parry Toure's effort.<br><br>With Spurs needing to score in extra-time to have any chance of progressing to the final, the first period saw the hosts continue to dominate possession.<br><br>And right at the end of the first 15 minutes, Spurs substitute Ricardo Rocha made a hash of an attempted clearance, allowing Aliadiere to fire into the roof of the net to send the Gunners to Cardiff.<br><br>The inspirational Rosicky put the tie beyond doubt with eight minutes of added time remaining, weaving his magic in the Spurs penalty area before firing against a post only to see the rebound deflect off Chimbonda and just over the line.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ten-man Gunners grab point</strong><br><br>Ten-man Arsenal came from behind to claim a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough at The Riverside.<br><br>After a fairly lifeless opening hour the game came to life on the hour when Boro won a penalty through Yakubu Aiyegbeni. Philippe Senderos was also sent off for tripping the Nigerian, who dispatched the spot-kick with great aplomb.<br><br>Despite being a man down Arsenal always looked capable of getting something from the game and indeed they did as a swift counter-attack from one back to the other saw Thierry Henry fire home to secure a point.<br><br>Middlesbrough had began the game brightly with Stewart Downing giving Justin Hoyte a number of problems on the left.<br><br>The only real chance, though, to come from Downing in the opening ten minutes was when Lee Cattermole but his header was well defended by Gael Clichy at the back post.<br><br>Arsenal were soon into their stride and the passing flowing football followed, but like Boro before them the chances were hard to come by.<br><br>Kolo Toure almost got on the end of a Thierry Henry free kick before Tomas Rosicky was unlucky to see his sliced effort fly just wide of the post.<br><br>The best move of the half saw Arsenal string a host of passes together before Henry picked up the ball on the edge of the box - but the Frenchman's archetypal curler into the corner could only find Brad Jones.<br><br>Like with the first half Boro were by far the brighter, with James Morrison - a half time replacement for the injured Cattermole - given extra width on the right.<br><br>Just minutes in and Toure was fortunate to avoid punishment as he handled the ball as Viduka could have been clear - but the Australian still got the ball only to volley wide from the edge of the box.<br><br>On the hour and the game erupted into life as Boro took the lead. A long ball from the back saw Viduka beat Toure in the air to flick the ball into the path of Yakubu - who raced into the box but went down under the challenge of Senderos.<br><br>Mike Riley had little hesitation in pointing to the spot and issuing Senderos with his second red card of the season. Yakubu slotted home from 12 yards in trademark fashion, sending Jens Lehmann - who was booked for his protests - the wrong way.<br><br>Arsenal immediately reorganised with Gilberto dropping to centre-half, but Boro were very much in the ascendancy.<br><br>Julio Arca was put through by Morrison but he dallied in the box and the chance was wasted, then Downing was denied by a good challenge from Hoyte as Boateng's cross found him on the edge of the six-yard box.<br><br>Lehmann was then at the heart of Arsenal's reply. He firstly pulled of a world-class save from Viduka as the Australian turned wonderfully on the edge of the box. From the corner the German rushed to the edge of the box - only just making sure he stayed inside.<br><br>The ball was fed out wide before eventually it fell for Henry in the box and in a sweeping move he fired into the corner leaving Jones helpless.<br><br>Both sides had chances to win with Viduka and Tomas Rosicky going close, but in the end it was a point each - a result which does neither any huge favours.</div>
