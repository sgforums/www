However, Steve Finnan and Steven Gerrard were unwilling to close him down and Rosicky coolly fired a shot past Dudek into the bottom left corner.<br><br>Liverpool came out much more positively after half-time, clearly determined not to relinquish their trophy without a fight.<br><br>Robin van Persie drew one good save out of Dudek from a tight angle, but afterwards it was one-way traffic as Liverpool poured forward.<br><br>The Reds peppered the Arsenal box with crosses, and their pressure was rewarded after 70 minutes when Peter Crouch rose highest to meet Pennant's corner and Kuyt cleverly headed home from six yards.<br><br>Fabio Aurelio almost levelled moments later as he volleyed Gerrard's delightful ball just wide, and it seemed only a matter of time until the equaliser would arrive.<br><br>Henry, however, had other ideas and restored Arsenal's two-goal cushion with a magical solo goal after 84 minutes.<br><br>Receiving possession in the centre circle, Henry sprayed the ball out to the left wing and set off in chase himself. Shrugging off Jamie Carragher, he charged into the area, sprinted past Daniel Agger, and stroked home from 10 yards.<br><br>Liverpool tried their utmost in the closing stages but their belief had gone and Arsenal held on to book their place in the fourth round.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Clichy calls for attitude change</strong><br><br>Gael Clichy says Arsenal need to show more humility against the weaker sides in the Premiership if The Gunners are to prove they are on a par with Chelsea and Manchester United.<br><br>Whilst Arsenal have enjoyed a productive season against their rivals at the top end of the table, a succession of disappointing results against the traditionally weaker sides has seen them fall 15 points off the title pace set by Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>The French left-back has pinpointed the problem as being Arsenal's attitude, with the North London side needing to show more respect to sides such as Sheffield United and battle for the win according to Clichy.<br><br>"We drew at Chelsea without key players, won at Old Trafford, beat Tottenham and Liverpool," Clichy explained in The Guardian.<br><br>"That showed everyone we have the quality. Of course we are far behind them [in points] but in terms of quality and football I think we are at the same level.<br><br>"The problem is we did well against all the big teams but maybe, like the boss says, we need to have humility when we play the smaller teams because even smaller teams near the bottom can hurt you bad. That's what has happened with us. We have drawn so many games at home.<br><br>"I think we are capable of great things.<br><br>"Last season it was a great thing to get to the Champions League final. That showed we can play football and get some great results but in England the football is different.<br><br>"It's a battle, a fight all through the game and we need to be capable of battling against those type of teams.<br><br>"Now everyone is saying: 'We go to Arsenal, play 10 at the back and just kick them and wait for them to make a mistake.' We have to show them that, if you do that, you will pay for it."<br><br>Clichy also revealed that he would have considered leaving North London had Ashley Cole not opened up a vacancy at left-back by joining Chelsea.<br><br>"Maybe I would have asked to leave or to go on loan but I'm happy for me and for him as well because he is at a good club and is a good guy," Clichy added.<br><br>"It's a big opportunity for me. My objective is to be the best and to be remembered in football, so of course I was happy Ashley left."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Baptista revels in Arsenal's extravaganza<br>By Henry Winter<br>Last Updated: 12:24am GMT 10/01/2007<br><br>Match details<br><br>Liverpool 3 Arsenal 6<br><br>In a cup-tie of unbelievable drama at Anfield last night, Arsenal paraded the beauty and the Beast of their game, a succession of breath-taking attacks, spiced by four goals from Julio 'The Beast" Baptista, sweeping them into a Carling Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur.<br>Jubilant: Baptista scored with each of his four efforts on goal<br><br>For Liverpool, hampered by Rafa Benitez's inexplicable team selection, this was a grim night, bringing their heaviest home defeat since 1930.<br><br>The extraordinary half-time scoreline of 4-1 to Arsenal reflected that Wenger's reserves were so much more talented than Benitez's B-team, who were embarrassed by the Londoners' greater athleticism, technique and pace. Given the immense pressure on Benitez to deliver a trophy, it was bizarre to behold his inexperienced selection, particularly after Saturday's FA Cup defeat to Arsenal.<br><br>Wenger could afford to take a gamble by resting star names. Such was the callow youth of the visiting party it felt like some had only just been born when the original tie was fogged off. With Alexandre Song outstanding in the centre and Baptista and Jeremie Aliadiere terrific in attack, Arsenal's outfield boasted an average age of 20 years 11 months.<br><br>Robbie Fowler was immediately involved, showing some neat touches, but the game was held up for six minutes when Mark Gonzalez slid in on Theo Walcott, suffered a six-inch laceration and severe bruising of his right tibia. The Chilean winger managed a couple of steps but then crumpled to the ground, and was carried away on a stretcher. Fortunately, initial fears of a break proved unfounded.<br>advertisement<br><br>Luis Garcia darted on and for a while Benitez's much-changed team attacked with promise. Twice Liverpool would have broken through Arsenal's defence but for the alertness of the outstanding Kolo Toure, who brilliantly intercepted incoming danger. Dawns do not come much falser.<br><br>Then Arsenal launched a devastating, 27th-minute counter-attack, the ball swept over the top of Liverpool's defence by Toure. Aliadiere, making a darting diagonal, was off and running, played onside by Sami Hyypia, bringing the ball down and racing at Jerzy Dudek. The Polish keeper stopped the Frenchman's first attempt, but Aliadiere finished well, stroking the ball in with his left foot.<br><br>Liverpool briefly responded well, equalising just after the half-hour mark. When Fowler was brought down by Song, Fabio Aurelio took responsibility. His free-kick brought a sprawling save from Manuel Almunia, who pushed the ball out to his right. Gonzalez's replacement, Garcia, was first to re-act, driving the ball across for Fowler to finish in style, with a near-post flick that gave Almunia no chance. The artful poacher's 31st League Cup goal was also the first Arsenal have conceded in this season's competition.<br><br>Parity prevailed for only eight minutes. Dudek endured a period plucked from a keeper's nightmares, Arsenal rattling in three quick goals in front of an initially disbelieving, quickly angered Kop. Baptista fell far too easily for local tastes when challenged by Gabriel Paletta, and he soon added insult to iniquity.<br><br>From 25 yards out, the muscular Brazilian sent a magnificent free-kick dipping over the wall and in. While there was much to admire in Baptista's delivery, Dudek was badly at fault, totally flat-footed, eventually watching the ball fly past him and in.<br><br>The clouds darkened for Dudek and Liverpool. When Cesc Fabregas curled over a corner, everyone expected Dudek to come and claim, but he faltered and the ball eventually rebounded in off Song: 3-1. The first-half agony had not finished. When Baptista collected up possession down the inside-left channel, Aliadiere made his move. He should have been flagged offside but his swift break deceived the linesman, and Liverpool were always struggling after that. Aliadiere cut the ball back and Baptista stroked Arsenal further clear: 4-1.<br><br>The pain continued after the break. Although Dudek brilliantly saved Baptista's penalty after Hyypia had brought down Aliadiere, Arsenal's No 9 soon had his hat-trick. Arsenal were targeting the space behind Liverpool's young right-back, Lee Peltier.<br><br>Aliadiere sprinted down the flank, cut inside and drilled a superb ball across Liverpool's box that Steven Gerrard failed to cut out. Baptista controlled and despatched a 20-yard shot past Dudek: 5-1.<br><br>In terms of a comeback, Liverpool required Istanbul and snookers. Gerrard reduced the deficit with a thunderous volley, latching on to Paletta's knockdown to make it 5-2.<br><br>Liverpool refused to give up. Gerrard rattled the crossbar, and then, thrillingly, they made it 5-3 when Hyypia headed in Paletta's cross. But back came Arsenal and Baptista made it a tennis score: 6-3.<br><br><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/01/10/sfgliv10.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/01/10/sfgliv10.xml</a></div>
