I believed we had a great chance to win the game although of course I did not expect us to score six goals. I felt pleased with the way we tackled the game and our problems on the pitch, with our fluency and the way we kept calm when Liverpool came back to 1-1. We just continued to go forward and play."<br><br><strong>on Arsenal's style of play throughout the Club...</strong><br>"We feel these boys work very hard to integrate what we want them to do and they got it out tonight. Sometimes the most difficult thing is not to be talented but to transfer it into competitive games. They did that tonight, they played the way we want to play football but also showed great mental strength."<br><br><strong>on a promising future...</strong><br>"It is a very satisfying night. I feel there is a continuity there inside the club. We feel we have worked very, very hard and we feel the future of the club is very promising. If we keep the players together and the spirit is right there is a chance for the future."<br><br><strong>on the depth of his squad...</strong><br>"We changed nine players from Saturday and we still have some players out like Gallas, Ljungberg and Adebayor who is coming back. That is why I said for a long time that I wouldn't buy anyone."<br><br><strong>on the Liverpool line-up...</strong><br>"At the start I was surprised because the last time we came here in the Carling Cup they had a normal side. But maybe because the game has been postponed on the back of a heavy schedule they decided to rest players. As you saw with [the injuries to] Garcia and Gonzalez, it is a gamble to play them in every game."<br><strong><br>on his selection dilemma...</strong>"I always have the same problem because we have 20 players who are all top quality. On one side you cannot make a mistake because everyone is good but on the other hand all the players who are not picked feel they deserve a chance to play. When you are the manager you give a chance to every player so you don't always stick to the same team. They benefit from the fact you rotate a little bit."<br><br>[ Tuesday, January 09, 2007]<br><br></div>

"He doesn't play enough but I persisted with him for the last month as I have seen signs in training that he has really made a big step forward.<br><br>"He made an outstanding performance (against Liverpool) and I am not surprised as he puts in that kind of performance in training.<br><br>"He has not yet transferred that into the Premier League, but he did it tonight."<br><br>Wenger also has Thierry Henry, Robin van Persie, Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott as attacking options and he is aware that he may find it tough to appease Aliadiere.<br><br>"I don't want to sell him," stressed Wenger.

You make room for young players and then it is difficult to leave them out again. I feel we have too many players in that position now.<br><br>"Lauren is free to talk to anyone because it is the end of his contract but frankly I don't know if he has spoken to West Ham.<br><br>"He doesn't have to inform me if he wants to speak to anyone."<br><br>Wenger has also stated that whilst Sebastian Larsson is likely to be sold to Birmingham, both Fabrice Muamba and Nicklas Bendtner will be returning to Arsenal at the end of their loan deals.</div>
