To overcome that takes a lot of strength within yourself," Campbell told the Mirror.<br><br>"Whether people always realise that or appreciate it is another thing.

I want to win, I want to play good football.

For any professional footballer who has a 20-year career it's not always going to be roses, is it?" added Campbell.<br><br>"You do sometimes go through difficult times. It can happen in any industry. I understand it doesn't happen so publicly for them but throughout my period in football I've shown that kind of inner strength.<br><br>"When you have that kind of experience that I did, you've got to re-evaluate everything around you. You look at what you are doing in your life and realise that some things have got to go and other things have got to stay.<br><br>"It's not about showing other people that I can still do it, that I haven't lost what made me a player.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Henry: Victory was special</strong><br><br>Thierry Henry could hardly contain his glee after netting a fine headed winner against Manchester United at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.<br><br>Arsenal's captain was on the periphery of much of the action in a pulsating capital contest but his one major contribution proved to be vital, as he scored Arsenal's winner three minutes into injury time.<br><br>After Wayne Rooney had broken the deadlock early in the second half, with a rare header of his own, there seemed only likely to be one winner but Arsene Wenger's side dug deep and ground out a result which opens up the title race.<br><br>Substitute Robin Van Persie, whose afternoon was later ruined in breaking his fifth metatarsal, grabbed Arsenal's equaliser eight minutes from time before Henry, not for the first time, stole all the plaudits with a brilliant winner.<br><br>The Frenchman admits he is not used to scoring with his head but he was not complaining, after what proved to be the most dramatic of conclusions to a fascinating contest.<br><br>"I scored with my head so it must have been pretty special!" he told Sky Sports.<br><br>"I wanted to make sure to at least make it difficult for Edwin (van der Sar) and I got the ball in the back of the net.<br><br>"It can't be better against Manchester United than to be 1-0 down and come back right at the end and win the game.<br><br>"A win against Manchester United is always special but especially so with the way we did it today.<br><br>"Doing the double over them is always a pleasure."</div>
