The pace was not too high and we controlled the game.<br><br>"He is 100 percent but not 100 percent match fit. He is in a good frame of mind and has come back hungry and fresh.<br><br>"If you look across Europe most of the players that played late in the World Cup have had problems.<br><br>"I am convinced you will see a great Thierry Henry from now until May."<br><br>Wenger believes the season is still very much alive for Arsenal despite being 15 points off the pace in the Premiership title race, as his side are still involved in three other competitions.<br><br>"Maybe we are very far from the championship but we want to do as well as we can," he explained.<br><br>"We are in the UEFA Champions League and play in the FA Cup against Liverpool on Saturday. We are also in the quarter-finals of the Carling Cup.<br><br>"A good Thierry Henry can make a difference in the big games.<br><br>"We have a good spirit in the camp and the team is very united."</div>

The only mistake I made was to carry on playing with the injury," said Henry.<br><br>"Sometimes you need to stop. I do not miss a lot of games, that is why it was difficult to take.<br><br>"When you have been out for a relatively long time, you never know how you are going to be. But, surprisingly, I was feeling fresh.<br><br>"When I am not playing as I can and all is not well with my body it shows straight away, because I do not come and take the ball and have a go at defenders.<br><br>"I did get hammered about the way I was playing, but it got to the stage where it was stupid to play with it.<br><br>"I had to stop and that is what I did.<br><br>"You could see straight away that when I am fresh, my legs are better."</div>
