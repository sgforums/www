            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool have announced the signing of Ajax starlet Jordy Brouwer.<br><br>Brouwer has come through the ranks at Ajax's famed academy and he is highly-regarded at the Dutch club.<br><br>Liverpool have moved to snap up the striker as he had not signed professional terms with Ajax.<br><br>Brouwer is Liverpool's third new arrival of the January transfer window following the signings of Daniele Padelli and Emiliano Insua.<br><br>Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry believes Brouwer will prove to be a good acquisition for the club.<br><br>"We have made a good signing for the future in Jordy," said Parry.<br><br>"He has had a youth contract at Ajax, but has opted to build his career at Liverpool.<br><br>"We have been monitoring his progress and look forward to developing his potential at Anfield."<br><br>Meanwhile, Parry has admitted he is still bemused as to why Lucas Neill snubbed a move to Anfield in favour of a switch to West Ham.<br><br>Neill completed his move to West Ham on Tuesday with reports suggesting The Hammers offered the Australian a more lucrative contract to lure him to Upton Park.<br><br>The former Blackburn star has denied claims he moved for the money and suggested Liverpool's interest in him was not as strong as West Ham's.<br><br>Parry admitted he was surprised Neill rejected Liverpool's overtures and he expects Reds fans to be shocked by Neill's decision.<br><br>"The decision by Lucas Neill not to accept our terms after we agreed a fee with Blackburn will bemuse many fans," Parry told the club's official magazine.<br><br>"Players make their decisions and while you are sometimes surprised, you have to move on to the next one.<br><br>"Neill had the choice between Liverpool and West Ham, we were offering him the opportunity of Champions League football.<br><br>"What we want are players with an instinctive desire to play for Liverpool. We want people with a real passion to come here and help us win trophies.<br><br>"Clearly, there will always be a chance for players to earn well if they do well.<br><br>"However, at the end of the day it is up to the individual to decide what is best for his career.<br><br>"From our side, we never want to be in a position where someone is only coming here for the money. A player has to be driven by something more than that.<br><br>"Because of the stature, history and ambition of Liverpool, there should be no need for us to sell the merits of this club.<br><br>"It's Neill's decision and it's his future. It has happened before and it will happen again."</div>
