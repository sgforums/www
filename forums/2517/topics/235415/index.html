            <div class='col-md body'>Paul Jewell admits he is hurt by Wigan's current Premiership struggles, but has asked for the club's plight to be put into perspective.<br><br>The Latics have lost a club record eight straight league games and it is almost two months since their last victory, a 2-0 win away at West Ham.<br><br>Wigan find themselves in a relegation battle at the bottom of the Premiership as a result of their disastrous recent run.<br><br>And Jewell is feeling the pain just as much as any of the Wigan supporters.<br><br>"It's very difficult to maintain a sense of perspective and your sense of humour," Jewell said.<br><br>"But my job means everything to me. Outside of my family, it is the most important thing in my life.<br><br>"People seem to think you just take training and do the press, but this job never leaves you, and when you are not doing well then it hurts, and this is hurting me, it really is.<br><br>"Clearly this is a tough time for us, but this is a club that is arguably still punching above its weight, and you have to put that into perspective.<br><br>"If you had said to any Wigan fan a few years ago we would be fighting relegation in our second season in the Premiership, they would have been very happy with that.<br><br>"So in taking this club from the lower leagues into the Premiership and into a cup final, I think I'm entitled to a rocky spell."<br><br>Jewell's job at The JJB Stadium appears to be safe for some time yet after chairman Dave Whelan stated the former Sheffield Wednesday boss would not be sacked even if the club was relegated.<br><br>"If the chairman sacks me, he sacks me. I'm not frightened of it. I've had the sack before," Jewell added.<br><br>"If I get sacked here - and I don't think I will be because he has told me I won't - then everyone should look over their shoulder."</div>
