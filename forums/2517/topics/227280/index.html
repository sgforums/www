            <div class='col-md body'>A superb second half display from Manchester United helped them record a comfortable 3-0 victory over Aston Villa.<br><br>Two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a stunner from Paul Scholes ensures Sir Alex Ferguson's side top the Premiership table at Christmas.<br><br>After a fairly disappointing first half, Ronaldo opened the scoring with an excellent finish just before the hour mark.<br><br>Scholes scored a stunning second six minutes later with a volley from 30 yards and Ronaldo added a third with five minutes remaining.<br><br>Villa have now lost three straight league games at Villa Park after starting the season going seven unbeaten at home.<br><br>Gary Cahill was proving an immovable object in the early stages of the game as he twice blocked goal-bound efforts from Park Ji-sung and Ronaldo.<br><br>Villa were denied the opener by Edwin Van der Sar's post as United failed to deal with a Gareth Barry free-kick and as the ball came down from the skies, Craig Gardner beat two other Villa players but his header came back off the woodwork.<br><br>After their narrow escape, United began to come into the game as an attacking force and Park should have done better than side-foot wide from a good position after Gary Neville's smart pull-back.<br><br>Defenders were looking the most likely to open the scoring for United but Nemanja Vidic flicked Ryan Giggs' free-kick over the bar and Patrice Evra forced a smart low stop from Gabor Kiraly after being played in by Ronaldo's clever back heel.<br><br>Giggs was providing teasing deliveries at every opportunity with Ronaldo the latest beneficiary, but his header was straight at Kiraly.<br><br>Ronaldo was in the thick of the action as he created a glorious opportunity with his pace and trickery but Darren Fletcher could not take the chance as he steered the ball past the far post from an inviting position.<br><br>The Portuguese winger took it upon himself to try and fire United in front following a Giggs break but after beating Aaron Hughes, Ronaldo dragged his shot across the face of Villa's goal.<br><br>Kiraly had to be alert to repel Fletcher's early strike from the edge of the area and his side finished the half the stronger.<br><br>An excellent Villa move culminated in Gabriel Agbonlahor's lay-off for Gardner 20 yards out, but the midfielder fired high and wide of Van der Sar's goal.<br><br>Villa started the second half brightly with Stilian Petrov shooting wide from the edge of the area before two sniffs at goal for Agbonlahor.<br><br>Van der Sar had to rush out of goal quickly to clear the ball from the feet of the pacey striker, who narrowly failed to make contact on a Barry cross soon after.<br><br>Ronaldo finally broke the deadlock just before the hour mark with an individual effort that began inside his own half.<br><br>The dazzling winger picked up the ball and ran at Villa's backtracking defence but after seeing his initial shot blocked, he made no mistake with his follow up, unleashing an unstoppable shot that left Kiraly with no chance.<br><br>Villa were forced to push more men forward but the best they could muster was a Gavin McCann shot that sailed well wide from range.<br><br>United took advantage of the gaps at the back and Giggs saw a shot diverted away after Ronaldo's pull back.<br><br>From the resulting corner, Scholes added another candidate for goal of the season with a stunning volley from 30 yards out.<br><br>McCann looked to have cleared the danger with his head but the ball fell kindly for the former England international midfielder who rocketed his shot past Kiraly and in off the underside of the crossbar.<br><br>Ferguson introduced Wayne Rooney soon after United's second and he made an instant impact as he twice created great chances for Ronaldo, who was denied first by Kiraly and then by the assistant referee's flag.<br><br>However, Ronaldo would not be kept out again as United took advantage of Villa's almost non-existent defence to score a third on the break.<br><br>Giggs, Rooney and Neville were all involved in the quick break from their own area before the latter laid the ball on a plate for Ronaldo to tap in at the back post with Kiraly stranded.</div>
