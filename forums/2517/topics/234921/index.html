            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool have been given permission by Fifa to sign West Ham outcast Javier Mascherano.<br><br>A deal between Liverpool and West Ham to take Mascherano to Anfield had been agreed, but the move was being upheld by Fifa's transfer regulations<br><br>The Reds petitioned the game's governing body to sign Mascherano even though the Argentine has already played for two clubs in the past 12 months.<br><br>Fifa rules forbid any player turning out for more than two clubs over a one-year period between 1st July and 30th June the following year.<br><br>However, Liverpool claimed that the player should be allowed to move on as he does not figure in West Ham's plans and Fifa have granted them special dispensation to push through a deal for the former River Plate ace.<br><br>A statement from Fifa read: "After due consideration of all aspects, the Fifa single judge ruled that 'upon registration for Liverpool FC during the present registration period, the player Javier Mascherano is eligible to play in official matches with the said club with immediate effect'."<br><br>"Particular emphasis was given to the safeguard of the sporting integrity and the crucial element of overlapping sports seasons between associations, notably in cases in which a sports season starts prior and ends beyond July 1.<br><br>"Yet, the single judge made it clear that such permission can only be granted under very restrictive preconditions, such as they exist in the case at stake, yet never occurred in a case that was submitted to the attention of the competent deciding bodies at an earlier stage.<br><br>"In particular, he emphasised that a series of elements related, on the one hand, to the duration and the positioning of the relevant sports seasons as well as to the respect of the registration periods and, on the other hand, to the duration and respect of the employment contracts concerned, need to be cumulatively met."<br><br>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez has been determined to sign Mascherano and he is now set to finalise a move for the defensive midfielder before the close of the transfer window.</div>
