            <div class='col-md body'>Forget the nine-point chasm, the seven-point gap... the only lead Gary Neville was concerned about on Sunday night was the one United lost to Arsenal in the closing minutes at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>The Reds skipper insists his bitter disappointment was only about the defeat and its almost inexplicable manner, rather than the wider implications it might have had on the title race.<br><br>"The hardest thing to take is the fact we've lost the game when we were 1-0 up at Arsenal and playing well," Gary told MUTV.<br><br>"Obviously the nine-point lead would have come with it (winning) but we're not even thinking about that. We're only thinking about our own performance. The fact that we're still six points clear (of Chelsea) is no consolation to us.<br><br>"We've lost games before where we've had to hold our hands up and say the other team deserved to win. But I don't think this was fair. We deserved at least a draw.<br><br>"We put in a good performance for 85 minutes. We created the better chances in the first half, then we got the goal and things were going perfectly for us.<br><br>"Arsenal started playing a lot of long balls towards the end which isn't like them, so at that point we were happy.<br><br>"We defended most of that well until they got a couple of crosses in, which we didn't defend, and we conceded two goals. It was a complete kick in the teeth for us."</div>
