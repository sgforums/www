            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho has paid tribute to Paul Ince ahead of Chelsea's FA Cup clash against Macclesfield.<br><br>Macclesfield have enjoyed a new lease of life since Ince took charge in October, and Mourinho feels his management style mirrors the way he used to play for Manchester United and England.<br><br>"I have just shaken his hand a couple of times but when you remember him as a player, you can feel his character and personality," hailed Mourinho.<br><br>"So it doesn't surprise me that he brings that type of personality to his new job. He is a leader, he is a fighter. They are a team with confidence after four victories in a row.<br><br>"As a player he was afraid of nothing, so I can guess he will not be afraid for his team to play at Stamford Bridge."<br><br>Mourinho is relieved to see his side take a break from Premiership action following a poor Christmas period, but admits he will not be able to rest many players against Macclesfield.<br><br>"We are going to play with the best team we have, but the players we have are the only players in condition to play," he said.<br><br>"I am happy it is the FA Cup and Macclesfield and not the Premier League."<br><br>Ashley Cole also admitted that Chelsea had found it hard to cope with their injury crisis in recent weeks, but is hoping the FA Cup will provide them with a timely boost.<br><br>"We had a lot of games and it was tough on the lads over Christmas, with the injuries and that," he explained.<br><br>"Hopefully we can beat Macclesfield and start winning games again.<br><br>"I think there will be a few players rested so it will be a chance for fringe players to come in and impress. But it will be a tough game.<br><br>"The FA Cup means everything to me and the rest of the players. We know how important it is to win trophies and the FA Cup is a special one to win."</div>
