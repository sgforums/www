            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ten-man Gunners stun Rovers</strong><br><br>Arsenal overcame the early dismissal of Gilberto to secure an impressive 2-0 victory over in-form Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.<br><br>Rovers' only defeat in their last seven games came at the Emirates in December and Arsenal made it a double over Mark Hughes' men in the return encounter.<br><br>Things looked bleak for the London visitors when Gilberto was dismissed for kicking Robbie Savage, but goals from Kolo Toure and Thierry Henry sealed a fine away success.<br><br>Rovers had a great chance to open the scoring but Matt Derbyshire's header from Morten Gamst Pedersen's inswinging corner fizzed just wide of Jens Lehmann's upright.<br><br>The visitors found themselves a man down shortly after when Gilberto took exception to Savage's double challenge and kicked out at the Welsh firebrand.<br><br>Referee Rob Styles took a dim view of the Brazilian's reaction and somewhat harshly dismissed the Samba star while also giving Savage a booking.<br><br>Although not at their free-flowing best Rovers carved out the next chance in the game, but Lehmann was on hand to tip over Pedersen's shot from the edge of the box.<br><br>Lucas Neill nearly made it ten aside when he hauled down Robin van Persie, but Styles deemed Rovers to have enough cover - ensuring Neill was not the last defender.<br><br>However, Arsenal made the most of the resulting free-kick and Henry's delightful chip into the box was thundered home in off the near post by a determined Toure.<br><br>Toure was the only one attacking the ball, however, the accuracy to send the ball in off the near post left Brad Friedel stranded in the home goal.<br><br>Arsenal nearly added a second from a free-kick, but after van Persie was blocked on the edge of the box his ensuing set-piece was straight at the American shot-stopper.<br><br>Rovers boss Mark Hughes unsurprisingly made a change at the break after bringing on experienced schemer Tugay for the ineffective Aaron Mokoena.<br><br>Hughes also brought on Shabani Nonda for Andre Ooijer to bolster his attacking options, although the Congolese striker fluffed a chance from Gamst Pedersen's teasing cross.<br><br>The missed effort proved the turning point as it was all Arsenal for the remainder of the contest. Henry sent a right-footed curler just wide of Friedel's far post, but made no mistake shortly after.<br><br>The Gunners captain carried the ball from the half-way line before playing a neat one-two with Cesc Fabregas before lashing a deft shot that Friedel could only parry in off the cross bar.<br><br>He nearly netted a quick-fire brace, but he proved he is human after all and somehow fired over after initially controlling Tomas Rosicky's right-wing cross.<br><br>Despite playing most of the match a man light Arsene Wenger's side strolled home to regain fourth spot and keep in touch with the leading trio.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Blues too strong for Latics</strong><br><br>Chelsea got back to winning ways in the Premiership with a 4-0 victory over Wigan at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Goals from Frank Lampard, Arjen Robben, Didier Drogba and a Chris Kirkland own goal were enough to give Jose Mourinho's men all three points and keep them six points behind leaders Manchester United.<br><br>For Wigan it was their sixth successive Premiership defeat and the loss will have them nervously looking over their shoulders.<br><br>After a quiet start Chelsea fashioned the first opportunity of the game on 11 minutes when Arjen Robben sent Wayne Bridge clear down the left and he crossed towards Didier Drogba who flashed his left-footed shot over the crossbar.<br><br>Chelsea broke the deadlock two minutes later with Lampard scoring direct from a free-kick.<br><br>There looked very little danger on when Lampard curled his free-kick goalwards from fully 40 yards out, but the ball flew into the net past the flat-footed Kirkland.<br><br>Leighton Baines came to Wigan's rescue on 16 minutes when he produced a vital tackle to prevent Salomon Kalou getting on the end of Drogba's pass inside the box.<br><br>Chelsea continued to call the tune as Wigan struggled to mount any serious attacks and Paulo Ferreira tried his luck on the half hour with a shot from the edge of the area which flew wildly off target.<br><br>The home side went close to doubling their lead on 32 minutes when Lampard worked a clever free-kick on the edge of the box with Drogba to allow the midfielder a shot on goal, but Kirkland got down well to turn Lampard's strike round the post.<br><br>Two minutes later Robben had a half chance when the ball dropped to him on the edge of the area, but the Dutchman dragged his half volley well wide of the target.<br><br>Lampard tried his luck from another free-kick two minutes before the break, but his effort flew over the crossbar.<br><br>Wigan created an opening right on the stroke of half-time with Fitz Hall heading the ball down to Lee McCulloch who saw his shot deflected over the top.<br><br>Chelsea had the first chance of the second half with Michael Ballack curling a free-kick from the edge of the box over the top.<br><br>The lively Robben wasted a good opening on 57 minutes when he shot straight at Kirkland when well placed.<br><br>Chelsea were gifted a second goal on 63 minutes when a terrible backpass from Kristofer Haestad sent Robben clear on goal and the Dutchman coolly rounded Kirkland before tapping the ball into the empty net.<br><br>Kirkland kept Wigan in the contest on 68 minutes when he tipped Robben's curling shot round the post after the Dutchman had been teed up invitingly by Kalou.<br><br>Chelsea added a third on 70 minutes with an unfortunate own goal from Kirkland.<br><br>Robben burst into the box past Kevin Kilbane and in trying to cut out his cross Kirkland deflected the ball into his own net with his arm.<br><br>Josip Skoko had a rare chance for Wigan in the closing stages with a left-footed shot from long-range which flew well wide of the target.<br><br>Drogba completed the rout in the final minute when he headed substitute John Obi Mikel's superb cross into the top corner to seal a good day for the reigning champions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>United overwhelm Villa</strong><br><br>Manchester United maintained their lead over Chelsea with a comfortable 3-1 win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford.<br><br>United were made to work hard to beat the same side in the FA Cup last week, but on this occasion Villa failed to pack any sort of punch as they were clinically exposed.<br><br>Park Ji-Sung, Michael Carrick and Cristiano Ronaldo handed Sir Alex Ferguson's side a comfortable advantage at the break and although Gabriel Agbonlahor cut into the lead, the home side were not hard pressed to maintain their six-point lead at the top.<br><br>Villa, in contrast, have not won a game since 11th November and the drop zone is looming large in the mirror.<br><br>Henrik Larsson made an immediate impact against Villa last week and he came close to repeating the trick on five minutes.<br><br>Gary Neville delivered a delicious ball from the right which the Swedish forward attacked with relish. He arched his neck and directed a header towards the bottom corner, but the returning Thomas Sorensen flung himself to his right to push the effort to safety.<br><br>The home side continued to call the tune and a clever clipped pass from Paul Scholes found Larsson but he tumbled under pressure and Sorensen was able to gather Ronaldo's follow-up effort.<br><br>United's pressure was relentless and the opener came on 11 minutes, but the goal owed as much to sorry Villa defending as it did to slick play from The Red Devils.<br><br>Gary Cahill should have averted the danger following a scramble in the box, but he made a complete mess of his clearance and the ball fell invitingly for Park to slam home.<br><br>The United fans had barely had time to return to their seats when Park transformed from scorer to creator for the second.<br><br>Carrick broke up play in the middle of the field, played the ball out wide to Park who cut inside before laying the ball into the path of Carrick who slotted beyond Sorensen for his first goal in United colours.<br><br>Villa were resembling a punch-drunk boxer and Larsson and Scholes went close to making it three, while it took the visitors 26 minutes to call Edwin van der Sar into action - the keeper making a comfortable save from Agbonlahor.<br><br>United were not at their best, they did not have to be in truth, but they made it three on 35 minutes and Villa were again contributors to their own downfall.<br><br>Gavin McCann gave away possession in sloppy fashion, the ball fell to Carrick and he picked out Ronaldo at the far post and he headed home with ease.<br><br>Wayne Rooney has cut a frustrated figure in front of goal in the last month and he should have done better moments before the break as, after making a mug of Cahill on the edge of the box, he dragged his shot well wide of goal.<br><br>Scholes' renaissance this term has been one of the main reasons behind their fine play and he came close to adding a fourth when making a typical late run into the box and heading into the hands of Sorensen.<br><br>Milan Baros toiled away up front in the first half and his willing running was rewarded on 52 minutes as he held off Nemanja Vidic down the right and crossed for Agbonlahor to tap home from all of a yard out.<br><br>United did not seem fazed by conceding and another glorious pass from Scholes presented Rooney with a great chance, but Sorensen rushed from his line to block the striker's effort.<br><br>Cahill had a sorry time in the first half, but he went some way to redeeming himself when denying Louis Saha a fourth with a fine block on the line.<br><br>Sorensen made an excellent save to deny Larsson a first Premiership goal, Rooney hit the bar from 20 yards and Ronaldo was denied by the keeper as United threatened to run riot without ever managing to find the target in the second half.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal vs Manchester United<br><br>Arsenal have the chance to derail Manchester United's title challenge when the two old rivals meet at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, live on Sky Sports 1.<br><br>With both historic clubs in superb form at present with their attacking philosophies paying dividends, a classic surely awaits in the latest instalment of one of the Premiership's great rivalries - which has previously witnessed all manner of conflict, as well as a food fight.<br><br>Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson have now been at odds for over a decade and, as ever, the stakes will be high when United visit Emirates Stadium for the first time.<br><br>Ferguson currently enjoys a six-point cushion at the top of the table and, depending on Chelsea's result at Liverpool on Saturday, could end the weekend with either a formidable lead or the narrowest of advantages.<br><br>The official line from North London is that emulating the 1-0 victory over United at Old Trafford earlier in the season would keep Arsenal in with a shout of the title, but with 15 points to make up Wenger will be more concerned about cementing a UEFA Champions League place at present.<br><br>The Frenchman also has the incentive of winning his personal battle of wills with Ferguson, as Wenger has won 13 of the 32 meetings between the bosses with the United chief victorious in 12.<br><br>The Gunners have looked in fine shape in recent weeks, winning all four of their games in 2007, and have captain Thierry Henry leading the charge with a goal in each of his last three games.<br><br>Robin van Persie is awaiting the results of an ankle scan to determine his chances of playing, and if the Dutch forward misses out then Emmanuel Adebayor - who scored the only goal of the game at Old Trafford - will start after shrugging off a thigh injury.<br><br>Arsenal's biggest concern is the absence of vice-captain Gilberto due to suspension, whilst senior figures Freddie Ljungberg (hamstring) and William Gallas (thigh) remain sidelined.<br><br>Emmanuel Eboue is also a doubt due to an ankle problem, and, with Lauren leaving to join Portsmouth, Justin Hoyte will continue if the Ivorian misses out.<br><br>Whichever side Arsenal put out, they will have to be at their free-flowing best if they are to engineer a win over a United side that has lost just once in their last 12 games.<br><br>Ferguson is also enjoying the benefits of a full strength squad as Wes Brown is expected to return after missing the win over Aston Villa due to a virus.<br><br>Louis Saha made his comeback from a groin injury at Old Trafford, and could return to the starting line-up in place of Henrik Larsson for the game which could have huge repercussions at the top end of the Premiership table.<br><br>Skysports.com Prediction: 1-1<br>Far too close to call, United may be top dogs but The Gunners are firing and have home advantage.<br><br>Player to watch: Wayne Rooney</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Reds give Jose the blues</strong><br><br>A terrific Liverpool performance saw them coast to a 2-0 win over a very poor Chelsea at Anfield.<br><br>From the off the home side looked far hungrier and their attacking approach was rewarded with a fourth minute lead as Dirk Kuyt struck.<br><br>Before 20 minutes had gone, Liverpool's domination told again as Jermaine Pennant's struck his first goal for the club and that proved enough for Rafa Benitez - as he claimed his first league victory over Jose Mourinho.<br><br>It was a rampant first half display from Liverpool that saw them set up victory as they totally over-ran a Chelsea side which looked completely disorganised without talismanic skipper John Terry in defence.<br><br>The main talking point before the game was Petr Cech's return and he was happy to claim a Steven Gerrard header after three minutes to get his first touch of a ball for over three months.<br><br>However, within a minute Cech's next task was to pick the ball out of the back of the net as Liverpool swept into the lead. A long ball flicked on by Peter Crouch fell for Kuyt, he knocked the ball past hapless make-shift centre-half Paulo Ferreira, before coolly side-footing a half-volley into the corner.<br><br>Chelsea just could not come to terms with Liverpool's attacking play and the home side should have been two-up just moments later. Xabi Alonso's excellent ball into the box freed John Arne Riise - but Cech was down wonderfully well to make the save.<br><br>Chelsea's first meaningful chance came for Didier Drogba from a corner but he headed wide - and within minutes they found themselves further behind.<br><br>A long ball from Gerrard was headed clear by Michael Essien, the ball fell for Pennant - but with Ashley Cole backing off and inviting a shot, the former Birmingham man accepted the invitation and unleashed a brilliant effort into the top corner leaving Cech helpless.<br><br>Shaun Wright-Phillips was soon introduced for the injured Arjen Robben and that resulted in some meaningful Chelsea possession - but Jose Reina remained untested up to half-time.<br><br>Liverpool should have had the game well and truly sewn up by the hour mark and it was Crouch the guilty party for missing two great chances.<br><br>Pennant, having one of his best games for the club, was the creator for the first opportunity as he whipped in a cross from the right and found Crouch unmarked 12 yards out but he disappointingly headed tamely at Cech.<br><br>Then came a double let off for the champions as Riise unleashed a trademark thunderbolt from 30 yards which smashed off the crossbar - the rebound looked to drop favourably for Crouch but under Essien's challenge he failed to find the target.<br><br>Chelsea simply were not clicking and Drogba seemed to sum up their day with two fluffed chances from great positioned free-kicks. He first contrived with Michael Ballack - one the edge of the box - to simply give the ball straight to the home side.<br><br>Then he was picked out brilliantly by Lampard from a set piece on the right just inside the box - but he missed the ball completely with his side foot.<br><br>Wright-Phillips was just about Chelsea's best player after entering the fray earlier in the first half and his mazy run through the Liverpool backline almost resulted in a goal as he crossed from the by-line and Dan Agger was relieved to see the ball fly into the side-netting rather than the back of the net.<br><br>An excellent late intervention from Ferreira prevented Kuyt adding a third - but Mourinho could have had few complaints had Liverpool, as they should have, secured a more sizeable success.<br><br>Indeed Kuyt spurned an even better chance in the final minute when he blazed over from 10 yards after a wonderful flicked pass from Gerrard.</div>
