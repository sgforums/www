              <p>Once again, sports commentators, experts and analysts are doing job where they are paid for being hypocrities and inaccurate opinion, and still get to insult those soccer players, jmping to conclusion even when they matters are still not being properly judged and all parties have given their chance to explain their point.</p>
              <p>Shame on you all those lousy and unethical journalists, experts or whatever you call them who milk on the emotions of stupid readers and give undue stress to the soccer players, and staff.</p>
              <p>I condemn all these hasty judgemental reports by these people. As they say, pen is mightier than the sword. These writers need to have a player or coach commit suicide like korean stars, before they will reflect on their own ethics. Readers must also share the responsilibity of criticising the players too fast without a proper process.</p>

              <p>Ya, that is the state of the world, hypocritical sport commentators, and writers, and coupled with stupid viewers, who are emotional. The losers are the soccer players, cause the safety and mental well being is at stake, plus their life is at stake with all these judgemental reports.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its their choice to take up their job, earn the salary and write like some immature and emotional writer, and psuedo expert, who cannot only write but cannot go and take up the coaching job themselves in the highest level.</p>
              <p>An S league player or coach talking about world cup analysts. Come on, they should work on getting singapore team to world cup if they are so good.</p>
              <p>As I have, i have to speak up for the players and coaches who get unfair reports, we do not wait until suicide happens then talk about a bunch of moral discussion again. Sadly, this is the state of the world. Wait till such things bite you these forumers, because i know that in your own personal life, you do get such unfair judgment also, jsut that is is a much lesser degree.</p>

              <p>of course i dun believe what i read. I already know that those writers are just predicting things according to trends and some usual soccer analysis which does not reflect the actual match.</p>
              <p>My point is. if your readers do not want to emphatise with the unfair way the world is living, then be prepared to live in this kind of life and experiencing this kind of treatment to yourself then since you think that that is the way world works! welcome to hell, fellow warriors.=p</p>
              <p>i read to see what crap their are writing, i myself do not buy the NEW paper also. just reading other people newspaper. i really think these writiers are murderers indirectly. The soicety and naive citizens, those stupid ones, not all, are indirectly murderers. As you all guys said, that is te way world is. Hope you guys dun become the victim then.</p>

              <p>As such, i hereby state my stance. I detest soccer writiers who blame, jump to conclusion, criticise, shame soccer players, and celebrities alike and popular people without conclusive evidence.</p>
              <p>These people are willing to get paid as being verbal bullys. Their action promote the culture of bullying our pathetic world. I served as an internet voice to educate people again such phenomenon.</p>

              <p>Sigh..... the way the TS speaks, it's almost as though he was
              talking about the greatest injustice ever in the history of
              mankind..... </p>
              <p>Sheesh. It's just some game analysis by some football pundits,
              some of whom have been professional footballers themselves. Lighten

              <p>well, if you are the celebrities and famous people who are on the receving end of the injustice, will you be lightening up? Do you think this issue is small issue?</p>
              <p>Does not mean that this issue is not as worst as war crimes means that it does not deserve mentioning.</p>
