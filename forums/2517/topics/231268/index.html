            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho has offered assurance to Chelsea supporters that his heart still belongs at Stamford Bridge, amidst reports of unrest and a possible parting of ways in the summer.<br><br>The Portuguese tactician, who has brought back-to-back Premiership titles to the capital, has intimated that he is less than enamoured with the club's decision to curb his involvement in the January sales, with his relations with Roman Abramovich thought to be cordial rather than warm.<br><br>It has been suggested this season could possibly be his last in England, with plenty of clubs across the continent sure to be interested in his services should be ever desire to move on.<br><br>Chelsea host Wigan on Saturday and Mourinho insists the focus of his attention will centre entirely on on-the-field matters, rather than what may be occurring off it.<br><br>"I love Chelsea. I always want to win the next game and the next game is against Wigan," he told the club's TV station.<br><br>"We have to be together to win that game and we have to forget the stories, we have to forget what the press are saying.<br><br>"It's easy for me. I'm self-motivated, always at the top. If results are not what we want, that is even a bigger motivation to fight."<br><br>The return of Ricardo Cavalho and Didier Drogba from suspension, along with the comeback of Arjen Robben after injury, should provide Mourinho's side with an ideal fillip.<br><br>Mourinho believes that being able to employ the aforementioned trio will more than make up for the absence of the suspended Ashley Cole.<br><br>"We lose Ashley Cole (to suspension) so on balance we have two positives. So we are better in terms of options.<br><br>"Mentally we are okay. Our last game in the Premiership was at Aston Villa. We didn't win but we played as a team.<br><br>"Tomorrow is at our home and we have two-and-a-half years of getting results at home.<br><br>"There are no reasons to be afraid of it and tomorrow we are confident we can get back to victories in the Premiership."</div>
