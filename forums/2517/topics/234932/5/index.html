            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE - Defending champions Singapore will be looking to end 30 years of hurt against Thailand when the two sides meet in the first leg of the Asean Football Championship on Wednesday.<br><br>Unbeaten in their last 15 games in the competition, the Lions face the biggest test of their title credentials against a side they have not beaten in a competitive 'A' international since February 1977.<br><br>Since suffering a 2-0 defeat in the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the Thais have built up a formidable record against their South East Asian rivals with an unbeaten run that includes 10 SEA Games meetings and a pair of Asean Football Championship clashes in 1996 and 2002.<br><br>Singapore coach Radojko Avramovic has little respect for history though and believes that his side can put an end to their poor record against the Thais.<br><br>'This final is a new game and there are many new players for both Singapore and Thailand who have had nothing to do with what has happened before,' said the Serbian.<br><br>'A lot of people say that Thailand are the top team in this region. But we are still the champions and I think that Thailand must be at their best to take the title from us.'<br><br>Speaking in the build-up to the game, Thailand team manager Thavatchai Sajakul was trying to play down his side's prospects of victory in the Lion City.<br><br>'The way that I look at the Singapore team nowadays, they are getting stronger and stronger from one game to the next and we feel that we are going to have a real hard time,' he said.<br><br>'We have been quite concerned since seeing their results against China [in the Asian Cup 2007 qualifiers]. We went to China last year for a friendly and lost 4-0 but Singapore drew 0-0 with them and lost to a last minute penalty in China.<br><br>'I know from those results that this Singapore team is a force to be reckoned with.'<br><br>The Thais have major fitness concerns with injured skipper Kiatisuk Senamuang not travelling with the rest of the team to Singapore on Monday while key players Datsakorn Thonglao, Nirut Surasiang and Suree Sukha are racing to be fit for Wednesday's game.<br><br>'It will be difficult for us without Kiatisuk and we also have five or six first team players who are not fully fit,' added Thavatchai.<br><br>'As a team, I always try to make sure that we give whatever we have got but there are times that we lose also. Maybe this might be one time that we lose and I would be very happy if we go home with a draw.'<br><br>Avramovic did not want to read too much into Kiatisuk's likely absence.<br><br>'Thailand have enough good players so even if he is missing, it will make no big difference to the way that they play because they have other players who have been scoring goals for them in this competition,' the Singapore coach said.<br><br>Singapore have concerns of their own with S.Subramani, Baihakki Khaizan and Hafiz Osman still recovering from injury but the Lions will be boosted by the return of skipper Aide Iskandar from suspension.<br><br>Thailand and Singapore are the only two teams to have lifted the Asean Football Championship with the Thais winning in 1996, 2000 and 2002 and Singapore emerging triumphant in 1998 and 2005.</div>

But we are still the champions and I think that Thailand must be at their best to take the title from us.'<br><br>Speaking in the build-up to the game, Thailand team manager Thavatchai Sajakul was trying to play down his side's prospects of victory in the Lion City.<br><br>'The way that I look at the Singapore team nowadays, they are getting stronger and stronger from one game to the next and we feel that we are going to have a real hard time,' he said.<br><br>'We have been quite concerned since seeing their results against China [in the Asian Cup 2007 qualifiers]. We went to China last year for a friendly and lost 4-0 but Singapore drew 0-0 with them and lost to a last minute penalty in China.<br><br>'I know from those results that this Singapore team is a force to be reckoned with.'<br><br>The Thais have major fitness concerns with injured skipper Kiatisuk Senamuang not travelling with the rest of the team to Singapore on Monday while key players Datsakorn Thonglao, Nirut Surasiang and Suree Sukha are racing to be fit for Wednesday's game.<br><br>'It will be difficult for us without Kiatisuk and we also have five or six first team players who are not fully fit,' added Thavatchai.<br><br>'As a team, I always try to make sure that we give whatever we have got but there are times that we lose also. Maybe this might be one time that we lose and I would be very happy if we go home with a draw.'<br><br>Avramovic did not want to read too much into Kiatisuk's likely absence.<br><br>'Thailand have enough good players so even if he is missing, it will make no big difference to the way that they play because they have other players who have been scoring goals for them in this competition,' the Singapore coach said.<br><br>Singapore have concerns of their own with S.Subramani, Baihakki Khaizan and Hafiz Osman still recovering from injury but the Lions will be boosted by the return of skipper Aide Iskandar from suspension.<br><br>Thailand and Singapore are the only two teams to have lifted the Asean Football Championship with the Thais winning in 1996, 2000 and 2002 and Singapore emerging triumphant in 1998 and 2005.</div></blockquote>it's so good to be true.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
