            <div class='col-md body'>Los Angeles Galaxy head coach Frank Yallop says his players will not be envious of the money that new signing David Beckham will be making.<br><br>The former Ipswich Town defender is about to make the former England captain one of his charges in the upcoming Major League Soccer season following the 31-year-old's shock announcement to move to America from Real Madrid.<br><br>The former Manchester United star stunned the footballing world by agreeing a five-year deal worth Â£128million with the Southern California outfit, with Beckham due to join the Galaxy in August.<br><br>The deal prompted Galaxy captain Peter Vagenas to suggest that there will be resentment among Beckham's new team-mates.<br><br>Yallop, however, dismissed those claims, suggesting that Vagenas's comments were 'tongue in cheek'.<br><br>"I know our guys and they're not the jealous type," the former Canada manager told The Times.<br><br>"We have players on $31,000 [about Â£16,000] a year, but we also have someone like Landon Donovan on big money.<br><br>"The salary cap is a way of life over here."<br><br>Yallop plans to play Beckham in central midfield when he arrives, stating the player could still turn out for England in the future, while admitting his surprise at the midfielder's exclusion in Madrid.<br><br>"Steve McClaren wanted to go in a different direction, but I will have no problem ringing him up to recommend David, if he plays as well as we expect," he added.<br><br>"I don't know why (Real boss) Fabio Capello came out and said David would never play for them again.<br><br>"Everyone knew Michael Ballack was going to Chelsea, but he saw out the season at Bayern Munich. Madrid have been in our situation."<br><br>Yallop believes Beckham's presence will take MLS and football in North America to the next level.<br><br>"He will drive the sport on here," insists Yallop. "Every kid under 10 in America plays soccer.<br><br>"I think, in three or four years, the salary cap will have been raised to a level where we can start retaining our best players."</div>
