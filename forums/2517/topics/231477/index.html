            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson was pleased with his side's display in the 3-1 win over Aston Villa.<br><br>Manchester United overwhelmed Villa from the outset and goals from Park Ji-Sung, Michael Carrick and Cristiano Ronaldo handed them a cushion.<br><br>Gabriel Agbonlahor reduced the arrears, but it did not detract from United's dominance as they proved far too good for Villa.<br><br>The win ensured United maintained their six-point advantage over Chelsea and Ferguson feels The Red Devils are well placed.<br><br>"I am not saying it is going to plan, but what the players are doing is they are playing with great expression and it is another game away," Ferguson told Sky Sports News. "It is 15 games to go and we are in a good position."<br><br>Commenting on the game, Ferguson added: "I think the first half we played excellent and could have scored a few more goals.<br><br>"Credit to Villa they turned things around and made it difficult for us in the second half and they got a goal.<br><br>"I don't think they were any real threat to us, but they kept possession and made it difficult.<br><br>"We had a lot of chances (in the first half). We played some good football and capitalised on that."<br><br>Wayne Rooney again drew a blank, but his performance earned praise from his manager.<br><br>"He is going through a little spell, it happens to all players, but he will get it back," stated the Scot. "He hit the bar today and contributed to two of the goals and he is okay.<br><br>"He is working hard, that's important, and he is enjoying it."</div>
