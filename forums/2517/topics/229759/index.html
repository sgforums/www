            <div class='col-md body'>Rangers fans are calling for executive chairman Sir David Murray to fully explain the reasons behind Paul Le Guen's departure from Ibrox.<br><br>Rangers Supporters Trust spokesman Stephen Smith said: "My initial reaction is one of disappointment and sadness that it has come to this.<br><br>"The supporters need clarity, information and leadership - and that needs to come from David Murray."<br><br>Le Guen's rift with club captain Barry Ferguson has brought things to a head but Smith wants Murray to provide definitive answers.<br><br>"At the moment we can only guess that this is because of the Barry Ferguson situation but it may be down to other things," he said.<br><br>"That's a problem. We are searching for answers."<br><br>Smith believes supporters would welcome another European coach as long as the new man has enough ambition to take Rangers forward.<br><br>He added: "The Rangers job in any circumstances is one of the most attractive jobs around for a manager. We are expecting high-quality candidates to emerge for this job - Rangers fans are looking for the best and someone who matches the ambition of the fans."<br><br>John Macmillan, general secretary of the Rangers Supporters Association, admits he is also shocked by Le Guen's departure.<br><br>He said: "It has come as a huge surprise. I didn't think it would end like this, if I was a betting man I would have said a compromise was on the cards.<br><br>"Obviously things have moved on in the last 24 hours and it's sad that things have happened this way especially at such a difficult time of the season."<br><br>Macmillan admits he has no idea who Le Guen's successor could be.<br><br>He added: "I honestly couldn't answer that because it has happened so fast.<br><br>"When Alex McLeish was destined to leave we had time to think about things and who might come in but this is a bolt out of the blue.<br><br>"One thing is for sure, we need a manager who can bring stability to the club, this cannot be allowed to drag on."</div>
