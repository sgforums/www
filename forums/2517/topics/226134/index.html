            <div class='col-md body'>Champions Chelsea are once again favourites for the Premiership title after another scintillating weekend of action.<br><br>Despite six games on Saturday, all eyes were very much on Sunday's games - with the double header that saw Chelsea and Manchester United facing tricky away tasks, and it was Jose Mourinho's men who passed the test and moved to within two points of their rivals.<br><br>For much of the match at Goodison Park, Everton looked as if they would take at the very least a point. But stunning strikes from Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba gave Chelsea a 3-2 success.<br><br>How United could have done with some of Chelsea's exquisite finishing as they succumbed to West Ham, who in Alan Curbishley's first game fell to a 1-0 defeat as Nigel Reo-Coker swooped late on to condemn The Red Devils to their first league defeat since September.<br><br>Liverpool's good form continued as they moved into third with a thoroughly comfortable 3-0 victory over second from bottom Charlton at The Valley.<br><br>The Reds were able to move into the top three after Arsenal and Portsmouth played out a 2-2 draw at Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Pompey left North London thinking what could and should have been as they were two up just after the interval, only for The Gunners to strike back with a quick-fire double through Emmanuel Adebayor and Gilberto Silva.<br><br>Bolton are fifth after an excellent 1-0 win at Aston Villa, although goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen left with most of the plaudits after a string of saves kept the home side at bay - which meant Gary Speed's penalty was enough for victory.<br><br>Tottenham were also major movers as they claimed their first away win of the season with a 2-1 success at Manchester City.<br><br>At the bottom it was a successful weekend for Sheffield United, Newcastle and Blackburn - who all claimed crucial wins.<br><br>The Blades travelled to Wigan and will have been delighted with their efforts as Rob Hulse's flick gave them a 1-0 win - which takes them three points clear of the relegation zone.<br><br>Newcastle's recent upturn in form continued at St James' Park with a hard fought 2-1 victory over bottom-of-the-table Watford, with Obafemi Martins proving the hero with a second-half brace.<br><br>Blackburn made sure they would not end the weekend in the bottom three as they came from behind at Reading to seal a 2-1 win, with David Bentley's wonder-strike winning it for Mark Hughes's men.</div>
