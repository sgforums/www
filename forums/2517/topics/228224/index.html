            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SAM ALLARDYCE has warned Chelsea to forget about nicking Tal Ben Haim on the cheap.</strong><br><br>The Israeli defender has been a target for Jose Mourinho before and he could renew his interest with John Terry out. Big Sam has admitted Ben Haim, 24, is unlikely to sign an extension to his contract, which expires in the summer, and will allow him to leave for Â£3million. Allardyce said: "He may spark a frenzied bidding war because he is a top talent.<br><br>"Although everybody thinks they can play games with us, they canÂ’t play games with me. "Unless we get what we believe he is worth, we may ultimately lose out. "You have to consider what we could lose through qualification for Europe by letting him go."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>MARTIN OÂ’NEILL is praying that he can hang on to loan keeper Gabor Kiraly.</strong><br><br>Crystal Palace decide today whether to recall the Hungarian because of their own injury crisis. And that would leave Aston Villa with no recognised senior stopper at Charlton tomorrow or for the visit of champions Chelsea next Tuesday. Manager OÂ’Neill has Thomas Sorensen and Stuart Taylor crocked, leaving him with only untried Austrian Robert Olejnik. Kiraly, who wants to quit Selhurst Park, has played three games for Villa, conceding six goals. He was given special dispensation to join Villa on a temporary basis. But PalaceÂ’s Julian Speroni has hurt a wrist and the Championship club have the right of immediate recall. That would leave Olejnik, 20, facing a baptism of fire over the next few days.<br><br>Meanwhile, defender Mark Delaney, 30, has suffered a new knee injury that could end his career. The Welsh international said: "IÂ’m coming to the end of my Villa contract so the timing could not have been worse."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>STEVE BRUCE has four million reasons to be cheerful as Birmingham see out 2006 tonight.</strong><br><br>The Championship table-toppers are eight points clear and can widen the gap with victory over Luton. Key to this success is the 13 goals scored by Â£4m ex-Coventry winger Gary McSheffrey, who Bruce refused to give up on signing in the summer. Boss Bruce insisted: "Gary was my No 1 target. HeÂ’s full of determination and heÂ’s a very good finisher."<br><br>Meanwhile, Bruce is ready to cut his losses on Â£5.5m midfielder David Dunn, 27, who could return to Blackburn for around Â£2m. He said: "We canÂ’t get the boy fit."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>GARETH SOUTHGATE has told Fabio Rochemback to forget a return to Portugal.</strong><br><br>MiddlesbroughÂ’s Brazilian midfielder, 25, has been linked with a move back to Sporting Lisbon. His representatives claim he wants to leave but Boro boss Southgate expects him to play a part at Blackburn tomorrow. He said: "There have been inquiries but nothing concrete. We are not looking to move Fabio on. "HeÂ’s been out of the side recently but has the talent to get back in."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>ANDERSON DE SILVA could be dumped by Everton Â— without playing a Premiership game.</strong><br><br>The Brazilian midfielder, 24, agreed a move 16 months ago but went on loan to Malaga as he did not have an EU passport. Toffees boss David Moyes said: "As a team we have moved on."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>TOTTENHAM and Newcastle are leading the race for DerbyÂ’s Â£3million-rated whizkid Giles Barnes, writes DAVE KIDD.</strong><br><br>Toon boss Glenn Roeder has been an admirer ever since the midfielder, 18, tore apart his academy side two years ago. Spurs chief Martin Jol is also keen on the talented youngster, who can also play on either wing. And the Dutchman may be willing to loan Barnes back to the promotion-chasing Rams for the rest of the season Â— in a deal similar to the one which took Tom Huddlestone from Pride Park to White Hart Lane two years ago.<br><br>Barnes is being regularly watched by top-flight scouts, including Chelsea. And Derby boss Billy Davies admits he will not stand in the playerÂ’s way if the price is right.<br></div>
