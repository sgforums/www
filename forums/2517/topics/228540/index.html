            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool got back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane.<br><br>Luis Garcia's goal right on the stroke of half-time was enough to give Liverpool the points and get their UEFA Champions League qualifying hopes back on track.<br><br>The win was only Liverpool's third victory away from home this season, while it was only Tottenham's second defeat at White Hart Lane this campaign.<br><br>Liverpool settled the better of the two sides in the rain at White Hart Lane and Paul Robinson had a scare in the opening two minutes when a poor backpass from Lee Young-pyo put him in trouble and the England keeper had to react quickly to clear the ball from Dirk Kuyt.<br><br>Mido wasted a golden opportunity to break the deadlock on ten minutes when the ball dropped invitingly on the edge of the box, but with only Jose Reina to beat the Egyptian wastefully blazed his shot off target.<br><br>A minute later Craig Bellamy got free down the right from a clever pass from Garcia and his deflected shot had to be turned round the post by Robinson.<br><br>Jermain Defoe had a sight of goal on 16 minutes when Jamie Carragher's headed clearance fell to him on the edge of the box, but the striker could only fizz his shot well over the top.<br><br>Bellamy went close for Liverpool on 27 minutes when Kuyt slipped in on goal, but the Welshman's low shot was well saved by Robinson.<br><br>A minute later Liverpool wasted another good opening to score when Bellamy returned the favour for Kuyt by teeing him up inside the box with the Dutchman clipping his shot just wide of the far post.<br><br>Liverpool should have opened the scoring on 38 minutes when Kuyt broke free to bear down on goal, but rather than pass the ball to the unmarked Garcia the striker selfishly saw his shot deflected straight through to Robinson.<br><br>The visitors continued to dominate proceedings and Xabi Alonso tried his luck seconds later with a long-range effort which flew just wide of the target.<br><br>Liverpool had a scare on 41 minutes when Lee flung over a dangerous cross from the left, but Mido completely missed the ball much to the relief of the visitors' defence.<br><br>Liverpool finally made their dominance count right on the stroke of half-time when Garcia scrambled home from close-range.<br><br>Didier Zokora carelessly gave the ball away to Steven Gerrard who swapped passes with Kuyt before seeing his shot blocked, but the ball fell to Garcia right in front of goal and he slotted the ball under Robinson.<br><br>Liverpool picked up where they left off at the start of the second half and Bellamy forced Robinson into a good save with a drilled left-footed shot from the edge of the box.<br><br>That was Bellamy's last involvement in the game as he was forced off on 49 minutes with a hamstring injury and Jermaine Pennant replaced him.<br><br>Garcia missed a great chance to double Liverpool's lead on 55 minutes when he ghosted into the box unmarked to meet Steve Finnan's cross, but the diminutive Spaniard headed his effort wide of goal.<br><br>Reina had a lucky escape on the hour mark when he somehow dropped a free-kick from Tom Huddlestone inside the box, but much to his relief no one was on hand to capitalise on his mistake and he grabbed the ball at the second attempt.<br><br>Kuyt almost got through on goal on 65 minutes when Alonso sent the Dutchman running clear, but Calum Davenport and Michael Dawson got back to snuff out the danger.<br><br>Garcia tried his luck soon after with an acrobatic overhead kick which flew straight at Robinson as Liverpool searched for a second goal.<br><br>Spurs almost grabbed an equaliser when Dimitar Berbatov worked his way down the right and fired in a cross which Finnan headed against his own crossbar.<br><br>The home side wasted a great chance to draw level on 75 minutes when Pascal Chimbonda got down the right and crossed towards Defoe who saw his shot blocked and the ball fell to Hossam Ghaly six yards out but he snatched at his shot firing it wide of the target with the goal at his mercy.<br><br>Spurs continued to pour forward and Defoe saw a shot from the edge of the box palmed out by Reina ten minutes from time.<br><br>Berbatov fluffed a great opening to score five minutes from time when he beat the Liverpool offside trap, but his touch let him down and the ball ran through to Reina.<br><br>The home side threw everything into attack in the dying stages, but the Liverpool defence stood up to all they could throw at them with Carragher making a couple of vital interceptions.</div>
