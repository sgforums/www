            <div class='col-md body'>Javier Mascherano has spoken of his relief after being given the green light to join Liverpool.<br><br>Fifa have given Liverpool special dispensation to sign Mascherano from West Ham United, even though he has already played for two clubs in the last 12 months.<br><br>The move has been delayed because the Premier League are looking to study the transfer before allowing it to be processed.<br><br>Liverpool have agreed an 18-month loan deal with the Argentine international, with the option of a permanent move after an unhappy spell at West Ham.<br><br>Mascherano is hoping he can get through the red tape to seal his switch to Anfield and get his career back on track.<br><br>"I received the communication from Fifa and the documentation has already been sent to my agent," Mascherano told Radio La Red.<br><br>"The club has done a lot for making this easier, they did a great presentation and that's why now I am allowed to play for Liverpool.<br><br>"It's very common that when a player doesn't play he makes excuses, but I don't want that.<br><br>"I am a principle person in having the fault for what happened because it was me who took the decision.<br><br>"It wasn't the best decision to accept to be transferred to West Ham, besides that what I am saying hurts, but I must accept that.<br><br>"I went through a very bad moment, but now Liverpool has appeared and I want to do my work as best as possible for showing that I still have the same ambitions as when I arrived in England."<br><br>Mascherano also singled out Rafa Benitez for special praise, admitting he has been very impressed by the Spaniard.<br><br>"Rafa Benitez gave me a lot of confidence since the fist moment that I spoke with him," added Benitez.<br><br>"Personally, I even got very surprised with the chance of being transferred to Liverpool, considering that I haven't been playing since December 3rd at West Ham.<br><br>"Now a new page starts in my career and I want to be again the player that I was some time ago and fight for a place at Liverpool.<br><br>"I want to give my best to this team that has done such a big effort to have me in the squad.<br><br>"In addition to that, I want to work very hard for Liverpool and for myself win a place again in the Argentinian national team."</div>
