            <div class='col-md body'>John Terry is still some way short of full fitness according to Jose Mourinho, with Chelsea's defensive problems showing little sign of being resolved in the near future.<br><br>It had been intimated that Chelsea's talismanic captain would be fit to make a return for Saturday's Premiership clash with Wigan, but this suggestion has now been refuted by his manager.<br><br>After undergoing surgery to cure a troublesome back complaint, it had initially been thought he would be able to make a swift return, but it would now appear he is still nursing his way back to fitness.<br><br>Mourinho is loath to rush back his defensive lynchpin, despite the fact in his absence Chelsea's backline has looked distinctly brittle, and short of numbers, as Michael Essien and Paulo Ferreira formed a makeshift partnership in Wednesday's Carling Cup semi-final at Wycombe.<br><br>"John had surgery, he is recovering from that, but he is not ready yet," said Mourinho, in the aftermath of the Adams Park clash.<br><br>"We have a lot of problems, because Ashley Cole and Claude Makelele face suspensions, and I do not see Terry back.<br><br>"There is no timescale on John. The only thing I know for sure is that he will not play against Wigan on Saturday.<br><br>"I am not a doctor. John is not fit to train with the group. He is not in my collective sessions yet, so he is out for the weekend."<br><br>Although the rest of the Premiership look on enviably at Chelsea's riches and spending power in the transfer market, it would appear Roman Abramovich is to keep his chequebook closed in the January transfer window.<br><br>Despite the fact Chelsea have been linked with bringing another defender to Stamford Bridge, with Mourinho having hinted that he feels his squad needs strengthening in this area, it would seem his bosses are reticent to sanction any new arrivals.<br><br>"Yes, that is the situation. I do not have to tell you the reason," Mourinho added. "They are club reasons.<br><br>"This is our situation at the moment. I hear nobody is coming in, and if nobody is coming in, nobody can leave.<br><br>"I cannot let a player go, even if he is a player I think should go, because we are very short of options and numbers.<br><br>"It is not choice - it is not my club. I am just the manager."</div>
