            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson says he was not surprised by David Beckham's decision to move to the United States.<br><br>Beckham has agreed a five-year, $250million (Â£128million) deal to join Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy in the summer.<br><br>The former England captain will leave Real Madrid as a free agent at the end of the season and Ferguson felt his next destination was always going to be America.<br><br>"I anticipated that. I thought that was expected, to go to America," he told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"He had the opportunity to go to America and with the kind of money being talked about he had to consider that."<br><br>The United boss thinks Beckham's lack of playing time at Real played a major part in his decision to go to MLS.<br><br>"You've got to gauge his position at Real Madrid at the moment," Ferguson said. "I think that's maybe accelerated it because he has only played five games this season and he can't be happy with that.<br><br>"Every top player wants to play so that has probably accelerated the whole business of it."<br><br>Beckham had been linked with a return to the Premiership when his Real deal expired.<br><br>However, Ferguson believes there was never any chance of the 31-year-old playing in England again because of his ties with United.<br><br>He added: "I don't think there was any chance of that, having played for us. Deep down he was always a United fan and I don't think there was any chance of him going back to another English club.<br><br>"He has been a terrific player at our club and everyone at our club hopes he does well. We wish him well. It's a big career change from playing for Real Madrid to go and play in America."</div>
