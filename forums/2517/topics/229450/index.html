            <div class='col-md body'>Frank Lampard has dismissed talk of a crisis at Chelsea by stating his confidence that the reigning champions will be able to close Manchester United's six-point gap at the top of the table.<br><br>The Blues could only earn a third consecutive draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday night as they failed to take advantage of United's slip-up at Newcastle, and Chelsea's title credentials have again been put under the microscope as a result.<br><br>With Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho trading verbal blows in the media, all eyes are trained on what could be a memorable title tussle but Lampard is still sure that the Londoners will reign supreme for the third year in a row.<br><br>"Ourselves and Manchester United know the situation now and there is still a long way to go," said Lampard.<br><br>"I am confident we can pull the gap back. There are many points to play for and we've got a lot of confidence in this team. That's the reason we've been champions two years on the trot.<br><br>"You have to look at the big picture rather than just a few games. I think Sir Alex Ferguson as well as Jose Mourinho is wise enough to know there is a long way to go.<br><br>"The pair of them talk after games which gives out some headlines - but at the end of the day the football will do the talking.<br><br>"There is nothing major wrong. Sometimes you have to remind yourselves as a team that it is nothing major because the fact people are asking questions after two or three draws is a statement about what a team we are and what a squad we are.<br><br>"It is certainly not a crisis."<br><br>Chelsea are soon to be boosted by the return of two key men, with John Terry pencilled in to start against Watford on 13th January and Petr Cech hoping to appear the following week against Liverpool.<br><br>"It is a great boost to have Petr back. For me he is the best goalkeeper in the world," Lampard added.<br><br>"Credit to Hilario for coming in but we've been unfortunate to lose two of the best keepers in the Premiership for a long period of time.<br><br>"As regards to John, we all knew it was a short-term thing with his back. Psychologically it will be good to have him back. Who wouldn't want John Terry back in their side?"</div>
