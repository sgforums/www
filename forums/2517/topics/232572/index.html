            <div class='col-md body'>Cesc Fabregas has admitted his admiration for opposite number Paul Scholes ahead of Arsenal's grudge clash with Manchester United on Sunday.<br><br>The two stars are at very different stages of their career, but both act as the creative hub of their respective teams and will be aiming to dictate the flow of the game when two of England's most historic sides meet at Emirates Stadium, live on Sky Sports 1.<br><br>Whilst Fabregas looks to be a prime contender for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, such is Scholes' form this season that the ever-modest United schemer has been put forward as a potential candidate for the senior award alongside the more extrovert pair of Cristiano Ronaldo and Didier Drogba.<br><br>The consumate professional has been one of the great unsung heroes for United during the Sir Alex Ferguson years, but Spanish international Fabregas has admitted he would love to have a similarly successful career to the player he rates as one of England's best.<br><br>"Paul Scholes has had a fantastic season," said Fabregas in The Sun.<br><br>"He is a very complete, spectacular footballer. He always fights for the ball and tries to lose his marker to help his team-mates - either to defend or to have a shot on goal.<br><br>"For any football player in the Premiership, Scholes is a player you want to emulate.<br><br>"I would happily end my career with the medals that Scholes has. He has six league titles, four FA Cups, one European Cup and one Inter-Continental Cup to his name.<br><br>"I am young and I hope that I will be able to surpass him - but it is not going to be easy."<br><br>Scholes missed a large part of last season with a serious eye problem, and Ryan Giggs believes it is no coincidence that United's rampant league form during the current campaign has dovetailed with the midfielder's return.<br><br>"We have seen now how much we missed him last season when he was out," said Giggs.<br><br>"We are pleased to have him back playing so well, because there is no other player like him. He is class."</div>
