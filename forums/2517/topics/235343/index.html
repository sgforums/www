            <div class='col-md body'>West Ham skipper Nigel Reo-Coker is confident The Hammers will extricate themselves from the Premiership's bottom three and avoid relegation.<br><br>The East Londoners have endured a hugely turbulent and disappointing campaign to date, especially when considering their exploits last term.<br><br>They currently find themselves in the relegation places, two points adrift of closest rivals Wigan.<br><br>Their plight is all the more worrying given that they have managed just one victory in their last 11 league outings, but Reo-Coker remains adamant they will turn around their form and retain their top-flight status.<br><br>"We're very confident we can stay up," he told skysports.com.<br><br>"We're going to try obviously and get some more points on the board, but we've got some good fixtures coming up against teams that are in and around us and we have to make sure we do well in those games.<br><br>"But everyone at the club is confident we can get the points we need to stay up."<br><br>While it has been a difficult season for all concerned at Upton Park, the skipper has suffered more than most with many fans singling out the 22-year-old for particularly stern treatment.<br><br>The former MK Dons midfielder admits the criticism has affected him both on and off the pitch, but is adamant he will come through it a stronger person and better player.<br><br>"It's just been a difficult period at West Ham," he continued. "Obviously a lot has gone on behind the scenes that people don't know about.<br><br>"You can see that a lot has changed because I think only three players that figured in last year's FA Cup final with Liverpool played in the game on Tuesday and that just shows how drastically football can change in such a short space of time.<br><br>"It's been a very difficult time for me and it (the criticism) does put you off your game.<br><br>"But who can I turn to for advice because there's not many people who have been through what I've been through at the age of just 22 at such a big club of the stature of West Ham? But I've managed to get through it and just concentrate on my football and that's all I want to do.<br><br>"At the end of the day it's the situation I'm in. I'm captain of West Ham and if people see it as my fault I've got to live with that whether it's fair or not. That's the pressure of being a captain and I'd like to think I've dealt with it okay so far.<br><br>"I've not really spoken to my team-mates about it, but I have spoken to people I've trusted and they've looked after me and help put me on the right track and make sure I concentrate on my game.<br><br>"I have been happy with my own form, it's just been a hard season.<br><br>"I don't understand how we have gone from last season when we were always West Ham the great team and now this season the main focus has always been on individuals and some individuals have been made scapegoats and pointed out more than other players, but it's always been a team effort for me."</div>
