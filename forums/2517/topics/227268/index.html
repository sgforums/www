            <div class='col-md body'>Tampines Rovers midfielder Tan Kim Leng is set to make time for football again when the S.League kicks off in 2007, his club revealed on Thursday.<br><br>The 29-year-old had not played since the StagsÂ’ league clash with Woodlands Wellington in early August, and had announced his temporary exit from football later in the year.<br><br>TanÂ’s decision to put his playing career on hiatus was prompted by his involvement in several work projects outside the club. He currently plays for Tampines part-time while holding a full-time job in the automotive industry.<br><br>The completion of those projects means that Tan is now free once more to take to the pitch, and the club has confirmed he will be pulling on the yellow top come March 2007.<br><br>Stags team manager Syed Faruk has led the way in welcoming back the No.8, who has been with the club for five seasons since moving from SAFFC in 2002.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s good to have Kim Leng back, after the service he has given to the club in the past,Â” said Faruk.<br><br>Â“The club has always been very supportive to our players, including Kim Leng, who is one of our three part-time players together with Nazri (Nasir) and Rafi (Ali). If theyÂ’re ever tied up, they could just give me a call, and they know we will understand.<br><br>Â“The important thing is that their hearts are with us. In return, we will give them a bit of leeway when they need it, because their work outside football is their bread and butter.Â”<br><br>Tan himself expressed gratitude to the club, especially chairman Teo Hock Seng, for allowing him to take a break from football to focus on his work.<br><br>The former Singapore international is now raring to go again. He has set his sights on achieving continental glory with the RHB Singapore Cup winners, who will enter their third straight AFC Cup campaign next year.<br><br>Â“Thank goodness I can play again; my legs are itching to get back onto the field!Â” he said.<br><br>Â“I felt a bit sad that I could only play for half a season because I had to concentrate on my projects. But itÂ’s really good to know that my club and my boss Mr. Teo have been accommodating and helping me out over this period.<br><br>Â“Now that IÂ’m able to come back, IÂ’m definitely looking forward to next season. I have a career to concentrate on, but football will always be there for me to get the stress out of my system.<br><br>Â“My aim is to help the club achieve something in the AFC Cup next season. We didnÂ’t do so well this past year and only picked up towards the end of the season, so I hope to do my part to improve on that.Â”<br><br>TanÂ’s return to action could leave Tampines with an embarrassment of riches on the flanks next season, as the clubÂ’s S.League squad looks set to feature no fewer than four orthodox wingers.<br><br>Besides Tan on the right flank and Santi Chaiyaphuak on the left, the Stags will be acquiring the services of Sutee Suksomkit and Ridhuan Muhammad, who join the eastern giants from Home United and the Young Lions respectively.<br><br>22-year-old RidhuanÂ’s deal had been confirmed earlier in the week, while Thailand international Sutee will put pen to paper when he returns from the Doha Asian Games, where he was representing his country in the menÂ’s football event.<br><br>In addition, the club has also signed former Young Lions centreback Shariff Abdul Samat and ex-Woodlands Wellington goalkeeper Ahmadulhaq Che Omar, while 18-year-old midfielder Shahdan Sulaiman has been promoted from the Prime League squad.<br><br>SuteeÂ’s arrival will round off the StagsÂ’ list of four foreigners in their S.League squad, with Santi, Brazilian midfielder Peres de Oliveira and long-serving Serbian Sead Â‘MookieÂ’ Muratovic set to stay with the club.<br><br>The winger will replace compatriot Choketawee Promrut, after Tampines had announced before the Singapore Cup final that the defenderÂ’s contract, which expires on 31 December, will not be renewed in the coming season.<br><br>Also leaving the club are backup goalkeeper Zulkifli Zainolabidin and defender Noraidit Mahat, while Aide Iskandar and Ahmad LatiffÂ’s loan deals from Johor FA will end on 1 January 2007.<br><br>The movements mean that Tampines have already settled on their full S.League squad of 20 players, barring any failures in the mandatory fitness test, which will be held over several weeks starting from mid-January.<br><br>Â“We are very happy with the players we have added to the side,Â” commented Faruk on the new signings.<br><br>Â“TheyÂ’re generally quite young, but they are already very experienced. We have a lot of options in front and at the back, and all of our players have to be versatile to fit into the modern game.<br><br>Â“Sutee can play as striker, and even Santi can play as striker. At the other end, (Mustafic) Fahrudin can play in defence as well if MookieÂ’s not available, so the players can adapt.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve had to act fast because the transfer window closes on 5 February, which is quite early. But all our players are technically not bad, so weÂ’re satisfied with our squad.Â”<br><br>Tan also welcomed the arrival of the new Stags recruits, and even though they may threaten his place in the first team, he appeared unfazed by the challenges they pose.<br><br>Instead he focused on the benefits their arrival would bring to the team, which had been gunning for a treble this year and would likely harbour similar ambitions next term.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’ve got to fight for your place when youÂ’re in a good squad, and I donÂ’t see why I should be worried about that,Â” said the winger.<br><br>Â“We now have more quality players like Sutee and Ridhuan, and of course IÂ’ll do my part. I donÂ’t see that as a problem; actually, I think itÂ’s a good sign for the club.<br><br>Â“Like everyone says, our team is aging, and that could be a problem because we began slowly this year. Newer, younger legs may be good for our early performance.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m not afraid for myself; IÂ’m still young, and I think IÂ’m still able to play. I just hope we can win the S.League title back and do well in the AFC Cup.Â”</div>
