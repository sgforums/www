            <div class='col-md body'>Ashley Cole is hoping Chelsea's off-field problems will disappear and the club can get back on track.<br><br>Recent tension within the club has been linked to a slump for Jose Mourinho's side which has seen them fall six points behind leaders Manchester United.<br><br>Chelsea have won just once in their last five league outings, drawing three and losing at Liverpool last weekend.<br><br>Cole, while stating the players are trying to ignore the off-field issues, concedes it may have had an impact on recent form.<br><br>"We don't know what has gone on and as players we are trying to stay away from all that and let other people deal with it," Cole said on Sky Sports News.<br><br>"But the results haven't gone too well for us of late and maybe it is down to that.<br><br>"It's not down to me it's down to other people to sort it out. I'm here to play football and whatever is going on behind the scenes I don't think there is anything I can do to change it."<br><br>Cole insists Mourinho remains in good spirits around the players despite reports of a rift between the Portuguese chief and the board.<br><br>"The manager seems happy," Cole continued. "He's always a great laugh around the lads.<br><br>"Whatever is happening doesn't seem to be affecting him around the training ground. He's got a job to do to get us winning games again and hopefully Sunday will be our start."<br><br>Meanwhile, Cole hopes the possible return of captain John Terry in the weekend's FA Cup fixture against Nottingham Forest will boost morale.<br><br>Cole added: "Having John Terry back will be good if he's involved. Everybody knows how much we've missed him, he's a great leader and captain of the club."</div>
