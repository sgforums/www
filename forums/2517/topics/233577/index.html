I still need to improve it and it's been taking longer than we thought. But I am delighted to be back involved with the lads."<br><br>Terry is now turning his attentions to getting Chelsea's title challenge back on track after last weekend's defeat to Liverpool.<br><br>The Blues captain admitted he was boosted by Arsenal's win over Manchester United as it denied Sir Alex Ferguson's men from going nine points clear at the top of the table.<br><br>"I'm disappointed that we lost at Anfield, obviously, and we need to pick ourselves up, but in a way that's already happened," added Terry.<br><br>"When Manchester United scored I thought that the game was over. But credit to Arsenal, they've given us another opportunity and it is time to put pressure on United now."</div>
