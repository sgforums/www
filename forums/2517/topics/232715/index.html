            <div class='col-md body'>Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate has confirmed his liking for Colchester's Greg Halford.<br><br>The 22-year-old has been attracting interest for a number of months and the likes of Reading and Sheffield United are understood to have seen offers shunned.<br><br>Now Boro have emerged into the race for the former England youth international, who can play at right-back or in midfield.<br><br>"I think he's a good player but he's somebody else's player," admitted Southgate.<br><br>"I wouldn't want to say too much about him."<br><br>U's boss Geraint Williams confirmed that the club were considering fresh offers for the player.<br><br>"There have been bids for Greg this week and he is being kept informed of the situation," said Williams.<br><br>"The board are considering them at the moment.<br><br>"Every bid that is put in writing for any player is considered.<br><br>"It will either be accepted or rejected and the club will take action in due course."<br><br>On other targets, Southgate confirmed that the club were inching closer to sealing a move for South Korean striker Lee Dong-gook.<br><br>"We're very close, we've just been in touch with his club and he's been going through a medical this week," he said.<br><br>"I would say just after the weekend we hope to have something in place. We'll have to apply for a work permit.<br><br>"When everything is done as well we will make an announcement."<br><br>Meanwhile, the Boro boss insisted that wantaway midfielder Fabio Rochemback had not told the club he would refuse to play for them and would go on strike until getting a move.<br><br>"Fabio's never once refused to play. There's hasn't been a meeting, it's a complete fabrication," he said.<br><br>"The situation is he has not been involved recently and he's frustrated with that, which I can understand.<br><br>"I'm pleased he's disappointed not to be playing. I don't want players here who are happy to be left out."</div>
