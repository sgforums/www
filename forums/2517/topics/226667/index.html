            <div class='col-md body'>For the second time in a week Didier Drogba climbed off the bench to grab victory for Chelsea against Glenn Roeder's Newcastle United.<br><br>First it was in the league at Stamford Bridge and then this time to guarantee the Blues a place in the semi-finals of the Carling Cup.<br><br>It was a case of unlucky 13 for Newcastle, having gone unbeaten in their previous 12 cup encounters of the season.<br><br>And ironically this was the second time in three seasons Chelsea had beaten the Magpies at this stage of the competition - the last time they went on to beat Arsenal in the final.<br><br>Newcastle, fresh from another three points over Watford made a couple of changes with skipper Scott Parker returning against his former club, while Nobby Solano returned at right-back.<br><br>Chelsea made five changes to the side that came back so dramatically to snatch that thrilling odd goal in five win at Everton.<br><br>Jose Mourinho might have rung the changes, but he still had a bench worth in the region of Â£100million and arguably the best 5-a-side team ever, in Drogba, Frank Lampard, Michael Ballack, Ashley Cole and Magnus Hedman.<br><br>With Sir Bobby Robson watching from the stands, Newcastle almost gave their former boss a goal to remember after 27 minutes. A Solano interception saw him pick out leading scorer Obafemi Martins.<br><br>There appeared little danger until the Nigerian turned to rifle a 25-yard left-footed drive beyond the despairing Henrique Hilario that crashed against the underside of the bar.<br><br>The linesman was out of position and referee Chris Foy allowed play to continue as the debate raged on as to whether the ball had crossed the line and judgement was divided.<br><br>From the resulting corner Nicky Butt struck a volley from 25 yards that Hilario acrobatically punched clear.<br><br>Then in time added on at the end the first half, Chelsea struck the woodwork when goal-shy Andriy Shevchenko, on the right, shot across Shay Given and against the foot of his far upright.<br><br>Mourinho made three second-half changes sending on Lampard, Ballack and then crucially Drogba after 75 minutes.<br><br>Three minutes after his arrival the Ivory Coast striker struck his 17th goal of the season and third in successive games, when he curled in a free-kick that Given could only help into the net.<br><br>It could easily have ended 2-0 when a poor Given clearance was volleyed straight back at goal by Lampard, who saw his effort bounce to safety off an upright.</div>
