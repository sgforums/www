            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://imgfly.com/files/291206_125945/pearce_gesture.jpg"><br><br>Manchester City boss Stuart Pearce has admitted he would consider quitting his job, if the club sold Micah Richards against his wishes.<br><br>Pearce is adamant he is under no pressure from the club to sell Richards, who has recently been linked with a big-money move to Chelsea.<br><br>Given City's relatively secure financial base, Pearce claims the final say on whether the club would part with Richards should be his.<br><br>"If I say no to any sale, then I would hope it would mean the club says no, otherwise someone else might as well manage the club," said Pearce.<br><br>"The bottom line is that I have never suggested for one minute that any of the key players in my squad, like Micah, are for sale.<br><br>"I don't think it is prudent to sell your better players. I don't think it would be beneficial to this club.<br><br>"And I don't think the kid will come to me and say he wants to go either.<br><br>"I think he wants to stay here. I would if I was 18 and my manager had picked me when I was just a pup.<br><br>"I want to keep the better players at this club and drive it forward, not backwards."<br><br>Meanwhile, Pearce hopes another of City youngsters in Stephen Ireland will build on his matchwinning performance at Sheffield United on Boxing Day.<br><br>"There is no doubt Stephen has promise," said Pearce.<br><br>"Like all youngsters at this club, he will get his chance, then the ball is in his court.<br><br>"We are encouraging him to show us what he has got. We know he likes to lay passes on for others, so it was pleasing to see him actually go on and shoot against Sheffield United.<br><br>"We have been trying to get him to do that month after month. You could see on Tuesday, the first thing he wanted to do when he got the ball was shoot, so maybe now he realises why the coaches have all been telling him to do it."</div>
