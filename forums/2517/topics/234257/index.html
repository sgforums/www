            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea ace Didier Drogba has urged strike partner Andrei Shevchenko to become more of a team player, if he wants to be a success.<br><br>Shevchenko has struggled to live up to expectations this season and he has been in and out of the team recently.<br><br>Drogba believes the pressure placed on Shevchenko following his Â£30million switch from Milan last summer has not helped the Ukrainian, as he is only focused on scoring goals rather than forging a partnership in attack.<br><br>"On Shevchenko's side, I don't really sense the desire to collaborate," Drogba told The Sun.<br><br>"I think that as a big signing, he believes he is obliged to justify his transfer fee with goals at any cost. I love to share but when I give, I appreciate it when I get something back.<br><br>"That's what happened with Hernan Crespo. But let's say it is a little different this season.<br><br>"That is a real pity because everyone would have something to gain if we really worked together. I have tried to understand his position and get an explanation.<br><br>"We know we are not rivals because, unlike in the past years, there is room for two in attack this season.<br><br>"I understand it is a really difficult situation for him to handle. But you have to think of the team first."<br><br>Meanwhile, Drogba has backed Jose Mourinho in his desire to bring in new players in this month's transfer window.<br><br>Mourinho has been at loggerheads with the club's board over their failure to support his transfer plans, with the Portuguese tactician keen to bring in a new defender to ease his side's injury problems.<br><br>However, Chelsea so far have failed to make funds available to bring in a new player.<br><br>Drogba supports Mourinho's stance and insists all the players at the club are behind their manager.<br><br>"Let's get one thing clear, when Mourinho says we need new players to help us achieve our ambitions, he is talking on behalf of the whole group," added Drogba.<br><br>"All the players here feel the same way as Jose."</div>
