            <div class='col-md body'>Billionaire owner Roman Abramovich expects Chelsea's spending in the transfer market to be reduced once the benefits are reaped from its academy.<br>European governing body Uefa may make football more competitive by curbing investment by rich benefactors.<br><br>Russian Abramovich has spent millions since taking over at Chelsea in 2003.<br><br>But he told The Observer: "Our strategy is to bring up our own players through the academy, which we have invested a lot in, and hope it gives results."<br><br>He added: "We will be spending less in the transfer market in future years."<br><br>Abramovich also denied that he had any involvement in picking the team.<br><br>However, he did confirm that he does influence Chelsea's business in the transfer market, although he insisted that boss Jose Mourinho has the final say.<br><br>"I am not involved in team selection," he said. "I cannot say I am completely not involved in buying players but my role would be significantly lower than that of the manager's.<br><br>"You cannot compare them. To give an example, this would be an impossible situation where a manager does not want a player to be bought and I try to impose ideas. It would not work."<br><br>It follows reports that suggested Abramovich was behind the decision to buy striker Andriy Shevchenko for Â£30m from AC Milan in May.<br><br>The 40-year-old stressed he was committed to Chelsea and would not lose interest if the club won the Premiership for a third successive year.<br><br>"People who know me said I will win one or two Premierships and will not be interested after that," he stated.<br><br>"The reality is that we have won two Premierships but I am more excited about this particular season than last year or the year before.<br><br>"I am getting excited before every single game. The trophy at the end is less important than the process itself."<br><br>Abramovich also gave an insight into his relationship with Mourinho.<br><br>"We do not have friendly relations but they are warm enough. Generally speaking, I treat him with great respect," he revealed.<br><br>And the Russian hinted that he has no ambitions to see Chelsea enter a European Super League.<br><br>"I don't see the risk of that," he said. "Money plays an important role in football but it is not the dominating factor.<br><br>"I don't have an opinion about Chelsea playing in a Super League.<br><br>"My feeling would be that you lose something of the beauty of the Premiership by joining something not defined at the moment."<br><br></div>
