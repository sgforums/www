            <div class='col-md body'>Glenn Roeder has dismissed reports linking Newcastle with a Â£12million January move for Peter Crouch as 'pure speculation'.<br><br>The England international has become a high-profile victim of Rafa Benitez's rotation policy at Liverpool and has been linked with a possible New Year switch to the injury-plagued Magpies.<br><br>With Shola Ameobi and Michael Owen injured, and Giuseppe Rossi returning to Manchester United, reports in the English media claimed on Friday that the North East club were lining up a Â£12million swoop to give added depth to Roeder's frontline.<br><br>However the Newcastle chief insists there is no deal in the pipeline and that talk of a potential transfer is wide of the mark, even if he is a confirmed admirer of the unconventional striker.<br><br>"Someone knows more than I do. As far as I am concerned, there has not been a deal even spoken about," Roeder insisted.<br><br>"Secondly, I really hate managers talking about other managers' players.<br><br>"Peter Crouch is a Liverpool player and I do not think Rafael Benitez would appreciate me talking about Peter Crouch when he is not a Newcastle player.<br><br>"At this moment in time, it is pure speculation and I would be surprised if he ended up becoming a Newcastle player.<br><br>"I said a month ago when I was asked, he is very talented and certainly deserves his place in the England team, in my opinion.<br><br>"But anything outside that would be unfair to Liverpool and the manager there."<br><br>Benitez recently insisted he has 'no plans' to sell Crouch, who has seen the partnership of Dirk Kuyt and Craig Bellamy restrict his chances at Anfield in recent months.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Crouch: I won't be going</strong><br><br>Peter Crouch has outlined his determination to stay at Liverpool and hopes to have given Rafa Benitez something to think about.<br><br>The striker has been heavily linked with a Â£12million move to Newcastle United after struggling to dislodge Dirk Kuyt and Craig Bellamy from the starting line-up.<br><br>But after scoring a stunning goal as the injured Bellamy's replacement against Bolton on New Year's Day, Crouch voiced his happiness at Anfield.<br><br>"I've heard all the speculation and all I can say is I'm happy here and love playing for the club," Crouch told the Liverpool Echo.<br><br>"It's a fantastic club, all the games are massive and I wouldn't want to leave.<br><br>"I see my future here and as long as the manager doesn't want me to go, I won't be going."<br><br>Benitez had been critical of Crouch's performance in the Boxing Day defeat at Blackburn Rovers, but the England international is determined to respond positively to his manager's comments.<br><br>He added: "I've had challenges throughout my career and this is another one. There are a lot of players who get rotated and I'm not the only one.<br><br>"When you get a chance, you've got to take it. Hopefully I've given the manager something to think about.<br><br>"It can get frustrating when you want to play every game and do your best for the club, but all you can do is keep working hard.<br><br>"I know the manager has got no problem with me."</div>
