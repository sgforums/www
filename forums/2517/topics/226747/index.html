            <div class='col-md body'>Charlton chairman Les Reed has aimed a swipe at Iain Dowie saying he is partly to blame for the club's slump in form.<br><br>The Addicks' season hit a new low on Tuesday when they crashed out of the Carling Cup to League Two side Wycombe at The Valley.<br><br>The defeat saw the fans turn on the players and also call for Alan Pardew to replace under-fire boss Les Reed.<br><br>Murray admits Reed has not been good enough so far having won just one of his six games in charge.<br><br>Charlton insist they will stick behind Reed and Murray blames the club's problems on Dowie's transfer flops.<br><br>Dowie spent over Â£11million in the summer, but Murray believes the players he brought in have failed to shine.<br><br>"Les is getting hammered at the moment and it is a tough spell for the club. Very tough," said Murray<br><br>"We have to see some changes on the pitch - we were awful against Wycombe. But those who watch Charlton regularly will say maybe it was the same under Iain Dowie. Maybe we haven't got a good enough squad.<br><br>"At the moment, we are carrying on as we are. We have got three key games coming up against Middlesbrough, Fulham and Aston Villa - and then we'll make some changes to the team in January.<br><br>"It is unfair on Les at the moment. His current record is similar to Iain's - not good enough. But are both managers at fault? Or maybe there is not the right balance in the squad.<br><br>"We will spend some money in January but we will have to wheel and deal, although we definitely won't be selling Darren Bent. We spent a lot of money in the summer - Â£11m we didn't have to spend.<br><br>"We backed Iain, they were Iain's signings - but I had never heard of (Souleymane) Diawara, apparently the best centre-half you've never heard of.<br><br>"For a club like ours to spend Â£3.7m on one player like that is a fortune.<br><br>"Some people must not just look at Les but what went on before.<br><br>"Also, maybe Alan Curbishley had that ability of getting a bit more out of some players than his successors have."<br><br>Murray also played down talk that the club could make a move for former West Ham boss Alan Pardew to replace Reed.<br><br>"People say why don't we get Pardew next, but maybe he needs some time out of the game," added Murray.<br><br>"And a lot of people are saying that Pardew's key was his assistant, Peter Grant."</div>
