            <div class='col-md body'>Rafa Benitez has called on the Anfield board to back him with more money and to move quicker in the transfer market.<br><br>The Liverpool boss has taken the unusual move to condemn his club's own actions in the transfer market as he feels The Reds are missing out on some top talent.<br><br>Benitez was speaking after seeing Arsenal's second string tear his own reserves apart on Tuesday as they cruised to a 6-3 victory.<br><br>"If Arsenal can play nine reserves and score six at Anfield, people should be asking why," said Benitez.<br><br>"It's not because of one game, it's because of many reasons.<br><br>"There is a lesson for the whole of our club. That lesson is that if you want to compete at the top level you must be able to spend a lot of money - not only on your first team but on the young players and the reserves.<br><br>"My scouting department has done an excellent job but sometimes we go too slowly as a club to make signings we need.<br><br>"We need to work quickly. And when we do, there is not a lot of money. Arsenal spent Â£4million on Abou Diaby, Â£4million on Denilson, Â£8million on Theo Walcott and Julio Baptista is a Â£22million player.<br><br>"We had seven players with first-team experience and still we could not win."<br><br>Benitez did confirm the club were in the process of tying up deals for Sampdoria's Danielle Padelli and James McCarthy of Hamilton.<br><br>"We are signing a young Italian goalkeeper on loan with an option for longer," said Benitez.<br><br>"We have also been working for many weeks to sign James McCarthy, a young Scot [from Hamilton Academicals].<br><br>"These are deals we are doing because we want to build for the future. But without spending money it is difficult.<br><br>"Arsenal have two or three players, for example, who we were monitoring but couldn't sign because we didn't have enough money."</div>
