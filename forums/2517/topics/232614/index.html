            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has moved to clarify Gabriel Heinze's future at Manchester United, with the Scot denying reports which suggested the Argentine defender was in the final few months of his contract.<br><br>Heinze has struggled to nail down a regular starting berth at Old Trafford since recovering from injury and he had been linked with moves to Tottenham and Milan.<br><br>The buccaneering left-back had been quoted as saying his contract was due to expire in the summer, but Ferguson has moved to reassure the club's fans by insisting Heinze's deal is not up for renewal until 2009.<br><br>"One paper said his contract finishes in June. That's wrong, it ends in 2009," stated Ferguson.<br><br>"When I read that I immediately went diving for my file. I was sure that wasn't right. We don't allow these things to happen."<br><br>Asked whether Heinze had a future at United, Ferguson said: "Absolutely, of course."<br><br>Ferguson is reported to be targeting Southampton youngster Gareth Bale, but the Scot admits he has made little progress in his bid to improve his squad.<br><br>"We're hitting a brick wall [with bringing players in]," added the Scot. "I make the point every year, not a lot happens in January. It's usually very quiet.<br><br>"Ourselves, Chelsea, Arsenal are generally very quiet. Blackburn have done a bit of business, Portsmouth have done a bit of business. They have got two or three players in Portsmouth.<br><br>"Aston Villa are desperate to get players in. I spoke to Martin O'Neill last week and he is finding it difficult and it is not easy in January."</div>
