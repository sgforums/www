            <div class='col-md body'>Calling the S.League Awards Night a night full of stars may sound a tad clichÃ©, but thatÂ’s what it truly was, and thereÂ’s no real reason to describe it in any other way.<br><br>Not that you canÂ’t try; it was a night full of humour and irreverence, a night chockfull of shocks and surprises, a night of wine and dine, a night of merry-making and photo-taking.<br><br>But for the most part, it was a night full of stars. Some shy, some straight-up, some suave, some surprised, and some substitutes Â– Sengkang PunggolÂ’s Haris Â“IÂ’m not Kim GrantÂ” Sumri comes to mind Â– but all stars.<br><br>And as the local football fraternity gathered on November 22 at MediaCorp Studios Auditorium to celebrate an excellent 11th year of S.League football, the biggest stars of the season shared their thoughts with sleague.com as they received their trophies.<br><br>Balestier KhalsaÂ’s Kengne Ludovick led the line of prize-winners, pipping Young Lions hotshot Khairul Amri and three others to land the Maxell Young Player of the Year award, the first trophy to be presented on the evening.<br><br>The confidence and courage he usually shows on the field was clearly missing when he collected the award. But who can blame him when he has to give a thank-you speech in front of a whole auditorium of fans, friends and members of the football circle?<br><br>Â“IÂ’m very happy to win the award this year, after missing out on it in my first season,Â” he told sleague.com in an off-stage interview later, clearly more composed.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not easy to win it this year, especially with tough challengers like Khairul Amri. Whatever the result, someoneÂ’s going to be sad because he is going to miss out.<br><br>Â“But at least the other challengers are still young. IÂ’m getting older, and I cannot keep this award next season because IÂ’m already 23, so itÂ’s important I grab this last chance.<br><br>Â“At least I have done something this time for Balestier, and people who may not have expected much of the club now see how far we have progressed. The team has improved a lot, and I want to help it improve even more.Â”<br><br>SAFFC coach Richard Bok bagged the Mikasa Coach of the Year award, fending off stiff challenges from four other contenders, including previous incumbent Vorawan Chitavanich of Tampines Rovers.<br><br>As usual, the 37-year-old underplayed his role in bringing his team to glory, but after nearly a decade of working his way up from the bottom, he was finally able to enjoy some personal glory after an excellent first season as the WarriorsÂ’ head coach.<br><br>He looked dapper in his suit too as he stood in the limelight, although nothing could compare to the solid all-black outfit he was wearing in the video introducing the Coach of the Year nominees, cast as a mafia-like group of ball stealers.<br><br>Bok was certainly the most convincing actor in the video, so donÂ’t be surprised if he switches jobs! But for now, heÂ’s totally happy guiding SAFFC towards glitz and glory.<br><br>Â“I really thank the club for giving me the opportunity to lead this fantastic team, and I canÂ’t do it without them,Â” he told sleague.com.<br><br>Â“All the hard work and perseverance IÂ’ve put in for the past ten years since taking up coaching has paid off now. Winning the league title was a team thing; this oneÂ’s personal!<br><br>Â“Back in 2003, I had a dream to lead the Warriors to the championship, and IÂ’ve finally realized that dream. So to win this award felt really good.<br><br>Â“My playing career was cut short because of illness ten years ago, but this is a worthy substitute for playing. Who knows? After tonight, I might even have a shot at acting!Â”<br><br>The big winner of the night, though, is undoubtedly Woodlands WellingtonÂ’s Laakkad Abdelhadi, who walked away with the double haul of being both RHB Top Scorer and NTUC Income Player of the Year.<br><br>So animated and loud was the Moroccan in his delight and surprise, he received a rousing ovation from not just his supporters, but members of all the fan clubs!<br><br>Laakkad was at a loss for words as he went on stage twice, hardly helped by the fact that he speaks very little English and therefore found it hard to express his joy.<br><br>But there was of course, little doubt just how expressive and confident his football was.<br><br>Â“How do I feel? Very happy, of course!Â” he told reporters afterwards in French.<br><br>Â“But it will not be easy for me to achieve something similar next year. This was my first year here; next year, everybody will already know who Laakkad Abdelhadi is.<br><br>Â“I will try my best to maintain my performances, but Woodlands will go through many changes in personnel next year. Of course, there will also be pressure on me to improve.<br><br>Â“I just hope that the team will click quickly next year and perform even better. I look forward to playing for a team that will be able to challenge for the championship.Â”<br><br>Full List of Winners:<br><br>NTUC Income Player of the Year:<br>Laakkad Abdelhadi (Woodlands Wellington)<br><br>MAXELL Young Player of the Year:<br>Kengne Ludovick (Balestier Khalsa)<br><br>MIKASA Coach of the Year:<br>Richard Bok (SAFFC)<br><br>POLAR Fan Club of the Year:<br>Singapore Armed Forces FC<br><br>SMRT Referee of the Year:<br>Abdul Malik Bashir<br><br>SINGTEL Assistant Referee of the Year:<br>John Chia Eng Wah<br><br>LEVI'S Story of the Year:<br>"For Love of the Beautiful Game" by Samuel Zhang, Football Weekly<br><br>Singapore POOLS Picture of the Year:<br>"Khairul" by Don Wong, TODAY<br><br>RHB Top Scorer Award:<br>Laakkad Abdelhadi (Woodlands Wellington)<br><br>Singapore POOLS Fair Play Award:<br>Young Lions<br><br>TIGER BEER Goal of the Year Award:<br>Kim Grant (Sengkang Punggol)<br><br>FAS People's Choice Awards:<br>Khairul Amri (Young Lions)<br><br>FAS Special Awards:<br>Mrs Angela Teh<br>Mr Lim Kia Tong<br>Mr Shamsul Maidin<br><br>100 International Caps:<br>Aide Iskandar<br>S Subramani[/img]</div>
