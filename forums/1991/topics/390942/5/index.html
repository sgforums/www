              <p>Be careful. Last time got one serial killer looking for young boys. Protect yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>John Wayne Gacy, Jr.</strong> (March 17, 1942 – May 10, 1994) was an <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States"><span style="color: #0645ad;">American</span></a> <a title="Serial killer" href="/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killer</span></a> active between 1972 and 1978. Until he was arrested, Gacy raped and murdered at least 33 young men and boys, mostly teenagers. Although some of his victims' bodies were found in the <a title="Des Plaines River" href="/wiki/Des_Plaines_River"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Des Plaines River</span></a>, he buried 26 of them in the small crawl space underneath the basement of his home and three more elsewhere on his property. He became known as the "Killer Clown" due to his charitable services at fundraising events and at children's parties where he would dress up as "Pogo the Clown," a character he devised himself.</p>

              <p>Gacy attended four different high schools but dropped out of every one, never actually graduating.

              <p>Gacy's second wife divorced him eight months later, and Gacy began to kill more frequently as he now had the house to himself. Between April and October 1976, Gacy killed a minimum of eight youths between the ages of 14 and 18, seven of whom were buried in his crawlspace, and one beneath his dining room floor. In December 1976, another Gacy employee, Gregory Godzik, disappeared. Godzik had worked for PDM for only three weeks before he disappeared. In the time he had worked for Gacy, he had informed his family Gacy had had him "dig trenches for some kind of (drain) tiles" in his crawlspace.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESullivanMaiken2000184_63-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESullivanMaiken2000184-63"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Godzik's parents and older sister, Eugenia, contacted Gacy about Greg's disappearance. Gacy claimed to the family that Greg had run away from home, and had indicated to Gacy prior to his disappearance that he wished to do so. Gacy also claimed to have received a recorded answering machine message from Godzik shortly after the youth had disappeared. When asked if he could play back the message to Godzik's parents, Gacy stated he had erased the message.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESullivanMaiken2000184_63-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESullivanMaiken2000184-63"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELinedecker198092.E2.80.9393_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinedecker198092.E2.80.9393-64"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

After several hours of assaulting and torturing the youth, Gacy drove Donnelly to his place of work, removed the handcuffs from the youth's wrists and released him. Donnelly reported the assault and Gacy was questioned about the assault on January 6, 1978. Gacy admitted to having had <em>"slave-sex"</em> with Donnelly, but insisted everything was consensual.

Once back at Gacy's house, the victim would be handcuffed or tied in another way, then choked with a rope or a board as they were sexually assaulted.

Many of his victims had been killed with a <a title="Tourniquet" href="/wiki/Tourniquet"><span style="color: #0645ad;">tourniquet</span></a>, which Gacy referred to as his <em>"rope trick."</em> Occasionally, the victim had convulsed for an <em>"hour or two"</em> after the rope trick before dying.</p>
