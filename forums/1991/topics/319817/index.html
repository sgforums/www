However, you cannot blame him for feeling down despite abiding his girlfriend's wishes. Ask yourselves people, how would you feel if you are standing in his shoes, and how would you deal with it?</p>
              <p>Having said all that, I do not advocate sex as a monetary transaction though.</p>

              <p>Yes precisely, that's why I said what I said - "Having said all that, I do not advocate sex as a monetary
                                      transaction though." I do not think he should be seeking paid sex either.</p>
