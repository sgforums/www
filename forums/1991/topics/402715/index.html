              <p>hmm.....old uncle share my personal life story here....going 30 this year...</p>
              <p>together with this girl 3 years, total time i caught her cheating on me, 8 times with 6 different guys...i forgave her every single time.</p>
              <p>call me a cuckold? maybe.... </p>
              <p>i cannot satisfy her? not being egoistic, but she has an orgasm at least once everytime we are making love. how sure am i that she is not faking it? let's just say i am not a novice when it comes to love making....i still get ' invites' from ex gfs....</p>
              <p>i am too soft? i assure you, i can be very ' hard' on her. (no pun intended)</p>
              <p>the fact is? she is too spoilt and tends to do whatever she likes...this, she admit herself, not i say one. Yet, she really wants to change. Again, not i say one, she said it.</p>
              <p>before you judge however, lets get something straight:</p>
              <p>i enjoy sex with her, but it doesnt mean that i wun enjoy sex with another gal. was she the best sex partner i had? No. if the opportunity presents itself for me to have sex with another girl, would i do it? Definitely MAYBE....Why? my life is too short not to experience different things...no human likes to eat abalone every day.....including girls.</p>
              <p>So, ask yourself this: if you put urself in the same environment with the same thinking and brought up in the same manner like her, would you have succumbed? if the Answer is YES, then you better know that you are no better then her. if you are no better then her, then don't judge, yet.</p>
              <p>a good litmus test: answer yourself honestly on the following 3 questions; in succession:</p>
              <p>1.  do you love him / her and see him / her as a possible companion for life?</p>
              <p>2. can he / she fullfill your sexual desires totally? if its a hesitant maybe not....</p>
              <p>3. do you find it worthy to stick to 1 partner for sex for the rest of your short life &amp; deprieve yousrlef of other possible experiences in life?</p>
              <p>if the answer to qn 2 is a RESOUNDING yes, then you are definitely ready for a lifetime commitment...but whether your parter is or not, that is a different story.</p>
              <p>if you had proceeded to qn3, whatever the answer maybe, that answer and the reasons behind it, is YOU; it is who you are and you should NOT be ashamed of who you are.</p>
              <p>continuing the long story short: we are still together today, and she is really making a lot of effort to change....and it is really working ....everyday she finds ways and means to prove to me she is trying (or maybe, proving to herself). she has gone 'clean' for the past 1 year. (i assure you, i conduct very very stringent surprise checks on her)</p>
              <p>will we get married? we don't know.....but what we do know, is that we probably will never be fully seperated for the rest of our lives, no matter what kind of relationship we will have in future. </p>

              <p>when i decided to post my life story, i already accepted i would get snide remarks like small-man's, thus am not surprised.</p>
              <p>naturally, a man's first instinct would be to say: tell her to fuck off. or be revengeful and create a set up where the girl's life can be destroyed, permanently. i can assure you, having personally lived through this experience, its a mental torture to me, and i have to admit that i sought professional counselling at a point in time.</p>
              <p>let me just pose 1 qn here for all to think: take 1 step back and look at the entire thing. you know you would have done the same thing if you were her; so, what is it going to be? it is acceptable for you (the guy) to have sex with others (if you are the kind that will succumb) &amp; still hope she will forgive you, but you will not forgive her if she did the same to you? that's not so much of a man isn't it? more like an egoistic walking piece of meat.</p>
              <p>if however, you answered a resounding YES to qn3 (in my previous post), you are obviously a very faithful and principled centred person and hence the above question would not have been applicable to you because you belive in sticking to 1 partner and will feel betrayed if your partner does not do the same. it would be natural.</p>
              <p>Thus, small-man; a REAL man don't just see every girl as an outlet of your sexual needs; they see girls as humans who make mistakes too. Period.</p>

              <p>hmm.....old uncle share my personal life story here....going 30 this year...</p>
              <p>together with this girl 3 years, total time i caught her cheating on me, 8 times with 6 different guys...i forgave her every single time.</p>
              <p>call me a cuckold? maybe.... </p>
              <p>i cannot satisfy her? not being egoistic, but she has an orgasm at least once everytime we are making love. how sure am i that she is not faking it? let's just say i am not a novice when it comes to love making....i still get ' invites' from ex gfs....</p>
              <p>i am too soft? i assure you, i can be very ' hard' on her. (no pun intended)</p>
              <p>the fact is? she is too spoilt and tends to do whatever she likes...this, she admit herself, not i say one. Yet, she really wants to change. Again, not i say one, she said it.</p>
              <p>before you judge however, lets get something straight:</p>
              <p>i enjoy sex with her, but it doesnt mean that i wun enjoy sex with another gal. was she the best sex partner i had? No. if the opportunity presents itself for me to have sex with another girl, would i do it? Definitely MAYBE....Why? my life is too short not to experience different things...no human likes to eat abalone every day.....including girls.</p>
              <p>So, ask yourself this: if you put urself in the same environment with the same thinking and brought up in the same manner like her, would you have succumbed? if the Answer is YES, then you better know that you are no better then her. if you are no better then her, then don't judge, yet.</p>
              <p>a good litmus test: answer yourself honestly on the following 3 questions; in succession:</p>
              <p>1.  do you love him / her and see him / her as a possible companion for life?</p>
              <p>2. can he / she fullfill your sexual desires totally? if its a hesitant maybe not....</p>
              <p>3. do you find it worthy to stick to 1 partner for sex for the rest of your short life &amp; deprieve yousrlef of other possible experiences in life?</p>
              <p>if the answer to qn 2 is a RESOUNDING yes, then you are definitely ready for a lifetime commitment...but whether your parter is or not, that is a different story.</p>
              <p>if you had proceeded to qn3, whatever the answer maybe, that answer and the reasons behind it, is YOU; it is who you are and you should NOT be ashamed of who you are.</p>
              <p>continuing the long story short: we are still together today, and she is really making a lot of effort to change....and it is really working ....everyday she finds ways and means to prove to me she is trying (or maybe, proving to herself). she has gone 'clean' for the past 1 year.
