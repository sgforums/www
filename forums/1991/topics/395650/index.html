            <div class='col-md body'><p>1. <strong>Learn to relax.</strong> <br> Being tense all over is part of the phase that helps bring on the point of  <br> no return. Once you feel yourself at the beginning stages of hitting that <br> point, slow down and relax. If you have to stop altogether, do so. Wait <br> for the feeling to leave and begin again.<br> 2. <strong>Develop a slow and deep breathing pattern.</strong> <br> Orgasm and breathing are linked! Rapid shallow breathing will take you <br> straight over the edge while relaxing and taking deep slow breaths will <br> help you last longer.<br> 3. <strong>Master the "squeeze method".</strong> <br> Masturbate until you feel the point of no return approaching. Then grab <br> your penis and apply pressure at the spot just below the head and where <br> the shaft meet. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds or until the urge to cum leaves <br> altogether. This method alone, if done devotedly, can cure premature <br> ejaculation all by itself!</p></div>

              <p>Did you know it takes the average woman <br> about 12-14 minutes before being able to <br> climax? What’s even worse, did you know<br> it takes the average man only 2-3 minutes!  <br> The problem faced by almost every guy is being able to last long enough
              for our partner to finish. We’re not being selfish or inconsiderate. It
              just happens. So, we’ve all tried the cliché responses of thinking
              about baseball, a math problem, grandma in a tube top, or anything else
              that’ll keep us from losing it. But does it really work? <br> <br> Try as you might, it is still going to happen. The male body was just
              designed to orgasm before a woman’s. Speed is built into the pesky Y
              chromosome of the species to ensure our survival. So, maybe that’s a
              good thing. After all, if you give a woman enough time, she’ll sober up
              and realize the horrible mistake of sleeping with you in the first
              place. But for those of us who aren’t as worried that a woman will run
              away screaming when the lights come on, here are a few things you can
              do to please and satisfy your partner:<br> <br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;">Tip #1: Play it Cool</span></strong><br> <br> Age has a lot to do with your climax control. Someone older and more
              experienced has had time to figure out what works for him to delay
              ejaculation. Also with age comes the familiarity to be relaxed and
              comfortable during sex. The biggest problem for teens and young men is
              the anxiety of being with someone new or being nervous about sex in
              general and your skills at it. Or more likely, the sight and especially
              the touch of a naked woman is a billion times more intense than your
              “alone time” with the hidden stash of girlie magazines and tapes and of
              course . . . ta da! The Internet! Mmm . . . electronic porn.<br> <br> Being able to relax during sex goes a long way. Realize that sex isn’t
              a competition or a test of your manhood. Once you get comfortable in
              your own skin (and hers), you’ll be able to enjoy the moment and your
              fears and anxieties about sex will pass<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;">Tip #2: Masturbation</span></strong><br> <br> Another problem with youth – but also a huge factor at any age – is
              masturbation. Let’s face it. You’ve just discovered the wonderland that
              is your body and the rides are FREEEEE!! The problem arises when you
              take a few too many turns. Over masturbation can actually make you come
              faster. You’re teaching your body what feels good and training it to
              orgasm even faster than it already does. Remember? 2 to 3 minutes!<br> <br> We’re not asking you to stop masturbating. What’s the point of living
              if that were the case? What we ARE asking you to do is to make sure you
              don’t over do it. Excessive masturbation makes your penis more
              sensitive. Also, the parasympathetic nerves responsible for ejaculation
              control happen to be the same as the ones that give you an erection.
              Constant use can “wear out” the nerves and make it harder for you to
              not only control ejaculation, but to get a firm erection in the first
              place.<br> <br> Also, over masturbation exerts your body’s resources of hormones and
              nutrients. You think sperm just magically appears? Well, sometimes. But
              for the other times, the ingredients needed by your body to produce
              your demon seeds are also needed for other sexual and bodily functions.
              Regulating how much you use up can go a long way in keeping you from
              coming too soon<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;">Tip #3: Health and Diet</span></strong><br> <br> Your age and health have a lot to do with your sexual abilities.
              Everyone reaches a point of life when the body begins to slow down and
              your risk factor for certain health concerns rise. Men have to worry
              about their prostate health as they pass the age of forty; fatty foods
              and genetics may make your blood pressure an issue; a low production of
              testosterone due to age or diet may be a factor; or an imbalance of
              hormones due to hyperthyroidism or some other hormonal condition may
              all reduce your ability to delay orgasm. By ensuring your good health,
              you may just add a few more minutes to your bedroom escapades. <br> <br> If you already have health problems, then realize that the medication
              you are currently taking may actually reduce your sexual endurance. A
              loss of libido, a weak erection, and premature ejaculation are common
              side effects to some drugs. Besides prescription and over-the-counter
              medication, illegal drugs (such as marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, etc.)
              are notorious for taking the wind out of your sails. Most likely to
              happen are impotence and a diminished sex drive, but problems with
              ejaculation control can also occur.<br> <br> Lastly, just be aware that your diet and the amount of exercise you get
              can affect your time in the sheets. Caffeine has actually been
              documented to shorten your intercourse length. Large amounts of red
              meat and fatty foods can affect sexual health. Even weight gainers and
              testosterone boosters for body builders and exercise enthusiasts can
              ruin your ejaculation control. So control your diet and regulate the
              amount of exercise you’re getting – it helps more than your general
              health. <br> <br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;">Tip #4: Techniques and Exercises </span></strong><br> <br> If you’re looking for a more proactive approach to delaying orgasms,
              then the best thing to do is to “train” yourself to control the point
              of ejaculation. Like your reflex reaction to cry like a little girl
              when you get slapped, your body has an instinct of when to orgasm when
              stimulated. There are several things you can do to delay this reaction,
              such as the Natural Ejaculation Control Technique, where controlled
              breathing and meditative efforts help teach your body to endure
              physical stimulation. <br> <br> Another technique known as the Masters and Johnson’s Squeeze Method
              teaches how to find the point of no return and learning to avoid it. Or
              the similar form known as the Start-Stop Method. Both of these
              techniques require a partner and are designed to build your tolerance
              to the heightened stimulation of sex and to control when you ejaculate.<br> <br> A simpler option known as the Kegel Exercise is extremely easy to do.
              It’s so easy in fact, that I’m doing it right now as I’m typing this!
              (No I’m not. But I could be. It’s that easy!) But one thing you should
              be aware of is overuse of the Kegel Exercise can actually have the
              opposite effect of what you want. That’s right. You could actually kill
              your ability to control ejaculation, so be cautious.<br> <br> <br> <strong><span style="color: blue;">Tip #5: Herbal Products and Drugs</span></strong><br> <br> Perhaps the easiest and most effective way to give you that extra
              endurance during sex is through herbal supplements. Your body loses a
              lot of nutrients, chemicals, and hormones throughout the normal course
              of the day. Extracurricular activities like masturbation and sex
              further drain your body’s resource of these essential building blocks.
              Herbs offer a fast and simple way to replenish these essential
              materials and provide extra energy. The added benefit of improving your
              general vitality and any existing health problem makes it a natural way
              for better healing. <br> Dietary supplements further aid orgasm delay by strengthening the
              nerves responsible for ejaculation control. These sexual nerves – also
              responsible for a hard erection – can be weakened by the friction and
              overuse of masturbation, insufficient neurotransmitters (the substance
              that transmits nerve impulses) due to improper diet and drugs, or the
              blockage of sexual stimulus from alcohol and smoking. By nourishing and
              fortifying these nerves, you can dramatically increase your sexual
              stamina. (Want to learn more about how herbs strengthen sexual nerves?
              Click Here)<br> <br> Along with herbs, there are topical agents to desensitize the penis.
              Numbing the sensation of sex can help add the few extra minutes you’re
              looking for. However, your partner may not enjoy the smell and trouble
              of this method. Also, topical agents must be used continuously for
              desired results. Herbs are easier to take. And once your body has
              healed and you’ve reinforced your ejaculation control, you can choose
              to stop taking herbal supplements. Don’t cover up the problem. Solve it.</p>
