              <p>G-spot is the nickname for the Grafenberg spot, named after the guy who
              noted its erotic significance in the 1950's. The G-spot in women is
              analogous to the prostate in men (which seems to play a more direct
              role in sex and procreation).<br> <br> The G-spot is a gland located behind the pubic bone and around the
              urethra. It can be massaged or stimulated by reaching up about two
              finger joints distance on the upper surface of the vagina. If already
              aroused, some women will find that stimulation of this area leads to an
              intense orgasm which may be of a different quality from a clitoral
              orgasm. Stimulation of the spot produces a variety of initial feelings:
              discomfort, feeling the need to urinate, or a pleasurable feeling. With
              additional stroking the area may begin to swell and the sensations may
              become more pleasureable. Continuing stimulation may produce an intense
              orgasm. Like the prostate, the G-spot can produce an fluid like semen
              (but not as viscous) which may be released on orgasm- even known to
              "squirt" a couple of centimeters.<br> <br> For comparison, the prostate in men is also located behind the pubic
              bone and around the urethra. The two ejaculatory ducts also end here
              (bringing sperm from the testis via vas deferens). The prostate can be
              reached through the anus (as in Doctors performing a prostate exam).
              Continued stimulation of the prostate may produce intense orgasms in
              men. The prostate is the glad which produces most of the seminal fluid
              that is ejaculated (other than the sperm in the semen).<br> <br> For those who never had a close look at a vulva before and are a bit
              worried, I should say that, except when quite sincerely aroused, female
              genitals are usually clearly set out. The clitoris likes to hide under
              it's own little hood, the lips stick pretty close to one another, and
              it is quite likely that if the owner of the genitals is standing up and
              unaroused you won't really see more than some enticing tufts of hair
              and maybe the outer lips. People whose knowledge of these matters
              derives mainly from Playboy pictorials may be quite surprised that
              there's more here than "just a hole".<br> <br> Traditionally it was thought that all of the sensation available from
              the female genitals derived from the lips, entrance to the vagina, and
              especially the clitoris. In other words, what you see above. It was
              thought that the interior of the vagina was practically numb to sexual
              sensation.<br> <br> Now one of those old coots who spent his"professional" time sticking
              their noses into other people's intimate businesses was a guy called
              Grafenberg. Dr. G. had this theory that there was an area within the
              vagina, which was called the Grafenberg spot or G-spot, which not only
              was sexually sensitive but which could trigger bigger and better female
              orgasms than the clitoris and the exterior bits could by themselves.<br> <br> Now the trouble with Dr. G.'s claim was that not everyone seemed to be
              able to find this spot, which he reckoned was analogous with the male
              prostate gland, and those that did find it didn't necessarily like it
              much, and so there was some controversy, especially in the popular
              press. A number of folks who did find it and did like it eventually
              soused out the mechanics of the spot, and in recent years there have
              been a number of good books about it.<br> <br> The story is basically this: The G-spot is a flat area about as big as
              a nickel, about two inches inside the vagina. It's just behind the
              pubic bone, on the vaginal wall that is closest to the belly button.
              You can reach it with your index finger. If the genitals you're playing
              with are not very aroused then you might have difficulty finding it, or
              it might not feel very interesting or nice to the owner. The trick is
              to make those genitals very aroused, and then have a go at the G-spot.
              The best way is probably cunnilingus, which is Latin for having a lick,
              but any technique that provides good stimulation of the clitoris will
              do for starters.<br> <br> Now bear in mind that I'm skipping over a lot here. I strongly
              recommend a good deal of foreplay before diving into a woman's muff,
              like at least half an hour, and longer if you like. If you can manage
              dinner and a good bath beforehand, even better. Actually, I imagine
              that a bath or a shower before sex is a reasonably good idea anyway,
              because we're dealing with equipment that can be quite undesirable if
              it's on the nose when it's on the nose, if you take my meaning.
              Besides, bathing together is fun, if that's an option.</p>
              <p>So, presuming that your woman is content with the preliminaries and
              you're going hunting, you're going to have to begin by relaxing. If
              you're so messed up that slamming your dick in the door has a
              pleasurable side to it (sorry feminists, I'm not certain what the
              female equivalent to that state is) then forget all this until you've
              had a bloody good rogering or two.<br> <br> Once you've achieved a state of patient interest, slowly start to
              stimulate the clitoris. You've got to be really careful here, because
              clitori are damned sensitive little beggars, and too much of a good
              thing is not really a good thing at all. Also, different clitori like
              different things. Some like very direct stimulation, some prefer one
              side or the other, others are so sensitive that they like you to mainly
              stick to the clitoral hood or the labia. Some like a circular motion,
              and others like to be lightly flicked back and forth. The best way to
              find out what your clitoris likes is to ask it's owner, and if she
              doesn't know then do some experimentation. That's fun too, so don't get
              pissed off if it takes a little while to figure out what's good for you.<br> <br> As I said, my preferred method is cunnilingus, but if the owner of your
              clitoris doesn't like that for some reason ("no, my dear, it's not
              germy and it does taste rather nice") then you'll have to use your
              fingers. I find that the best thing for clitori is a nice regular
              stroke, with regular exotic interludes. Basically it's the same thing
              as for penises - you don't want all sorts of unpredictable jerking
              around, and you don't want to feel like it's caught in a vise, and you
              don't want it to feel like it's attached to a reciprocating engine
              going at 5000 revs. Take it easy. If the owner of your clitoris wants
              more stimulation you'll notice her writhing around and pushing it at
              you. If she wants less then she'll draw away. If it's just right then
              she'll sit where she is and enjoy it. Pay attention to what she does.
              When it comes to pleasuring a woman, she says a lot more with her
              actions than with her words.<br> <br> So, you've got a nice regular stroke going - say, seven strokes and
              then something exotic, and then another seven strokes and another
              something exotic. Of course the G spot is in the vagina, and you're
              going to have to know what's going on in there if you're going to find
              it and do something with it. Slowly insert a finger or two. Don't grab,
              because that can be rude and distracting.<br> <br> Now hopefully the vagina that you're dealing with is well lubricated,
              but that won't necessarily be the case. If you spend a long time at
              this even the juiciest woman can start to dry out, so it never hurts to
              have a little lubricant handy, just in case. I'd recommend K-Y jelly,
              which you should be able to find at any pharmacy, but there are lots of
              alternatives. One that I wouldn't recommend is Vaseline - too thick.
              Another is baby oil, it's too thin.<br> <br> You can entertain yourself by running your finger around the inside of
              the vagina, trying to discern its shape. Unless your female is coming
              (having an orgasm), you should probably find that the vagina is
              reasonably form-fitting, although some are tighter than others. If your
              female is not coming or consciously causing contractions you'll
              probably find that the vagina isn't doing anything in particular, just
              sitting there and producing lubricant. If you bring your finger to the
              front wall of the vagina then you'll find it less yielding than the
              rest, because there is a bone in front of it called the pubic bone,
              part of the pelvis. If you feel along this unyielding section or just
              beyond you may find a slightly raised area. This is the G spot. It
              might not be raised, but it will engorge once your female starts to
              come.<br> <br> Don't poke this spot yet. Don't do anything with it, yet. At best you
              won't have any effect, and at worst you'll be distracting. You've got
              to wait for your female to start to come. Now this might happen in
              thirty seconds, or it might take an hour, and you've just got to be
              patient and keep things regular and smooth. You'll be able to tell your
              woman is coming when:<br> <br> she tells you: she moans one hell of a lot and her breathing changes<br> she flushes: over her face, neck and/or chest<br> her vagina begins to flutter rhythmically around your finger<br> <br> You may see all of these things, or you may see none of them. If you
              miss an orgasm, don't stop unless you or she wants to. Women have
              startling recuperative powers, particularly when they're receiving the
              right level of attention, and generosity is its own reward. Multiple
              orgasms are not mythical.<br> <br> Once you believe that your woman is coming you should shift your attention from the clitoris to the G spot. Keep up</p>

              <div id="post_message_1134">The G-Spot is a small "mound" of tissue
              inside the vagina, between ten-cent coin size, which responds to light
              - moderate pressure. The G-Spot are raised tissues within the area of
              the ceiling inside the vagina, which has high concentration of sexual
              nerves producing hormones similar to male's prostate gland. <br> <br> <strong><span style="color: darkorange;">Method of Locating the G-Spot</span></strong><br> Imagine your lover lying on her back, legs spread. Your position is
              between her legs. Slide a finger inside her vagina, palm up. With your
              middle finger straighten and curve it towards yourself (as if you were
              gesturing to someone to "come here"). This gesture pressed area would
              be pretty near the "G-Spot". You may feel a slight swelling (if she's
              excited) at the point where the G-Spot is. <br> <br> When she is excited, this area (more often than not) is the best way to
              bring her to orgasm. You work your way back to it gradually, teasing
              her (typically, this works best) with your fingers, slowly and gently.
              It's easier to hit the right area with two fingers, but this may not be
              comfortable for her, depending on how "tight" she is at that moment.
              When you have your fingers around the right area, try gently pressing,
              not too quickly. The movement should be fairly rhythmic. Better effect
              if you're licking her clitoris (or near it, depending on the woman,
              some/few women, the labia (lips) are sensitive to licking also) at the
              same time. The licking should be the primary activity. <br> <br> The G-Spot orgasm is different experience for all woman. Just like With
              some women, they can also experience different kinds of orgasms ranging
              from vaginal, clitoral, anal, and even breast stimulation...but with
              other women, all orgasms feels pretty much the same. The G-Spot orgasm
              not only feels different but also causes her body to react differently.
              <br> <br> First, it often causes a "push out" orgasm. The area around, or "above"
              (farther inside, that is) your fingers seems to swell up or to contract
              toward the opening of her vagina. <br> <br> If you find the right combination of pushing back when this happens,
              and slacking off to let it push out, you can cause her to have multiple
              orgasm. I've managed to keep this pattern of build-up, orgasm, plateau,
              orgasm, build-up, orgasm for over four hours, with one lover. We
              stopped when, though she wanted to go on, she was so exhausted that she
              really had to stop. <br> <br> G-Spot orgasms sometimes produces huge amount of lubrication. With the
              extra wetness combines with the push-out orgasm, you get actual
              ejaculation (Squirting) ...like a guy, but much better tasting. The
              built up juices can shoot out in volume that you, or she, may be afraid
              that she lost control of her bladder, which will not happen. The fear
              that she squirt can be enhanced by the feeling of wanting to pee
              feeling because the urethra is behind the g-spot. <br> <br> Scientifically both sexes, sexual stimulation/excitement prevents
              peeing, try to pee when you are arouse which would prove my
              explaination.<br> <br> Morning hard-on for male is because this reflex action is to keep him
              from wetting the bed with urine that was built up while sleeping.<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: darkorange;">Techniques of G-Spot Arousal</span></strong><br> Licking the Alphabet/Numbers<br> Believe it or not, one letter at a time, on and around her
              clitoris/vulva works. The real goal is to keep regular and rhythmic and
              changing in gradual pattern that does not get noticed by your partner.
              I tried method with the g-spot stimulation it does not seems to work
              that well as the two techniques kind of conflict due to the focus of
              arousement is different.</div>

              <p>Hi TTFU</p>
              <p>Very detailed information on this, I agree with you cunnilingus is the best way to stimulate G spot in the vagina. I am one of the world best cunnilingus man. Ha ha, if you have a competition to stimulate G spot, I may be champion and lick more than 10 girls at one day and make them shiok in cunnilingus,,,,</p>
