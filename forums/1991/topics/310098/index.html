              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) - - American men have doubled the
              amount of housework they do and may be having better sex because of it,
              experts have told AFP.</p>
              <p>"By
              and large, the more men do around the house, the happier women are,"
              sociologist Scott Coltrane of the University of California, Riverside,
              a co-author of a report published in synopsis form on the website of
              the Council of Contemporary Families (CCF) said late Thursday.</p>
              <p>"When
              men do more of the housework, women's perceptions of fairness and
              marital satisfaction rise and the couple experience less marital
              conflict," the report says.</p>
              <p>The reward for menfolk who help out around the house could be more sex.</p>
              <p>"We
              sociologists generally don't go there, but therapists say there's a
              direct correlation" between men doing more housework and the frequency
              of sex, said Coltrane.</p>
              <p>In a comment posted on the CCF website,
              psychologist Joshua Coleman agreed that sharing household chores "is
              associated with higher levels of marital satisfaction -- and sometimes
              more sex, too!"</p>
              <p>"Wives report greater feelings of sexual interest
              and affection for husbands who participate in housework," Coleman, who
              is a senior fellow at the CCF, said.</p>
              <p>In addition to doing more
              boring chores around the home, American men spend three times more time
              with their kids today than they did in 1960, the study said.</p>
              <p>The
              time women spend with their children has doubled, it said, speculating
              that both mothers and fathers have set higher parenting standards for
              themselves.</p>
              <p>But all that time spent parenting could have a negative effect on a couple's intimate relationship.</p>
              <p>"The
              increase in parenting hours on the part of both husbands and wives may
              pose some threats to the couple relationship since many couples have
              increased their time with their children by eliminating or greatly
              reducing time for romance," Coleman wrote.</p>
              <p>Happily, though, the
              phenomenon of men chipping in around the home appears to be global,
              Coltrane said, citing work by co-author Oriel Sullivan, a woman, who is
              a professor of sociology at Ben Gurion University in Israel.</p>
              <p>"Men everywhere are doing more," said Coltrane.</p>
              <p>"Even Italian men and Spanish men are doing more ... not huge amounts but more than they used to," he said.</p>
              <p>The
              report praised American couples for the "remarkable progress" they have
              made in sharing out the responsibilities of working and family care.</p>
              <p>Even
              if men still lag far behind women in terms of what they do around the
              house, they are moving in the right direction and the gains are
              unlikely to be reversed, the report summarized.</p>
              <p>"Men are still
              only doing half as much as women do, but we see the bar inching up and
              we think the process is irreversible," said Coltrane.</p>
              <p>The
              hard-earned gains have been made in spite of the poor social support
              system for working families in the United States, the report said.</p>
              <p>"The
              US guarantees no paid leave for mothers in any segment of the work
              force, leaving it in the company of only Lesotho, Liberia, Papua New
              Guinea, and Swaziland," the report said, referencing a study published
              last month.</p>
              <p>The full report on men and women sharing household
              tasks is to be presented at the CCF's annual conference next month in
              Chicago.</p>
