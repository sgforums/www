              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Sex education for teenagers is now an SMS or an Internet connection away.
              <br> <br> Sex expert, Dr Wei Siang Yu, also known as Dr Love, has launched an
              interactive sexual wellness online forum for teenagers to contact him
              on issues related to sex. <br> <br> "It is important for parents, teachers and lawmakers to work together
              and understand today's teenagers from their perspective rather than
              from our own," he said. <br> <br> But will this hotline stem teenage sex and the transmission of infection among teens? 
              <br> <br> Men's health expert and urologist, Dr Peter Lim, thinks it's worth a
              try. "Well, we can't stop the march of progress; sex is so rampant on
              TV. If you can't stop it, at least do it right. We have to teach them
              to do it maturely and responsibly." <br> <br> However, Dr Rosie King, a sexual health physician at the Sydney Centre for Sexual and Relationship Therapy, had reservations. 
              <br> <br> "It's too late to talk about sex by the time they are teenagers. Sex
              education should be taught in primary school," she said. "And it does
              not have to be explicit". <br> <br> Said Dr King: "The topic of sex can be brought up naturally, for
              instance, when the dog has puppies, when Mum is having another baby —
              it's a good time to talk to your children about it."
              <br> <br> Studies have shown that children whose parents have talked to them about the birds and the bees, "actually delayed sex". 
              <br> <br> Still, since teenagers might get wrong information from their friends, the hotline is a much safer alternative, she added. 
              <br> <br> Dr King is also a past president of the Australian Society of Sexual Educators, Researchers and Therapists. 
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, you can SMS your email address and sex questions to 9437 5683.
