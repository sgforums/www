              <p style="margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; ">As a husband of a beautiful sweet wife of a happy
              family with a few children I think I am well positioned to give an answer to
              this question. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; ">I met quite a lot of female sex partners and my wife also met
              quite a number of male sex partners but we can't make out <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/331552"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Revaan</span></span></a> is
              a male or female. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; ">So here let me answer to both male and female questioners:
              you are quite green on sex at this moment judging from your ignorance of the
              usual term we use to describe the two different types of dicks. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; ">If the dick is cut (castrated) the man is a eunuch. I don’t
              thank there is any eunuch now in this world though there were many in ‘china,
              Europe and some other parts of the world in the olden days.<span>  </span>Any women wants to sleep with an eunuch? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Circumcision is
              to have the foreskin removed.<span>  </span>You may
              hear men of Muslim and some other minor religions can usually give girls more
              sexual satisfaction than those uncircumcised, Of course seeing is belief. If
              you watch black men playing with girls you will get what I mean. We like to
              watch BBC F. ASIAN GIRLS on the net to see big dicks pumping in and out for a
              long time and the men still going on strong making the girls screaming loud and
              nonstop.<span>  </span>It is just because his
              forehead is not very sensitive to the extensive and rough rubbing of the
              vagina. The girls should extremely enjoy the fuck.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To the man he may
              think that an insensitive penis may not be able to give him excitement as much
              as a sensitive dick. That nay be true to some extent nut he must realize that
              if you just can maintain 10 minutes or slightly more or even much less you
              cannot make the girls happy and she will be unlikely to come back to look for
              you again. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When two sex
              partners come together to play their sex games they both always wish that the
              games will last as long as possible. For those who enjoy sex very much it need
              at least two to three hours to get their full satisfaction.<span>  </span>They will have their foreplay before the
              real battle start.<span>  </span>That will involve
              all sorts of styles, positions and locations. During this period the man should
              make full use of his hand, mouth and tongue to keep the girl at high
              spirit.<span>  </span>An uncircumcised man should
              always wait till the final moment before taking out his vital instrument in the
              attempt to subdue her by fighting with her with her vital weapon.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Normally the girl
              can defend herself with her shield much longer than the man’s sword can last.
              As an experienced man and a good lover of your sex partner you know that the
              most enjoyable thing in love making with a girl is to make her happy and enjoy
              physically. Though you may not enjoy a lot physically but you should extremely
              enjoy psychologically by looking at her reaction while you are manipulating her
              especially while you are attacking her with your sword. If your dick is not
              very sensitive and can control your ejaculation at will you can make her scream
              loud and long. You should tease her, talk dirty to her and play tricks with her
              to see how she can stand. </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;  "> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><span style='color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 14pt;     '>If it comes to a stage when she seems need more
              thrusts, hard and fast, like asking you to fuck hard and quick or pushing her
              cunt hard against your dick by herself, you should know that her climax is
              approaching soon. At this time you should utter more dirty words at her and
              start to pump hard to help her to get what she wants. You can also release your
              sperms into her body and ask her to bear you a baby instead of her husband if
              she has one. That sort of psychologically excitement you will never forget for
              life.<span>  </span>My wife said her sex partners
              usually did these to her and they both enjoyed it and was very trilling. She
              liked the one who always give her the most satisfaction.</span></p>
