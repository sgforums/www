              <p> The western medical fraternity has always maintained that
              masturbation is harmless.However,<br> Taoism,and even modern TCM,hold that masturbation<br> is not without harm,though the latter may take time<br> to manifest.<br>    In Taoist internal alchemy,the practitioner focuses on
              three things,viz "jing","qi" and "shen"<br> which all reside inside us."Jing" has two forms,<br> visible and invisible.The invisible form is produced from our
              nutriment,the food and drinks<br> we ingest and digest.When the sexual urge comes,<br> this invisible "jing" partly changes into the<br> visible form,which is the semen in males.In the<br> female,it is the liquid produced during sexual<br> arousal.<br>    In the ordinary person,where sexual thoughts<br> and acts are frequent,a part of our nourishment<br> keeps going to produce the semen and the "liquid",<br> resulting in very little invisible "jing" even in<br> the healthy individual.This can result in a weak<br> immune system,and the person can get sick easily.<br> Even a common flu could progress to some serious<br> condition unexpectedly,if the immune system is<br> overly weak due to weak invisible "jing".<br>    In the Taoist practitioner,it is totally<br> different.By consciously abstaining from all<br> sexual thoughts and acts,he or she,via certain<br> meditational and breathing techniques,attempts<br> to transform the great amount of invisible "jing"<br> into "qi",then "qi" into "shen",then "shen" into<br> one(union) with the cosmic consciousness.When the<br> sexual urge arrives,the ordinary person will seek<br> release through sex or masturbation,but not the<br> practitioner.It is the time to "harvest the medicine"("cai yao")
              when the urge comes,sublimating this urge into "qi" first via<br> certain techniques of meditation and qigong.When<br> all the "jing" has transformed into"qi",the person<br> will have a ruddy countenance and a healthy glow<br> in the face,like some Buddhist monks and nuns.He<br> or she always feel energetic,seldom tires,and very<br> peaceful within.Food and drinks intake,and sleep<br> are reduced.Even during very cold conditions,he or<br> she almost never feels any coldness.The feet and knees always feel
              warm,unlike the frequent<br> masturbator,who also experiences frequent lower back pains.In
              TCM,this is a sign that the kidneys<br> are turning weak,as they store the invisibe "jing".<br> If one isn't careful,then dialysis is the only way<br> out.<br>    For the practitioner,eyesight will also improve,<br> even becoming perfect if the "qi" is full and bouncy.At this stage
              he or she almost never falls<br> sick,unless because of advanced age.<br>    The next level(stage),transforming "qi"into "shen" is
              even more difficult.Deep meditation is<br> involved here,along with some dangers if the<br> meditator starts to have stray thoughts or attachments.An
              experienced teacher,not any Tom,<br> Dick,Harry meditation teacher,is needed here.Some<br> blokes in Singapore can become mediation teachers<br> after meditating for a while.I find this amazing.<br> When things go awry,they don't know how to handle.<br> When you try to warn them,they brush you aside.Hence don't just
              join any meditation class,even if it is free.<br>    This stage is itself "subdivided" into several<br> stages,like the first,second,third jhanas of Buddhist
              meditation.The names are different,but<br> the realities are the same.The final stage is<br> "san hua ju ding,wu qi chao yuan" in Taoist terms,<br> loosely rendered as"The Three Flowers gather at the<br> top of the head,and the Five Qis return to the Origin."At this
              stage,no harm can come within 3<br> feet of the practitioner.So no need to worry about<br> Sars or dengue fever or earthquakes or cyclones.<br>    The final process also involves "pi gu",avoiding<br> all solid food for a certain period.Something like<br> fasting for 40 days and 40 nights.Anyway,there is<br> very little craving for food now,due to the strong<br> "qi"and "shen".This is the direct opposite to the<br> average person,who always feels hungry after sexual<br> activities.At this stage too,the saliva becomes sweet,there is
              brightness when both eyes are shut,and<br>  he or she can see very clearly in pitch darkness.<br> All these we can validate for ourselves if we practise.The
              practioner will also feel no sadness,<br> worry or anxiety with regard to his or her own<br> living conditions.His or her so-called"soul" can<br> also separate from the physical body at will,going<br> anywhere,even to deep outer space.<br>    Hogwash?<br>    Read up carefully on the Buddhist and Taoist
              Canons,preferably in Chinese.<br>    Those who masturbate frequently not only will<br> get ill easily due to weak immune systems,they may<br> become "empty shells" because of depletion of "jing","qi" and
              "shen".This may not be known from<br> appearance,but a spiritually advanced person can<br> discern it.Furthermore,"empty shells" have  higher<br> risks of encountering"shas",accidents,or problems<br> with the "low spirits" realms.Just one visit to a<br> hospital could also make that person sick.<br>    So,please don't keep thinking of sex.Just don't<br> think of it and occupy yourself with other activities,such as
              reading a good book,or go jogging.</p>

              <p>On a serious note though, the purpose and goal of Buddhism is not about getting rid of all unwholesome act. Getting rid of unwholesome actions is an important practice, but it is not the goal or the purpose of Buddhism. Avoiding bad rebirths and gaining good rebirths is also not an ultimate goal. Ultimately it's not a matter of morality (morality is important but when it comes to the the big matter of birth and death, we're dealing with the part of Wisdom and Insight/Intuitive-Awareness) but the insight that allows the complete seeing through and ending of all suffering, a.k.a Liberation, Enlightenment and Nirvana. The ending of all samsaric cycles, the supreme bliss and liberation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, 'Salvation' by Christ is always misunderstood. It means Christ crucified your sinful 'self' or ego, you have to die and let God, to be born again in Spirit, ( only then is there salvation. Born in Spirit means, a spiritual birth, living in Spirit, AS Spirit (as Christ is our Life). Nothing needs to be done on your part -- all self-effort to perfect one's inherently sinful 'self' or 'ego' (aka. via 'Good Works') is doomed to fail, the only thing is to let go and let God.</p>
              <p>What is important here, is a transforming union with Christ. When there is a true spiritual birth, as one is Born in Spirit, the signs are damn obvious -- it is not just a matter of belief, it is not a matter of one's emotional experiences and certain experiences and miraculous encounters or things like that. One will find God as inseparable from one's being, no longer see God as a separate entity from 'I'! The old 'I' is dead, for now Christ is your Life. The new birth will be clear and undoubtable when it happens. The relationship with God becomes a whole different level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note that I am not saying that Buddhism and Christianity is ultimately similar, there are similarities and subtle differences (in terms of the path), but the problem is Christianity is simply misunderstood by most people including many or most Christians themselves and one of the long time Christian forummer admitted to me that this is the case (as I have suspected). So I am just presenting a better understanding of the Christian faith in a non-biased way, and I may not be the most appropriate person to do so but... if you're interested to find out if what I said is true go check from reliable sources.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>God did not transform our old unsaved selves. No,
                                                            He crucified it. He nailed it to the cross with Christ. God does
                                                            not expect anything from our old unsaved selves. We donÂ’t expect
                                                            anything from a dead man.</em></p>

              <p>Note that I am not saying that Buddhism and Christianity is
              ultimately similar, there are similarities and subtle differences
              (in terms of the path), but the problem is Christianity is simply
              misunderstood by most people including the Christians themselves
              and one of the long time Christian forummer admitted to me that
              this is the case (as I have suspected). So I am just presenting a
              better understanding of the Christian faith in a non-biased way,
              and I may not be the most appropriate person to do so but... if
              you're interested to find out if what I said is true go check from
              reliable sources.</p>

              <p><em>God did not transform our old unsaved selves. No, He
              crucified it. He nailed it to the cross with Christ. God does not
              expect anything from our old unsaved selves. We donÂ’t expect
              anything from a dead man.</em></p>

              <p>Hi Uncreated, I must add even though your article is interesting, I do not think we can advocate sexual abstainance to lay persons. The Buddha has never advocated sexual abstainance to lay followers. If one wishes to be celibate as a lay, it is entirely due to his own personal choice.</p>
              <p>As a Buddhist, as a lay person, we just have to avoid immoral sexual activities, and know balance. We should not indulge in sexual pleasures too much to the detriment of our physical, emotional, mental, spiritual health.</p>
              <p>What is important is to continue developing insight. The way to end dualistic attraction is not through suppression but insight on the ultimate level.</p>

              <p>I do not want to talk about myself, but I do have forummers who know exactly where they will end up the after death. To them, birth and death is over, they have seen the deathless. I'm still outside the gate. Similarly many people think they are going to enter the kingdom of heaven, but they have no idea yet what transforming union is by direct experience. They still see God as separate.</p>
              <p>As a forummer once said, <em><br>...Many Christians here cannot accept what I say, even though it was

                                      the Spirit" and insists that it is simply "believe, have faith" and
                                      not a "new birth" in you (the other school hope that as long as you

              <p>Belief and faith is important, but is it just a conceptual belief, or a new birth?</p>

              <p>No need to be so hard upon yourself, this is just a forum. Express yourself and forget.</p>
              <p>It's one of the places that people are allowed to express themselves freely and anonymously.</p>
              <p>Each of us have a reason why we visits forums regularly and how we expressed ourselves.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, some people chose to visit forums with an intention to offend and flame and run and post irresponsibly.</p>
              <p>Whatever may happen, I believe we must always be true to ourselves and our beliefs or else we will still be lost even when we have aged.</p>
              <p>Ageing is a natural process, but Growth isn't.</p>

              <p>BTW I also want to add that the article posted by Uncreated is a Taoist practice. This is not a Buddhist practice... so please don't confuse. Buddhism and Taoism are separate religions.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless it is still interesting.</p>
