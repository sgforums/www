            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Obviously it's not only physical.  Some major factors before even getting in to it:<br><br>1. Time<br>Time of month, time of day, time of year.  If it is the wrong time, it ain't going to happen.<br><br>2. Mood<br>She better be very happy and ready to do anything.  She needs to be confident and ready to take the next step with you.<br><br>3. Environment<br>From music to your room setting.  If you're a slop and ill-prepared, nothing is going to happen.<br><br>You may think those are basic, but so many "clueless" men get into it without ever thinking about those four basic things.  I know sad, very sad.<br><br><strong>Step 1: Making the Right Move</strong><br><br>If you meet the other criteria I listed, and that is not easy to do, your shot at a one-night stand or successfully making love will improve.  Regardless of the occasion this strategy will work on most women (80%).  The exception would be super models, I am just guessing here.  Before I get into this first stop of foreplay (sorry guys there are 2 steps), let me credit Men's Health for really being a help.  That magazine has been the best investment I as a guy have ever made.<br><br>You must understand guys, women will not get naked if they feel insecure (ie: they have tons of flaws).  If you want them naked (especially in the light), give them confidence.  This is done by romantically complimenting them.  Notice the romantic?  That does not mean saying saying, "Your legs are as smooth as my condom."  Wrong, but I know plenty of guys that would pull that line.  although I would not compliment her legs at first (start with the face), if you are going to shoot first with her legs say, "Your legs are as soft as a cool breeze."  That sounds ten times more romantic and sweet.  Women's insecurity is majorly in three areas (according to Cosmo):<br>1. Butt<br>2. Legs/Hips<br>3. Boobs<br><br>Ironically, though, women think it is most romantic if you first compliment them on their eyes and hair.  Like I stated start with facial features.  You can move your way down after that, but remember that the lower you get too early, the less chance of anything happening.  Stay focused on her facial area as you compliment her and look her in her eyes with wonder.  She'll realize that this is more than just some good fun, but something that is going to be special.  Men tend to forget a lot of times that it is about an intimate connection during sex.<br><br>Guys also don't get speech sometimes.  Females prefer the gentle whisper over rough yelling (we're talking about at the beginning).  I dated a girl who loved rough dirty talk, and I ignored that part about her and pulled off my gentle whispers trick.  She loves whispering now even more.  Practice makes perfect, so if you're not quite sure how you sound get a tape recorder and find out and just practice.  But you have to be good ...<br><br>To do it right: a soft whisper very lightly blowing near where her ear is (note: not necessarily in her ear, but near it).  Compliment her romantically very gently, make her want to kiss you BAD.<br><br>Whatever ear you are close to (right or left) go to the nearest cheek and gently kiss and blow very softly, move a half an inch towards her lips, kiss and blow again.  Cross over her lips not kissing them but kissing and blowing her other cheek until you get to her ear, and then romantically compliment her some more.  Repeat this several times, make her beg to kiss you, but don't give in yet.  She just might beat you to it though ...  Also after a few times around it is ok to do a LITTLE (notice that word there) wetter kisses, as these can really drive a girl nuts when you blow on them.  Some guys have used a special kind of peppermint that give a tingly sensation when you blow on it.  Basically you get the girls cheek a little wet and then blow.  Yeah, it drives a girls nut, but this is just the beginning!<br><br>So finally your lips meet.  Go gently at first, men like it rough too quickly.  All women have different tastes when it comes to making out, but here are a few women tend to HATE:<br>1. The hanging tongue: letting your tongue hang in her mouth without movement.<br>2. The darting tongue: no explanation needed.<br>3. Playing with teeth equipment: again no explanation needed.<br><br>Some they tend to LIKE:<br>1. Gently rubbing your tongue against their top lip causing a tingling sensation (the peppermint can REALLY enhance this!).<br>2. Gently playing tongue tennis.<br>3. Gently stroking inside lip or top of mouth with tongue.<br><br>Amazing how it's all soft and gentle!  Since every woman is different pay attention to what she likes, you'll notice this by rapid breathing and moaning - this right here is the greatest indication that what you are doing is working.  The same strategy goes for kissing her neck, gently soft blowing and kissing.  You'll see what I mean.  Patience will lead to some awesome sex before it's all over with, you'll see.<br><br>Before I go on, let me just say if your girlfriend does not want to go any farther than my last step mentioned respect her!!!  It is not ever a gentleman like thing to push a girl to do something she is not ready to do.  If she doesn't want to have sex until marriage, respect her!<br><br>That being said, if she does want to go further, and you followed the last steps you will know right off.  She will begin to want you to do things "farther down."  It would be much easier if she got fully naked for this next step, but if she only takes off her shirt and bra, go with that.<br><br>This next step required one of three or all of three things:<br>1. Tongue<br>2. Massage oil/hands<br>3. Feather<br>A diamond may be a girl's best friend in life, but a feather is a girl's best friend in bed - trust me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Depending on how fully naked she is you are going to gently stroke her with feather/oiled hand/tongue all over her body except three areas: her two nipples, and her vagina/clitoris area.  You will gently stroke every place on her body going around those areas very gently for quite some time.  Each time you go over her body once, then go and whisper something a little naughty and very gently in her ear.  Saying something like "Your goosebumps are incredibly sexy."<br><br>Top places girls loved to rubbed in:<br>1. Behind the knees<br>2. Neck<br>3. Back<br>4. Legs/hips<br>5. Feet<br>6. Around vagina area<br>7. Around boobs<br>Basically their whole body.  Spend a great deal of time doing this.  The girl will very quickly beg you to "go inside of her."  That is because she will get incredibly turned on if you do this right.<br>After much begging, don't go inside of her, instead rub the feather/oiled hands/tongue over her nipples.  Now gently stroke her entire body including her nipples, and gently go around her vagina area.  Blow softly when you go over this area.<br><br>(BONUS TIP: To add some pleasure and fun take a couple of mints and kiss her really wetly with "minty breath" then blow gently on the wet spot.  This causes a tingling sensation if done right.)<br><br>Very soon she will be begging, maybe even forcing you to go inside of her.  Basically, she's primed and ready.  But guess what?  You still aren't going to get inside.  First you are going to do some oral action with her clit (Next step).  Before you get there make sure to whisper more dirty thoughts in her ear and kiss her cheeks and lips.  Also kiss her eyes (when they are closed).  Tell her she is beautiful and tell her what you are about to do (in a romantic, and gently dirty way).<br><br>Once again be sure to be gentle and patient.  By this time 99% of men are so hard that their patience is growing thin, but trust me your pay off will be so worth it.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>By now, she should already have one orgasm from you going down on her, and of course you should have zero (but it's ok).  This step has to do with sexual positions that will make both of you go nuts pretty much.  First of all, let me tell you the benefit of waiting so patiently.<br><br>What most men don't know about themselves is that there are 3 levels of penis hardness.<br><br>1. Placid (not erect)<br>2. Fully Erect (when most guys have sex)<br>3. Rock Hard (when a penis has been hard for a while - never exceed 4 hours)<br><br>By patiently waiting, you should be at level 3, which will be a half on inch to an inch longer, and a little bit more fuller.  Once again, patience really pays off.<br><br>And now it's time to go in ...<br><br>1. Typical, old missionary style, with a new twist.  Go inside of her gently and slowly whispering things in her ear that are of course another step dirtier.  Go back and forth just barely going in.  Believe it or not there are quite a few nerves are located at the entrance of the vagina (Cosmo, Glamour), you'll hit all of those and turn her on like crazy.  After a couple of minutes begin getting a little bit deeper and deeper.  The fact that she has already came once, should speed things up (multiples you know).  Slowly increase the speed, and keep using your hands to massage her and touch her everywhere.  She'll go nuts and if done correctly, very soon she'll reach her second orgasm.  Well, you probably won't last long either.<br><br>2. Cowgirl style: Get her on top of you cowgirl style, using your hands to manuever her hips correctly, and let her rub back and forth against your abdomen with your penis inside of her.  This is usually the point that makes her come the fastest.  Remember let her take control in this position, you just relax and let her do her thing.  You'll be surprised.<br><br>3. Have her lie on her back across the bed with her head and shoulder dangling over the edge.  Ensure she keeps as much of her lower back on the matterss as possible.  Enter her slowly and don't thrust to quickly.  Don't try to knock her to the floor, but anytime you turn your head upside down, you'll get a head rush as blood rushes in.  This head rush combined with physical pleasure can heighten orgasms for women.<br><br>4. Reverse Cowgirl, same strategy as 2, but remember she is in control.  Also while she's rubbing away, whisper dirty nasty things in her ear, and slowly and gently stroke her back to her butt.  She'll go nuts.<br><br>5. Position the woman beneath you and press lightly downward on her clitoris with your body or hand.  Enter her boyd with your penis, still pressing down lightly on her clit.  Thrust rhymically and not too fast or hard at first!  At the end of each thrust, lightly push her clit slightly upward (use your fingers if you need to, but try with your body).  Pull your penis back, almost far enough to where it withdraws completely, but not all the way.  Press downward gently on the clit, and enter her again, pressing lightly upward on the clit at the end of the thrust.  Keep doing this over and over and just watch what happens.  This can work with either on top, but takes a while to practice.<br><br>6. Last one: the girl lies on her back, her head upraised on pillows so she can start off admiring your erect penis.  Let her start masturbating to get her juices ready and flowing again, while you also stroke yourself.  This should turn you both on.  Then sit between the girl's legs, with her legs over his shoulders.  Alternating hands, the man starts above her breasts, gently rotating his hands in a downward cupping motion barely grazing her skin.  As one hand relieves the other the strokes get closer and closer to the womans genitals.  As they near the fingers should only lightly graze her mound ending up on the insides of her thighs.  When her head falls back on the pillow, her yes close and she breathes heavily (meaning she is really turned on) move closer to her vagina so your penis head is lightly against her vagina opening.  Now using upward strokes you move your hands along her mound gently watching it swell for your entry.  Enter softly and begin gently again.  She'll go nuts within seconds.<br><br>After you are finished, she should have had 3 or 4 orgasms, and you should have had 2.  It is this that lets a woman know you really care about her.  Basically you are more focused on her.  Believe me, you'll end up becoming a sex object to her and she'll never be able to get enough of you.  To get even more bonus points, go down on her again and let her climax.  She'll love you forever and probably never cheat on you.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This by far is the most fun thing to do with a woman if you are really good at it.  There is nothing sexier to me than going down on a woman.  First to let you know, the goal here is to get her to have the first orgasm through oral sex, then go inside of her.  Remember, women have multiples, so with most men having 2 or 3, women can have 4 or 5.  The more she has, the more likely she is to want to do it again.  Basically, you really know you are good in bed when your girl can never get enough of you!<br><br>By now, if you followed the other 2 steps she is completely turned on so going down on her won't be hard.  Kiss around her vaginal opening/clitoris and after a few minutes of her (probably) begging you to go further, begin to work on her clit GENTLY with your tongue.  There are two most popular ways women like you licking them on their clit:<br><br>1. Most popular: doing figure 8's.  You gently move your tongue in a figure 8, crossing at the clit.  Make sure your hands are massaging other parts of her body as well.  At first just keep your tongue doing the same action with your hands moving<br>2. Also popular: the alphabet game.  You gently move your tongue in the shapes of letters over her clit.  Try to make it to O.  Once again keep your hands gently massaging other areas.<br><br>Every now and then pop your head up and whisper something a little bit dirtier; "Oh you feel so warm."  Also kiss her vaginal opening, each time you kiss hum.  Yes, believe it or not, if you do this just right your humming will cause a vibrating sensation making it very intense for her.<br><br>In a short period of time, she will probably explode.  But if you want to add some intensity here's another strategy I suggest:<br><br>Keep doing your "figure 8s" on her clit, and while doing this with your tongue, insert your index or middle finger inside of her.  Then do a "come hither" motion towards you.  This means bending your finger inside of her towards you stroking her upper vaginal area.  This is where most G-spots are located on women (there was an article in Cosmo about not all women having a G-spot downstairs).  Regardless between you stimulating her clit and her G-spot, she'll go nuts in a matter of seconds.<br><br>Then finally your patience will have paid off.  You'll be ready to make things more intimate.  And later on I'll discuss this.  Until then, enjoy reading and practicing.  Remember practice makes perfect, and this is enjoyable!</div>
