              <p>Hi yoohoo,</p>
              <p>Yes, it <strong>does</strong> happen. Otherwise how would you explain why some ladies want &amp; crave sex? No rewards in return?</p>
              <p>I'm speaking from MY first-hand experience. I've experienced intense orgasms so I <em>do</em> know they <strong>ARE</strong> possible!</p>
              <p>If you've never experienced those orgasms, you might think they are a myth.</p>
              <p>But let me tell you, they ARE possible. &amp; the first step to a woman getting them is to read up as much as she can on the topic of sex &amp; orgasm for women, do her kegels &amp; explore her body! Buy a vibrator, look for her clit, massage her G-spot, try them out!</p>
              <p>How can her partner please her if she herself doesn't know what pleases her?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">This is quite an interesting thread, with less than expected retarded responses from sillyporeans. I shall contribute my fair bit to it!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Doing the right thing at the right time actually do make sex much more enjoyable for couples. I for one, prefer to call it making love rather than the generic term, sex.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">For example, contrary to porn, not every female out there are comfortable with having their clit lapped at. May I remind beginners out there that it is an extremely sensitive spot that requires great skill and finesse. I've came across some who had an overly sensitive clit where just a slight touch would cause them to react uncomfortably (probably for the guys, its like having a handjob without lubrication on the head.. ouch).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">There are also others who prefers their men to go rough on it, with violent tongue movements, sucking on it, etc. It really varies with each individual</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">My advice is if you are unsure, start slow and progress according to her responses. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Foreplay does wonders, put your hands to good use. Instead of heading straight for the usual target areas, boobs/pussy, why not nibble gently at her earlobes, while whispering GENTLY into her ear, what you intend to do to her. This sets her into a fantasy mood, imagining all sorts of scenerios and can greatly enhance her sexual performace. Mind manipulation is great if you do it right. (Personally, I HATE it when my girl licks into my ear, for me its uncomfortable, noisy and I shudder at the thought of where her char kway tiao laced saliva might end up)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">And while you're at it, keep your hands busy too! There are many wonderful unconventional "turn-on" spots on the female body just waiting to be explored. E.g, gently stroke her inner thighs, moving slowly upwards towards the vagina area, HALT! Do not even attempt to touch the area no matter how much you want to. Keep her guessing what you'll do next, build up her anticipation, charge her up as if you are storing power bars to do a ultimate combo attack. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Another favourite of mine would be an oil massage. Women do enjoy kinky massages as much as men do! I combine techniques from those used at up scale hair saloons for the neck area, thai style, bali style, etc... whatever works! Don't be lazy (most singaporean men are), do your research online, I don't mean porn sites. Johnson's baby oil would do, and its great on the lady's skin too! Cooking oil not advisable.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">For the more adventurous ones out there, I would really discourage the use of whipped cream and chocolate sauce, foodstuff generally, as it is too messy and there might be a chance of infection in your privates if you're not throughly cleaned. And definately a no no for inexperience couples/virgins.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">I normally advice my enthusisatic friends who seem eager to boost Singapore's birth rates. Popping her cherry doesn't necessary mean you have to decorate it like a black forest cake, and blowing him doesn't mean taking in calories equating to a banana split. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Lazy to type more, maybe when i'm free ^^</p>

              <p>Ysera, we know that 'nympho' is a deragatory term for women who enjoy sex. It's just societal biasness. Society  as a whole condones men who love sex, so there're many more negative terms for women who enjoy sex than there are for men.</p>
              <p>Men OR women, both genders enjoy sex, &amp; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Most important, you know what you're doing &amp; take care of yourself.</p>

              <p>^ yes practice makes perfect and also research in books to learn how to stimulate the Gspot and clitorus.</p>
              <p> kegals helps</p>
              <p>also chances are better if she's on top and if she presses and rubs her clitorus on his pelvic bone as she moves on him , this is a really good technique.</p>

              <p>Did you know that if you do this till she cums, she is very sensetive and highly aroused and more "swullon /wet "on the inside  and if you do this before intercourse , then have intercourse, you both will be very excited.</p>

              <p>^ yes practice makes perfect and also research in books to learn

              <p> kegals helps</p>
              <p>also chances are better if she's on top and if she presses and
              rubs her clitorus on his pelvic bone as she moves on him , this is
              a really good technique.</p>

              <p>Agree that for the girl cum easier it's important to ensure she is stimulated. Also try anus rimming her as there are lots of nerves there.</p>

              <p>I used to know a friend of mine who never orgasmed despite multiple efforts to make her do so. And when I say multiple, I mean, many, many, many hot and tedious yet exciting ways. She said she would feel really wet and such, and the usual stuff, but still would not and could not orgasm. The nearest she came to was a slight tingle, which was a short one and definitely cannot be called an orgasm.</p>
              <p>But, I guess the most important factor to consider is whether the girl is comfortable with the methods you are using and not what style you are using at that moment. Make her lose herself in the movement. That's the whole point of it.</p>
              <p>Sex is not sex anymore if you aren't enjoying it to the full.</p>

              <p>Every lady is different, guys you need to understand what makes her jolts and what makes her crave for more. It really takes 2 hands to clap if there's ever an "explosion" to begin with.</p>
              <p>All my ex-gf are fully satisfied and at times they will initiate popping the sex notion whenever they wants it. I have made couple of them "ejacualated" before too :)</p>

              <p>Hey! that all goes with honest sincerity. Girls, if you have second thought and not sure about attraction in that guy, never go forward. Be sincere yourself, sometime were mis-lead by circumstances: money, favor for higher job social class, feel pitful of boy. The key here is don't easily give in your sex. Find real real chemical attration and once that call set-in... Hummm.. give it in all, submit your body and soul, nature take the toll.. till you will quiver all that you can take.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">. </p>

              <p>Sucking the clit. First I put some salvia on her clit to make it
                                      wet if it it is not slick already. Than I like to wrap my lips
                                      around her clit and move her clit around the roof of my mouth with
                                      my tounge. I use the tip of my tounge to do this. My tounge and
                                      roof of mouth are soft tissue so I don't have to worry about her
                                      hurting her at all.</p>
              <p>2. Giving the clit a bj. If she has a bigger clit I will purse
                                      my lips and move up and down it like a bj. If her clit is smaller I
                                      will use the sides of her pussy and suck on them like a bj and
                                      finish on the clit.</p>
              <p>3. I will put her clit against my upper lip and move my tounge
                                      back and forth on it. When I do this I can put my lips on her pussy
                                      at the same time (since the clit is in my mouth) and move my lips
                                      sideways back and forth across her pussy at the same time.</p>
