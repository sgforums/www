              <p>need to build more more trust.She may not know her body, but the main reason a girl wouldn't want a guy to explore is that she feels vulnerable. And if daily living already have friction or disagreement, she tends to bring all that negative emotions back into the bedroom. But once you have liberated her from feeling that it's ok to explore her body more, and assure (and assure, and assure) her that you are a considerate lover as well as a devoted and understanding partner in real life, chances are, she will be your most ardent and devoted lover. All these need accumulative understanding and time. Take note that any major conflict will upset all previous cumulative security a lady feels. Women are built to warm up gradually this way, if you want the love included that is.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p style="text-align: justify;">According to reports, roughly 70%
              of women don’t reach an orgasm during intercourse. Although that
              figure in itself is shocking, it also makes you wonder about how
              many women never orgasm at all (i.e., intercourse or not)!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of flack fall on men on why
              women don’t experience an orgasm but truth be told, women have a
              lot to do about this as well whether they realize it or not.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6 Reasons Why Women DON’T
              Climax</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">There are many reasons why women
              don’t reach sexual climax. Some of them maybe men’s faults but a
              lot can be because of her too…</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foreplay? What
              foreplay?</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Foreplay is extremely important.
              For women, making love begins in the mind and if you don’t
              ‘condition’ her mind for sex, then chances are she won’t be
              sexually reciprocating in bed too. Furthermore, women really do
              need more time than men to reach an orgasm; so foreplay is actually
              <em>your</em> way of extending your own sexual stamina.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>She’s thinking too
              much!</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Women are natural multi-taskers.
              Unfortunately, they’re so used to thinking and doing several things
              at the same time that they find it hard to simply be ‘in the
              moment’ during sex. If most men can be very ‘in the zone’ during
              sex, women seem to have various thoughts running through their
              heads all the time (e.g., home chores that need to be done, kids’
              homework, dirty laundry, etc.).</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>She’s full of…
              insecurities.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Women have many body image issues.
              While you may adore her, her mind is probably worried about at
              least three different things as you undress her: Is the light
              revealing any cellulite? Are my ‘love handles’ protruding? Does he
              think my breasts are too small/big?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If body image anxiety is not in her
              head, then she may be thinking about things such as “I didn’t
              shower yet, I hope I smell good… especially down there.”, or “I
              didn’t pee. I hope I don’t embarrass myself.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">ALL these thoughts are making her
              focus on the <em>wrong</em> things! It’s taking attention away from
              sexual pleasure and into sexual insecurities. And when a woman is
              in this mode, it’s almost impossible to her focus on reaching her
              own climax!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>She really doesn’t know her
              own body.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">There is a certain art form to
              making love to a woman’s body. It really does have a lot of
              mysterious curves, spots and turns. Sadly, many women don’t indulge
              in a lot of ‘self exploration’ when it comes to sex. As such, it’s
              hard to guide you on what makes her feel good or which techniques
              really turn her on. And really, if she doesn’t know her own body,
              how can you be expected to instinctively know what brings her
              pleasure, right?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The best thing is… it’s never too
              late to learn! Why don’t you BOTH explore her body? Don’t rush
              anything and try everything. See what turns her on best and use
              that knowledge to make her reach her orgasm. Make it your sexual
              quest! However, here are some clues to save you a few
              steps...http://www.TheFemaleOrgasmRevealed.com</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You are not paying
              attention!</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">True, men are not mind-readers.
              Unfortunately, many women are not great communicators in bed as
              well so we have a little problem here. Compounding this problem is
              of course that favorite female bedroom habit of ‘faking orgasms’.
              As a result, YOU think that what you’re doing is great when in
              reality you may not even be close!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To solve this particular problem,
              try to develop a certain ‘sexual code’ between you two. For
              instance, a slight squeeze on your arm means “You’re doing great!
              Pls. keep doing it!”; while nails on your skin or arm mean “enough
              of that!”. You will receive more squeezes, however, if you know
              some important facts. Click here to learn more: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.TheFemaleOrgasmRevealed.com">http://www.TheFemaleOrgasmRevealed.com</a><br> <br> <strong>YOU’re changing ‘techniques’ too fast.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Men like to try different sexual
              positions and that’s great but sometimes you may be changing just a
              bit too fast. Women need to get accustomed to a certain ‘rhythm’
              before sexual pleasure begins to climb. If you keep shifting
              positions, she will either (a) never find the position that brings
              her an orgasm, (b) lose the sexual pleasure she was experiencing in
              the previous position or (c) be so frustrated that even if you go
              back to the same position, she may not be that sexually aroused
              again.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">So keep this in mind: when it comes
              to female orgasm it’s not just location, location, location… it’s
              also about repetition, repetition, repetition.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Hopefully this list of potential
              reasons why your partner is not reaching an orgasm paves the way
              for discussion between the two of you. Don’t focus on why she’s not

              approach and lot more fun too! Learn creative and easy ways to do

              <p>1. Foreplay is a very basic thingz even if you are in a quickie.</p>
              <p>2. You must be able to take her mind away and ensure she is focus only on you.</p>
              <p>3. Praise her. Do not look or pass unnecessary remarks that make her feel insecure of her negative points.</p>
              <p>4. Do not mention the curves if she don't have instead tell her that you like the smell of her hair or body etc etc things that makes her feels good.</p>
              <p>5. Work your way around and know the g-spot. work on it gently and slow.</p>
              <p>6. know the progressive build-up. never never rush.</p>
