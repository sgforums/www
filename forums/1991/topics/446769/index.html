              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Four men aged between 30 and 78 years have been 
              admitted to hospital after they apparently consumed illegal sexual 
              enhancement products.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>They had consumed the drugs over the last week, from January 30 to February 2.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Two of the men were unconscious when they were brought to the hospital while the other two were confused and weak. <br><br>All four are no longer in a critical condition. <br><br>However,
               the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said the two men who were initially
               unconscious suffered more severe consequences. One remains in a 
              non-communicative state while the other can only hold simple 
              conversations. <br><br>Based on HSA's assessment of the cases, the 
              adverse effects experienced by the four men are likely related to the 
              consumption of the illegal health products.<br><br>HSA has issued an alert to the public not to consume or buy such illegal health products from vendors or peddlers. <br><br>The
               four men were hospitalised after they developed very low blood sugar 
              levels. Their urine and blood were tested and found to contain 
              glibenclamide, an anti-diabetic medicine which was identified as the 
              cause of their dangerously low blood sugar. <br><br>Of the four 
              patients, three are non-diabetics and one is diabetic who was not 
              prescribed glibenclamide for the treatment of diabetes. <br><br>Glibenclamide
               is a potent Western medicine used in diabetic treatment to lower blood 
              sugar levels to normal levels. It is a prescription-only medicine and 
              should be used under medical supervision, said HSA. <br><br>Many illegal
               sexual enhancement health products in the past have been found to 
              contain glibenclamide, which can cause patients to suffer serious 
              adverse effects of seizures, coma and death.<br><br>HSA said the 
              patients could not positively identify the products that they had 
              consumed but based on their case histories, the test results, and HSA's 
              surveillance activities, HSA has assessed that these cases are likely 
              related to the consumption of illegal sexual enhancement health 
              products.<br><br>HSA added that it has been closely monitoring the sales
               of illegal sexual enhancement health products in Singapore and has 
              conducted more than 80 raids and seized about 1.4 million units of such 
              illegal products over the last three years. <br><br>More than 20 illegal sellers of these products have been prosecuted by HSA in the past few years. <br><br>Glibenclamide
               is a substance controlled under the Poisons Act. It is an offence for 
              an unlicensed person to import, sell or possess for sale any product 
              containing the substance. <br><br>Anyone found guilty of an offence 
              under the Poisons Act is liable to a fine of up to $10,000 and/or 
              imprisonment for a term of up to two years. <br><br>HSA said it takes a 
              serious view against those engaged in the sale and supply of illegal 
              health products and will take strong enforcement action against such 
              persons.<br><br>HSA has reminded the public not to buy health products 
              from dubious sources, like street peddlers, make-shift stalls and over 
              the internet. This is because such products may contain undeclared 
              potent substances that can cause serious harm when taken without medical
               supervision.<br><br>- CNA/al/ac</span></span></p>
