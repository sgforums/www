            <div class='col-md body'><p>IN Geylang, PRC girls are generally (not always) a class above the rest. Generally, they are entrepreneurial, uncompromising on condoms, clean, intelligent, tall, fair and beautiful. That is the reason that we see them in brightly lit areas like where you mentioned whereas girls of other nationalities tend to crowd in dark lanes. And that's why they have the confidence to walk the streets. It all boil down to demand and guts. Where there is demand, there will be supply. Other than Vietnamese girls, they command the highest price.<br><br>However, sadly success is always double-edged. It breeds unhappiness in those who are affected and attract unnecessary attention. This has led to an unlikely union of disparate groups who hound them down regularly as though they are the also group involved in the flesh trade in Singapore.<br><br>I reproduce below what I wrote earlier after a few fact-finding missions.<br>Salient Points<br>1. Prostitutes in Geylang are categorised by nationality and placed in order from the highest ratio of prostitutes to men of the same race( includes foreign and Singaporean males) in Singapore - to the lowest. So, while prostitutes are by nationality, customers and potential customers are by race. It could be seen from the table that PRC prostitutes constitute the 2nd smallest percentage of prostitutes to males of the same race while the Indian prostitutes constitute the smallest.<br>2. As the world is facing a recession, Indian prostitutes offer the best saving.<br>3. As PRC prostitutes operate in brightly lit and popular areas in Geylang and are spread out sparsely and are tall and fair-skinned, we have the impression Geylang is all about PRC prostitutes. These girls are mostly found in odd number lorongs.<br>4. Even number lorongs and the dark back lanes are packed tight with girls and their customers unlike odd number lorongs. Most non-Chinese girls operate here although they are also in the odd no lorongs ; hence there are many more non-Chinese prostitutes than thought of. <br>5. Vietnamese girls in Geylang dominate the main road of Geylang from Lor 6 to Paya Lebar Road and the brightly lit back lanes parallel to it and inside the numerous pubs. Hence, my suspicion that they may be the most in absolute numbers.<br>6. Other than the 5 major groups, prostitutes of other nationalities are not included because their numbers are too small. In fact, Filipinas, Columbians, Black Africans and Myammarese girls have been found working in Geylang as well.<br>7. Indian men often prefer non-Indian girls ( and don't mind paying more for them ) than their own girls ; otherwise there will be more Indian prostitutes in Singapore and they will command higher prices.<br><br>Legend <br>(The higher no given to a symbol denotes a higher value. For example, R5 shows that Vietnamese prostitutes have the highest estimated prostitutes to men of the same race in Singapore.)<br>R : Estimated ratio of prostitutes by nationality to men of the same race, regardless of nationality in Singapore, where 5 is highest and 1 is lowest.<br>Pr : Estimated price , where 5 is highest and 1 is lowest.<br>A : Absolute numbers, where 5 is highest and 1 is lowest.<br>Po : Popularity where 5 is highest and 1 is lowest.<br><br>R5 --- Vietnamese prostitutes --- Pr 5 ( Av $80 to $150 without room) --- Geylang Rd from PL to Lor 6 (both sides) esp Lor 44 to 42 , 28 to 26, PL to 37, back lanes parallel to Geylang from PL to 42 and PL to 37, inside most clubs as well and other back lanes --- Customers of all races esp Chinese youths --- Po 4 --- A5.<br>R4 --- Thai girls --- Pr 3 (Av $50) --- all over main Geylang Road (both sides) esp Lor 22 to 16/Geylang, Lor 6/Geylang, back lanes , Westherhout Road, fish tanks along Lor 6 and 18 --- Customers of all races including Indians, Japanese and Ang Mohs ---Po3 ---A3<br>R3 --- Indonesian lasses --- Pr 2 ( Av 30) --- all over Geylang Road from Lor 24A to Lor 6 esp Lor 22 to 18/Geylang, 6/Geylang, Talmar Road, Jalan Suka, Jalan Molek, the dark back lanes ; can be found Lor 4/Guillemard, Lor 15 --- mostly Malay men, Indian and Bangladeshis, some Chinese --- Po2 --- A2<br>R2 --- PRC girls( 2nd lowest percentage of girls by nationality to men by race) --- Pr 4 ( Av $70) --- in popular, brightly lit areas of Geylang, spread out sparsely, mostly in odd no lorongs --- customers are mainly Chinese but include other races and nationalities --- Po 5 ---A4.<br>R1 --- Sari clad Indian girls --- Pr 1 ( Av 20 including room) --- can be seen at Geylang Road with Indian men but mostly in Lors 24A, 24, 22, 18, 16 and 21 and in the dark and darkest back lanes from Lor 24A to 14 ( Sri Lankans in skirts at Lor 4 and 15) --- only Indian customers as Indian men shun their own kind.--- situation may improve if Bollywood looking types make their appearance --- Po1 ---A1.</p></div>
