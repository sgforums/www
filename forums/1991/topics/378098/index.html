            <div class='col-md body'><p>everyone just know that hiv is the cause of aids, but not many really know if that's the truth ? Yes people died, but what they really died from ?Â <br><br>I seriously hope you are aware of another side of this story, that the media or medical industry wont even bother to see. Im not sure if this movie is being shown in your country, but if you are able to watch this movie in full, you will regret what you have choosen to support mandatory HIV Testing. Here is the link to the trailer of House Of Numbers(bear in mind, those who speaks are the EXPERT of this field - journalism, virology, electron microspists...) :<br><br><a href="http://www.houseofnumbers.com/about-house-of-numbers/trailer"><span style="color: #cb632f;">http://www.houseofnumbers.com/about-...umbers/trailer</span></a><br><br>Please listen to the last person Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Prize winner for HIV Discovery saying : <br><br>"We can be exposed to HIV many times, without being chronically infected, our immune system will get rid of it within few weeks, if you have a good immune system."<br><br>DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS ? <br><br>You dont need to be a doctor to understand what is going on. There is another side of HIV=AIDS, but the medical dont want you to know....the other side of aids consists of virologists, doctors and scientists...ASKING VERY CRITICAL QUESTIONS that the medical CANT answer, and there you are with the public, BELIEVING 100% what the medical choose to say to you. When you are in a FEAR situation, your brain will tell your body to produce symptoms that you have understand from the modern medical science...flu, fever, rashes...<br><br>Did you also know about the Dingell Investigations ? It is conducted in the US, and was quickly cover-up, where it is found, the HIV Discoverer, Robert Gallo actually steals the "virus culture" from the French counterpart, Luc and claims it as his own work. He's the one who says HIV is the cause of AIDS, BUT Luc says this isnt possible. Robert Gallo was later quitely told to get out of NIH because of scientific misconduct, and he didnt get Nobel prize for HIV Discovery.<br><br>This investigation work was later also started by other investigative journalists, whom seems feel strange about this "virus" because BIG CLAIMS NEED TO COME WITH BIG EVIDENCES. Below are some of those investigators :<br><br><a href="http://exlibhollywood.blogspot.com/"><span style="color: #cb632f;">http://exlibhollywood.blogspot.com/</span></a> - This all happens because Prof Duesberg, the world's leading virologists, yes LEADING virologists says that it is IMPOSSIBLE for HIV to cause AIDS. Then, a journalists(Celia Farber) later investigate about his claims and found out what this professor says seems to be true. They were to be awarded "Clean Hands Awards" by Semmelweis Society, a group of doctors, nurses and scientists that rewards health care practitioners who are people of integrity, honesty and care for their patients. Things started to go wrong, when there are some people who claim that Prof Duesberg is wrong in that claim, there's where Semmelweis Society hire Clark, a pro-bono and experience policeman who was retired and wasnt even aware of HIV/AIDS to do this investigation. He was SHOCK that he cant find any relation between HIV and AIDS. Instead, he find out a much more deeper profound problem that has been covered up from the ignorant public.<br><br><a href="http://www.fearoftheinvisible.com/"><span style="color: #cb632f;">http://www.fearoftheinvisible.com/</span></a> - janine roberts started her investigation in 1994, this website is an extraction from her book. She later join earlier investigate journalists, Celia Farber to find out that a horrific truth. <br><br>If you are interested in critical questions that people(scientists and doctors) raises about this HIV=AIDs paradigm, below are some of the websites, with scientific references included(yes, it's not a matter of joking) :<br><br><a href="http://aras.ab.ca/index.php"><span style="color: #cb632f;">http://aras.ab.ca/index.php</span></a><br><br><a href="http://www.virusmyth.com/"><span style="color: #cb632f;">http://www.virusmyth.com/</span></a><br><br>If those of you who are taking AIDS medication, here is a website that investigates about the toxicity of the medication YOU are TAKING :<br><br><a href="http://www.tig.org.za/"><span style="color: #cb632f;">http://www.tig.org.za/</span></a> <br><br>the modern medical science will keep twisting the definition of the AIDS, from last time 2 definition illnesses ( Kaposi Sarcoma and PCP ) to now 30 illnesses...so that the theory can always be true. And when there are people who REJECT the medication and survives for more than 20 years, the modenr medical science quickly created another defintion, called Long Term Non Progressors to defend for themselves. <br><br>and MOST IMPORTANTLY, if you go for the HIV Test, I just want to let you aware that you are a fool to believe that the test is testing for "HIV". It is just testing for antibodies, NOt virus. Even the person who created the "HIV Test", Dr Rodney Richards admitted, it is just simply an illusion to believe that the test, tests for a virus. <br><br>For those of you who are HIV+, be inform, educate yourselves. The best thing is buy the book, FEAR OF THE INVISIBLE. Inside that book, after reading it, your life will change forver because there are evidences inside that shows HIV isnt the cause of AIDS.</p></div>
