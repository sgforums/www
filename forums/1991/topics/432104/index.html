              Joke #2: Hairspray
              
              Got one Ah Gong and his grandson, Ah Boy, were in their garden. They rich mah, so they have garden lor.
              Ah Boy saw an earthworm crawling halfway into a hole. So Ah Boy, quite brave lor, grab the worm and tried to pull it out.
              Ah Gong laughed and said, â€œCannot pull out one lah. If you can pull it out, Ah Gong gives your five dollars.â€�
              Ah Boy tried gently because he didnâ€™t want to break the worm into two. But cannot pull out leh.
              Then he said, â€œAh Gong, Iâ€™ve got an idea. You hold it for me first.â€�
              Then Ah Boy ran into the house and returned with a can of hairspray. He sprayed on the worm which became had and stiff, and Ah Boy pulled it out of the hole easily.
              Ah Gongâ€™s eyebrows rose in amazement. â€œWah! Like this also can. Wait here. I go get the money.â€�
              So Ah Gong took the hairspray from Ah Boy and went back to the house.
              Half an hour later, Ah Gong appeared, panting. Old liao mah, so a bit of walking sure panting one lah.
              Ah Gong gave the boy two 5 dollar note.
              Ah Boy said, â€œAh Gong, itâ€™s only 5 dollars, not 10 dollars.â€�
              Ah Gong grinned, â€œThe other 5 dollars is from Grandma.â€�
