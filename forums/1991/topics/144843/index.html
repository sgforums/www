            <div class='col-md body'>The term "U-15 idols" must be unfamiliar to all Japanese, and of course to all foreigners. Actually, Even to a idol fan like me, that name was quite unfamiliar before Irie Saaya appeared.<br><br>As far as I investigated, the main target of this industry is middle-aged real pedophiles.<br><br>It is confusing but "real" idol fans, such as Morning Musume's and even Berryz Kobo's are not pedophiles. These real idol fans, includes me, only loves and support hopeful teenagers, attracted by their talents and hopeful future. Hence, sometimes we boos them if the performance or provided songs are really disappointing. And our ultimate goal is our favorites' "break." When our idols' songs are sold well and they become more famous, our dream come true.<br><br>On contrary, U-15 idol fans seems that they did not care about these girls' will. They are only attracted these victim girls' immatured points, and love these girls' exposure like porngraphs. It is disgusting, but approximatelry over 10 thousands of Japanese males are consumer of this industry. And they did not require these girls any dancing skills or rich talents as vocalists. Their ultimate goal is enjoying these girls' pics forever, caputuring them in the jail of this hopeless industry. So, some malicious perents of poverty can sell their daughters to the agents of this industry very easily.<br><br>If you understand this difference between U-15 fans and real idol fans, you will soon notice why Saaya could become famous in such a short period. Saaya's case was the first case that real idol fans loved a U-15 idol, Saaya.<br><br>However, this does not mean Irie's parents are so poor that the sold Saaya as a U-15 idol.<br><br>Judging from some interviews, it seems that Saaya is relatively richer than average Japanese girls. For exaple, she has her own toy-poodle which costs over 2,000 dollars in Japan. What is more, it seems that their parents still pay Saaya's lesson fee.<br><br>Truth is that Saaya's management office is the company which targets this U-15 industry which cannot be overlooked for the existance of 10 thousand of pedophiles. In fact, unfortunately, no "real" idols are produced by Saaya's office, Elk Heart Promotion, but U-15 idols they produce.<br><br>What is worse, there is an infamous reputation around this company. This office's main revenue is lesson fee from idol-wannabee girls, although there is no real idol in this office. Some Saaya fans say that this office might be a fraud.<br><br>--<br>As you see, Irie Saaya's future is not as bright as the reputation of herself on the Internet community. The fact that this office has not chosen the record publish company has aggravated the situation. If they are sincerely thinking about Saaya's debut as a pop-star, not as a child pon model, they should do best to find her new job.<br><br>For the time being, this office has kept silence since the apperance on Playboy Japan in ealy June. As it is currently in the middle of the first semester of elementary schools in Japan, this silence might be natural. However, if they would force Saaya to do another child-porn-like work with pedophilic photographer Aida Garo, regretfully, we should think that Saaya would end up as only a U-15 idol, who never appears on TV programs or nomal magazines.<br><br>I hope, more skillful and tactful management office, such as Avex's branch company, pick up this Japanese indespensable treasure, and save her from the worst company of this idol industry.<br><br>source from   <a href="http://santoslove.exblog.jp/i20/" rel="nofollow">http://santoslove.exblog.jp/i20/</a></div>
