              <p>Let's face the truth.</p>
                  <p>Girls and Women are all sexual animals. We are all the same.</p>
                  <p>It is the nature's way for girls and women to get attention from guys and it is natural for guys to love looking at them.</p>
                  <p>The problem lies on the way how asian culture especially Chinese culture force the girls to act pure and holy in the eyes of public.</p>
                  <p>The girls are afraid that guys and other girls will condemn them as cheap so they have to act to you  "eeeeeeeeeee!!! pervert!" but deep inside very shiok.</p>
                  <p>How many guys here dare to tell girls how much you love to look at their sexy bodies? I do.</p>
                  <p>You will be surprised how horny a girl can get when you tell her privately how much you love to look at her sexy body and actually many girls don't mind letting you to see more when no one is around.</p>

                  <p>Say you have the urge to do her ... let her feel close to you and then tell her the truth that you have the feeling to sex her. Then it is up to her whether she want to be f**k or not.</p>
