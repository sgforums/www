My qn is actually more on, why is that humans are trying to change what's best for humans? esp in this area.. i am not more onto the reasons why not to have "underage" sex, and more to, why the law was created in the 1st place.. uh ah? so, do you mean what i am enquiring is pointless? however, i am just curious on the reason, how that law came into place.</p></div>

              <p>I wonder why do people go out of e topic.. sure, if i gt daughters ahs, i dun mind, if they willing to do with you ah, lao tico.. i am asking more on when people are born, i mean dun you agree they are born to reproduce?? by implementing such a law in the 1st place.. isnt it a violation of human rights? as in, a couple both willing to have sex, also illegal ah? just becoz girl below 18 ma.. As in not for the present now, coz things alrdy developed far far ardy ler..Â  as in when that law was just implemented, i kind of feel its more of control how human to behave, not more on protect someone.. by implementing such laws, you defied the human's nature uh? Thats what i am asking, abt why this law was implemented, which like trying to control human's, o.o?</p>
              <p>And to answer to ur qn kcockicht, what i am talking is not abot rape.. is more onto the willing side.. like both parties willing? o.o?</p>
