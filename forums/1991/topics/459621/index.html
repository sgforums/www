              <p>I love smart girls, especially if they are smarter than me... last time still got chance, but now almost impossible to find someone who is smarter than me... unless they know about M Theory, String Theory, DNA/Cancer, Synthetic Life, Cosmology, Programming, Gene Therapy, etc... then maybe got chance...</p>
              <p>Since I know about these topics, let me share some interesting information... I don't want to elaborate because each of them in itself is a broad topic, so go do some research if you want to know how those things came about.</p>
              <p>- The universe is flat.</p>
              <p>- More than 99% of which we perceive as solid are actually empty space. This is also the reason why blackholes can be so small and so dense.</p>
              <p>- In the quantum world, stuff can be at multiple places at the same time. Once they were observed, they only take up 1 position, this is the wave particle duality.</p>
              <p>- Quantum entanglement. Stuff can be still connected even if they are billions of miles away, once you do something to a particle, it can instantly affect another particle billions of miles away if they were entangled. Search for quantum teleportation to understand more.</p>
              <p>- Scientist were able to create life out of chemicals by creating the right RNA/DNA structure from chemicals. This is called synthetic life.</p>
              <p>- DNA is the programming language of life. All analogies are defective... but to explain it simply, cancer is just a bug on this DNA programming language. Cancer can be cured by fixing the bug. Indeed scientist have already cured certain form of cancer by fixing the DNA structure which causes certain cancers. Previously I wanted to raise money to create a system to cure cancer by brining in the best scientists of this industry but couldn't raise funding from those social funding sites, so just too bad because anyway, humans should die... If humans were allowed to prosper, the world would end eventually through their actions... The world would have been alot better without humans in it.</p>
              <p>- If you see any object of a certain color, say a blue table... that table is anything but blue. The reason why you see it as blue is because the table reflects "blue light" and absorbs the other colors and that "blue light" hits your eyes and your brain interprets them as blue... so that blue table is definitely not blue.</p>
              <p>- And that brings me to... the whole world is actually an illusion. It's basically a construct based on your brain interpretation. We all live in a "box". How you interpret reality is based on those photons and your brain interpreting those signals. Everyone's reality may be different. It's hard to believe all these because you have only been yourself your whole life. Only if I can put you inside the minds of a schizophrenic person, then you will understand your reality is different from others as your brain constructs the reality differently. There are also many other reasons why the world is an illusion if you read about collapse of the wave function, near death experience, evolution, how other living things perceive the world (example, through echolation instead of visual), consciousness... so you see, reality is not so simple.</p>
              <p>- The universe is made up mostly of something we can't see nor detect... such as dark matter and dark energy. Whatever you see, it's actually a small part of the universe.</p>
              <p>So next time you just care about money, just think, you're focusing on the wrong things in life. Life is just a game, it doesn't matter how well you play, eventually it has to end.</p>

              creating the right RNA/DNA structure from chemicals. This is called
              synthetic life.</p>
              <p>- DNA is the programming language of life. All analogies are
              defective... but to explain it simply, cancer is just a bug on this
              DNA programming language. Cancer can be cured by fixing the bug.
              Indeed scientist have already cured certain form of cancer by
              fixing the DNA structure which causes certain cancers. Previously I
              wanted to raise money to create a system to cure cancer by brining
              in the best scientists of this industry but couldn't raise funding
              from those social funding sites, so just too bad because anyway,
              humans should die... If humans were allowed to prosper, the world
              would end eventually through their actions... The world would have
              been alot better without humans in it.</p>
              <p>- If you see any object of a certain color, say a blue table...
              that table is anything but blue. The reason why you see it as blue
              is because the table reflects "blue light" and absorbs the other
              colors and that "blue light" hits your eyes and your brain
              interprets them as blue... so that blue table is definitely not
              blue.</p>
              <p>- And that brings me to... the whole world is actually an
              illusion. It's basically a construct based on your brain
              interpretation. We all live in a "box". How you interpret reality
              is based on those photons and your brain interpreting those
              signals. Everyone's reality may be different. It's hard to believe
              all these because you have only been yourself your whole life.
              Only if I can put you inside the minds of a schizophrenic person,
              then you will understand your reality is different from others as
              your brain constructs the reality differently. There are also many
              other reasons why the world is an illusion if you read about
              collapse of the wave function, near death experience, evolution,
              how other living things perceive the world (example, through
              echolation instead of visual), consciousness... so you see, reality
              is not so simple.</p>
              <p>- The universe is made up mostly of something we can't see nor
              detect... such as dark matter and dark energy. Whatever you see,
              it's actually a small part of the universe.</p>
              <p>So next time you just care about money, just think, you're
              focusing on the wrong things in life. Life is just a game, it
              doesn't matter how well you play, eventually it has to end.</p>

              <p>I dislike confucianism, it is for the mentally weak, as it's about conforming to authority and being a coward in society. Although our government is a big fan of it, especially Lucky. Lao Tzu is a much better philosopher.</p>
