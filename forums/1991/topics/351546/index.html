              <h3></h3>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>March 4, 2009 -- A new kind of vaginal gel prevents sexual</p>
              <p>transmission of the <a href="http://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/default.htm"><span style="color: #3789b9;">AIDS</span></a> virus in monkey studies.</p>
              <p>The anti-HIV ingredient in the gel is glycerol monolaurate or GML. It's already FDA approved as an ingredient in cosmetics and medicines.</p>
              <p>"The results are very encouraging. They point to a novel avenue to prevent sexual transmission of HIV," study researcher Ashley T. Haase, MD, head of the microbiology department at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, said at a telephone news conference.</p>
              <p>The surprise finding that GML can block HIV comes from basic research showing that the AIDS virus gains a foothold in the vagina by taking advantage of the body's immune system. Immune responses to the virus draw T cells -- the white blood cells HIV loves to infect -- to the site of infection. Without T-cell recruitment, HIV loses its grip.</p>
              <p>That's where GML comes in. The antimicrobial agent affects immune responses and breaks the chain of events that let HIV spread through the body.</p>
              <p>"We thought if we could modulate the immune response at the portal of HIV entry, we could block sexual transmission," Haase said. "[Colleague] Patrick Schlievert's work with GML showed that it had many properties that might block HIV expansion and systematic spread."</p>
              <p>Haase, Schlievert, and colleagues gave five rhesus macaque monkeys daily GML treatments before putting 200 infectious doses of deadly SIV -- the monkey version of HIV -- into their vaginas. Another four animals got a gel without GML.</p>
              <p>The four animals not given GML got AIDS. Those treated with GML showed no sign of infection during the short-term study, although one of the five animals showed signs of infection several months later. But just as HIV <a href="http://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx"><span style="color: #3789b9;">drugs</span></a> with different modes of action are more effective when mixed into a drug "cocktail," Haase says GML could be mixed with different kinds of anti-HIV agents.</p>
              <p>"GML could be part of a combined strategy with another vaginal microbicide, such as PRO 2000, with a different mechanism of action," he suggests.</p>
              <h3>Ingredients of GML Anti-HIV Gel in Common Use</h3>
              <p>GML is found in breast milk, Schlievert says, and it is used in many cosmetics and in medicines taken orally or used on the <a href="http://www.webmd.com/skin-beauty/default.htm"><span style="color: #3789b9;">skin</span></a>. And recent studies show that GML kills many different kinds of germs -- including vaginal yeast infections and several different sexually transmitted diseases, said Schlievert, professor of microbiology at the University of Minnesota.</p>
              <p>"GML is presently being considered as an additive to tampons because of its ability to interfere with bacterial growth, including the bacteria that cause <a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-toxic-shock-syndrome-basics"><span style="color: #3789b9;">toxic shock syndrome</span></a>," Schlievert said at the news conference.</p>
              <p>For vaginal use in the monkey studies -- and with an eye toward future human use -- GML was mixed with KY Warming Liquid, an over-the-counter product widely used as a personal lubricant.</p>
              <p>"What was done was to combine two FDA-approved medical devices to create another approved device," Schlievert said.</p>
              <p>However, Schlievert said GML has not yet been tested for long-term human use.</p>
              <p>And there's a lot more work to do with monkeys before GML gel is ready for human tests. That will have to be done before human studies of GML gel for HIV prevention.</p>
              <p>Haase, Schlievert, and colleagues report their findings in the March 4 online edition of the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>
