            <div class='col-md body'><strong>quoted from Devil1976's post, italics are comments from me.</strong><br><br>I think I must have been nutz... As in the same case as to jump to Bee_gal's defence when I was actually the accused... I'm repeating my same mistake here again...<br><br>I've been reluctant to state whatever actually for 2 main reasons..<br><br>1. I know a girl's reputation is especially important to her. Especially for someone like Quinsy. Age 19. And according to her, she really mind how people would judge and look at her. I can understand that.. I truly have no intention to trash your reputation or whatsoever... Even when mine's down the drain... Like I've said, such things often don't really bother me... But what started as a joke for you to just 'humiliate' me is not so 'funny' anymore if you strike out for it to be a police case... I'm not stopping you nor intimidating you if you feel 'justified' that such a call is most adequate from your point of view. I just ask you to touch your heart and recalled of what happened..<br><br>Below would be my account of what happened between me and Quinsy in the cinema. Yes, I gave her the treat. I told her it's because she's a student, that's why I treated her.<br><br>We had a drink which we shared. I suggested using 2 straws. She suggested to use 1 straw to share. I insisted on 2.<strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> I NEVER INSISTED ON 1 STRAW. I just said if the straws were to get mixed up, it's all still saliva and amino acids. I won't die.[/]<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></span></strong><br><br>In the movie, I was holding the popcorn. <strong>[i]Actually, the popcorn was left on the arm rest cuz I don't like holding popcorns. You only held it later on.</strong>She was to my left. She had her arms rested on the chair initially as according to her. And yes, I believe her attire is as what she had described more or less. After a while of taking popcorns from me (she took it herself using her own hands, I did not feed her), she actually pulled my arms closed to her bre*st. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong> I never pulled your arms to my boobs!</strong></span>I did not retaliate. But I did moved my arm away from her because I had to take popcorn for myself. The process repeated itself for a while.<span style="font-style: italic;"><strong> Repeated itself... more like when I stopped eating, your hands continued moving!!!! WTF.</strong></span> Sometimes she would pull my arm close to her to feed on the popcorn, sometimes I just moved my hand to her.<br><br>After the movie we talked and I sent her to the toilet. She took a long time to come out but I waited anyway. After which she left for home.<br><br>Some time after, I realised that what we did back in the cinema could have been quite inappropriate and so I smsed her telling her something like "I'm sorry for being naughty in the cinema just now." or something like that? Then we continued to exchanged smses for a while. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> but your sms-es were very inappropriate leh... all about 'appetite', you being 'teaser', etc tec... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></span></strong><br><br>Some time after, a question which kept popping my mind continued to disturb me. There was another(?) forumite who PMed me about her problem (sorry I can't disclose the nick) which involves a sex buddy. She and Quinsy were PMing me about the same time which was really in the middle of the night. So I thought they might actually be the same person, hence I smsed Quinsy the question of "Do you have a sex buddy?" out of the blues...<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Quinsy Has NO clone!OH, AND YOU FORGOT THE QUESTION YOU ASKED ME AFTER THE MOVIE. YOU ASKED IF I WAS RUSHING HOME OR NOT. AND THAT IF I COULD STAY OUT LATE. WTF.</span></strong><br>That's basically my part of the account. I only discovered about her thread on me and VK's thread(s) in AA at a much later stage.<br><br>I do not insist that forumites believe in the above I've stated, but I think it's only fair that I give my part of the account having heard so much from the involved and 'uninvolved' people.<br><br>I only true regrets now is the disappointment I've given to my gf and the dirty politics in Sgforums.<br><br>2. 2nd reason why I've been reluctant to speak up is because I know my words would be twisted around somehow... Just look around the threads and it won't be difficult to understand what I'm trying to say. Nonetheless, I've decided that it's only fair to everybody to state my account. For those who is still interested to twist my words around and put words into my mouth (claiming that I've said things which I've actually not said), I shall try to ignore for now.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
