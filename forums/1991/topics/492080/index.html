               deeply. I went down multiple times to visit her, take care of her when 
              she is sick and keep her accompany when she needs me the most. Basically
               she accepted me as her boyfriend or her potential husband. We are so 
              close to one another, she always gives me the love and attention as what
               all other girlfriend will do. But one day I found out behind my back

              way to maintain customer relationship. Guys, can I trust her fully? Can I
               have some advise on what I need to do to maintain this relationship 
              with her. I do no want to end it this way. Any strategic plan I can 
              follow to make sure she is not lying?</p>

              <p>I think everyone should be given a chance to change but will she?  Is she willing to give up her trade now??  can u afford to support her? and if she gives up - and  you do a spot check and find her with customers then what?</p>

              Bro, you need to do these to awaken from your sleep and blindness. Don't get offended. I better straight with you then go around the bush.
              
              1. Get someone you know well to slap hard on your face. Hopefully, you wakeup.
              
              2. Take a bucket full of freezing ice water and pour on yourself. Hopefully, you wakeup.
              
              3. Bank in plenty of cash into her bank account. If she use it and spend it all. You will 100% wakeup. Because you know for sure she just wants your money.
              
              Bro, don't be a fool. Give her up now rather than  you get more hurt with her in the future. 
              
              WAKEUP MAN!

              <p>Bro Ghostimage, my personel point of view is you shouldnt serious in this kind of reletionship. If u truly love in her, why not just bring her by your side while letting her at Batam if u want her? Further more, do u support her living cost and send money to her family? If not they need to earn for living as well. Fast money and easy job if they have a really good looking and body figure. Me always go batam to work as well and managed to know many of girls there and fuck them (not call girl or prostitue) the most u give them some extra money to buy better food for themselves. </p>
              <p>Try your luck to know some girls who have a clean work like shopping mall or cashier as long as clean, when the time u fuck also more like gf feeling. My advise is never get fooled by them and treated u like an idiot. Remember money is the cutest thing in this world and it make wonders. So spend it when worth. Give up this relationship and its time to find new relationship bro.</p>

              <p>I only have similar case with you in Bangkok. I was introduced to a club hostess (Eva) in a live band club. She is a cute 20s Isaan girl and polite. Whenever I visit Bangkok I'd dropped by the club and take her for supper after her work. I did not try to f... her the first few times we met.</p>
              <p>Later I found out from club captain she doesn't go out with guests ... as she got a bf. I was scared I might be bashed up by her bf if I hang out too much with her.</p>
              <p>So one evening I called her early (7 pm) and told her I can't see her in the club that evening as I got to go to Ayutthaya with colleagues at 6 am next morning. I invited her for dinner at a nice restaurant at 8 pm before she starts at the club. She agreed. We had a nice dinner and chat. I found out her bf is a Danish fella who visits her twice a year and pays her some monthly  maintenance. That's why she don't go out with guests.</p>
              <p>She asked me to call her when I got back from Ayutthaya. I did and visited her at the club. That evening after supper she asked to see my hotel room. I took her there and we made love so sweetly. She stayed with me in the room that night. Since then whenever I visit Bangkok, I stayed in at least 4-star hotel as she will stay with me then. She never asked for a single dollar from me since I met her 6 months already. I have not been to Bangkok, 3 years now and she never try to call me. Nice memories....</p>
