              <p>Does it only happens for sex only or do you soften easily in other cases as well?</p>
              <p>The drugs might have effects but different drugs affect the body for different durations so its hard to say. After the initial failure, do you keep having the thoughts and worries that you might fail again in subsequent tries since having such thoughts would likely affect your concentration etc.</p>

              <p>Maybe give yourself abit more time to let the drugs be cleared from your system. Some drugs can take 6 months to a year even before its throughly cleared.</p>
              <p>If you still masturbate very frequently, maybe cut it down abit as well. Too much masturbation and the degree of force you use when you do it might make your penis requires high amounts of physical stimulation to maintain the erection.</p>
              <p>I don't really think polyclinic would take such cases since they would likely have to sent you to a specialist in such areas.</p>
              <p>i understand it would be a huge blow to a guy's ego for such a thing to happen. Just let more time pass and see whether theres any improvement in the situation.</p>
