              <p>Recently so many people kena busted for having sex with under aged prostitutes.   I'm wondering whether those legal brothels in Geylang ensure all their girls are above 18?   What if the girl lie?   Then if she kena busted,  all the customers will kena too !</p>
              <p>My friend told me all the girls got license.   Sure above 18.   I'm thinking what if the house take in those without license just to make more money ?   </p>
              <p>Any bros know more insights?   Are the legal houses truly safe from under aged girls?</p>

              <p>In Singapore law all Prostitution abv 18 is legal. But pimping and soliciting is not legal.</p>
              <p>My understanding that the legal brothels that are able operate based on license. The license is for the number of rooms each house can "rent out". That's how I understand the whole thing works.</p>
              <p>The people getting caught by police for sex with underaged girls is because of phone number. These pimps operate privately advertise in forums and leave a number so when you call up the number it is capture on their cellphone and the pimp will keep a "database of customer number" in their cellphone.</p>
              <p>I heard these pimps got arrested for some other issue and the police stumble across the number list in their phone by chance. <br><br>You notice all these people got arrested are all well educated high profile people, not a single ah beng in the group so it means they got the number very likely from sammybody forum because ah beng dunno how to surf internet.</p>

              My friend some years ago befriended a "very very young" chio girl at pub. One time she stayed his place for several days, he thought so young girl must be clean so no need wear condom later went for checkup and found he had gotten vd from her. My fren damn cock but dat ger so young already have vd I shudder to think how many guys she slept with all thinking she so young must be clean so no need to wear condom.  And I think a lot young people these days who are into casual sex have std but they dunno because all never want to go for medical checkup. 
              
              In contrast all the girls in the lorong houses all have to go for std checkup once a month and if they find any having std immediately will get deported. So with that I seriously think buying sex is a whole lot safer than picking up chicks online or from pubs. 
              
              Unless you are like my friend that fucks bareback or raw without using any condom or protection in that case you're like him a fucking twit nothing will ever be safe for you.

              To be clear there's many different kind of std you can contract from sex. Condom only cover 1 aspect.
                  </p>
              
              <p>
              if you look at the numbers, there are around 100 houses in GL talking about the lorong houses. So nearly 1000 girls total in the trade, each will service between 5-8 customers a day at $50 each time you can see it's very big business and there's a lot of money at stake. So these people who are involve like the pimps and girls are doing it for lucrative money not passion with so much earning potential at stake nobody will be willing to take any unnecessary risk to jeopardize it like encouraging unprotected sex and all the girls have to go for regular medical check ups. 
              
              Also the girl is on the clock you only get just enough time to hit the shower then wham bam thank you mam, no time to slowly get to know person which also reduces the risk further. So at each stage there is some "built in" protection.
              </p>
              
              <p>    
              Also if you make arrangement online whether casual or buying sex you still have to make appointment leave your name and contact number anything happen the girl like underage shit, you are screwed police can trace. GL advantage is you just walk in walk out and no need to leave any personal details, something happens later nobody also can trace you.
