              <p>LONDON (AFP) - - Female chimpanzees are hungry for sex with as many
              males as possible, and keep their mouths shut about it to boost their
              chances of luring the top chimps, a British university said.</p>
              <p>Scientists at the University of St Andrews studied the copulation
              calls -- sounds they sometimes make during mating -- of female
              chimpanzees in Uganda to find out more about what they mean.</p>
              <p>The
              Scottish institution's team concluded that female chimps sometimes keep
              quiet during sex so their female rivals do not find out what they have
              been up to.</p>
              <p>Evolutionary psychologists Simon Townsend and Klaus
              Zuberbuhler studied chimp behaviour in Uganda's Budongo Forest over 16
              months.</p>
              <p>The team established that female chimpanzees hid their
              sexual activity when high-ranking females were nearby, perhaps in a bid
              to reduce competition for good quality males.</p>
              <p>This could prevent higher-ranking female chimpanzees from turning on them.</p>
              <p>They also found the females produced more copulation calls when high-ranking males were around to attract them to have sex.</p>
              <p>The
              scientists believe that having sex with several males causes confusion
              among the male chimpanzees as to which one sired the offspring.</p>
              <p>The males are therefore less likely to kill any babies that might be theirs.</p>
              <p>The
              study found no evidence that males were competing to have sex with
              females after they produced copulation calls, and no link between a
              female's fertility and her use of the calls.</p>
              <p>"Chimpanzee females
              adjusted their calling behaviour in flexible ways, potentially to avoid
              aggression from other females and possibly to secure future benefits
              from the socially important males," the study said.</p>
              <p>The research
              indicated that the social pressures deriving from resource competition
              acted as an important selective force, shaping the copulation calling
              behaviour in wild chimps.</p>
              <p>"Competition between females can be dangerously high in wild chimpanzees," said Townsend, part of the team.</p>
              <p>"Our
              findings highlight the fact that these females use their copulation
              calls in highly tactical ways to minimise the risks associated with
              such competition.</p>
              <p>"The female chimps we observed in the wild
              seemed to be much more concerned with having sex with as many different
              males as possible, without other females finding out about it, than
              causing male chimps to fight over them.</p>
              <p>"We also found that the
              calling behaviour of copulating females was unrelated to their fertile
              period and therefore not linked to the likelihood of conception."</p>
              <p>Zuberbuehler
              added: "Copulation calling may be one potential strategy employed by
              female chimpanzees to advertise receptivity to high-ranked males,
              confuse paternity and secure future support from these socially
              important individuals."</p>
