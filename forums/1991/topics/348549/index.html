              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Survey on Sexual health and Overall Wellness</span></strong></p>
              <p>Almost half the men in Singapore surveyed recently say they are not happy with their erectile hardness.</p>
              <p>And more than half the women in Singapore says they are dissatisfied with their partner's erectile hardness.</p>
              <p>Our reporter <em>Devika Misra</em> explains the findings of a recent survey on Sexual health and Overall Wellness.</p>
              <p>46 percent of men surveyed in Singapore consider themselves to have less than optimal erectile hardness.</p>
              <p>29 percent of those have what is known as sub optimal erections, a
              condition where erections are not as hard as they could be and the rest
              suffered from erectile dysfunction.</p>
              <p>Dr Peter Lim is the President of the Society for Men's health here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He says though there is awareness of the issue, people still do not seek help.</p>
              <p>"Singapore men have got different ambitions, I think. They are all
              work and no play type of people here because we're very industrious so
              its all directed at making better profits for the company, working over
              time so they can....they have hardly any time for sex really."</p>
              <p>A total of 224 people were surveyed in Singapore,117 men and 107 women.</p>
              <p>But Singapore may not be all that different from its neighbors according to this survey.</p>
              <p>The first of its kind, the AP Show or Asia Pacific Sexual Health and
              Overall Wellness reveals that the picture here mirrors that of the
              twelve other countries in the region that were surveyed.</p>
              <p>Dr Rosie King is a sexual health expert and relationship therapist based in Sydney.</p>
              <p>"Theres quite a high level of sexual dissatisfaction in the Asia
              Pacific region. Fifty seven percent of men were not very satisfied with
              sex and 64 percent of women so that's half of men are not very
              satisfied and two thirds of women."</p>
              <p>Apart from Singapore countries surveyed include Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia. Japan and New Zealand.</p>
              <p>Dr King says though there are many effective treatments the issue of sexual wellness is largely ignored.</p>
              <p>"I think the awareness is this area is very low. People often ignore
              sexual dissatisfaction, they think it is not important, that it doesn't
              matter if I have a problem like erectile dysfunction or lack of libido
              or painful intercourse. They don't realise the impact that this can
              have on their overall life and on their outlook even their satisfaction
              with their relationships, their satisfaction with their health."</p>
              <p>She suggest that GP's discuss the issue with their patients just as they might any other health disorder.</p>
