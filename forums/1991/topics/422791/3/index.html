              <p><strong>This is your message sent to me.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong>Hi, thanks for your reply. So, I guess
              there must be some... . The reason why I asked is not because of me
              getting laid, I got no problem with that and I met some amazing
              girls in Singapore, but I just wonder how people and Singaporeans
              look at it when they see Local Asian lady with White guy and if
              it's desirable or not.</p>
              <div class="">
              <p>J.</p>
              <p><strong>This is my reply to you.</strong></p>
              <p>Actually, there was a point in time (over a decade ago), when
              quite a few sg gals would literally go out of their way to hook a
              'white' guy. Also, quite a number of the 'whites' who came
              here then, tended  to look down on asians. Many of the older
              folks would actually term it the 'colonial' mentality.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="">
              <p>However, times have changed. The gals are more 'worldly' and
              'materialistic'. Less gals here favour 'whites', and those who do,
              tend to have 'less favourable' traits. Naturally, the number of
              'whites' with local gals have also dwindled.</p>
              <p>As long as you are ready to blend in with the locals (not just
              the gals) keeping an open-mind, you're bound to meet a lot of good
              people who'd accept you. Along with them might be a 'great gal'
              (not someone pretending), whom you like and who likes you back.</p>
              <p>If you're more interested in looking for gals with more of a
              'short term' view, I'd suggest you get on one of the expat forums
              to find out where the 'easier gals' are. There'd still be gals with
              a preference for 'white' guys.</p>
              <p>Don't worry too much about how the locals view such a
              relationship. Most people are 'cool' with it, and those who aren't,
              will not object openly.</p>
              <p>Enjoy your stay in Singapore.</p>

              <p>There are AM/WF couples, but going by observations they are less common than WM/WF and WM/AF couples. I don't think anyone holds a grudge against honest white guys, but the nasty ones get a lot more coverage.</p>

              <p>u will normally see white men-asian women combi if u walk around the streets especially in town. but to see the reverse, rare sight.</p>
              <p>most asians men who live in asian countries prefer their own kind of women. maybe its also due to preference from elders in their family as they want to carry their breed forward and also for the daughter-in-law to be able to understand her husband's family more. not all asian elders in sg speaks english or western languages. if the daughter-in-law is from a different culture and speaks a different tongue as the elders, there is bound to be communication break down.</p>
              <p>however, there are bound to be some asian guys who like western girls, some might not be able to find in their daily life routine, some might feel inferior due to some physical issues.</p>
              <p>the anti -white sentiments are present because some asian guys feel that they lost the asian girls to the whiteys. in my opinion, that is just loser attitude. everyone have the freedom to choose their preference to be with the one they like.</p>
              <p>there is bound to be some single white ladies working in sg, but to be honest, most ppl who venture out of their country to work are guys. u might want to look and see if there is an community for ppl of your country currently residing in sg.</p>
              <p>quoting from u, "maybe atttraction of male/female female/male of diffent colours makes all human?" Its rare that i met someone who had the same sentiments as me. especially in sg.</p>
              <p>well i have not lived overseas before, but it depends on the asian guys whether if they personally are open enough to have a western gf/wife, be it them living in sg or overseas. I do have an asian guy friend who is 18 and have a gf from a scandinavia country. he had been with her for 1 year on and he already made plans to travel this year end after his exams.</p>
