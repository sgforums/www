              <p>thanks for the thesis gerberad.</p>
              <p>i actually went out with a sikh guy for over 6 months, his parents also lived here, they did not like it. my parents did not mind. we broke up ages ago and have been out with chinese and other guys and whites as well! i find asians more sensitive to more people........ not just the partner but family etc... but also to friends etc.... just my experience. whites are more focused and also on the partner. when going out, there's nothing a white guy won't do. whereas others may say, "oh but my sis may not like that......"</p>
              <p>i don't carry baggage. but i also a romantic....</p>

              <p>pardon me for the thesis , personally i am interested in interracial relationshps. but most of the people in sg dont find that significant to them at least.</p>
              <p>but to be honest, if the guy places so much focus on how his family thinks about his own relationship, isn't he a wimp? probably carrying with him and more troubles will arise in future</p>
              <p>what do u mean by baggage?</p>

              <p>baggage? i mean i take everyone on face value white, black or asian. yes i have been out with blacks too and had a great time. i am quite attractive (although i say so myself) and some white males did not like that!</p>
              <p>i am first attracted by their looks, fitness and how they present. then how we can mix.</p>
              <p>i don;t care from which walk of life they come from or who their parents are.</p>
              <p>if  i am single in many more years i may also start carrying baggage... yes gals don;t want to be single for ever. it suits me fine now. anyone who says otherwise is brushing off reality.</p>

              <p>its really rare that i found someone with same sentiments as me! im my opinion, race doesnt matter, i value their character more. and i definitely agree with any girls who wanna stay single forever is a liar..</p>
              <p>but the funny thing i heard before is "once u go black, u never go back". wonder how true is that?</p>
              <p>i guess the asian males who grew up in western countries would suit your character more than their counterparts who grew up in sg or any other western countries.</p>

              <p>It's not rare. race matters little to most people these days. maybe those from the old guard, but it's not uncommon now</p>

              <p>i agreee with comments by gerberad, normad80 &amp; KB. i guess i am more upfront on the internet to say those things. i would be embrassed, maybe more scared to say it in person to someone i like. mainly becasue he may not feel the same way towards you. noone handles rejection well by someone they spill their hearts out to. so no one breaks the silence. it harder for females. their biological clock is ticking away. all like to have kids one day but it get more risker as age ticks on. guys can have a little later but it the gals who carry the load!</p>
              <p>this is getting heavy. i am not yet at that stage. i want to have fun and go to cool places</p>
