              <p>The difference between web game and other games is that it’s really hard for freshmen especially those who unfortunately enter an old server. In this case, you have to be positive in developing and arm yourself or you may be attacked by other players because of your weakness. So it’s important to be positive, sensible and become an armed-sheep. Under this situation, I think freshmen could be spitted into two phrases, the first is sheep and the second is armed-sheep. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The player who focuses on the resources in the Beginner’s Protection time or several days after that is called sheep. In this period, the main goal is accumulating resources and developing your city. It is necessary for you to make all your resources up to level 7, while in the city, you only have to build three constructions: Granary, Warehouse and Hidden Warehouse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then the sheep should upgrade to armed-sheep. The City Wall plays an important role in defense, so you need upgrade it to level 12 then your city will gain defensive ability by 43 points. And it’s wise for you to choose Heavy Infantry, Swordsman and Longbow Archer to be the defense soldier</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For an armed-sheep, high production is necessary. The first hero you can choose one with 30+ politics and assign him as the Governor. And you may use Gold to recruit strong heroes for more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the total number of your soldiers has reached to 100, and the Wall up to level 10, you are now an armed-sheep. I believe now you can protect yourself in this turbulent world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you’re not reconciled to be a sheep, you can then consider either building sub-city or sending your cavalry to attack others. But my advice for you is to send the three types we mentioned before. To enhance your troop ability, you can focus on the attack enhancement of Longbow Archer and defense enhancement of Swordsman and Heavy Infantry. Here is a point that before the total number of your soldiers is over 500 please not upgrade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At this step, I think I have no more to say, as you are already an experienced player. Now you can enter a league, please note don’t choose the nearest one instead of the strongest one. The last and most important note is to be an honest guy and make more friends in the game. Then the only thing you need to do is enjoying your game! Good luck my friends.<br></p>
