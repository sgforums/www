              <p>just dont let yourself cum all and you can keep going for hours really. easier said than done so this thread is to hopefully share personal opinions which positions or tricks work for you, that slows down the feeling of approaching orgasm.</p>
              <p>try varying positions to see which one doesnt make you feel like coming too soon. personally i think position which makes you feel like cumming fastest is, girl on side with bottom leg straight and top leg bent. And spooning, (both lying on sides with her back facing you) while breathing deeply is the position that least drives you to orgasm, but i dont really like it :)  in any pos, when the girl is moving back against you when you're fcking her, it makes you reach orgasm faster and harder to control. my fav pos are: girl on top but she bends down till she can hug you instead of sitting up straight, guy does the moving. and doggy style.</p>
              <p> if you feel you're going to orgasm just stop or slow down for a couple secs till it subsides, while rubbing her clit / boobs / kissing. girls generally like doggy or her on top bending down the most, i feel. and try to give them an orgasm too, either orally or w fingers first (lick clit and surrounding small area somewhat circularly with pressure on the upstroke usually works for most) or with your fingers while you're fcking.</p>
              <p>also this 2 tricks work for me to slow down the feeling of going to orgasm: try breathing deeply, and try pressing your tongue on the roof of your mouth, just behind your front teeth. seriously, i dont know why but it does. or if you're already on the brink of orgasm, try squeezing ur pelvic muscles and stopping the orgasm just as you reaching it, not ALL your cum will be ejaculated and you can keep going longer still with feelings of pleasure, without getting soft.</p>
              <p>her mood is important, girls like foreplay, dont always go straight for tits n pussy and neglect her hair and back, ears, neck, length of body, upper thighs, legs. sometimes i feel foreplay starts from dinner or movie too, the activities before sex, atmosphere, words you say, hugs and kisses.</p>
              <p>with more experience you will have enough control over your orgasm and can keep going for hours until you both want to stop, or carrying on between breaks n bonding. after fcking for a prolonged time sometimes i reach a state where i wont always have the sensation of reaching orgasm when im fcking, usually after alot of controlling at the brink of orgasm and not cumming ALL. at then i can keep fcking without the feeling of needing to slowdown or orgasm.</p>
              <p>a whole sex session including foreplay, oral, and shower would be close to 2 hours i think. motels start from 2 hours transit, and if we have a quick nap tgt after, we end up staying 3 hrs. of course sometimes a quickie anywhere is good too! try not to vary things in a rs and not fall into a routine ^^ this thread is more for those who find it hard to keep the sex lasting longer than foreplay when they want to.</p>
              <p>excuse my ign, from m.manson yearss ago ;p &amp; you may disagree that some of the above doesnt work for you, well every girl and guy is slightly different and you need to experiment what works best for you and your partner, share your thoughts/experiences? ^_^</p>

              height). she on side with bottom leg straight and top leg bent.
              missionary with a pillow or your hands slightly lifting her butt,
              or put her head over edge of bed a while ;p she sitting astride and
              facing you as you sit on the edge. lying behind her and spooning.
