              <p>Today, Pre-Marital Sex is no longer a forbidden fruit but is a free-for-all grab on a first come first serve basis. Making all evil men look damn smart and all kind men look like dumbfucks. Some girls are really that stupid to fall into deceptions posted by free-riders.</p>
              <p>Now pre-marital sex has already been opened into juvenile relationships as the economy picks up and stress levels increase and also, because buying condoms is no longer any form of disgrace to discourage youngsters indulging in sexual activities.</p>
              <p>Worse, in some juvenile cases, especially hoodlums, tend to cheat their girlfriends into having unprotected sex with them, and subsequently getting them pregnant and leaving them in the lurch at the end of the day. And the most hilarious part is, many of the typical ah lians are hot, which made Singaporeans have the mindset that hot girls are stupid.</p>
              <p>However to be noted, it is not advisable AT ALL to make general comments about any form of human characters as it may affect your job performance and vocational reputation in the future.</p>
              <p>Well, it is for most men to jeer and say that they are indeed dumb and readily there for us to "harvest" their virginity. However most people have indeed neglected the importance of virginity in a marriage.</p>
              <p>To probe into the statistics of marriages especially in highly economised countries of the world such as Singapore, North America, Europe, Japan and Hongkong. Typical marriages doesn't last for more than 5 years.</p>
              <p>So what is the problem here? Virginity? Not exactly, perhaps more on the male ego of the typical man. Many women and men are now spending less and less time into homemaking. As the fire of love slowly extinguishes under the impact of each and everyones career, couples will sometimes in their work mull about what is happening to them and the truth slowly surfaces.</p>
              <p>Virginity in this typical chain situation, forms a WIDELY NEGLECTED cushion to save the marriage. Especially if a man faces difficulties in his career or is even being fired, making the woman bring home the bacon. And especially without the presence of the individuals biological children, virginity is indeed the last hope.</p>
              <p>Look into this psychological mindmap, based on default as humans are naturally selfish. On the THRESHOLD OF A SEPARATION, many would go back to the physical aspect of the women and dig into all the faults of one another and thrash it all out. While being oppressed, normally its the woman who have nothing to say IF her husband is clean himself.</p>
              <p>As have the marriage vows have mentioned. "Will you love her, care for her and be with her in sickness and poverty and to forsake all others to be with her."</p>
              <p>Well, verbal promises have sometimes been a mere recital and neglected from the face of marriages due to stresses caused by affluence.</p>
              <p>One thing to take note, WE, as ASIANS, come from a rather conservative background of ancestralisation.</p>
              <p>Well as its agreeable that biologically, men have NO prove whether are they virgins. So perhaps the Almighty who created us, gave the fucked-up-membrane-of-controversy to our mammalian lactators, women.</p>
              <p>Realise something in here, which God disgusted us as humans.</p>
              <p>Humans, are given the right of supremacy among all vertebrates on earth, and are distinguished as humans by the word called Self-Control. Humans who have no self-love, self-control and have lower social organisational abilities, should not be treated like a human but as an animal.</p>
              <p>So you see the importance of virginity now? This is a stand made by the TS. Please discuss appropriately cause I want to listen how you guys think. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Typical marriages don't work because woman want their 50-60% alimony money. That their too busy with their careers and coming back to a arguesome home is too taxing to resolve.</p>
              <p>I guess the girls get over-consumed by the relationship that's why they are blinded.</p>
              <p>I have a slut-friend-now-a-whore who once said during her early days that:</p>
              <p>Man can love to get sex while</p>

              <p>abit true to say how to know whether a guy is still a virgin...unlike gals..hmm..like unfair nia</p>
              <p>nowadays marriages are no longer based on the vows they take..2 years maybe still ok...10 years then start toking abt $$ and who knows what else...</p>
              <p>and unlike our western counterparts, its not like we get to learn abt sex education from our parents...which might have ended up the rising cases of pre-marital sex..and those young gals that get involved is way too gullible and end up addicted...its funny how they always claim, can't be helped lah...nvm lor...peer pressure etc...</p>
              <p>at the end it..its really all abt self-discipline ba XD</p>
