              <p>Been using a <a href="https://www.fullextend.com/penis-pumps/">penis pump</a> for years, the result was okay and I feel good after using it. Just a little pain in the skin at the start, hell yeah that's what I look for. No pain no gain. Found this online with a good collection of <a href="https://www.fullextend.com/penis-extenders/">male enhancement</a> and <a href="https://www.fullextend.com/male-sex-toys/">sex toys</a>.</p>
              <p>Using pump does not require me to be dependent on viagra or Tongkat Ali cos I believe in every drug there are side effects.</p>

              <p style="margin-right: 4.8pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;  ">I never favour using stimulant in sex act. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As shown below I extract a section of my sex book about my wife and my sex life to enable you to know how to stay long in sex act. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For a man who is not circumcised, the best way to toughen it is to roll or pull back the long foreskin covering the forehead up and then put back your pant or underwear if any.<span>  </span>You will feel very uncomfortable or even pain at the beginning as the coarse surface of your underwear or pant rubbing against it. It will be much better not to put on underwear as it is tight and tends to protect the forehead from getting rubbed.<span>  </span>It is better just to wear pant to let the coarse surface of the textiles to rub it continuously when you are working, walking or running. You will get the result much faster. <span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>T</span>he foreskin tends to come back to its original position to cover the forehead again and again.<span>  </span>You should once in a while check it and roll or pull it back to expose the forehead again.<span>  </span>Maybe you have to do this for a year or more until the forehead grows bigger and the foreskin contracts to fit tightly around the plunger body behind the forehead.<span>  </span>Then your penis will look exactly like the circumcised one. Please be patient and you will be successful in life, to be more exact, in sex life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you want to compete with the Black men, of course in duration not in size, you should carry on to do the advanced course of training.<span>  </span>Occasionally in shower, you can train it up by forcing the forehead to wash the small hand towel or your socks. You just use your forehead as a brush to brush your towels or socks.<span>  </span>I say forcing because it is quite painful after the washing initially and you should not use it too long and too hush before its skin has grown thick and the nerve become numb.<span>  </span>You should train it bit by bit until it is tough enough to do the washing like your hands.<span>  </span><span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">By then you can have full control of it when you are engaging in a battle with a girl in bed. You need not have to worry that you may lose the war to her.<span>  </span>You just use your “sword” to thrust deep into her body, or you may call it the “plunger” to sink deep into her hole in order to succumb her. If she refuses to surrender, you just have to stick your sword hard against her or sink your plunger deeper until it touch the last defend line of her battlefield and stay put to look deep into her eyes and smile at her to see what she can do. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">She may surrender. If not fight with her again. For some girls who have plenty of firing power to fight with you she will keep on fighting with you even if she has lost her first round of battle. Sometimes you may have to keep on to defend yourself after she has lost even the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> round before she would totally be defeated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You can only do this if you have the staying power and it will be a great achievement to you in engaging in a sex war with your love one or other girlfriends. You can control yourself as to when you want to release your valve to let your champagne splashing out inside her body, into her mouth, on her face, her breasts or her pussy wherever she likes to celebrate your victory.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">By then she can’t do anything else but totally give herself up by hugging and kissing you as a hero in conquering her and occupying the whole territories of her body. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>On this s</span>ome men may worry that once their dicks are insensitive to the friction in intercourse they may lose the pleasure in screwing and fucking a girl. In fact it is not the case. <span>T</span>he real pleasure and excitement of a man in having intercourse with a girl do not derive from the friction on the forehead in the game. Instead it derives from the reaction of the girl <span>on what </span>the man gives her. The exciting response of the girl derived from his kiss, caress, patting, screwing, fucking as well as uttering of dirty words to her will make the man really excited physically, mentally and psychologically. <span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you can control not to ejaculate, you can fix your two eyes right into hers while you are screwing and fucking her. You can thrust deep into her cunt and then hold it at that position and ask if she likes what you are doing.<span>  </span>You will enjoy to see what she is going to do and say.<span>  </span>You can then bang hard while talking dirty to her until she surrenders.<span>  </span>Knowing that she is going to surrender you can bang much harder to consummate together with her.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In addition to the exercises mentioned previously you can further use a small rope to tie some weight at one end and hang it onto the neck of the forehead at the other end.<span>  </span>Swing it slightly.<span>  </span>It may be quite painful at the neck of the forehead at first.<span>  </span>But as time passes you will get used to it and you can gradually add weight to make it heavier. Normally the penis can take up<span> slightly more than</span> one kilo in weight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
