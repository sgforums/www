              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Quinsy:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>There is no doubt about it; we all need some loving. And so
              whether you're in a committed relationship or are playing the
              field, there is one thing that you should always remember: that you
              can keep a woman ready to please you simply by letting her know how
              much she already knows.<br> <br> Below are some simple things that you can tell your woman on daily
              basis and as sure as the sun, they will indeed work wonders for
              you.<br> <br> a) "How was your day?"- When you ask her how her day went, she is
              likely to interpret it that you are caring, concerned, mindful,
              thoughtful and eager to know about her daily routine. However, this
              question gives her license to talk at length about all the little
              dramas and episodes that unfolded throughout her day. So, for her
              to believe that your question was genuine, be ready to set aside
              some time to listen to her stories however boring some may be. To
              her, it's the thought that counts. Asking about her day shows that
              you're receptive, interested and open to listening to her. You're
              also giving her an outlet to vent and acting as her confidante.
              Remember that once she is through, she will begin to talk about
              you! In the end, she will appreciate you for the concern you have
              over her affairs.<br> <br> b) "I just can't help believing how sexy you look!" this will tell
              her that you still find her attractive, and to a greater extent
              that you want some. If you are in a relationship, she is likely to
              hear more than just that-namely that you still appreciate her nice
              butts. This line is effective in long term relationships, as you
              are assuring and attesting to her that she is still hot.
              Consequently, she will be constrained to share her hotness with
              you.<br> <br> c) "How do you feel about anything or life in general?" Asking this
              question tells your woman that you're genuinely concerned about her
              feelings and thoughts. Women always love to express their feelings
              on every topic imaginable and therefore you should be ready for a
              lengthy and deep conversation about the topic that may be. In most
              cases, she is likely to tell you how she feels about you and the
              whole relationship. Since, it's all about showing the compassionate
              side, once she understands that you're devoting attention to her,
              it will make surely all her feelings about you that much more
              intense. So, if you were just kind of another handsome boy before,
              you'll become a stud in her eyes. If you were just her love before,
              now she'll want more.<br> <br> d) "Your star shines brighter than all your girlfriends" i.e. "you
              are beautiful." Putting and rating her on a pedestal against her
              peers gives her an ego boost that she can secretly lord over her
              girlfriends. It's praise valued highly in the world of women, and
              will score you some big points. Other than making her feel
              aesthetically superior to other women, this small remark will make
              her cognizant of how much you value and rate her. She'll also feel
              less threatened by her female friends when they are around you.
              She'll feel good about herself and consequently may feel
              constrained to summon up better logic to reward your good taste.
              However, if yours is the jealous partner, she may take this only as
              evidence that you're checking out on her female friends.<br> <br> e) "You're very smart." By acknowledging how intelligent she is,
              you're communicating that you recognize her brains, as well as her
              whole being and figure. This makes her feel appreciated for all her
              valuables. It's a mark of respect from you as her love. This
              compliment is good because, she will appreciate that you are
              capable of thinking above the waistline. A woman loves a cordial
              man, and there's no better way for you to prove your gentlemanly
              qualities than to praise and distinguish her smarts.<br> <br> f) "You're great in bed." If well and timely put, these words makes
              her feel like a princess. To her, the words suggest that her
              sexuality has been elevated in your eyes and makes her feel like
              she really knows how to satisfy you as her man. This may boost her
              confidence and thus knock away any inhibitions she might have in
              the bedroom. Praising her performance also indicates that for you,
              sex isn't just about releasing yourself. It shows that you
              appreciate every aspect of the whole exercise itself, particularly
              the extra efforts she puts towards it.<br> <br> g) "I want to spend the rest of my life with you." This is a very
              sensitive line as it's always not many metres away from proposing
              to her. So be prepared for the outcome if you say it. But be
              informed that the risk often carries a reward - once you tell her
              this, she'll be doing mental back flips of joy. If you feel that
              these words are so strong, then you may try other lines which are
              less committal such as "only you alone can make me happy" or this
              one by Michael Bolton " I'll rather have bad times with you than
              good times with someone else" Since all women love to hear a formal
              expression of enduring commitment from their men, you are likely to
              practically receive a permanent halo after this.<br> <br> h) "You're the only best friend I have." This means that you are
              telling her how you feel much above and beyond a sexual context. It
              signifies the fact that you've placed value upon your relationship
              and that you want to do things with her that other men may not have
              had any interest in. She'll feel overpoweringly connected to you
              after you say this because these words change you from being just
              the guy she is doing things with. It propels you to the top of the
              suitors list because you've openly declared your friendship.<br> <br> i) "You'll make a great mother." It is no secret that most women
              look forward to having babies one day in life. Most also undergo
              the agony wondering whether they will do a good job of it or not.
              By asserting this, you affirm to her that she'll be a success
              story. Furthermore, you greatly satisfy her internal need and
              curiosity to be pacified on the subject or institution of
              motherhood. To make it great, coming from her man, these words will
              make her very happy. The indirect meaning is that you're thinking
              about making and raising babies with her. Obviously, this should be
              great music to her ears. Depending on how or what she feels about
              you, she'll be even more receptive to your advances.<br> <br> j) "You make my life complete." This line can be coupled with "my
              whole life has changed" to confirm to her that she's the only one
              for you. I tend to think that all women want to hear this line from
              their men. It says that you've accepted her completely regardless
              of who she is or what she does and that she has become an integral,
              essential and more important, indispensable ingredient in your
              life. By confessing to her that you have witnessed changes since
              she came into your life, you indirectly saying that she is the most
              prized asset you have! That's an unbelievably gratifying thought to
              your woman: she'll be very happy especially if you can repeatedly
              tell her this.<br></p>
