            <div class='col-md body'>There is no doubt about it; we all need some loving. And so whether you're in a committed relationship or are playing the field, there is one thing that you should always remember: that you can keep a woman ready to please you simply by letting her know how much she already knows.<br><br>Below are some simple things that you can tell your woman on daily basis and as sure as the sun, they will indeed work wonders for you.<br><br>a) "How was your day?"- When you ask her how her day went, she is likely to interpret it that you are caring, concerned, mindful, thoughtful and eager to know about her daily routine. However, this question gives her license to talk at length about all the little dramas and episodes that unfolded throughout her day. So, for her to believe that your question was genuine, be ready to set aside some time to listen to her stories however boring some may be. To her, it's the thought that counts. Asking about her day shows that you're receptive, interested and open to listening to her. You're also giving her an outlet to vent and acting as her confidante. Remember that once she is through, she will begin to talk about you! In the end, she will appreciate you for the concern you have over her affairs.<br><br>b) "I just can't help believing how sexy you look!" this will tell her that you still find her attractive, and to a greater extent that you want some. If you are in a relationship, she is likely to hear more than just that-namely that you still appreciate her nice butts. This line is effective in long term relationships, as you are assuring and attesting to her that she is still hot. Consequently, she will be constrained to share her hotness with you.<br><br>c) "How do you feel about anything or life in general?" Asking this question tells your woman that you're genuinely concerned about her feelings and thoughts. Women always love to express their feelings on every topic imaginable and therefore you should be ready for a lengthy and deep conversation about the topic that may be. In most cases, she is likely to tell you how she feels about you and the whole relationship. Since, it's all about showing the compassionate side, once she understands that you're devoting attention to her, it will make surely all her feelings about you that much more intense. So, if you were just kind of another handsome boy before, you'll become a stud in her eyes. If you were just her love before, now she'll want more.<br><br>d) "Your star shines brighter than all your girlfriends" i.e. "you are beautiful." Putting and rating her on a pedestal against her peers gives her an ego boost that she can secretly lord over her girlfriends. It's praise valued highly in the world of women, and will score you some big points. Other than making her feel aesthetically superior to other women, this small remark will make her cognizant of how much you value and rate her. She'll also feel less threatened by her female friends when they are around you. She'll feel good about herself and consequently may feel constrained to summon up better logic to reward your good taste. However, if yours is the jealous partner, she may take this only as evidence that you're checking out on her female friends.<br><br>e) "You're very smart." By acknowledging how intelligent she is, you're communicating that you recognize her brains, as well as her whole being and figure. This makes her feel appreciated for all her valuables. It's a mark of respect from you as her love. This compliment is good because, she will appreciate that you are capable of thinking above the waistline. A woman loves a cordial man, and there's no better way for you to prove your gentlemanly qualities than to praise and distinguish her smarts.<br><br>f) "You're great in bed." If well and timely put, these words makes her feel like a princess. To her, the words suggest that her sexuality has been elevated in your eyes and makes her feel like she really knows how to satisfy you as her man. This may boost her confidence and thus knock away any inhibitions she might have in the bedroom. Praising her performance also indicates that for you, sex isn't just about releasing yourself. It shows that you appreciate every aspect of the whole exercise itself, particularly the extra efforts she puts towards it.<br><br>g) "I want to spend the rest of my life with you." This is a very sensitive line as it's always not many metres away from proposing to her. So be prepared for the outcome if you say it. But be informed that the risk often carries a reward - once you tell her this, she'll be doing mental back flips of joy. If you feel that these words are so strong, then you may try other lines which are less committal such as "only you alone can make me happy" or this one by Michael Bolton " I'll rather have bad times with you than good times with someone else" Since all women love to hear a formal expression of enduring commitment from their men, you are likely to practically receive a permanent halo after this.<br><br>h) "You're the only best friend I have." This means that you are telling her how you feel much above and beyond a sexual context. It signifies the fact that you've placed value upon your relationship and that you want to do things with her that other men may not have had any interest in. She'll feel overpoweringly connected to you after you say this because these words change you from being just the guy she is doing things with. It propels you to the top of the suitors list because you've openly declared your friendship.<br><br>i) "You'll make a great mother." It is no secret that most women look forward to having babies one day in life. Most also undergo the agony wondering whether they will do a good job of it or not. By asserting this, you affirm to her that she'll be a success story. Furthermore, you greatly satisfy her internal need and curiosity to be pacified on the subject or institution of motherhood. To make it great, coming from her man, these words will make her very happy. The indirect meaning is that you're thinking about making and raising babies with her. Obviously, this should be great music to her ears. Depending on how or what she feels about you, she'll be even more receptive to your advances.<br><br>j) "You make my life complete." This line can be coupled with "my whole life has changed" to confirm to her that she's the only one for you. I tend to think that all women want to hear this line from their men. It says that you've accepted her completely regardless of who she is or what she does and that she has become an integral, essential and more important, indispensable ingredient in your life. By confessing to her that you have witnessed changes since she came into your life, you indirectly saying that she is the most prized asset you have! That's an unbelievably gratifying thought to your woman: she'll be very happy especially if you can repeatedly tell her this.<br><br></div>

This line can be coupled with "my whole life has changed" to confirm to her that she's the only one for you. I tend to think that all women want to hear this line from their men. It says that you've accepted her completely regardless of who she is or what she does and that she has become an integral, essential and more important, indispensable ingredient in your life. By confessing to her that you have witnessed changes since she came into your life, you indirectly saying that she is the most prized asset you have! That's an unbelievably gratifying thought to your woman: she'll be very happy especially if you can repeatedly tell her this.<br><br></blockquote>The completeness of any set of basis is always very much appreciated in quantum mechanics.....likewise for husband and wife...</div>
