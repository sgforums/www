              <p>Those who were most active while younger had more chance of developing cancer later in life.</p>

              reported.

              <p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with well over 30,000 new cases diagnosed each year.</p>
              <p>It affects the prostate gland, which is found close to the bladder and makes a component of semen.</p>
              <p>The Nottingham team, led by Dr Polyxeni Dimitropoulou, recruited
              more than 400 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, then compared their
              answers to 409 men thought to be free of the disease.</p>
              <p>As well as questions about how often they had been sexually
              active from puberty onwards, they were asked how many sexual partners
              they had had and whether they had been diagnosed with any sexual
              infections.</p>
              <p>Roughly the same proportion of both groups, 59%, said they had
              engaged in sexual activity 12 times a month or more in their 20s,
              falling to 48% in their 30s, 28% in their 40s and 13% in their 50s.</p>
              <p>Almost two-fifths of the prostate cancer group had had six
              female partners or more, compared with less than a third of the
              non-cancer group.</p>
              <p><strong>Frequency risk</strong></p>
              <p>There was also a difference among the men who masturbated or had
              sex the most often, with 40% of men in the cancer group being sexually
              active 20 times a month or more in their 20s, compared with 32% in the
              non-cancer group.</p>
              <p>The gap between the two groups narrowed as the men aged, suggesting that the difference was strongest at a younger age.</p>
              <p>Dr Dimitropoulou said: "What makes our study stand out from
              previous research is that we focused on a younger age group than normal
              and included both intercourse and masturbation at various stages in the
              participants' lives."</p>
              <p>He said that it was possible that higher levels of sex hormones
              in some men were both responsible for a high sex drive in their 20s and
              30s, and for the development of prostate cancer later on.</p>
              <p>"Hormones appear to play a key role in prostate cancer and it
              is very common to treat men with therapy to reduce the hormones thought
              to stimulate the cancer cells."</p>
              <p>She said that the reasons why the connection between sexual
              activity and prostate risk appeared to diminish with advancing age was
              not clear, although other studies have suggested that sexual activity
              releases toxins from the gland.</p>
              <p>John Neate, chief executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity,
              said that while the study was useful, its findings would need to be
              backed by more evidence before they could be accepted</p>
              <p>He said: "The role of sexual activity is becoming an increasing
              focus for prostate cancer research but unfortunately this study does
              little to offer any practical advice to men wishing to reduce their
              risk of the disease.</p>
              <p>"The study is retrospective, and asks men to complete a questionnaire about their sexual history.</p>
              <p>"However, in relying on men to recall information from 20 or 30
              years previously, it is likely that there will be some inaccuracy in
              the data collected as men either consciously or unconsciously forget
              some detail which could compromise their findings.</p>
              <p>"The sample used in the study is also relatively small, making it difficult to draw any universal conclusions."
