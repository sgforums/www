              <p>Hi people out there, since this forum is all about sex so I won't hesitate in talking everything about it.</p>
              <p>Here it goes, a couple of months ago one of my sex partner ring me up and ask if I wanted to meet her in her flat, as it's on weekdays and office hours (about 1pm+) so it's quite inconvenient for me to go over, I kindly decline her and unknown to me after that incident, It's the last time I'm contacting her. I tried calling her again to fix another appointment but she failed to picked up my call and after a while, she sent me an sms saying that "It's a big turns off for a girl to have been turned down by a guy." From that day onwards, I've lost one sex partner.</p>
              <p>So now, makes me wonder and also a lesson learnt for me, is it true that girls don't like to be turned down with valid reason? I mean that she could have understand that typical working adult like me is not convenient to meet up during office hours and that cost a lost of a friend.</p>
              <p>So if you people were in my shoes, how would you respond? Looking forward to read a respond from girls.</p>

              <p>I think it's a pride issue. Women likes to feel wanted, desired, chased after. Your rejection after her request must have hit her hard especially since she was the one who initiated the meeting. So now she is getting back at you.</p>
              <p>It could be also HOW you rejected her then. You could have told her how much you desire to meet her but just could not make it at that moment.Say something really nice 1st before adding some negative stuffs to that (for some 'balance').</p>
              <p>Anyway...since she is just a sex buddy, let her go in peace. If you really matter that much to her, she will come back to you somehow.</p>
              <p>Actually why don't you just find a proper steady gf?</p>

              <p>Hi white.jewel,</p>
              <p>I sincerely thank you for your constructive comments, your respond captured my attention and I hope you'll return to read my reply.</p>
              <p>First of all, I'm a horny person just like any other typical guys and If I ever think of seeking a proper gf, I know I'll betray her because I'm just enjoy flirting around. I mean that's my nature, no matter how hard I tried but still to no avail. Yeah right, perhaps I've construct a bad sentences that result in withdrawal of a friend.</p>

              <p>I guess you may be still young and so are still at the 'exploring' stages? But after seeing &amp; experiencing much , you may just yearn to settle for someone stable in the end. Just make sure you do not hurt people around. You would not want hurtful  things to happen to your beloved sisters or relatives also ya?</p>

              <p>Depends on individual I guess. Perhaps she's in a bad mood? Perhaps it's pride like someone said here.</p>
              <p>Well, I will be blunt here, OP. Do you consider a f**** buddy a friend? I certainly believe friends don't f*** each other, even if there is something called friends with benefit. If it is purely for sex, then there should be no attachment issue. Losing her should not be a big deal. Get a new one and mature thinking one.</p>
