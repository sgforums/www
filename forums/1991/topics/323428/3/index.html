              <p>what i like to know is, don't you feel shy or even totally awkward when she's holding it?</p>
              <p>seriously, although i'm scared of the pain, i'm even more scared of the thought of letting the nurse do that sort of thing......it really freaks me out, especially if the nurse is a young one.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, I did feel shy at first about the female nurse holding it. I even undressed reluctantly, leaving only my shirt on because I used to shirt to cover my private region. Even when lying on the operating table, I still used my shirt to cover myself. But after a while, I got more worried about the operation itself than a female nurse holding my penis. Also, the doctor gave me injections, so the whole area is numb, I didn't even feel her fingers holding me up.</p>

              Hi, what I heard is that laser circumcision allows for more precise cut of the foreskin...of cos when more advanced medical technology is used for such procedures, it will cost more than manual methods..not sure if recovery period would be shorter although I feel there should be some difference..another alternative to consider is Preputioplasty which is definitely less painful and recovery is faster..but there is limited places that offers this procedure and this procedure only possible if infection have never occured before and also if you have higher desire to keep the foreskin..take note it also cost a bit more than laser circumcision..

              <p>I disagree on a 'tight' circumcision as it's better to have some skin covering the gland of the penis when your penis is flaccid. This helps protects the gland. And the frenum of the penis should never be removed. There's a lot of nerves there and removing the frenum will decrease sensitivity.</p>

              <p>For me it was the best thing I have done. I was circumcised when I was 18 yrs old. I had sex before I was circumcised &amp; it was not as great as after the op. Before the op my foreskin was not pulled back when I was having sex and it wasn't as sensitive as after I was circumcised.</p>

              <p>Before the operation, if I don't pull back my foreskin it's not painful when I have sex but it's not pleasurable as the head of my penis is not exposed. If I pull it back the foreskin is very tight around the penis head and it's not comfortable. I wouldn't say it's painful.</p>
              <p>After the operation it was great. My penis head is a lot sensitive. I love it!</p>

              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>i've made up my mind to go for circumcision this coming Dec.....maybe early Dec or mid Dec......the earlier the better.......otherwise every now and then worry about this problem.</p>
              <p>i'll be contacting dr. lau for more details and appointment fixing, and when the op eventually gets done, i'll let you guys know the results. :)</p>
              <p>btw, for those guys who got circumcised in adulthood (plsdunbanme, natas666 etc.).....you guys didn't cut off the frenulum, right?</p>
              <p>i'm thinking of cutting it off cos' when the penis is erect, the frenulum stretches tightly on the underside of the penis and it's kinda gross to look at...........dunno why, but when i see the frenulum being stretched on an erect penis on online websites, it kinda gives me the creeps and lots of goose bumps.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm 20 and I have a few questions to ask of my own too. I have considered going for circumcision 2 years back because I couldn't retract my foreskin before too. After seeing the specialist, he told me that i just need to gradually pull back and stretch it and I should be able to retract it fully eventually. Thankfully, it happened and now I can retract it fully with ease. But, the problem now is I'm able to retract it fully ONLY when it is flaccid. When it is erect, I'm not able to retract the foreskin fully. Only the top head of the glans is exposed when I tried pulling it back. Beyond that, it is all pain.</p>
              <p>So my questions are, is my condition considered a mild one? Do you guys think I require circumcision? I've also done research on preputioplasty 2 years ago but I have always thought Singapore hasn't had the technology to perform such an operation, until now...</p>

              <p>I would like to add my experience with                         <strong><strong>Preputioplasty</strong></strong> to the discussion. It has not exactly been all positive. I had at age 18 and because. My foreskin could be pulled back, but it was very tight when errect and it hurt too much for sex. The operation was quick and easy (and free in my country) and I waited 6 weeks for it to heal. One problem that soon became clear was that my foreskin would not stay and cover the head. It just retracted by itself, which left my glans unprotected (quite uncomfortable in the beginning, but I got used to it) Another problem was that after the operation I saw that a there was a quite large swelling under the skin below the penis head. Around 20 milimeters (2/3 inch) in diameter I guess. I went to see my doctor and and he told me, that it would go away. And it did. But unfortunately the swelling had expanded the skin. It's not that much, but it makes a strange kind of "collar" around the head.</p>
              <p>So for the past 9 years I've had this loose part of the foreskin hanging under the penis and I've had not skin to cover my glans. This DOES make it more insensitive and it looks a bit dry. I'm now going to talk to my physician about this and I hope that I can have the loose part of skin removed, since it kinds hurts my self confidence that I look different down there :) So please consider that the operation can have complication. I wish I had NOT done it and had tried the 'manual' methods in stead. But of course you will not have that choice if your condition makes it impossible.</p>
              <p>Good luck whatever you guys choose to do!</p>
