                  Been away for quite sometime and notice there's been quite a discussion on this during my absence..
              
                  
                  As with all surgical procedures, there are always pros and cons to it...results of procedure can vary in different people even though it is the same procedure..some people who had the same procedure might had it good while some might not..sometimes it also depend on who is the one carrying out the procedure..
                  
                  I have read quite a lot of testimonies from both groups of people who did preputioplasty and circumcision...for both procedures, some reported excellent results, some did not..while one of us might report unpleasant results with preputioplasty here, it doesn't mean it will be bad for all people..I too have read quite a few accounts of people who said they fully regretted going for circumcision for various reasons..having said tat, I dun think any conclusions can really be drawn as to which procedure is definitely better..sometimes it really depends on your priorities and preferences for certain things..
                  
              
                  Some say the appearance(circumcised penis always said to look better according to most people) is more impt while some dun really care abt tat..in anycase, most intact men dun really complain abt that foreskin hanging around makin their manhood look ugly, do they? 
              
                  
                  I will have a check up at Dr Ho's place and a thorough dicussion with him on the pros and cons before deciding what I would go for..
                  
                  Thanks for everyone's input by the way...really appreciate it..

              <p><br> Been away for quite sometime and notice there's been quite a
              discussion on this during my absence.. As with all surgical
              procedures, there are always pros and cons to it...results of
              procedure can vary in different people even though it is the same
              procedure..some people who had the same procedure might had it good
              while some might not..sometimes it also depend on who is the one
              carrying out the procedure.. I have read quite a lot of testimonies
              from both groups of people who did preputioplasty and
              circumcision...for both procedures, some reported excellent
              results, some did not..while one of us might report unpleasant
              results with preputioplasty here, it doesn't mean it will be bad
              for all people..I too have read quite a few accounts of people who
              said they fully regretted going for circumcision for various
              reasons..having said tat, I dun think any conclusions can really be
              drawn as to which procedure is definitely better..sometimes it
              really depends on your priorities and preferences for certain
              things.. Some say the appearance(circumcised penis always said to
              look better according to most people) is more impt while some dun
              really care abt tat..in anycase, most intact men dun really
              complain abt that foreskin hanging around makin their manhood look
              ugly, do they? I will have a check up at Dr Ho's place and a
              thorough dicussion with him on the pros and cons before deciding
              what I would go for.. Thanks for everyone's input by the
              way...really appreciate it..</p>

              <p>hi all,<br><br>today is the 1st Jan 09.......happy new year!<br><br>and today, i received my new year present.......I MANAGED TO PULL BACK MY FORESKIN ALL THE WAY!!!!!!! OMFG!!!!!! :-O<br><br>it was somewhat accidental, though. What happened today was:<br><br>-i watched lots of porn and masturbate as usual; usually this lasts for 1.5+ hours but i took like 3 hours today<br><br>-after i'm done, i played around with my penis a bit (in it's fully non-erect state) and tried to see how far i can stretch for fun<br><br>-previously, when my penis is in fully non-erect state, i can stretch the foreskin back just a little bit (less than 0.2 cm)<br><br>-today, i tried to test the limit of the stretching, so i tried to pull it back a bit more<br><br>-and a bit more.....and then it retracted back by 0.6 cm<br><br>-i was excited, so i tried a bit more, but then it stopped<br><br>-at that time, the thought of pain + circumcision + S$2500 surgery fee came into my head, and i knew i couldn't give up<br><br>-so i tried harder and told myself "even if bleed, so what? skin only mah, bleed bleed loh! heck care!"<br><br>-with that, i used both my fingers of both hands to tug at both sides of the foreskin and pull them sideways (left fingers pull left part of foreskin sideways, and right fingers pull right part of foreskin sideways). Then, with that, both fingers proceed to pull down the foreskin.<br>(pull sideways to expand the foreskin and loosen it a little, then pull everything down)<br><br>-because my foreskin is very tight, now that i pull it down, it won't go back to previously (normal state) again. The big "band" around the penis forehead prevents the foreskin from sliding back to previous state. So, now, it's like my foreskin is exposed all the time.<br><br>-of course, i can still retract back to previously as normal, but for now, i wanna keep it this way to let the head be used to the rubbing of the underwear. Now, the head is very sensitive and everything i used my fingers to stroke the head, I kinda shiver due to the sensitivity<br><br>-as for pain, it's not really pain; more like uncomfortability due to very sensitive skin (shower and water are no problem; but actual touching with hands is very sensitive)<br><br>I've some questions for those of you guys who are knowledgeable about this:<br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) There's some greyish-white "dust" thing below the "band" area. You guys have it too?<br><br>2) How long does it take for that sensitivity to go away?<br><br>3) Should I always keep my penis in this retracted state? Looks kinda cool to me. X-D<br><br>4) Now that my skin has been fully exposed and I get erect, the frenulum area is kinda tight though. I can feel the frenulum gripping the penis very tightly. You guys feel the same? It's kinda uncomfortable, seriously. Not sure if I will get used to this.<br></span><br>So, I guess, my problem is just tight foreskin, and not true phimosis (true phimosis is whereby the foreskin really can't retract at all).<br>For those who're experiencing similar problems, maybe you could try what I did.<br><br>Just use lubricant if needed (if you don't want to watch porn), and be sure to retract the foreskin when the penis is in fully NON-ERECT state. If you try to retract it during erect state, I'm sure there'll really be blood.</p>
              <p>Happy New Year 2009!</p>

              <p>Found this topic through google while researching preputioplasty..</p>
              <p>I'm going for one this coming wednesday, so i was looking around for heasling rates &amp; how much pain was involved (i've noticed that the actual foreskin, if pinched as hard as possible, doesnt seem to hurt at all.. so it may be fine.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>few things i saw on this page that caught my eye.. firstly:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>yeah, i think circumcision is still a better choice than Preputioplasty.<br><br>i have seen pics of Preputioplasty whereby there's some kind of skin hanging around the penis head area like a rooster's throat.<br><br>circumcision will let your penis look like a porn star's.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You may have been looking at the 'dorsal slit' which is a similar procedure, but leads to visual weirdness; as the skin gathers underneath. The preputioplasty has no visual effect.</p>
              <p>And:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>just a quick qn..do u guys talk to your parents abt this?<br><br>i feel uncomfortable broaching this topic to them...even to my dad, coz we are not the types that discuss abt sex openly...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Now, my urologist suggested telling someone at home, incase when you have the op, you react badly to the anaesthetic later on. SO maybe mention it to your dad. One thing my girlfriend suggested, to avoid embarassment, was to tell him that 'because i'm so well endowned, the foreskin was tight' Instead of it being weird, he'll be proud XD</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More info about my op:</p>
              <p>I'm from the uk, so the preputioplasty is free on the NHS (yay).. my doctor and urologist first suggested circ over preputioplasty, as i believe they try and cut costs -,-, with it being free.</p>
              <p>I asked for the op last november, took a month to get an appointment for my urologist, and then 2 months about, for a spot to open up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The actual operation is said to take minutes.. which is great!</p>
              <p>I'll come back to post about how it went on thursdayish.. wish me luck, lmao.</p>

              <p>@ Casper: congrats! :-)</p>
              <p>btw, just take it slow! ever since i managed to pull back my foreskin, i'm having better progress everyday. now, i can even pull it back when fully erect.</p>
              <p>the only thing is that my foreskin isn't as smooth or flexible as those US male porn stars.</p>
              <p>in those porn videos, their foreskin seems to be 100% flexible and can slide forward backward all the way without any lube. for me, i need lube and even then, it's nowhere near their level.</p>
              <p>but then, as long as foreskin can retract to show the turtle head (even if you need some lube), then it's an achievement already.</p>
              <p>also, that piece of foreskin is meant to stretch, so stretch it, but take it slowly bit by bit. :-)</p>
              <p>what the doc says is right, but i advise you to try retracting back when watching porn.</p>
              <p>for some reason, porn gives me lots of courage and helps numb any fear or thoughts of pain i've, so it's even easier. :-)</p>
              <p>and when you bath, use plenty of soap and rub it in the foreskin opening and then practice retracting. it's even more slippery and easier than oil. :-)</p>
              <p>i'm now using this 100ml Guardian pharmacy house-brand massaging oil.</p>
