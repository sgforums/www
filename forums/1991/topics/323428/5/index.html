              <p>hi all,<br> <br> today is the 1st Jan 09.......happy new year!<br> <br> and today, i received my new year present.......I MANAGED TO PULL
              BACK MY FORESKIN ALL THE WAY!!!!!!! OMFG!!!!!! :-O<br> <br> it was somewhat accidental, though. What happened today was:<br> <br> -i watched lots of porn and masturbate as usual; usually this lasts
              for 1.5+ hours but i took like 3 hours today<br> <br> -after i'm done, i played around with my penis a bit (in it's fully
              non-erect state) and tried to see how far i can stretch for
              fun<br> <br> -previously, when my penis is in fully non-erect state, i can
              stretch the foreskin back just a little bit (less than 0.2
              cm)<br> <br> -today, i tried to test the limit of the stretching, so i tried to
              pull it back a bit more<br> <br> -and a bit more.....and then it retracted back by 0.6 cm<br> <br> -i was excited, so i tried a bit more, but then it stopped<br> <br> -at that time, the thought of pain + circumcision + S$2500 surgery
              fee came into my head, and i knew i couldn't give up<br> <br> -so i tried harder and told myself "even if bleed, so what? skin
              only mah, bleed bleed loh! heck care!"<br> <br> -with that, i used both my fingers of both hands to tug at both
              sides of the foreskin and pull them sideways (left fingers pull
              left part of foreskin sideways, and right fingers pull right part
              of foreskin sideways). Then, with that, both fingers proceed to
              pull down the foreskin.<br> (pull sideways to expand the foreskin and loosen it a little, then
              pull everything down)<br> <br> -because my foreskin is very tight, now that i pull it down, it
              won't go back to previously (normal state) again. The big "band"
              around the penis forehead prevents the foreskin from sliding back
              to previous state. So, now, it's like my foreskin is exposed all
              the time.<br> <br> -of course, i can still retract back to previously as normal, but
              for now, i wanna keep it this way to let the head be used to the
              rubbing of the underwear. Now, the head is very sensitive and
              everything i used my fingers to stroke the head, I kinda shiver due
              to the sensitivity<br> <br> -as for pain, it's not really pain; more like uncomfortability due
              to very sensitive skin (shower and water are no problem; but actual
              touching with hands is very sensitive)<br> <br> I've some questions for those of you guys who are knowledgeable
              about this:<br> <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">1) There's some greyish-white "dust"
              thing below the "band" area. You guys have it too?<br> <br> 2) How long does it take for that sensitivity to go away?<br> <br> 3) Should I always keep my penis in this retracted state? Looks
              kinda cool to me. X-D<br> <br> 4) Now that my skin has been fully exposed and I get erect, the
              frenulum area is kinda tight though. I can feel the frenulum
              gripping the penis very tightly. You guys feel the same? It's kinda
              uncomfortable, seriously. Not sure if I will get used to
              this.<br></span><br> So, I guess, my problem is just tight foreskin, and not true
              phimosis (true phimosis is whereby the foreskin really can't
              retract at all).<br> For those who're experiencing similar problems, maybe you could try
              what I did.<br> <br> Just use lubricant if needed (if you don't want to watch porn), and
              be sure to retract the foreskin when the penis is in fully
              NON-ERECT state. If you try to retract it during erect state, I'm
              sure there'll really be blood.</p>
              <p>Happy New Year 2009!</p>

              <p>That's because you didn't wash that area when you didn't manage to fully retract last time. I forgot the name of this... starts with S I think...</p>

              <p>2 types of phimosis. Yours was likely the same since birth... so the remedy is just to do gentle stretching for a few months....</p>
              <p>The other type of phimosis occurs for people who could retract last time, then one day cannot....</p>

              <p>QUOTE Nikar3:</p>
              <p>thanks, but any disvantages to low-cut?</p>
              <p>equally important is that the penis must look nice after
                                      cutting.</p>
              <p>btw, did you cut your frenulum too?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My Reply:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I personally think (and I requested for it during my opt) that a MIDDLE and MODERATELY TIGHT cut be made. I think you might be slightly confused here.</span></p>
              <p>Basically, there are HIGH/LOW and LOOSE/TIGHT cuts. HIGH/LOW cuts refer to the placement of the scar. If you ask for a high cut, your scar will be placed closer to your crotch, meaning that MORE inner sensitive skin is exposed. If its a low cut, your scar is placed nearer to the head of the penis, having LESS sensitive inner skin outside. A HIGH cut will be more sensitive, a LOW cut will be less sensitive. For mine, I chose MIDDLE to get better balance.</p>
              <p>A LOOSE cut will result in LESS SKIN BEING CUT AWAY, meaning that there will be some skin left on your shaft for some sliding. For a TIGHT cut, this means that a lot of skin will be cut off, leaving your shaft almost smooth when erect. There will almost be no mobile skin left on your shaft. Honestly, a tight cut looks better. But a loose cut allows some room for shaft play. For me, I requested to be moderately tightly cut, as a result, I have a little shaft skin left to play with even when erect. I initially wanted a VERY tight circ, but decided against it when I was told if it were to be too tight, erections would hurt.</p>
              <p>As for the frenulum, I didn't discuss that with my doctor and he just cut it away without me knowing. I don't really miss it though because when I still had my foreskin, my frenulum tore once, it is really hurt.</p>
              <p>Overall, I am very happy with my circ. It is up to you to choose your own style.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Its a simple and easy way to get rid of this. While you masturbate,close your hand on the top of the pennis and do it a bit harder way, pull up and down. Dont put any lubricants just use little coconut oil. It will help you overcome this prob in a month time. Or alternatively, go to ayurvedic masseurs (Indians) they generally help to get rid of this through traditional coconut oil massage which is known well for this reason.</p></div>

              <p><br>Hey thanks for the advice! :) I just went for my op yesterday and it has gotten a lot better today. I removed the bandage already though but changed it with a new one. Surprisingly, there wasn't much bleeding. Mine was a low &amp; loose one such that there would be skin covering the glans a bit after all has recovered. According to my mum, who was a nurse, she said that my wound was recovering very well.</p>
              <p>I do have a few questions to ask though. My problems lie with the underwear part. I don't dare to wear underwear as my glans is still very raw &amp; sensitive so all this while I've been wearing boxers or sometimes even nothing. Should I continue to do so? The sensitivity is killing me. And I'm also afraid of the nocturnal erections part when it comes at night. Any way to solve it (like different sleeping positions)? And roughly how long would it take for the stitches/sutures to naturally come off? Or did you ask your doctor to help you remove it?</p>

              <p>Haha i see, however to me no matter how many you have seen, its still not mine. Still would feel uneasy though but i guess under your situation, not much of a choice and seeing it flaccid isn't as bad as erected which i believe you definitely would avoid at this stage.</p>
              <p>Sorry but i can't give any proper advice for this but hopefully your wound heals well and you can keep it covered again and back to 'normal' functioning :p</p>

              <p><br> Hey thanks for the advice! :) I just went for my op yesterday
              and it has gotten a lot better today. I removed the bandage already
              though but changed it with a new one. Surprisingly, there wasn't
              much bleeding. Mine was a low &amp; loose one such that there would
              be skin covering the glans a bit after all has recovered.
              According to my mum, who was a nurse, she said that my wound was
              recovering very well.</p>
              <p>I do have a few questions to ask though. My problems lie
              with the underwear part. I don't dare to wear underwear as my glans
              is still very raw &amp; sensitive so all this while I've been
              wearing boxers or sometimes even nothing. Should I continue to do
              so? The sensitivity is killing me. And I'm also afraid of the
              nocturnal erections part when it comes at night. Any way to solve
              it (like different sleeping positions)? And roughly how long would
              it take for the stitches/sutures to naturally come off? Or did you
              ask your doctor to help you remove it?</p>
              </div>

              <p>First, I would like to congratulate you on finally undergoing the opt. I will now address your concerns.</p>
              <p>For the sensitive glans part, there is nothing much you can do except grin and bear it. When you said that you've been wearing boxers, does that mean that you're wearing boxers NOW (after the op) or do you mean that you've been wearing boxers all along and now you don't really dare to wear anything? Please clarify.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you can look up this site: <a href="http://www.circinfo.com/prepandcare/pac.html">http://www.circinfo.com/prepandcare/pac.html</a>. Basically, what it recommends is you to wear some form of loose fitting briefs that allow some form of support and yet not to tight.</p>
              <p>As for nocturnal erections, the clue is not to drink so much water before you sleep, and go to the bathroom to pee before you sleep. I read somewhere that the fetus position (curled up to one side with a pillow/bolster tucked between your legs) helps reduce night erections. Also, you can request your doctor to give you some medicine that prevents night erections although I felt that it wasn't necessary.</p>
              <p>For stitches, it depends. Mine were dissolvable stitches, meaning that they are MEANT to fall off after 3 weeks or so. You have to know what kind of stitches were used on you. If they're dissolvable ones, they'll fall off automatically after 3 weeks. If they're non-dissolvable, your doctor would have told you to come back some time later to remove them for you.</p>
              <p>Feel free to clarify any more doubts with me.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the advice so far. Really appreciate it. I've been doing what all the other websites on circumcision tell me, namely the fetal position when sleeping &amp; stuff like that. And the nocturnal erections dun come very often at night anymore so that is a problem solved. Similarly, I was told that my stitches were the dissolvable kind too and I'm due to see the doc in 1 week's time so if he does see the need to remove, which I highly doubt so now, he would do so. So that's another problem solved.</p>
              <p>So my last concern is the boxers part. I've been wearing boxers before the op &amp; after the op. But when I sleep at night, I take it off to let it air. Basically, my glans is so sensitive that even the slightest touch of it against my thigh would send a jolt through my body. So I guess the only advice that I really need now is what brand of loose fitting briefs do you recommend? The kind you used back when you were going through the recovery stage.</p>

              <p>one question for you guys..........do any of you worry about the frenulum snapping during sex?</p>
              <p>i've been retracting my foreskin all the way recently and when erect, i can see the frenulum is like being stretched tightly (no pain, though).</p>
              <p>i was thinking during sex, if i try those positions in those porn vids, whether my frenulum will snap.</p>
              <p>if any un-circumcised male here have experienced sex before, pls advise on this frenulum issue.</p>
              <p>i see that the frenulum is fragile and delicate and very prone to snapping by the slightest touch.</p>

              <p><br>Hello again. I had dissolvable sutures on. It took me 3 weeks for the first sutures to start dropping off. The top suture took almost 4 weeks even though all the other sutures all around already fell off. Don't worry about it. It will fall off eventually. Good luck. See a doctor if it hasn't fallen off after 1 month.</p>
