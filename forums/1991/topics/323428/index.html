              <p>Hi, anyone here ever have the condition called Phimosis before? If yes, anyone tried the surgical procedure called<strong> </strong><strong><strong>Preputioplasty</strong> </strong>in correcting it? How was the experience, cost and the place which you seek consultation with?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know Circumcision is one of the most common methods used to rectify this condition but would prefer to keep the foreskin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pls share if anyone has experience and recommendations..thanks..</p>

The manual method only works for those with a less serious extent of the problem.I recently done some research on this and came to know of Preputioplasty which have been said to be a good alternative to circumcision.

            <div class='col-md body'>i have, or rather, had the same problem as you. My doctor didn't tell me anything about the pre-plasty operation. The next thing i knew, i was at gleneagles, lying face up and getting injections. It was local, not general so i was awake. The whole area was numb and i heard some snipping. I didn't dare to look lol. So when i got up, the whole thing was bandaged and numb and sore. The tip also exposed. For the next month, i had to wear a bandage and cannot use underwear. I even cried one morning when i woke up with an erection cause it was so painful. But after the month, it was fine. And the problem was solved after that.</div>

              <p>Preputioplasty is a surgical method that is newly available in SG (its been around in europe for yrs) as an alternative to circumcision. It is a less drastic operation compared to Circumcision and is good for those who wants to keep the foreskin intact. It is however only suitable for certain conditions. The doc won't recommend Preputioplasty to anyone that has similar problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe currently there are very few medical centres or hospitals offering such a procedure. I have managed to find one that offers such a procedure and the cost is about $2500 (can use $500 from medisave). But so far I think very very few people had tried it. I have not known of anyone who tried it and after posting this topic here, it seems no one else have experienced it. I intend to go down for consultation early next yr..</p>

              <p>I think that is bloody damn expensive. You might as well get it cut off. Circumcision costs only like $550 at Gleneagles. Furthermore, I'm sure you can find benefits from losing that foreskin.</p>

              <p>Dear PDBM:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 5 most sensitive areas of the Penis is actually located on the foreskin. There are various studies and research conducted worldwide which reported pleasure of sexual activities are more enhanced in uncircumcised males than circumcised males. There have also been studies which rebutted the usual thinking that circumcision helps significantly in hygiene. Read also testimonies of circumcised males who lamented they felt loss of sexual pleasure in comparision to prior circumcision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Circumcision is a must if the condition cannot be resolved by any other means and if there is already infection taking place. Preputioplasty cannot be used if the patient already has an infection. If there are other alternative solutions which can solve the problem for the patient, it should be preferred over circumcision. Circumcision should only be used as the last resort if all other methods have failed or is not viable </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read this: <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/studies.htm">http://www.circumcision.org/studies.htm</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Above are just one of the many websites and studies being conducted on the subject of circumcision. I do believe not many people are aware of the possible side effects of circumcision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some pple may say such studies are very subjective. Well, why not err on the side of caution and take preventive measures if one knows there are other ways to solve a problem? Why risk it just to save $1500 and that part of your body happens to be one of the most imporant?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just dun understand why is there a lack of discussion on alternative methods to circumcision in Singapore. Preputioplasty is long available in other european countries but it is strangely rarely spoken off in SG. Everytime when a male in SG has problems such as tight foreskin, the reaction of docs in SG is always either to ask you to do manual stretching or if that fails, circumcision. If one bothers to look through other health related forums in overseas, Preputioplasty has always been spoken of as one of the viable method to treat Phimosis (provided infection hasn't occured).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for healing, it takes just abt 5 days for complete healing with Preputioplasty and for Circumcision, complete healing takes 2-3 weeks.</p>
