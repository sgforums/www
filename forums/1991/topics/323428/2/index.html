              <p>Thanks for sharing the article. In research studies on any topics, I do acknowledge there is always two sides of argument to a situation. Besides the two articles I brought up, I must have read at least a dozen more such studies throwing questionable doubts on circumcision and the important functions of the foreskin. I do not doubt there could be other benefits of circumcision, but for me, why take a chance if there is other alternative solutions which could solve the same problem and may bring about certain benefits?</p>

              <p>actually, $2500 is very expensive (btw, i'm the "chap" who started a circumcision thread once at: http://www.sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/313205)</p>
              <p>i have severe phimosis in that my penis when erect is around 5"5 (14 cm), but my foreskin can only pull back less than 0.1 cm at most, and even then, it's a bit uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>will Preputioplasty work in my case? i don't have any infection whatsoever.</p>
              <p>actually, i prefer a circumcised penis over a non-circumcised one, because circumcised one looks a lot nicer, but the greatest fear i've is that if you circumcised as adult, the sex experience will be greatly affected due to the constant rubbing of the forehead's glans against underwear.</p>
              <p>i'm very scared of not being able to enjoy sex anymore, and worse still, i won't even get erect (or will have soft erection) when i see porn.</p>
              <p>for those people who have circumcised during older-teenage years or during adulthood, do you still get aroused when you see porn? are you still able to get erection when you masturbate?</p>
              <p>also, i wonder if anyone is going for circumcision this year's end (around nov or dec 08).</p>
              <p>i need some moral encourage because now i'm the only one going (nobody else including my family knows about it).</p>
              <p>i'm planning to take 3 - 4 days leave and go for laser circumcision (more expensive than traditional circumcision but heals faster and less pain, nicer-looking results), but everytime i think of it, i really freak out.</p>

                  forehead's glans against underwear.</span></p>
              <p>Having only been circumcised about 2 months ago, I can tell you that the loss of sensitivity after circumcision is <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></span> mostly due to the rubbing of the exposed glans against underwear. It is in fact, the style of your circumcision. You see, I was circumcised low and moderately tight. Look what they mean if you don't know. Basically, my scar is near the glans (low) and quite a bit of skin was snipped away, hence moderately tight. Hence, a lot of my inner foreskin was cut away as compared to the outer shaft skin. Therefore, my loss of sensitivity was because of the inner skin being cut away. Anyway, you can request for a different circumcision style. Also, I swear by the sensitivity of the scar itself, it's so sensitive, it's sometimes painful to stroke it.</p>

              <p>Of course you'll be able to enjoy sex and get erections.</p>

                  (nobody else including my family knows about it).</span></p>
              <p>I underwent that situation too. My doctor told me I needed the operation so I went for it without telling anyone including my family because you just don't go to your mom saying that your foreskin is too tight. You need inner courage. If you're set about the health benefits it will bring, go for it. Trust me, the only time you're afraid would be while you're lying on the operation table itself. Then afer the sedative is given, you won't feel anything, just a little sore, numb and sensitive that's all.</p>

                                          moderately tight. Look what they mean if you don't know. Basically,
                                          my scar is near the glans (low) and quite a bit of skin was snipped
                                          away, hence moderately tight. Hence, a lot of my inner foreskin was
                                          cut away as compared to the outer shaft skin. Therefore, my loss of
                                          sensitivity was because of the inner skin being cut away. Anyway,
                                          you can request for a different circumcision style. Also, I swear
                                          by the sensitivity of the scar itself, it's so sensitive, it's
                                          sometimes painful to stroke it.</span></p>

              <p>thanks a lot for your reply. i've quite a bit of questions to ask you, so hope you don't mind. If you could advise, i'm very sure your answers will help a lot of people who'll be undergoing circumcision soon (like me and Kenshin).</p>
              <p>questions:</p>
              <p>1) when you go see the doctor, the doctor will advise on the circumcision style and let you choose by showing you pictures?</p>
              <p>2) is your scar big and visible? i assume it must look really gross and the penis is kind of "disfigured"? Where's the scar in your case and how big (approx in cm?)</p>
              <p>i'm scared to freak out my future gf / wife.</p>

                                          table itself. Then afer the sedative is given, you won't feel
                                          anything, just a little sore, numb and sensitive that's all.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>3) so, they apply the anaethesia to numb only penis area while you're awake?</p>
              <p>4) is yours the traditional circumcision or the laser one?</p>
              <p>5) how long did your surgery take? 15 mins? 25 mins?</p>
              <p>6) did you complete the surgery on the 1st time you saw doctor? (as in, you see him the 1st time and you do surgery on the same day)</p>
              <p>7) after anaethesia wears off, is it very painful? if very painful, for how many days?</p>
              <p>8) did you wear sarong after operation? or just loose underwear?</p>
              <p>9) after surgery, when you go home to bath and the water touches the wound, does it hurt?</p>
              <p>10) after surgery, does the wound bleed etc.? (i don't want my mom to see my bloodied underwear)</p>
              <p>11) did you have problems walking or walking fast?</p>
              <p>12) during operation, is the doctor the only one in the room? or are there female nurses?</p>
              <p>13) could you provide the address / doctor name where you did the operation?</p>
              <p>14) how much did the surgery cost?</p>
              <p>15) did you regret going for circumcision?</p>

              <p><strong>To Kenshin_Himura:</strong> I found this website at: urologycentre.com.sg.......the doctor is Ho Siew Hong and seems quite good. I may be going to him as he offers laser circumcision and i'm very scared of the traditional type.</p>

              <p>Dr Ho Siew Hong is the doctor whom I'm planning to consult for my Phimosis problem. He offers Preputioplasty as well at his clinic. I will go for Preputioplasty unless after examination he feels circumcision is better for me. His fees are not cheap by the way.

              <p>Hi Nikar 3,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think Iam worse off than you. Mine is not even retractable by 0.1cm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, $2500 is expensive if compared to circumcision. But look at it this way, circumcision is a bit like shaving your head bald or performing a crew cut on your head and preputioplasty is much like trimming your hair with a style of which not any barber can do. Which is going to cost a lot more? Circumcision is even available at some GPs whereas Preptioplasty is only available at very selective medical places as it is more difficult to do. I will only trust specialists for such a procedure and have chanced upon Dr Ho who seems to possess high credentials in the area of Urology.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dun think Iam going to be bothered by the appearance of my penis. Iam also inclined to believe Preputioplasty is likely to work for most cases after reading quite a number of feedback from patients who have undergone this procedure in overseas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For your concerns abt circumcision, here are some articles(besides those that I posted earlier):</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.norm-uk.org/circumcision_lost.html">http://www.norm-uk.org/circumcision_lost.html</a></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/anat/">http://www.cirp.org/pages/anat/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not want to be here concluding Preputioplasty is going to be better for everyone. But I feel if you have concerns, do give it a thorough thought first before making that decision. Please note that once circumcision is done, the process is irreversible. There are people who after doing circumcision, wanted to do a foreskin restoration. <a href="http://www.norm-uk.org/foreskin_restoration.html">http://www.norm-uk.org/foreskin_restoration.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you ask medical doctors such as Dr Ho whether sexual pleasure would be loss with circumcision, he will likely tell you there's no concrete medical evidence that suggest so. Most doctors will tell you that as most medical researches usually will only be able to throw reasonable doubts or findings on a subject but is often not conclusive enough for certain declaration to be made. But that is not to say some of the conjectures made by certain researches has got absolutely no truth in it or has no basis in it whatsoever. You know what I mean right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just to let you know also that I originally wanted to do this procedure (Preputioplasty) by end Nov/Dec this yr but will now postponed this to sometime in 1st Quarter to Mid 2009 as I will be too tied down with work committments in End 2008 as I will be joining a new company in Oct 2008 and it will not be good for me to take leave at that time. Do let me know what are you thoughts...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In life, I always feel things happen for a reason...as such, I feel the presence of foreskin on our penis is there for a reason too...But if situation dictates that Circumcision is the only alternative, then I will go for it...Let's see how is the outcome of consulation by Dr Ho..</p>

              <p>i think we're about the same.....mine can retract 0.1 cm but only if i tried to pull it back really hard (it hurts a lot), and after a while, it will go back again.</p>
              <p>my problem is not just phimosis, but the foreskin is kinda long too.</p>
              <p>so, for my case, i'm not sure if preputioplasty is better or circumcision.</p>

              <p>$2500 is very expensive since i'm not a rich guy, and $2500 = nearly 2 months of my salary</p>
              <p>my main goal of going for the surgery, regardless of whether it's preputioplasty or circumcision, is to fix my phimosis problem.</p>
              <p>more importantly, because my phimosis is quite serious, i know for sure there'll be problems during sex in future.</p>
              <p>If preputioplasty can cure my phimosis and make my penis like others (able to retract fully etc), then i'll go for that, obviously, even though it's way more expensive, but i don't mind paying for that.</p>
              <p>my concern is whether preputioplasty can be done on people with phimosis + slightly-longer-than-average-foreskins.</p>

              <p>Answers:</p>
              <p>1) Yes, my doctor did that. I told him I wanted a full circ when he asked me whether do I want about half a centimeter of skin left on the shaft</p>
              <p>2) No, the scar is not big or disfigured. It is now a thin line. I can send you some photos over email if you want.</p>
              <p>3) Yes, local <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">anaethesia is applied through injections in that area.</span></p>
              <p>4) Traditional freehand.</p>
              <p>5) About 1 hour.</p>
              <p>6) Yes.</p>
              <p>7) There is no sharp pain I can tell you that. When the <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">anaethesia is still working, all you feel is a numb and swollen thing hanging between your legs. After it wears off, there is no sharp pain, just a dull ache.</span></p>
              <p>8) For the first 2 days or so I couldn't wear any underwear.</p>
              <p>9) Cannot shower straight after surgery. You need to leave the compression bandage on for 2 - 3 days. After that, when I showered for the following week, I took extra care not to splash water or soap directly onto the wound, instead I simply let water run over it. No it didn't hurt.</p>
              <p>10) Yes, the wound WILL bleed. But only for the first 3 days.</p>
              <p>11) I couldn't close my legs/thighs properly after surgery, so I walked slightly awkward, I could run, but I tried not to.</p>
              <p>12) During the operation, the nurse held my penis and assisted the doctor in handing him the scapel etc.</p>
              <p>13) Sent this information to your mailbox.</p>
              <p>14) $600</p>
              <p>15) Obviously not.</p>

              <p>same here! i've contacted Dr Ho some time ago by e-mail and found that the circumcision surgergy is around S$1500.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">The $1500 he is charging is for laser circumcision right? It is excessively expensive if it is for normal type of circumcision which can be done at most places for around $500-600.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my problem is not just phimosis, but the foreskin is kinda long too.</p>
              <p>so, for my case, i'm not sure if preputioplasty is better or circumcision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">I think so far we can only speculate. Only the doc can determine which will be more suitable. Preputioplasty is a less drastic procedure but it can also mean it might have its limits as well..</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>$2500 is very expensive since i'm not a rich guy, and $2500 = nearly 2 months of my salary</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">By the way, just to let you know, of the $2500, $500 is payable by medisave. So, it will be $2000 by cash.</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">Ok, $2000 may stilll be quite a substantial amount for lots of people, but if you start putting aside a small sum of money each month, perhaps you will have sufficient funds for it by the time you decide you want to go for this</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If preputioplasty can cure my phimosis and make my penis like others (able to retract fully etc), then i'll go for that, obviously, even though it's way more expensive, but i don't mind paying for that.</p>
              <p>my concern is whether preputioplasty can be done on people with phimosis + slightly-longer-than-average-foreskins.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Preputioplasty is definitely an alternative treatment solution for Phimosis. This has been confirmed by Dr Ho and also some articles I came across on website. The only thing is, whether the extent of your problem can be cured by it (and also you must never have an infection before). This is something which only the doctor can determine during examination.</span> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so, what made you choose preputioplasty over circumcision?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">All along I have reservations and some fear about doing a circumcision even before I had done some research via website. Partly its the perceived pain and discomfort which puts me off (its been said that circumcision is much less painful when done young compared to when it is done as a full grown adult) and I also have this thought that the foreskin is an integral part of the sexual organ and should not be removed just like that unless absolutely necessary</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">With these thoughts in my mind, I begin to explore the possibility of whether its possible to have a surgery which is less drastic than Circumcision but at the same time of which can solve my Phimosis problem as well. True enough, after researching on these topics extensively on the website, I chance upon Preputioplasty and found out that it can be an effective solution for Phimosis which allows one to keep the foreskin at same time. Also found out that it takes a shorter healing time compared to Circumcision and is also less painful. I also chanced upon various studies which cast doubts about possible side effects that can be brought about by circumcision which make the option of Preputioplasty becoming a further increasingly attractive one for me. Iam not saying Circumcision is definitely bad, but since I already have some doubts about it, why take a chance?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yeah, that's what i'm thinking.....i wanted to do circumcision this Nov 08 but it's one of the greatest decision in my life and i don't think i'm ready for it, because i want to read more about preputioplasty and circumcision first before deciding whether they're right for me.</p>
              <p>based on my calculations at this time, i'll most likely visit Dr. Ho in early Jan 09.......if not, May 09.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so, you'll be going to see him for consultation this coming weeks?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">I will be seeing him for consultation nearer to the time of surgery. As I have decided I will not be going for the surgery anytime within this year, so I will probably see him perhaps sometime in Jan or Feb 09 for a consultation. Depending on my work committments and schedule, I might go for the surgery sometime within March-May 09..Perhaps we can go together if both our schedule can fit in together? </span></p>

                  <p>thanks for your thoughts, but i'm kinda too shy to go
                  together.</p>
                  <p>i think i'll go by myself. :)</p>

                  <p><strong>To PlsDunBanMe:</strong> in your earlier post, you
                  mention that the female nurse held your penis while the doctor
                  performs the surgery.</p>
                  <p>what i like to know is, don't you feel shy or even totally
                  awkward when she's holding it?</p>
                  <p>seriously, although i'm scared of the pain, i'm even more scared
                  of the thought of letting the nurse do that sort of thing......it
                  really freaks me out, especially if the nurse is a young one.</p>
                  <p>if only Dr Ho has a male nurse or something. haiz</p>

                  Oh, I asked you if wanted to go together since you mentioned in your first post abt "supporting each other"...its ok then, since you prefer to go down alone...
                  
                  Anyway just tell yourself women do also have their breast checked by male doctors for lumps and pregnant ladies are usually attended to by male gynaecologist and you will feel better and not so "freaked out" at the thought of a female nurse holding your penis...
