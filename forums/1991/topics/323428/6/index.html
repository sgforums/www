              <p>this sticky thing you're refering to.........could it be smegma? google or wikipedia this term.</p>
              <p>if the sticky thing is indeed smegma, then i used to have the same case as you.</p>
              <p>it's super-smelly for sure.</p>
              <p>ever since then, i have the following routine to keep my kuku-bird clean :</p>
              <p>1) fully retract foreskin before urine (if you urine 10 times per day, then retract it 10 times, so what?)</p>
              <p>2) dab the penis head with tissue to clean away all liquid / urine left after urinating</p>
              <p>3) before you bath, retract the foreskin as well, then start your bath. When it comes to the part when u need to wash your kuku, then use soap to gently clean the head, and *under* the head (glans penis) as well.</p>
              <p>the entire head and it's underneath is very important. after that, use lots of water to wash away the soap till the whole thing is clean. For me, i also soak the entire penis head in water and shake it a bit (while the head is still iimmersed in water)</p>
              <p>i can assure you, with this method, my kuku is cleaner than any other part of the body and has 100% no-smell now. and i'm proud of it.</p>

              <p>Hmm ok, thought u went for a circumcision to solve your problem cos i remember you posting here and most of the people that post here are ppl who have went for circumcision or preputiplasty.</p>
              <p>The cheese is normal and just clean it off would be fine. Hopefully restrating your foreskin gets easier and easier by the day and 1 day you might not even remember you once had that problem ;)</p>
              <p>Personally i don't feel he has any real problem that requires him to really go waste money on seeing a urologist cos its not going to affect him having sex in future etc nor prevents him from retracting his foreskin. Unless really got the money to spare, its easier to just live with it since it doesn't really affect your sex life that much if at all.</p>

              <p>As mentioned, it is normal for the head to feel sensitive. Unless you are circumcised and the head is constantly touching something, you will always feel the sensitivity. That is NORMAL for all uncircumcised people so stop worrying.</p>

              <p>for me, i need to retract and clean my penis head thoroughly everyday or else the smegma (cheese) will appear. i think this is what most hygiene guys do.</p>
              <p>also, i make it a point to retract my foreskin fully everytime i urine, so that i can clean it more easily and it's a lot cleaner too (urine liquid won't get stuck on the crisps and folds of the foreskin).</p>
              <p>more importantly, for me, if i don't retract the foreskin for more than 1 - 2 days, then the foreskin will be like kinda glued to the head after 2 days, and it becomes more troublesome to retract; this is why i need to retract it everyday.</p>
              <p>also, like what <a href="../../../users/60883">dkcx</a> says, it's natural for the head to be very sensitive, but u can de-sensitive it by pulling back the foreskin and keeping the head exposed constantly for several weeks; this will harden the head a bit.</p>

              <p>There is not much point in 'desensitising' the head since it will reduce sexual pleasure. No point to force a uncircumcised dick to feel like a circumcised dick if theres no need to</p>

              <p>Just get circumcise. It's easier. I did it when I was 16 and love it. Sex was a lot better after I was cut.</p>

              <p>Hi Nikar 3,</p>
              <p>Hope you can help me with my problem,</p>
              <p>I can retract my foreskin to below my turtle head when flaccid, but cannot when fully errect.</p>
              <p>So what I normally do is I retract the foreskin 1st then errect. Very pain.</p>
              <p>Can I keep doing this to stretch the foreskin?</p>
              <p>Or is there any other better ways to stretch it?</p>
              <p>Need how long to solve this problem ah?</p>

              <p>How old are you now? How much of your foreskin can you retract when its erected? 25%? Halfway? 75%?</p>
              <p>You should try slowly retracting when its erect. It will be painful but try it slowly bit by bit and see whether there is any improvements. If after some time, there is still no improvement in how much you can retract the foreskin when erected, you might need to see a doct and consider circumcision or preputioplasty.<br>.</p>

              <p>24 years old..</p>
              <p>Last time no problem during sex..</p>
              <p>until recently the foreskin accidentally rolled back and the turtle head exposed. Damn tight and pain.</p>
              <p>Can roll back about 50% when its fully erected,</p>
              <p>last time not even 25%</p>
              <p>When its flaccid can roll all the way back to the other end of the shaft. Its abit tight, but no pain. Same during partial erect.</p>
              <p>What I am trying to do now is to retract the foreskin and leave it like that when I sleep. and also retract the foreskin 1st then errect for like 10mins.</p>
              <p>Hoping that these will stretch the foreskin or make myself get used to it..</p>
              <p>Thanks for your reply and I hope u can give me more advice.</p>
