              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) - - One in five US teens has sent nude or partially
              clothed images of themselves to someone by email or mobile phone and
              twice as many have sent sexually suggestive electronic messages, a poll
              showed Wednesday.</p>
              <p>And American youngsters aged 13-19 are having tech-sex despite a
              majority of them saying it could have "serious negative consequences"
              on them, the survey commissioned by the National Campaign to Prevent
              Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy (NCTUP) showed.</p>
              <p>More than half of
              the 1,280 teens and young adults up to age 26 who took part in the
              online poll, conducted in September and October, said they had received
              a sexually suggestive message from someone else -- and one in five said
              they had shared the racy message with a third person.</p>
              <p>Eight in 10
              teens said they would be concerned about sending a sexy image of
              themselves or racy message because they "might regret it later," while
              nearly 70 percent said they were worried it could "disappoint family."</p>
              <p>Where
              teen tech-sex gives real rise to concern among adults, said NCTUP, is
              that more than one-third of teens (38 percent) say exchanging sexy
              content makes dating or physical sex with others more likely, and three
              in 10 say those who exchange sexually suggestive content are "expected
              to hook up."</p>
              <p>"That so many young people say technology is
              encouraging an even more casual, hook-up culture is reason for concern,
              given the high rates of teen and unplanned pregnancy in the United
              States," said Marisa Nightingale, senior advisor to NCTUP.</p>
              <p>Although
              teen pregnancy and birth rates in the United States have dropped by
              one-third since the 1990s, they remain high compared to other developed
              countries and carry high costs to the teens involved, their children
              and society, NCPTUP said in a report published last year.</p>
              <p>"The US
              birth rate of 41 per 1,000 in 2004 was much higher than Canada's 14 (in
              2003), England and Wales' 27 (the highest rate in Western Europe),
              Japan's six and the Netherlands' five (the lowest rate in Western
              Europe)," said NCTUP's "Emerging Answers" report, published in November
              2007.</p>
              <p>More than 30 percent of girls in the United States become
              pregnant before they reach age 20, and many become pregnant a second
              time before their 20th birthday, according to NCTUP.</p>
              <p>According to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly half of all 15- to 19-year-olds in the United States have had sex at least once.</p>
