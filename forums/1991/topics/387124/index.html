              <p>I was offered willingly by 3 girls (at different times) to meet up and have sex with them. I only met them through msn, or cyberspace. Each girl gave their offer within only a few encounters on the net. To be precise, less than 3 times of chatting/messaging with them.<br><br>1 was a Thai-born, mixed caucasian, big-tits, slender body girl.</p>
              <p>1 was a chinese hot clubber girl (deduced from her picture) who live in the east of SG.</p>
              <p>1 was a Thai expatriate 20+ that looked like a model.<br><br>Even though these were 'sincere' demands (something that seems unbelievable but yet authentic), I remain to be morally upright, and chose to decline.</p>
              <p>And mind you these aren't those spammers or whatsoever as I did my bit of research and can differentiate between false and actual information.</p>
              <p>Moreover, I gave the contact of the first girl to some frens, and they tested it and proven that she is hot, though a real bitch and 'loose'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To get straight to the point:</p>
              <p>- Is it just me or are more girls in SG really wanting sex?</p>
              <p>- What do girls really think of such guys who choose to decline such sexual favours?</p>
              <p>- Will the guys in SG be really prepared to jump in the bandwagon and have a joyful good fun, or just saying that they would want to have sex with them and no actions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had chose to decline because:</p>
              <p>1) I find such favours outrageous coming from 'strangers'.</p>
              <p>2) She may have STDs for fooling around too easily and too much.</p>
              <p>3) Scared may end up with some kind of tranny.</p>
              <p>4) Plainly speaking, it was hard to believe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In conclusion (what I really want to know):</p>
              <p>Was it a mistake to have make those 'right' decisions? Do the guys find me dumb enough to have decline an offer by a willing party?</p>

              <p>Yes, the whole story is hard to swallow. I am not asking you to believe me. All I need is your opinions.</p>
              <p>If it were you, what would you have done?</p>
              <p>Then, do girls look up to guys who did the right thing, or should I just dun give a F... about being the good guy and have some fun with my life? For all I know if the ans is the latter, then I would tend to view females as very lowly creatures.</p>
              <p>What's the point of trying to make the world a better place when you are not appreciated for it. What's worst, it goes to show that girls like you more if you treated them as tools for sex? These statements itself will definitely give some people food for thought.</p>

              <p>I think you don't seem to comprehend the general point that comes with the story. The issue is not the rejection, rather, it is how there are such carefree women around.<br><br>You don't even have the foresight that maybe one day, your daughter or wife may just fuck around with guys like no one business because its an accepted culture.</p>
              <p>So please do think before you act.</p>
