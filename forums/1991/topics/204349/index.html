            <div class='col-md body'>how can, she is married right, i find no matter how bad the husband is she must never go crooked way, she should stand by and get herself loose first before jumping into other relationship, that is betrayal in marriage, and i really pity those man that their wife hv affairs with other man during the marriage, so pity esp children, why can't she spare any thought of that, if want to fool around just don't get married first, why broke other heart for fun or jsut to satisy herself. really sad ..... so many of this kind of case, either husband go haywire or wife, so better never get married all life, and keep on fooling around until noone to fool around with, better.<br><br>it really take very heavy responsibility to be married and to stay true to just 1 partner.  it is all in their brain. it is so fun to double crosse in general.<br></div>
