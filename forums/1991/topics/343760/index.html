              <p><br>that is the different lor...... that mean... les is still les lah.. not all butch think like a real guy.... a real guy will fuck any hole available when he is horny lah... so if u say she got a HSD.. then u better confirm if she never go out fuck around.... or she is not interests lah.... if she is not interests then she dun think like a real guy lah.. so just a gal lah...... our advise will be depend on how her thinking lor... a gal or a guy thinking..</p>

              <p>She's just messing with your mind. And what the hell are you doing going there to orh orh? Looking for trouble right? You are just giving more opportunities for something to happen.If she really respect you as a friend, or respect her gf, she would not be reacting in this manner.</p>
              <p>The reason she rejected you after she made you high is because she does not want to be the guilty party in the event you actually want to carry on. I have seen it happen so many times. She is also telling you that she still likes to F you and would like to have a no-strings attached r/s with you. In another way, it's like getting a mistress to commit, she has already emphatise on the fact that she is attached, so if you want to carry on, it is not her fault and she wants you not to expect anything out of the r/s. Why do you think some woman actually willingly stick to married man despite knowing that they are married? It's a mind game, so dun be silly and fall for it.</p>
              <p>And what are you doing still spending all your time with her? What about her gf? Dun they need time together? Unless you want her back, else stop looking for trouble yourself.</p>
