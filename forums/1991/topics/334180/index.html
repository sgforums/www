              <h1>Female Ejaculation: It is Possible!</h1>
              <p>Female Ejaculation? You mean <strong>women can ejaculate like men?</strong> Yes, we women can ejaculate – as <strong>many soaked towels</strong> in my laundry basket can attest to!</p>
              <p>Many of us women are <strong>simultaneously curious and timid</strong> about the subject. Did you know that many women ejaculate already without actually knowing they are doing it?</p>
              <p>It can be an intimidating concept to imagine gushing crazy amounts of fluid when you orgasm, but it can open you up to a new level of sexuality and can offer you the <strong>wildest, deepest, wettest orgasms ever!</strong></p>
              <p>As you might have guessed by now, the g spot is a big player in squirting – in fact female ejaculation is even sometimes referred to as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.master-your-g-spot.com/g_spot_female_ejaculation.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>g spot female ejaculation</strong>.</span></span></a><br><br>Its helpful to know that some women experience ejaculation due to stimulation to the g-spot alone; others can ejaculate with clitoral stimulation and others (like me!) do best with a combination of both.</p>
              <p>However, the g spot (with or without direct stimulation) is the key area as it becomes <strong>engorged and swells when aroused</strong> and thus sets in motion the release of ejaculate fluid.</p>
              <p>To get started with female ejaculation, set aside some time to do the exercise we've written for you below.</p>
              <p>Also, you still might be wondering what the substance of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.master-your-g-spot.com/female_ejaculate.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>female ejaculate</strong></span></span></a> is made of, as well as where it comes from. If are like most people, you have probably heard that it is just pee, but this is not the case.</p>
              <p>Although it is released via the urethra – the same tube we release urine from – it is not pee! In fact, many cultures refer to it as sacred female sexual fluid or “amrita.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>A Female Ejaculation Exercise for Women</h2>
              <p>This female ejaculation exercise is for you – the woman - to get comfortable touching and stimulating yourself, and bringing yourself to ejaculation.</p>
              <p>Leave about 45 minutes to an hour for this female ejaculation exercise. You don’t need much – gather some lube, a couple of towels, a small hand mirror, and your favorite dildo or vibrator (harder is better than soft).</p>
              <p>Here is what I keep on hand: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liberatorshapes.com/products_fascinatorthroe.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">sex sheet,</span></span></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://store.sex-superstore.com/cgi-bin/toys2.cgi?af=1&amp;amp;ecode=9001573N&amp;amp;init=&amp;amp;fam=&amp;amp;letter=&amp;amp;last_list=&amp;amp;first_list=&amp;amp;dozen_list=1&amp;amp;text=Pjur%20Group%20USA&amp;amp;criteria=manufacturer&amp;amp;init1="><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">lube,</span></span></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://users.tns.net/~backs/backstore/AcuVibe.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">acuvibe</span></span></a> and a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.babeland.com/page/TIB/PROD/butt-top-picks/LN364455"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">crystal wand.</span></span></a><br><br>You may also want to pee before starting, so that later during the exercise, you know you are not peeing, you are experiencing female ejaculation.</p>
              <p>During this female ejaculation exercise, feel free to use a small hand mirror to see what you look like touching yourself and ejaculating – it is not something you often get to view!</p>
              <p>1. Take a hot shower or bath, and get really relaxed and comfortable. Its really important with female ejaculation that you be relaxed and open (you are, after all, letting something out!)</p>
              <p>2. Set yourself up in a cozy and comfortable location, with several layers of towels or the sex sheet underneath you. You will likely want to be reclining or sitting up – lying down on your back will probably not allow you to reach your g spot.</p>
              <p>3. Begin to touch yourself, using your fingers or a dildo or vibrator - any and all of your favorite techniques to get yourself really hot. You can touch your clitoris, as well as your g-spot.</p>
              <p>4. When you are pretty aroused, take a moment to find and play with your g spot. Reaching your g-spot with just your fingers might be hard – it depends on where yours is exactly.</p>
              <p>To locate yours, take one or two fingers (you might want to use lube) and insert them inside yourself, palm up, fingers hooked, and feel around about 1½ inches in, on the front wall of your vagina, just above the pubic bone.</p>
              <p>You will likely find a pea or walnut sized spot that feels a different texture from the rest of the vagina. Play with this spot, and notice what feels best to you. Also try using your vibrator or dildo (again with lube) – it can offer much more access and control when playing with your g-spot.</p>
              <p>5. You can try the “withdrawing” technique of rubbing the g-spot directly in a series of 5-6 repetitions, and then withdraw fully your fingers or the vibrator suddenly; wait about 2-3 seconds and then repeat. This can bring on ejaculation, and you often see this technique used in videos.</p>
              <p>6. If it doesn’t, just keep heading toward orgasm, touching either your clit or gspot (or both), whatever works best for you. Either way, keep noticing the full or watery feeling you are likely experiencing.</p>
              <p>If you bring yourself to orgasm, rather than stopping, keep touching yourself – see what happens when you go beyond orgasm, when you would ordinarily stop.</p>
              <p>7. If you feel like you need to pee, you are on the right track – but rather than backing off, push into this feeling. I have found that I need to relax to let the ejaculate come out, but you may find you need to assist with pushing out.</p>
              <p>8. You are there! You are not peeing, you are experiencing female ejaculation! Don’t worry about getting the area wet – that is what the towels or the sex sheet are for – just relax, release and let go.</p>
              <p>9. Take a moment to appreciate your body and its capacity for such immense pleasure, and the amazing experience of female ejaculation.</p>
              <p>If you didn't ejaculate this time, don't worry! Think back on this female ejaculation exercise - what felt good, what you noticed, where you got stuck or blocked, etc. Think of a few things you'll do differently next time, and then try it again on another day.</p>
              <p>Practice does make perfect after all : ) <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.master-your-g-spot.com/"><br></a></p>
              <h1>Female Ejaculate: It's Not Pee!</h1>
              <p>You might be wondering <strong>what exactly is this substance</strong> of female ejaculate? And if it is released through the urethra but is not urine – which it is not – then what exactly is it?</p>
              <p>It is interesting to know that men also release ejaculate through their urethra, the same tube they pee from. In fact, the whole process of female ejaculation is <strong>much like male ejaculation.</strong></p>
              <p>Confused at all? Here’s a brief description of the process:</p>
              <p>As a woman, when you get turned on, your whole pelvic area begins to get hot and aroused, and the glands that surround your urethra, (called Skene’s paraurethral glands, if you care) start to fill up. This is why sometimes when the g spot gets stimulated, <strong>you may feel like you need to pee.</strong> Many of these glands cluster to make up the organ known as the beloved g spot.</p>
              <p>When you feel your gspot get engorged and protrude more into the vagina, it is the organ <strong>filling with female ejaculate.</strong> The fluid will either get recycled into the bladder and will come out when you next pee, or it will be released through your urethra as female ejaculation. At times <strong>this can mean a few teaspoons, and at others a cup or more!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You still might be wondering - is it urine?</strong> The answer is, no, it isn’t! It is a fluid that can be either “milky” or clear, that usually has little or no odor or taste, although this can change depending on your diet or where you are in your menstrual cycle.</p>
              <p>The fluid of female ejaculate is a mixture of glucose, fructose, some hormones and acids known as PSA and PAP, with here and there traces of urine. <strong>OK – enough of the scientific</strong>.</p>
              <p>Although you now know a bit more about female ejaculate, many cultures have not only known about it since ancient times but have both <strong>celebrated and revered</strong> it.</p>
              <p>In fact, it was known as “Liquor Vitae” in Ancient Rome, “The Third Water” in Taoist traditions, “Waters of Gaia” or “Waters of Life” in many different indigenous cultures, and is referred to by Tantric or Indian traditions as “Amrita.” In ancient Japan, it was common for women to own “Ejaculation Bowls” for capturing the flow for later use.</p>
              <p>And how was it used? Female ejaculate is considered by many to be <strong>an aphrodisiac</strong>. Many ancient cultures considered it to be a health tonic that had the ability to reverse the aging process, and so they drank it and made tea out of it. Many traditions believe that both male ejaculate and female ejaculate are needed for conception.</p>
              <p>OK, so even though most of us won’t <strong>be making tea out of female ejaculate,</strong> I can recommend a few essential items for your own exploration. Fingers and tongues are excellent, but consider adding the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.babeland.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;amp;kbid=276&amp;amp;Product_Code=LN364450"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>crystal wand</strong></span></span></a> to your bag of tricks. It was the first toy that really helped my find my g spot and ejaculate much more easily.</p>
              <p>And, because you likely don't want to have an ejaculation bowl like in ancient times, I recommend this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liberator.com/aff.php?ID=npatmor&amp;amp;L=32"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sex sheet</strong></span></span></a> underneath you. Conversely, you can put down a couple of towels, but we've found that sometimes these soak through and leave a set spot.</p>
              <p>Also, now that we've been experimenting with this for awhile, I'll be ready to ejaculate without even planning with it. This then used to leave us scrambling for towels, or just messing up the bed and mattress which bothered me.</p>
              <p>Now, with this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liberator.com/aff.php?ID=npatmor&amp;amp;L=32"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sex sheet</strong></span></span></a> we just throw it down when we start having sex and then I can ejaculate or not. It's got a waterproof inner lining, and a smooth satin side, and a furry side.</p>
              <p>Lately, I've taken to calling it my magic carpet! Generally, I just love we can throw this down on our sofa, on the floor, or on our bed, and it soaks up whatever comes out. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.master-your-g-spot.com/female_ejaculation.html"><br></a></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Squid squirt ink to alert their companions to the presence of predators, according to a study.</em></span></strong></p>
              <p>London, October 18 : Squid squirt ink to alert their companions to the presence of predators, according to a study.</p>
              <p>"When
                  fish bleed, the scent of their blood has been proven to alert nearby
                  fish of danger, so I wondered if ink was also being used as some form
                  of alarm," New Scientist quoted James Wood, a marine biologist at the
                  Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, as saying.</p>
              <p>For their study, Wood and his colleagues gathered ink from individual squid by scaring them with a shake of their aquaria.</p>
              <p>The
                  researchers either added a dose of ink to a squid's aquarium, to a
                  nearby unoccupied aquarium, or added ink that had had the dark melanin
                  colouring removed.</p>
              <p>They said that the Caribbean reef squid took evasive action in the first two cases.</p>
              <p>The
                  team observed that ink that lacked melanin did not have any effect on
                  squid behaviour, indicating that it was a visual, not a chemical,
                  signal.</p>
              <p>Unlike these reef squid that are social, and live where
                  it is light, "the majority of squid are asocial and live in darkness,
                  so it would be interesting to carry out similar work in other species,"
                  said Stephanie Bush, of Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.</p>
              <p>An article on the study has been published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology.</p>

              <h1>Female Ejaculation: It is Possible!</h1>
              <p>Female Ejaculation? You mean <strong>women can ejaculate like
              men?</strong> Yes, we women can ejaculate – as <strong>many soaked
              towels</strong> in my laundry basket can attest to!</p>
              <p>Many of us women are <strong>simultaneously curious and
              timid</strong> about the subject. Did you know that many women
              ejaculate already without actually knowing they are doing it?</p>
              <p>It can be an intimidating concept to imagine gushing crazy
              amounts of fluid when you orgasm, but it can open you up to a new
              level of sexuality and can offer you the <strong>wildest, deepest,
              wettest orgasms ever!</strong></p>
              <p>As you might have guessed by now, the g spot is a big player in
              squirting – in fact female ejaculation is even sometimes referred
              to as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.master-your-g-spot.com/g_spot_female_ejaculation.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>g spot female
              ejaculation</strong>.</span></span></a><br> <br> Its helpful to know that some women experience ejaculation due to
              stimulation to the g-spot alone; others can ejaculate with clitoral
              stimulation and others (like me!) do best with a combination of
              both.</p>
              <p>However, the g spot (with or without direct stimulation) is the
              key area as it becomes <strong>engorged and swells when
              aroused</strong> and thus sets in motion the release of ejaculate
              fluid.</p>
              <p>To get started with female ejaculation, set aside some time to
              do the exercise we've written for you below.</p>
              <p>Also, you still might be wondering what the substance of
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.master-your-g-spot.com/female_ejaculate.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>female
              ejaculate</strong></span></span></a> is made of, as well as where
              it comes from. If are like most people, you have probably heard
              that it is just pee, but this is not the case.</p>
              <p>Although it is released via the urethra – the same tube we
              release urine from – it is not pee! In fact, many cultures refer to
              it as sacred female sexual fluid or “amrita.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>A Female Ejaculation Exercise for Women</h2>
              <p>This female ejaculation exercise is for you – the woman - to get
              comfortable touching and stimulating yourself, and bringing
              yourself to ejaculation.</p>
              <p>Leave about 45 minutes to an hour for this female ejaculation
              exercise. You don’t need much – gather some lube, a couple of
              towels, a small hand mirror, and your favorite dildo or vibrator
              (harder is better than soft).</p>
              <p>Here is what I keep on hand: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liberatorshapes.com/products_fascinatorthroe.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">sex sheet,</span></span></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://store.sex-superstore.com/cgi-bin/toys2.cgi?af=1&amp;amp;amp;ecode=9001573N&amp;amp;amp;init=&amp;amp;amp;fam=&amp;amp;amp;letter=&amp;amp;amp;last_list=&amp;amp;amp;first_list=&amp;amp;amp;dozen_list=1&amp;amp;amp;text=Pjur%20Group%20USA&amp;amp;amp;criteria=manufacturer&amp;amp;amp;init1="><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">lube,</span></span></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://users.tns.net/~backs/backstore/AcuVibe.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">acuvibe</span></span></a> and a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.babeland.com/page/TIB/PROD/butt-top-picks/LN364455"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">crystal
              wand.</span></span></a><br> <br> You may also want to pee before starting, so that later during the
              exercise, you know you are not peeing, you are experiencing female
              ejaculation.</p>
              <p>During this female ejaculation exercise, feel free to use a
              small hand mirror to see what you look like touching yourself and
              ejaculating – it is not something you often get to view!</p>
              <p>1. Take a hot shower or bath, and get really relaxed and
              comfortable. Its really important with female ejaculation that you
              be relaxed and open (you are, after all, letting something
              out!)</p>
              <p>2. Set yourself up in a cozy and comfortable location, with
              several layers of towels or the sex sheet underneath you. You will
              likely want to be reclining or sitting up – lying down on your back
              will probably not allow you to reach your g spot.</p>
              <p>3. Begin to touch yourself, using your fingers or a dildo or
              vibrator - any and all of your favorite techniques to get yourself
              really hot. You can touch your clitoris, as well as your
              g-spot.</p>
              <p>4. When you are pretty aroused, take a moment to find and play
              with your g spot. Reaching your g-spot with just your fingers might
              be hard – it depends on where yours is exactly.</p>
              <p>To locate yours, take one or two fingers (you might want to use
              lube) and insert them inside yourself, palm up, fingers hooked, and
              feel around about 1½ inches in, on the front wall of your vagina,
              just above the pubic bone.</p>
              <p>You will likely find a pea or walnut sized spot that feels a
              different texture from the rest of the vagina. Play with this spot,
              and notice what feels best to you. Also try using your vibrator or
              dildo (again with lube) – it can offer much more access and control
              when playing with your g-spot.</p>
              <p>5. You can try the “withdrawing” technique of rubbing the g-spot
              directly in a series of 5-6 repetitions, and then withdraw fully
              your fingers or the vibrator suddenly; wait about 2-3 seconds and
              then repeat. This can bring on ejaculation, and you often see this
              technique used in videos.</p>
              <p>6. If it doesn’t, just keep heading toward orgasm, touching
              either your clit or gspot (or both), whatever works best for you.
              Either way, keep noticing the full or watery feeling you are likely
              experiencing.</p>
              <p>If you bring yourself to orgasm, rather than stopping, keep
              touching yourself – see what happens when you go beyond orgasm,
              when you would ordinarily stop.</p>
              <p>7. If you feel like you need to pee, you are on the right track
              – but rather than backing off, push into this feeling. I have found
              that I need to relax to let the ejaculate come out, but you may
              find you need to assist with pushing out.</p>
              <p>8. You are there! You are not peeing, you are experiencing
              female ejaculation! Don’t worry about getting the area wet – that
              is what the towels or the sex sheet are for – just relax, release
              and let go.</p>
              <p>9. Take a moment to appreciate your body and its capacity for
              such immense pleasure, and the amazing experience of female
              ejaculation.</p>
              <p>If you didn't ejaculate this time, don't worry! Think back on
              this female ejaculation exercise - what felt good, what you
              noticed, where you got stuck or blocked, etc. Think of a few things
              you'll do differently next time, and then try it again on another
              day.</p>
              <p>Practice does make perfect after all : ) <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.master-your-g-spot.com/"><br></a></p>
              <h1>Female Ejaculate: It's Not Pee!</h1>
              <p>You might be wondering <strong>what exactly is this
              substance</strong> of female ejaculate? And if it is released
              through the urethra but is not urine – which it is not – then what
              exactly is it?</p>
              <p>It is interesting to know that men also release ejaculate
              through their urethra, the same tube they pee from. In fact, the
              whole process of female ejaculation is <strong>much like male
              ejaculation.</strong></p>
              <p>Confused at all? Here’s a brief description of the process:</p>
              <p>As a woman, when you get turned on, your whole pelvic area
              begins to get hot and aroused, and the glands that surround your
              urethra, (called Skene’s paraurethral glands, if you care) start to
              fill up. This is why sometimes when the g spot gets stimulated,
              <strong>you may feel like you need to pee.</strong> Many of these
              glands cluster to make up the organ known as the beloved g
              spot.</p>
              <p>When you feel your gspot get engorged and protrude more into the
              vagina, it is the organ <strong>filling with female
              ejaculate.</strong> The fluid will either get recycled into the
              bladder and will come out when you next pee, or it will be released
              through your urethra as female ejaculation. At times <strong>this
              can mean a few teaspoons, and at others a cup or more!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You still might be wondering - is it urine?</strong> The
              answer is, no, it isn’t! It is a fluid that can be either “milky”
              or clear, that usually has little or no odor or taste, although
              this can change depending on your diet or where you are in your
              menstrual cycle.</p>
              <p>The fluid of female ejaculate is a mixture of glucose, fructose,
              some hormones and acids known as PSA and PAP, with here and there
              traces of urine. <strong>OK – enough of the
              scientific</strong>.</p>
              <p>Although you now know a bit more about female ejaculate, many
              cultures have not only known about it since ancient times but have
              both <strong>celebrated and revered</strong> it.</p>
              <p>In fact, it was known as “Liquor Vitae” in Ancient Rome, “The
              Third Water” in Taoist traditions, “Waters of Gaia” or “Waters of
              Life” in many different indigenous cultures, and is referred to by
              Tantric or Indian traditions as “Amrita.” In ancient Japan, it was
              common for women to own “Ejaculation Bowls” for capturing the flow
              for later use.</p>
              <p>And how was it used? Female ejaculate is considered by many to
              be <strong>an aphrodisiac</strong>. Many ancient cultures
              considered it to be a health tonic that had the ability to reverse
              the aging process, and so they drank it and made tea out of it.
              Many traditions believe that both male ejaculate and female
              ejaculate are needed for conception.</p>
              <p>OK, so even though most of us won’t <strong>be making tea out of
              female ejaculate,</strong> I can recommend a few essential items
              for your own exploration. Fingers and tongues are excellent, but
              consider adding the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.babeland.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;amp;amp;kbid=276&amp;amp;amp;Product_Code=LN364450"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>crystal wand</strong></span></span></a> to your bag of tricks. It was the first toy that really helped my
              find my g spot and ejaculate much more easily.</p>
              <p>And, because you likely don't want to have an ejaculation bowl
              like in ancient times, I recommend this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liberator.com/aff.php?ID=npatmor&amp;amp;amp;L=32"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sex sheet</strong></span></span></a> underneath you. Conversely, you can put down a couple of towels,
              but we've found that sometimes these soak through and leave a set
              spot.</p>
              <p>Also, now that we've been experimenting with this for awhile,
              I'll be ready to ejaculate without even planning with it. This then
              used to leave us scrambling for towels, or just messing up the bed
              and mattress which bothered me.</p>
              <p>Now, with this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liberator.com/aff.php?ID=npatmor&amp;amp;amp;L=32"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sex sheet</strong></span></span></a> we
              just throw it down when we start having sex and then I can
              ejaculate or not. It's got a waterproof inner lining, and a smooth
              satin side, and a furry side.</p>
              <p>Lately, I've taken to calling it my magic carpet! Generally, I
              just love we can throw this down on our sofa, on the floor, or on
              our bed, and it soaks up whatever comes out. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.master-your-g-spot.com/female_ejaculation.html"><br></a></p>
