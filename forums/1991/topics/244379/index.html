            <div class='col-md body'>Let me say for the record, and everyone should know, that each woman is different.  How women rate orgasms depends a great deal on the women.<br><br>The first three are as follows:<br>1. Clitoral orgasm: the most popular, well known orgasm.  Any kind of intense stimulation to this area after it is ready usually can result in an orgasm.  Once again each woman is different.  The rating of this orgasm is usually fairly pleasureful.<br><br>2. The G-Spot orgasm: the term G-Spot may be well known, but this orgasm isn't as common as the above.  It is reported in Cosmo, that not all women have a G-Spot, but if they do it is usually in the vagina on the top wall.  Once again each woman is different, there have been reports of women having a G-Spot on their lower back. Most women say this orgasm is a little more intense than a clitoral orgasm, like I said each woman will say one thing or another.  It might be the guy, not the woman though - keep that thought in mind.<br><br>3. Dual Orgasm: this is when you hit the G-Spot and Clitoral area at the same time, creating a dual orgasm, though it many just refer to it as one orgasm.  Women call this "mind blowing."  There is also the claim that if you can get your girlfriend to have this all the time, she'll never cheat on you.  Then again, all women are different.  And less than 10% of women will experience this "mind blowing" orgasm in their lifetimes.  This is also the orgasm that some women can ejaculate on.  Once again, not all women ejaculate.  Some do though!<br><br>The following orgasm is not achieved by practicing safe sex.  You should take heed to <strong>not</strong> practice this if you are just fooling around, or don't want to get pregnant or put yourself at risk.   A condom cannot be used to achieve this.  DO NOT TRY THIS FOR FUN!  This should only be for people who are in a serious relationship and/or married.<br><br>4. After my ex-gf and I had been in a relationship for about a year, we stopped using condoms because it felt more closer and of course we loved each other.  Not to worry, my sperm count was low, as I take a pill to keep it there, and she was on BC.  One night I was giving her the usual number 3 orgasm and she was about to cum as I was about to.  A little beyond her G-Spot, as I could easily feel with my penis (like I said once you get to know a woman, it makes this so much simpler), I began to cum.  Suddenly, she came too, but not like I had ever noticed.  She began to shake, and her eyes rolled back.  After about 15 seconds of her not inhaling, I thought she was dying or something because she had not said a word.  Then she passed out.  She woke up 10 seconds later, moaning and having a hard time inhaling.  An hour later she told me that the usual intensity of the number 3 orgasm quadrupled, causing a line orgasm.  I call it a line orgasm.  This is when it just continues in the high state, no fluctuating like most orgasms do.  She passed out of course because of the lack of oxygen, but as we practiced more she can now go for about 45 seconds at this high state and then pass out (passing out is how your body stops you from dying).  I talked to my friends kev and Courtney to ask if they knew about it.  I lucked out, Courtney knew (kev didn't at the time).  Courtney told me it was the X-Spot (she calls it that), a little beyond the G-Spot where if the man cums, since his sperm is warm it sets off some trigger.  Few people are aware of this, although there are some.  I searched the internet and didn't find very much on it.  Everyone seemed to have a different name or experience.  But everyone agreed: this orgasm is too intense for the human body.  Unfortunately if not all women have a G-Spot down there, not all women can experience it.  But believe me it is intense.  If you have any questions I'll try to answer them, but like I say we're not sure exactly what this is - I was just playing around!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>5. The last orgasm is the size orgasm.  As I am sure you've heard it before "size matters."  When you get a woman primed and ready to go, and she is about to cum, you can literally blow her mind by just banging her like crazy.  The problem here is almost no woman experiences it because guys with big dicks (10+) tend to not be so good in bed.  Obviously they're too cocky, and they don't think they need to do that much.  But if you set a girl up for a 3 orgasm, and she's about to cum, bang her like crazy and watch what happens.  Few men actually are that well-endowed, and the ones that are usually suck in bed.  This by far is one of the more rare orgasms.<br><br>6. Women having orgasms from foot massages?  Happens all the time.  Quite a different feeling is what they claim.  Who knows ... stay tuned.<br><br>Have fun trying methods 1-3, remember I do not condone number 4 if you are not in a serious relationship even though I am sure some idiot will try and end up hurting themself.  One thing I will note, it is so much better to be married.  I've done all these things and the truth is, none of them are really that great unless it is with a person you are going to love forever.  Always keep that thought in mind - and hey, if you're a guy and you are going to stay pure before marriage, you are now a step ahead of most guys!<br><br><strong>Copied from some forum.</strong></div>
