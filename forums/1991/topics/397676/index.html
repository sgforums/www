              <p>Are men truly professionals at the cheating game or are women the 
              (af)fairer sex? Hidayah Salamat looks beyond the 
              statistics.</p>
              <p>Let’s play a game of Taboo, shall we? Jack Neo, Tiger Woods, Jude Law, Jesse 
              James, John Terry—have you guessed it already? If you guessed “cheating,” 
              “scandals,” “affairs” or anything else related to the dastardly topic of 
              infidelity, you’re right. Unless you’re currently serving time (hell, even word 
              gets around in there) or participating in the gazillionth season of 
              <em>Survivor</em>, you should be the slightest bit aware of, if not very 
              familiar with some of the biggest names in the celebrity cheat sheet. In fact, 
              we are willing to bet that the mere mention of our dear local director will 
              probably set off some alarms in your head. Neo and his more famous Hollywood 
              male counterparts have made headlines at home and all over the world with their 
              tales of deceit and scandal while news of natural disasters and the 
              unpredictable economy have taken a back seat. Somebody please blow the whistle 
              on the whole dramatic press conference shebang; it’s getting old. Did you notice 
              that all the celeb cheats we mentioned (plus some more you can Google real 
              quick) are males? Can we assume then that men are more likely to cheat on their 
              partners than women? If so, does that make them better cheats? We thought of 
              something even more fun than assuming; we went to find out.</p>
              <h3><strong>What’s Going On?</strong></h3>
              <p>The Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) has reported that 
              out of the 400 infidelity-rated cases they have received through their helpline 
              over the past year, 97 percent cite men as the culprits. Sounds like the men are 
              kicking arse right? Well, don’t be so quick to judge. “More men than women 
              cheat, for sure,” reveals Associate Professor Norman Li of the Singapore 
              Management University’s School of Social Sciences. “The statistics have 
              confirmed that. It’s generally two to five times more likely for men to cheat on 
              their spouses than women but that’s not to say that women aren’t cheating.” 
              <br>Damien*, 29, can testify to this. “I was dating this girl for about six 
              months when I decided to meet up with an old friend from school. Naturally the 
              conversation led to the girls we were dating. Turned out there was only one girl 
              and we were both dating her.”</p>
              <h3><strong>Men are from Mars...</strong></h3>
              <p>“Since the beginning of time, men have proliferated by finding different 
              mates. In this way, the genes that cause men to be more sexually promiscuous get 
              spread throughout and all of a sudden, thousands of generations of men have a 
              higher desire for sex,” says Professor Li. <br>Many men find it impossible to 
              fulfil their desires with just one woman and look elsewhere for sexual variety. 
              They aren’t necessarily attached to a new partner and can have sex with someone 
              new without knowing anything about them, including their name. The reason why 
              men cheat isn’t rocket science. Many women spend all their lives deciphering 
              “mixed messages” when it comes to figuring men out but the message is simple—men 
              are superficial. “A study showed that when men were exposed to pictures of 
              attractive women for five minutes, they later began to feel dissatisfied with 
              their partners,” Professor Li explains. <br>Men have less of a moral problem 
              with “shopping around” for a new partner as compared to women. To them, this is 
              just an issue of sexual dalliance. In most cases, men who cheat don’t do so with 
              the intention of replacing their wives.<br>It is evident that the first humans 
              OK-ed the idea of multiple sex partners. But according to Professor Li, “Men who 
              allowed sexual transgressions naturally never gave birth to their own kids and 
              died out. Today’s men react more violently and get more upset than women do when 
              they are cheated on. In fact, up till about 30 years ago in the US, it was legal 
              for a husband to murder his spouse if she had committed adultery.” In fact, an 
              article in UK newspaper <em>The Times</em> discovered that several American 
              states used to have statutes that allowed men to kill adulterous wives without 
              fear of prosecution. These were only abolished in the 1970s. But even now, there 
              are remnants of this loophole in the law. <br>“You only need to look at the 
              papers to see that men who are discovered to have committed crimes of passion 
              with regards to an adulterous spouse tend to be given more leniency in court. In 
              fact, it almost seems like an excuse they use for murder,” observes Juliyanti 
              Jalil, a former executive for the Centre for Caregivers of the Asian Women’s 
              Welfare Organization (AWWA). “Men deem sexual infidelity more hurtful than 
              emotional betrayal. Watching their spouse fall for someone else is without a 
              doubt, a hundred times less painful than watching their spouse have sex with 
              another man. It is unforgivable,” she elaborates.</p>
              <h3><strong>...and Women are from Venus</strong></h3>
              <p>While men are sexual deviants, women rarely look for new partners to satisfy 
              their sexual urges. Says Professor Li, “Women have developed a different 
              mentality over time because when they were randomly having sex, they found 
              themselves pregnant and having to support their child without help from the men 
              because they just took off. The women today are descendants of the women who 
              generally became more careful about whom they select as mates. They tend to look 
              for mates who can invest in them.” So, women are born opportunists; they’re only 
              interested in affairs to remember and that have much to offer.<br>Professor Li 
              cites a study similar to the one conducted on men, in which women become 
              dissatisfied with their partners after reading stories about successful men. 
              “They’re thinking how there are all these other people out there and they start 
              to wonder why they’re with this one person.” <br>“Many of the women we’ve spoken 
              to cite loss of income as a reason for deviating from their husbands. They feel 
              like they’re not being supported financially. We also have women sharing about 
              their men being emotionally unstable so they look for another guy who can 
              support them emotionally,” reports Corinna Lim, Executive Director of AWARE. 
              It’s very rare for a woman to say she did it because she felt horny and wanted 
              more options in terms of sex; that’s more a male thing to say. <br>Unlike men, 
              women who find someone better equipped to provide for them may leave her partner 
              altogether. Johnson*, 32, had been married to his ex for close to two years 
              before she started seeing someone else. “We were trying to have children and by 
              the second year of trying, we had both become so exhausted we stopped having sex 
              altogether,” Johnson explains. “On some nights we didn’t even talk much; we just 
              went to bed. Even if we did talk, we’d end up quarrelling. It became such a 
              chore to spend time with each other. One day, on my way home from work, I saw a 
              man drop her off at the car park. I asked her about it but she kept quiet. She 
              didn’t even bother explaining. We ended up fighting about stupid things I can’t 
              even remember now. After a while, things got out of hand. Friends were coming up 
              to me asking me what was going on after they’d seen her with the same man a few 
              times in public. Of course I was angry. I kept demanding that she explain 
              herself. I even confronted the guy after finding out who he was. He said he’d 
              stop seeing her, but eventually, she left me. She said she had grown tired of me 
              being so detached from our marriage and ignoring her all the time. She wouldn’t 
              even listen to reasoning, not even from her parents. They have since gotten 
              married and now have a kid.”</p>
              <h3><strong>The Lying Game</strong></h3>
              <p>Let’s face it; women are better liars than men. Studies leading to this 
              discovery have even led to the publishing of the book <em>Little White Lies, 
              Deep Dark Secrets: The Truth About Women and Deception</em> by Susan Shapiro 
              Barash, where the author cites an online survey of 500 women in her assertion 
              that women lie about everything—love, sex, money and even plastic surgery. In 
              the book, Barash also reveals that women lie better than men, or are just 
              cleverer about it. Her assertions created an uproar and have been fodder for 
              talk shows. <br>As men are more prone to acting drastically upon a cheating 
              spouse, women have to take extra care in covering up their tracks. This is not 
              the case with men as women are more forgiving towards cases of sexual 
              transgression; the mindset is that as long as he invests, it’s all good. 
              <br>When women cheat, chances are their partners are the last to know. And when 
              they do find out, it doesn’t usually come right from the horse’s mouth. Max*, 
              25, reveals, “She was pretty much what I fell for throughout. If it wasn’t for 
              the dude cluing me in, I probably wouldn’t have known—ever. It was only 
              afterwards that I started noticing little weird things here and there that I 
              thought nothing of before. She was (and probably is) pretty damn good at hiding 
              shit. In fact, she still remains sketchy about the whole affair.” Still not 
              convinced? The late Farrah Fawcett of <em>Charlie’s Angels</em> fame reportedly 
              cheated on long-term partner Ryan O’Neal for over 10 years. And we only heard 
              about this after her passing. Ryan denies this adamantly but then again, who 
              wouldn’t? <br>Women are also aware of the material consequences of infidelity in 
              marriages. “Usually, when women come to us, we determine first what they want to 
              achieve, be it grounds for divorce, the husband’s assets or custody of the 
              children,” explains Jaycee Choy, Project Manager of private investigation 
              company JP Knights Consultancy Pte Ltd. “Most women already know about the 
              affair and just want to make sure they don’t end up with nothing.” So you better 
              believe that if she’s the one doing the cheating, she’d have exercised a bit of 
              damage control first to make sure she doesn’t end up high and dry.</p>
              <h3><strong>The Cheat Sheet</strong></h3>
              <p>So it all boils down to one thing: While statistics confirm men still cheat 
              more often than women, the (af)fairer sex is much smarter about it. Not only are 
              they lying about every little thing, including stuff they don’t need to lie 
              about, they are also capable of maintaining the lie for as long as they need to. 
              <br>While having a natural affinity for distorting or hiding facts is one of the 
              reasons why women are better at cheating, it isn’t the only one. “A woman’s 
              intuition is a very strong and admired quality,” explains Ilinadiah Ismail, a 
              family counselor for a voluntary welfare organization and a psychology major 
              from SMU. “We can sense when something is about to happen and are able to 
              pre-empt an outcome to a situation, which makes it easier for us to exercise 
              damage control. We tend to see what needs to be hidden and hide it before it is 
              found, and try not to put ourselves in situations where our credibility may be 
              compromised. Women are also known to be excellent multi-taskers. We perform many 
              roles in society and can easily hide behind each role we play in order to throw 
              off any suspicions.” <br>Also, women are perceived to be very emotional so even 
              if a cheating wife does express some emotion due to her guilt, her behavior is 
              not seen as being out of the ordinary and does not arouse suspicion. “It makes 
              women sound so manipulative and yet, to us, it’s only natural,” Ismail explains 
              further. <br>This makes us wonder. Could it be possible that women are cheating 
              more than men but they’re so good at manipulating facts that it never shows in 
              the statistics? Who knows? Maybe nobody ever will. After all, the one charm 
              about marriage or a relationship is that it makes a life of deception absolutely 
              necessary for both parties, or so says Oscar Wilde.</p>

              <h3><strong>When is it cheating? </strong></h3>
              <p>When entering into a new relationship, it is important to know where to draw 
              the line between cheating and normal social behavior. It may be normal for you, 
              but it could be a dealâ€‘breaker for your partner. Go through this list together 
              and mark the ones that you both feel constitute cheating so that you’re on the

              <h3><strong>When to Blow the Whistle</strong></h3>
              <p>Your intuition tells you something’s up but you don’t know when to speak up. 
              Here are some tell-tale signs your partner is probably cheating on you and that 
              you’re not just being paranoid.</p>
              <p><strong>1</strong>. You have significantly less sex or stop having sex 
              altogether.</p>
              <p><strong>2</strong>. She comes home one day looking all dolled up when she’s 
              usually plainly dressed, claiming she’s been doing makeovers at her 
              girlfriend’s. Unless your wife is 15 (which makes you a criminal), that’s 
              probably not the case.</p>
              <p><strong>3</strong>. When your man stops trying to make you laugh, or when 
              your wife stops laughing at your jokes.</p>
              <p><strong>4</strong>. He/she brings the phone everywhere; even to the toilet 
              and claims it’s for playing Tap Tap. Yeah, right.</p>
              <p><strong>5</strong>. You find tickets to movies you’ve never gone to see. In 
              most cases though, spouses become immediately suspicious the moment they see 
              movie tickets lying around. When was the last time you actually went to a movie 
              together anyway?</p>
              <p><strong>6</strong>. There is an increase in credit card bills. Note the 
              restaurants your partner goes to.</p>
              <p><strong>7</strong>. Whenever you think you’ve got sufficient evidence (we 
              recommend hiring a professional investigator) to wring the bastard/bitch dry of 
              all his/her assets.</p>
              <h3><strong>How to Fix It</strong></h3>
              <p>If you’ve both gone through the nitty-gritty and decide that the marriage is 
              worth saving, the marriage counsellors at AWARE are unanimous in saying that 
              your best bet is to stop making excuses and get down to it. “Many couples say 
              they have no time to work on their relationship. But you see, there are no 
              shortcuts. If you want the marriage to work, make the time. Find the time to 
              talk—like when the football match is not on, when the kids are not doing their 
              homework, and when both of you are alone.” <br>What about romance? Screw 
              romance. “You know what women are going to say if we mention date night?” asks 
              one counsellor. “They’re going to say, ‘I don’t want a date night, I just want 
              him to bloody do the dishes! I just want him to look around the house and see 
              what needs to be done.’ Taken for granted is a common problem for both men and 
              women.” <br>So if you want your marriage to work, forget flowers and expensive 
              presents (though no one will say no to these, we’re sure). Try being considerate 
              (gasp!).</p>
