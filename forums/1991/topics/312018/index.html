              <h4>What does sex cure?</h4>
              <p><br>It is confirmed what some studies show that sex can bolster the immune system, relieve pain, ease some types of migraine headaches and have important psychological benefits. The fact is in sex, the body releases its powerful endorphins. This is natural pain relievers, which create a healing, relaxing situation for the whole body. Sex can reduce heart disease as well. Those with intimacy in their lives had better levels of T cells or the while blood cells that affect the immune system. Other studies show sex on a regular basis reduces stress, helps alleviate PMS in some women, and that orgasm is a natural analgesic that relieves any kind of pain. Researchers debate the mechanisms of sexual first aid. One theory is that the endorphins activated by orgasm travel to receptor sites throughout the body and produce effect as morphine.<br></p>
              <h4>Sex can boost the immune system </h4>
              <p><br>Definitely good news is how sex is good for you, at least in moderation. Psychologists showed that the immune systems of people who have sex once or twice a week boosts. Scientists evaluate how robust our immune systems are by measuring levels of immunoglobulin A. this is an antigen found in saliva and mucosal linings. This substance called IgA is the first line of defense against colds and flu. Important role for IgA is that it binds to pathogens at all the points of entry to the body and then calls on the immune system to destroy them. In study made to measure amount of IgA with people who had sex and who abstinence, results showed that participants who had sex less than once a week had a small increase in IgA over those who abstained completely. Those who had one or two sexual encounters each week had a 30 per cent rise. Unfortunately, people who had very frequent sex that means three times a week or more had lower IgA levels even than the abstainers had. The high levels of IgA in volunteers who had moderately frequent sex are easy to understand. Sexually active people may be exposed to many more infectious agents than sexually non-active people may. The immune system would respond to these foreign antigens by producing and releasing more IgA.  In the same time, why there was no IgA rise in the most sexually active group is less clear.</p>
              <h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sex and stress</span><br></h4>
              <p><br>Most of us generally recognize that extremely uptight and stressed-out people could benefit from a nice roll in the hay. However, sex is not always included as a top stress management technique. With all the physical and emotional benefits, it provides. The fact and truth is it should be. Everyone should learn the stress management benefits of a healthy sex life. We should also find tips on how to get our groove back if stress has put a damper on our libido. In addition to effectively taking your mind off your worries for a decent period, sex provides some of these other stress management benefits.<br>Deep breathing as relaxed type of breathing relaxes your body, oxygenates your blood and reduces the stress you feel.<br>Sense of touch is important, because massage can be a great stress reliever.  In fact, we need touch for our emotional health. Studies also show that babies who are not touched enough can fail to thrive, and touch continues to be important into adulthood. <br>Social support tends to manage stress better, live longer, and enjoy increased overall health. The type of emotional intimacy that sex can help supply is good for all of us.<br>Endorphins released from sexual activity are very important to prevent stress. Sex is also able to release some other feel-good hormones.<br>Physical workout you could have during sex, depending on your level of enthusiasm, can burn many calories. That is why you could gain the stress management benefits of exercise as well.<br>Unfortunately, many people find that, when they are under stress, their sex drive suffers and libido is low. In fact, a recent study showed that more than half the partners of people working over 48 hours a week reported that it was damaging their sexual life. Fortunately, the same factors that can decrease the level of stress you feel can rev up your libido at the same time as vicious circle. <br> </p>
              <h4>So could we say sex is a cure?</h4>
              <p><br>Should not we all try to have as much sex as we could, since this activity that can burn calories, strengthen your immune system, improve circulation, relieve pain, tone muscles, counter depression, make you look younger and use equipment you already own and is absolutely free? All this improves with regular sexual activity with a caring partner. It confers many emotional and psychological health benefits, and there is a growing body of evidence to prove it.</p>

              <p>Ya endorphine is true. If you want can take morphine oso. Why is morphine addictive cus its the same as endorphine, just tat endorphine is harmless to the body, yet you still have the urge for more endorphine and more pleasure.</p>
              <p>Like drugs, its the same concept. Just that when you stop having sex you just feel mentally uneasy, when you take morphine, your body craves for it everytime. And nid more to satisfy. Thats why in sex its the same. This time one women, 0.5 hour. Next time same women 2 hrs then can.</p>
