              <p>Yo bros,</p>
              <p>I am a vegetarian in my mid 30 this year and is suffering from ED. I started a relationship 6 months back and had sex about twice per month but non of them work unless I take Viagra.</p>
              <p>I had tried the following but till now still no use.</p>
              <p>1) My family clinic who perscribed Viagra to me and it works.</p>
              <p>2) I then went for a full body health screening and the result is fine.</p>
              <p>3) Next I tried a Urology specialist in Glen Eagle hospital. That doctor suspected I had something called venous leak and send me for UltraSound scanning. The end result was that my penis is alright and there is no venous leak or narrowed blood vessel that causes ED. He even claim that he will give me some medicines to take which will repair my whole body system but turns out to be Cialis OAD (Once A Day) which I did not take since it behaves closely to Viagra. I am trying not to take Viagra or Viagra alike anymore, that is why I went through all the trouble to seek for the right treatment.</p>
              <p>4) At present, I am trying TCM which is the Public Free clinic since early Sep till now. But it also didn't help much. My penis can erect but is still soft and could not sustain for long.</p>
              <p>It is definitely not a physchological problem since I don' t feel stress or unhappy.. Neither nor am I nervous or anxious as I had watched countless love making videos from the web and had already been masturbating frequently (every alternate day since I am in my mid 20s) since the last 20 plus years.</p>
              <p>I am really at my wits end now brothers.. Hope anyone who see this post and had similar issue can help me. I am thinking if I cannot get this sickness fixed by Dec I might as well discontinue the relationship with my girlfriend since I really cannot stand a relationship or marriage life without sex.She is just a few years younger than me and I hope to get married by next year and that' s why I want to settle this unknown issue soon.</p>
              <p>Thanks to those serious helpers only:)</p>

              <p>eh......not sure whether you'll consider this serious lol.... one of my friends had the same prob......with his wife. but according to him , it only affects his wife...... not other women.</p>
              <p>no matter how hard he tried..... simply don't last long enough for sex to start. can only tell his wife he's stressed. but once outside his exact words "I turned into a dragon"</p>
              <p>with his wife he could only imagine her trying to start an arguement whenever she tried to initiate sex.</p>

              <p>Sorry i'm not an expert but i really want to help you out based on what i know.</p>
              <p>Firstly i need to ask you that when you said that you are masturbating for the past 20 years, do you also have ED? And when did the symptoms appear?</p>
              <p>Secondly, unhealthy eating habits and lifestyle like the intake of drugs, alcohol and smoking can hamper your normal blood flow and might affect your normal neurological functions which might cause ED. Lack of excercise might also cause ED.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, having low testosterone levels might affect your sex drive and not only that but testosterone is also needed to keep your penis erect.</p>
              <p>PS: No offence but you might not be satisfied with your as she might not be attractive or emotionally fulfilling. ( This point is very important as this might be the cause of your ED)</p>
              <p>Well, if you really are at wits end but you really want to marry this girlfriend and engage in sexual activity with her. You could try having foreplay before sex which might increase sexual arousal of both parties. Who knows, you might not have ED when you engage in sexual intercourse.</p>
              <p>Sorry man, thats all i can think of. I guessed that what you should really do is find another doctor in another hospital who might be more experienced in dealing with the third case i have mentioned. Or you could find a professional sex consultant who might be able to help you too. </p>
              <p>Thanks for reading bro, all the best for you. </p>

              A vegetarian diet is low in arginine, precursor of nitric oxide. You may want to supplement with arginine and also acetycholine(for in lecithin). Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter, I think.
                      Unfermented soy contain isoflavones which may mimic estrogen. It is also rich in phytic acid, an antioxidant, good if you are involved in aerobic training. Phytic acid interferes with mineral/ vitamin(which, I've forgotten offhand). Take soy product in moderate amounts or go for fermented soy products!
                      A human male's hgh and testesterone peaked around 24-28yrs, declining as one ages. Weight training, especially major muscle groups will stimulate testesterone levels. Cardiovascular training strengthens the heart, prolonging and improves the quality of one's erection! However, over training will cause the hormones to drop!
                      Lastly, watching pornography and masturbation will require a higher level of arousal, therefore abstain from both if you wish to return to normal level  of stimulation to achieve an erection!
