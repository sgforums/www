            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Condoms, LetÂ’s Roll!</strong><br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/rainbowcondoms.jpg"> You can have safer sex by using condoms. Condoms are covers used to protect you from being in contact with fluids from the penis or vagina that could have STDs. They can also protect you from unwanted pregnancy. If you and/or your mate are currently using birth control (pills, patches, shots, or tubes tied) you still need condoms, because none of those things helps protect you from HIV/STDs. Only latex and polyurethane condoms (Lifestyles, Reality, Trojans, etc.) have been shown to consistently prevent transmission of HIV/STDs. "Skins" or condoms made from animal skins have microscopic holes in them that STDs can get through. Remember, condoms are needed for safer sex; not having sex is the only way to avoid STDs or pregnancy.<br><br><strong>No Guarantee</strong><br><br>Condoms cannot guarantee that you will not be exposed or get infected for several important reasons:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Condoms do not cover the entire genital area</span><br>Contact with infected skin alone can lead to the spread of disease especially with viruses and lice. Any genital contact, therefore, puts you at risk. But remember, not wearing a condom leaves you wide open for all infections or pregnancy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Condoms break</span><br>If you do not place the condom on properly or use a defective one it is more likely to break and you or your partner could be exposed to an infection.<br>Many people have foreplay naked. Release of semen (pre-cum), contact with infected skin or vaginal discharge before sex can lead to pregnancy or disease.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Many people have oral and anal sex without condoms</span><br>You can also get STDs in your anus, mouth, throat and tonsils. Since the tissue in the rectum is very delicate it is more likely to break and the germs can spread into the body through the tears. You may also have tears in your mouth (from brushing/flossing your teeth) where germs can enter. Avoid brushing/flossing at least one hour before sexual contact.<br>Some people get caught up and think one time without it wonÂ’t hurt WRONG!!! You can get HIV, any other STD or pregnant your first time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He Can "Pull Out" and Climax Outside of Me</span><br>WRONG, AGAIN!! The same fluids that can infect you on the inside can infect you on the outside. Many people get warts, Herpes or Syphilis Â‘cause someone "came" on their genital area, back or stomach.<br><br><strong>Male Condoms</strong><br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/multi.jpg"> Male condoms cover the penis and if used properly are 80-90% effective in preventing HIV/STDs or unwanted pregnancy. They are less effective in protecting you from STDs that can live on the skin (Herpes, Syphilis, HPV [Human Papilloma Virus], Crabs). To be effective they must be used from the beginning (even with foreplay &amp; even if "just the tip" is gonnaÂ’ be inserted")! They can be purchased at many retail stores (grocery, drug and convenience stores) and on the Internet. Many clinics and health departments will give them to you free of charge<br><br><strong>Female Condoms</strong><br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/female.jpg"> Female condoms are long polyurethane tubes (with a ring at each end) that are inserted into the vagina. When they are inserted, one ring is placed inside the vagina and anchors the condom in position and the other covers some of the outer area surrounding the entrance. Like the male condom it also can only be used one time. They are less likely to break because polyurethane is stronger than latex. They are effective in preventing pregnancy and the spread of HIV/STDs mostly because they cover more of the female genital area (less skin contact) and polyurethane doesnÂ’t allow virus transmission. Female condoms are more expensive. They also need to be used from the beginning.<br><br><strong>Other Condoms/Barriers</strong><br><br><img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/latex.jpg"> <img src="http://i139.photobucket.com/albums/q311/roykhong/Finger.jpg"> Dental Dams or plastic wrap should be used for oral sex. Non-lubricated condoms can also be used for protection from oral contact with the penis and a cut open one can be used to cover the vulva (lips of the vagina). Dental dams can be purchased at your dental office and at some retail stores.<br><br>Finger cots, male condoms or latex exam gloves should be used for finger sex (inserting a finger in the vagina or anus). These are necessary because cuts on your finger can allow germs to spread into your body. You can purchase either of these at pharmacies and retail stores.<br><br>Male condoms should be in place when massaging/stroking the penis (especially with a partner who knows they have an infection) because there could be sores or unknown viruses on the penis and germs can enter through cuts on your hands. Latex gloves should be used when touching the female genital area for the same reasons. Latex gloves can be purchased at retail stores.<br><br>A condom or plastic wrap should be placed on sex toys and they should always be cleaned after each use. Diseases can also be spread this way<br><br><strong>Tips For Effective Condom Use</strong><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Store Your Condoms in a Cool, Dry Place</span><br>Do not put condoms in your wallet or shirt or pants pocket or leave them in the car (Heat, even from the body, causes them to break)<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Remember Condoms Expire</span><br>Condoms used after 2-5 years will become dried out and brittle and this can cause them to break. Also, if your condom is sticky or has an uneven color, the package is damaged or they have been in the washing machine by accident, of course, throw it away and get another one.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Condoms can only be used once</span><br>Even if you didnÂ’t climax (cum) in it you need to use a new condom every time you have sex.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Male condoms have to be placed on the penis with room at the tip</span>The semen (cum) has to go somewhere. If there is no room at the end the force of the pressure from the semen will break it open.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Do Not Use Oil Based Lubricants</span><br>Vaseline and oil based gels (petroleum jelly, vegetable shortening, lotions, massage oils, grease) weaken condoms and causes them to break more easily. Water based lubricants (KY jelly, Astroglide, etc.) do not weaken the condom.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">DonÂ’t Assume Your Partner Knows How To Use It</span><br>You need to know how to use the condom, whether you are the one using it (putting the condom on the penis or placing it in the vagina) or your partner is. Some people are too ashamed to say they donÂ’t know how or are tryinÂ’ to front. This is one of the most common reasons that condoms fail. This is not the time for you to be placing your trust in someone else to protect you. LADIES, THIS IS ESPECIALLY STATED FOR YOU!! Also, you need to see for yourself that it has been done right. DonÂ’t be shyÂ…leave the lights on!<br><br><span style="color: brown;">If the Condom Breaks</span><br>Immediately stop having sex, remove the condom and wash the area of the body (both partners) that was exposed and your hands. Use a new condom and make sure it doesnÂ’t appear damaged. Ladies, douching often spreads disease and isnÂ’t recommended. Emptying your bladder (urinating) is also a good idea because the urethra (opening to the bladder) is in the same area and germs can spread there also. Understand that germs canÂ’t be "washed away" if they already entered through openings on your genitals, etc.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Spermicide Use</span><br>Spermicides or Nonoxynol 9 is a contraceptive agent that destroys sperm. They have not been shown to decrease getting an STD when using condoms. It is also recommended that people having anal sex not use Nonoxynol 9 as a lubricant when having anal sex because of the increased risk of infection.<br></div>

If not, when you "push forward", you may well break the condom.
