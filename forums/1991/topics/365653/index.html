              <p>i've had phimosis since young but i've already managed to pull back the foreskin fully whether or not its erected. However when it is dry, the surface of the glans is v.sticky and would stick to the foreskin, though i still can fully retract it. I've tried washing the head with my hands when i shower for a couple of months are maybe more than a year but it still doesnt help. When it is wet, like when i shower, the glans are no longer sticky but rather sensitive, especially at the top of the head. Is this normal?</p>
              <p>Other than the following problems above, my penis is also tilted slightly to the left which seems to be a result of masturbation with the bolster. Though websites have said masturbation does not cause this, does anyone know whether or not this is true? The angle is less than 45degrees so i would have no troubles having sex in the future right? &amp; also my penis also curls slightly forward, which is natural?</p>
              <p>Hope u can share ur experiences with me, so that i can lift this weight off my chest. I'm 17 this year btw &amp; thx</p>

              <p>Uncircumcised penis are generally more sensitive. Very sticky is what i don't really understand.</p>
              <p>Its normal for the penis to be bent slightly left or right. Not everyone's penis is straight so don't worry..</p>

              <p>Nothing to do wiht masturbation don't worry.</p>
              <p>Phimosis is a condition of the foreskin being too tight till the foreskin cannot be retracted right? I don't think it has anything to do with any stickiness etc but as long as you can retract your foreskin, you should be fine :)</p>

              <p>hmm...thx for helping out so much</p>
              <p>i not sure if other people who are suffering phimosis face this but after i was able to retract fully, there were quite a few yellow patches adhering to my penis glan. They stink and i slowly removed them after i was able to fully retract my foreskin. Now it has been fully cleaned, however the glan still remains sticky when its dry like a post-it note. It would hurt if i touch it with my finger and remove it. Also, when its dry, while i am retracting the foreskin, it still adheres slightly to the glan because of the stickiness.</p>
              <p>As for the sensitiivity, as i touch the head of the penis when its not sticky during shower as its wet, its v.sensitive when touching it. I've read on the internet that by washing it with my hands for weeks, the head of the penis would get used to the touching and become less sensitive. However, i've done so  for a couple of months already, yet it doesnt seem to help. I'm not sure whether this sensitivity is normal for all guys.</p>

              <p>The yellow thing you see is normal which is why most guys will pull back the foreskin to wash every so often.</p>
              <p>The sensitivity is normal and thats what makes a uncircumcised penis more sensitive than a circumcised penis. Everyone who is uncircumcised will have that sensitivity so its normal.</p>
