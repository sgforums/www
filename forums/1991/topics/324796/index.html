I want to ask for some advice in choosing adult movies or DVDs for me and my husband to help us bring an element of excitement and novelty in our relationship...<br><br>We've been married for eighteen years now, and are still wildly in love with each other. We love to roll in bed and do all kinds of crazy things. We are so close to each other spiritually and fit each other so well that we really have no shames, doubts, or secrets in between us. We are not afraid to experiment in bed, and love to spruce up our intimacy with something original. So here is my question. Recently we decided to try watching erotic and porn movies together, and the idea itself kind of tickled our senses in a very new and pleasant way... the problem is that all my husband could get in local stores was cheap stuff. I can't believe how adult DVD stores can make money these days, all the movies are exactly alike - no theme, only dull, repetitive action! And while hot action is good, I don't think a good adult movie should make it so dull as to deprive every new movie of all novelty. So I was wondering if somebody could recommend really beautiful, elegant and chic adult movies or DVDs. We watched Pirates, and that is not chic in view of our standards... We are looking for something really unique. A few people on other forums suggested quality Russian erotica, but I don't even know where to find those kind of things.<br><br>I appreciate all feedback, thanks to everybody!</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Definitely look at Andrew Blake's films, some are really good, but that is entirely on the softcore side. If you would like to have a mixture of hot action and beauty, then I would suggest you try some European, particularly Russian adult movies. There are many studios in Russia that are only starting to open up their erotic art, and yes, art it is. My husband bought a few on his first trip to Moscow a few years back and since then we've seen others, together. You can find most of what is available at xxx (pm me if u wan to know), may be somewhere else, but at least we've been ordering from them in the past and they could always be relied on. If you do check them out, definitely have a look at the Naughty Novels, Sex in the Outdoors and the Amateur categories. What is good about Russian erotica is that it fits couples very well, and I think this is exactly what you are looking for. Beautiful, intelligent, unconventional and very sexy.</p></div>

              <p>I totally reckon that you watch this film called "Lie With Me". Its Canadian but I think the language is in Spanish. There's lots of actions going on but its erotic in a sense that its not explicitly and downright "porny". Quite artistic. The entire film is about sex and sex. I find it very beautiful.</p>
