              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">So you’ve been in the same ol’ job for a while, gotten a few promotions and, suddenly, you are handed the pink slip. Or you find that you’re banging your head against a glass ceiling.

              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">For some of us, eating is more than just about survival; it’s a way of life. Put your food obsession to good use by studying to be a chef. At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy just started offering short-term certification courses—Certificate in F&amp;B Service, Food Preparation and Food Production—all of which are ideal for those looking to get their first taste of the culinary arts. These courses are pretty intense—five hours a day, five days a week—but so is the profession. This intensity is one reason chefs like Gero DiMaria, executive chef at Ricciotti Pizza, Pasta &amp; Deli, love their work. “It can be very challenging to run a very busy restaurant efficiently and smoothly—a lot can go wrong if you don’t plan well,” he says. “But at the same time, it’s such a satisfying feeling to be doing crazy 100 pax services and yet still be organized.”</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">If you love wine more than food and you haven’t already thought about a career as a sommelier, you should now. To get certified fast, the Oriton School of Culinary Arts is the place to go. It offers an eight-hour foundational course and a 16-hour intermediate certification in wine. Courses are quarterly and cost $430 (foundational) and $815 (intermediate). Get additional practice by assigning yourself extra wine tasting homework (that’s the best assignment we’ve ever heard). It all comes down to experience in the end. The more wines you try, the more in tune you will become to the unique character of each wine. As David Chan, Sommelier and Vice Principal of Institute of Wine &amp; Spirits, SHATEC, explains, “If you fall in love with wines, you will find a way to find out more. It’s like courting—you go all out to find out more about the gal you like. It’s the same for wines—we need to court them.”</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">If you have a taste for what makes good tipple and love to perform, indulge the showman in you by becoming a mixologist. Zac Mirza, 33, got his start as a bartender at the now defunct The Jump club and was trained by influential flair bartender Adam Browning Hill. He says, “Becoming a good bartender takes years of practice. It helps to improve your social skills since you get to meet people from all walks of life. It’s a great job—I’m paid to go out on Friday nights to have fun!” Bartistry, set up by Mirza, offers courses for developing bartending skills, such as cocktail making and flair bartending, from beginner to professional levels. They also provide training in product knowledge, customer service and maximizing performance. Lessons for beginners cost $1,500 for a 14-day course, while an advanced course for bar owners who want to upgrade their employees’ bartending skills costs $250 for two hours.</span></p>

An introductory course is available for students who would like to concentrate on the basic pet grooming of a particular breed. This includes bathing, brushing, fluff drying, nail clipping and ear cleaning. At the end of the one-day program, students will be awarded a certificate by P.G.A. “The greatest satisfaction comes from seeing the difference in the dogs after grooming them. It’s good when you can help to solve a problem for the owners and make the dogs happy too,” says Zayne Yong, 31, a grooming instructor at Prestige Grooming Academy.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">Help couples make their big day one to remember by becoming a wedding planner. The Institute of Certified Wedding Planners offers a specialist diploma in wedding planning. Currently the only course in wedding planning in Singapore, it spans seven modules and teaches essential wedding planning skills such as project management, wedding etiquette, wedding event planning, wedding music selections as well as relationship education. Taught by Caroline Yakop-Lim, a wedding planner for The Wedding Entourage, the course takes place over 10 months and costs $9,000. Interested applicants can also apply for a bursary, which will be available for a limited time. Yakop-Lim says, “Wedding planning is rewarding and fulfilling, especially when people recognise your efforts. It’s not what a corporate job can give you. I got hooked after my first wedding when the bride’s sister thanked me for making her sister’s dream come true. It is a kind of calling.”</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">If you want to take your new found skill further and make a business out of it, read this step-by-step guide.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">Launching your own business is no mean feat. With the economy ailing, it seems like an even greater challenge to venture into the world of entrepreneurship. However, there has been no better time to latch on to the spirit of enterprise. With funding initiatives and how-to guides by government bodies such as SPRING Singapore and EnterpriseOne to help budding entrepreneurs navigate the start-up maze, there is no need to tear your hair out to launch your dream venture.</span></p>

              <div>
              <h4><span style="color: #33cccc;">Have a business plan</span></h4>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">Having a solid plan to work from is fundamental to any business. A good business plan encompasses factors such as timing, market research, finding an appropriate platform and proper business premises, and working out limitations with regards to funding, budget and manpower.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">Making sure that you have a good brand name is also essential. “The first step, also one of the hardest, was coming up with a brand name that expressed us and which hadn’t been taken yet,” says Serene Wong, 31, jewelry designer and entrepreneur. “It’s also good to make sure that the domain name for your website is available as well because this might influence your choice of brand or company name.”</span></p>

              <h4><span style="color: #33cccc;">Familiarize yourself with tax incentives for start-ups, and find government assistance for your start-up</span></h4>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">In recognition of the increasing number of people plunging into entrepreneurship, the government has set up initiatives to help new businesses grow. You can apply for tax incentives such as the Enterprise Investment Incentive (EII) scheme or the SPRING Startup Enterprise Development Scheme (SPRING SEEDS). You can also check whether your company is eligible for tax exemptions on the EnterpriseOne website. SPRING Singapore has come up with the Incubator Development Programme (IDP), which helps incubators and venture accelerators nurture innovative start-ups by providing them with critical resources and services. These include obtaining financing, management guidance and mentorship, office space with flexible leases and shared business services and equipment.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">The world being the interconnected place it is today, many are venturing online to gain greater outreach for their businesses. Wong adds, “Since we spend so much time online, it’s essential for our brand to have some form of web presence (</span><a title="www.t43please.com" href="http://www.t43please.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #b6498f;">www.t43please.com</span></span></a><span style="color: #b6498f;">). This provides us with quick and convenient ways to introduce our brand, reach out to an international audience as well as update and inform our database of upcoming events and news. Finding the right partners also helps with brand positioning and develops our online presence. There are numerous advantages for starting an online business such as lower start-up and operational costs, and a basic web set-up can be built within a shorter time frame as compared to a brick and mortar shop.”</span></p>

              <div>
              <h4><span style="color: #33cccc;">Open for business</span></h4>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">If you’ve made it this far, congratulate yourself on a job well done! But this is only the beginning. The challenge of managing a business is a whole other ball game. Says Wong, who likens it to being a ringmaster in a circus, “Not having a business background meant that I had to work harder to change my mindset and learn about managing a business and handling technical aspects such as production and manufacturing.” However, there’s no need to lose heart. Here are some pointers that she recommends for aspiring entrepreneurs out there:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">•           Be passionate and believe in what you’re doing—sometimes when things get overwhelming, this is the only thing that will see you through it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">•           Being your own boss is not always as glamorous as it sounds, so be prepared to do whatever it takes to get things done.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">•           Don’t wait around for opportunities to find you. Be pro-active—even if it means cold-calling or being thick-skinned enough to ask for what you want.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">•           Build up and maintain a network of contacts and resources, e.g. join an association or attend networking events.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">•           Pay it forward—always be willing to help others out and repay those who’ve helped you even if it isn’t in monetary form.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">•           Don’t give up when the going gets tough! However, be objective and realistic about whether something is working <br>or not.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">•           Consider how far you’re willing to go and have an exit plan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #b6498f;">She adds, “Basically, all that I’ve learnt to date has been through hands-on experience, making mistakes and learning the hard way. You need to be humble, ask questions and listen to advice from others who’ve more experience than you. However, you also need to know when to play safe and when to push forward and find solutions to your problems independently.”</span></p>
