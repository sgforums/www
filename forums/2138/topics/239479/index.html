            <div class='col-md body'>* No matter how hard you try, you can't baptize cats.<br>* When your Mom is mad at your dad, don't let her brush your hair.<br>* If your sister hits you, don't hit her back. They always catch the second person.<br>* Never ask your 3-year-old brother to hold a tomato.<br>* You can't trust dogs to watch your food.<br>* Reading what people write on desks can teach you a lot.<br>* Don't sneeze when someone is cutting your hair.<br>* Puppies still have bad breath even after eating a tic tac.<br>* You can't hide a piece of broccoli in a glass of milk.<br>* The best place to be when you are sad is in Grandma's lap.<br><br>Things kids says:<br><br>JACK (age 3) was watching his Mom breast-feeding his new baby<br>sister. After a while he asked: "Mom why have you got two?<br>Is one for hot and one for cold milk?"<br><br>MELANIE (age 5) asked her Granny how old she was. Granny replied she<br>was so old she didn't remember anymore. Melanie said, "If you don't<br>remember you just look in the back of your panties. Mine say five to six."<br><br>STEVEN (age 3) hugged and kissed his Mom goodnight. "I love you so<br>much that when you die I'm going to bury you outside my bedroom window."<br><br>BRITTANY (age 4) had an earache and wanted a painkiller. She tried<br>in vain to take the lid off the bottle. Seeing her frustration, her Mom<br>explained it was a childproof cap and she'd have to open it for her.<br>Eyes wide with wonder, the little girl asked: "How does it know it's me?<br><br>SUSAN (age 4) was drinking juice when she got the hiccups. "Please<br>don't give me this juice again," she said, "It makes my teeth cough."<br><br>MARC (age 4) was engrossed in a young couple that were hugging and<br>kissing in a restaurant. Without taking his eyes off them, he asked his<br>dad: "Why is he whispering in her mouth?"<br><br>CLINTON (age 5) was in his bedroom looking worried. When his Mom<br>asked what was troubling him, he replied, "I don't know what'll happen<br>with this bed when I get married. How will my wife fit in?"<br><br>JAMES (age 4) was listening to a Bible story. His dad read: "The man<br>named Lot was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city but<br>his wife looked back and was turned to salt. Concerned, James asked:<br>"What happened to the flea?"<br><br>TAMMY (age 4) was with her mother when they met an elderly, rather<br>wrinkled woman her Mom knew.Tammy looked at her for a while and then<br>asked, "Why doesn't your skin fit your face?"<br></div>
