            <div class='col-md body'>Number 6<br><br>Ooopppss..you are born to enjoy.. You dont care about others. I mean<br>you are always want to enjoy your life time, you are a person.. You<br>will be very good in either education or workwise or business<br>management! You are talented, kind (but with only people who you think are nice), very<br>beautiful girls and guys, popular and more than lucky with anything in<br>your lives. All the goodness does come with you. Your mind and body is<br>just made perfect for love. You are loveble by any other numbers. But<br>if you are a number 6 man, you will experience kinda looks from most<br>girls and will involve in more than few relationships until you get<br>married. If you are girl, most of you will get marry/engaged early.<br>You are ! a caring<br>person towards your family &amp; friends . If you miss the half-way mark<br>then you are about to suffer physically and mentally. Generally you<br>will lead a very good inner-home happiness with nothing short of. You<br>are a person of compassion, comfort &amp; fairness, domestic<br>responsibility, good<br>judgement, and after all you can heal this world wounds to make peace<br>for every life coz you have the great power of caring talent to<br>make<br>this world of love one step further...<br><br>Your best match 1, 6, 9. Good match 4, 5!!!<br><br>Number 7<br>You have got the attraction to anyone out there, you are realistic,<br>very confident, happy, such a talented individual with your education,<br>music, arts, singing, and most importantly acting too. You have real<br>problems  with bad temper! If you are a girl, you are popular with the<br>subjects listed above. You give up things for your parents. I mean you<br>value your family<br>status a lot, you will be in the top rank when you<br>reach a certain age. If you are a guy you are popular with girls, you<br>are a very talented too. Most of the number 7s face lots of problems<br>with their marriage life. Only a very few are happy. You have<br>everything in your life, but still always number 7s have some sort of<br>unfullfilness, such worries all their lifetime. It's probably the Lord<br>given you al! l sort of over the standard humans talents and you are<br>about to suffer in family life. So you need to get ready looking for a<br>partner rather than waiting. If you don't, then you might end-up<br>single. So<br>take care with this issue, ok? You are wonderful, friendly,<br>artistic, happy person. You are born to<br>contribute lots to this world!!!<br><br>Your best match is 2. Good matches are 1,4 !!!<br><br>Number 8<br>You are a very strong personality, there's no one out there will<br>understand you. You are very good at pointing your finger at some<br>thing and say "this is what". You are more likely to suffer from the<br>early ages. I mean poverty. If your times are not good you might lose<br>either of<br>your<br>parent and end up looking after your entire family. You often suffer<br>all the way in life. The problems will not allow you to study further,<br>but you will<br>learn the life in a very practical way. You are the one who will fight<br>for justice and may die in the war too. You are normally very reserved<br>with handful of friends and most of the time live life lonely and<br>always<br>prepared to help others. Well..once you get married (which is often<br>late) then your bad lucks will go away a bit and yo! u become safe.<br>You will face un-expected problems such as : the error,<br>government,<br>poisonous animals, accidents. You are some one with great discipline,<br>persistence, courage, strength which will take you to success. You are<br>a great part of a family team. You are a fighter!<br><br>Your Best match 1 ,4, 8. Good match 5 !!!<br><br>Number 9<br>Hey..you guys are the uncompatible people in the world. You are so<br>strong, physically and mentally. You are often have big-aims. You will<br>work hard and hard to get there. Normally you suffer in the early age<br>from family<br>problems and generally you will have fighting life. But<br>when you<br>achieve what you have done, it's always a big task you have done! You<br>are so much respected in the community, you are a person who can make<br>a challenge and successfully finish the matter off. You are very<br>naughty in your younger age, often beaten up by your parents and<br>involve in fights and you seemed to have lots of injuries in your life<br>time. But when u grow you become calm and macho type. Love is not an<br>easy matter for you. You are good in engineering or banking jobs coz<br>people a! lways trust you. Your family life is very good, but<br>will<br>have worries over your children. Your such qualities are humanitarian,<br>patient, very wise &amp; compassionate. You are born to achieve targets and serve every one all equally without any prejudice. You are totally<br>a role model to anybody in the world for a great inspiration.<br><br>Your Best match 3, 5, 6, 9. Good match 2</div>
