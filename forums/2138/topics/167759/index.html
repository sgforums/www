            <div class='col-md body'>THE BRICK<br><br>A young and successful executive was traveling down a neighbourhood street,<br>going a bit too fast in his new Jaguar. He was watching for kids darting out<br>from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something.<br>As his car passed, no children appeared. Instead, a brick smashed into the<br>Jag's side door! He slammed on the brakes and backed the Jag back to the<br>spot where the brick had been thrown. The angry driver<br><br>then jumped out of the car, grabbed the nearest kid and pushed him up<br>against a parked car shouting, "What was that all about and who are you?<br>Just what the heck are you doing? That's a new car and that brick you threw<br>is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do it?" The young boy was<br>apologetic. "Please, mister...please, I'm sorry but I didn't know what else<br>to do," He<br>pleaded. "I threw the brick because no one else would stop..." With tears<br>dripping down his face and off his chin, the youth pointed to a spot just<br>around a parked car. "It's my brother, "he said. "He rolled off the curb and<br>fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up." Now sobbing, the boy<br>asked the stunned executive, "Would you please help me get him back into his<br>wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me."<br><br>Moved beyond words, the driver tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in<br>his throat. He hurriedly lifted the handicapped boy back into the<br>wheelchair, then took out a linen handkerchief and dabbed at the fresh<br>scrapes and cuts. A quick look told him everything was going to be okay.<br>"Thank you and may God bless you," the grateful child told the stranger. Too<br>shook up for words, the man simply watched the boy! push his<br>wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home.<br><br>It was a long, slow walk back to the Jaguar. The damage was very noticeable,<br>but the driver never bothered to repair the dented side door. He kept the<br>dent there to remind him of this message: "Don't go through life so fast<br>that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your<br>attention!" God whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes<br>when we don't have time to listen, He has to throw a brick at us. It's our<br>choice to listen or not.<br><br>Thought for the Day:<br>If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it.<br>If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it.<br>He sends you flowers every spring.<br>He sends you a sunrise every morning Face it, friend - He is crazy about<br>you!<br></div>
