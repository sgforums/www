              <p>yea my ps2 is also spoiled, the lens is crazy, sometimes can read, sometimes can't.. at times after trying for half an hour also can't then make me lose all my motivation..tsk... storyline is the same ma, always the politics followed by saving the world with some romance..maybe its the futuristic design..</p>

              <p>i think it was really really fun.. especially the power up concepts they introduced.. like a blizzagra,firagra,thundergra when you accumulated 3 of the same runes.. then i remember bahamut ultimate as being kinday smelly, and then there's squall also as a secret character..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>i only played resident evil among em, and didn't really enjoy it too i think i prefer devil may cry, metal gear solid was too tactical for me at that time..legend of dragoon is a sad case, cause it came out together with ff8..totally no chance to fight at all.. star ocean 3 on the ps2 was very nice, the graphics really improved alot..</p>

              <p>AHHH don't mention star ocean...the other time...i asked my cousin to get it for me...but because he thought that i will be playing often and neglecting my studies (like in the end who did)...he didn't get it for me =( yeah...it was a shame =(( sigh</p>
