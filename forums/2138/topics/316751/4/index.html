              back memories....i think the disc is as good as dead...my cousin
              doesn't really look after the discs =(</p>
              <p>I think i don't mind watching from the side when people are
              playing Resident evil or Fatal frame...but really playing it...i
              think i can't LOl...Hmmm oh no wonder....i didn't know Legends of
              dragoon came out together with FF8....heh...</p>
              <p>AHHH don't mention star ocean...the other time...i asked my
              cousin to get it for me...but because he thought that i will be
              playing often and neglecting my studies (like in the end who
              did)...he didn't get it for me =( yeah...it was a shame =((
              sigh</p>

              <p>i rmb my sis downloaded the game onto her pc, and was playing it with a controller.. cause i rmb seeing her playing it a few months ago.. maybe i shall ask her bout it when she returns..heh, now that you mentioned it, i start to have the urge to wana play again..keke..</p>
              <p>eh, yeah i think so, both came out in 1999 if i rmb correctly, their combat system was a 1 of its kind at that time, too bad they didn't manage to expand on it..</p>
