              <p>Cow people should have a nice Rat year in 2008. Many things end up with their

                  Stars</strong> are coming to Cow people and there is no strong <strong>Lucky Stars</strong> coming to help them. Therefore, the fortune of 2009 is unstable and 
                  unpredictable. Troubles and obstacles will appear soon or later and wait for the 
                  challenge. Cow people need to pay attention on everything during the entire year

              <p>According to Chinese Zodiac, if the zodiac sign of birth year is same to the 
                  zodiac sign of yearly cycle, then that's an unlucky year to the person. Many 
                  troubles will come to bother the person. The person needs to manage events with 
                  caution at work, at home or traveling to avoid argument, lawsuit, accident, 
                  libel, blooding and money loss.</p>
              <p>Career: The <strong>Unlucky Year Star</strong> and <strong>Fighting Stars </strong>move to your career area in year 2009. 
                  People relationship in your business or job circle will be poor. Business 
                  development has the difficulty to expand. You will face strong competition with 
                  coworkers in the company. Unfortunately, you are the underdog in the 
                  competition. You might keep losing your spirit, cannot focus on your task and 
                  then impact your job performance.Â The good news is that a <strong>Knowledge 
                  Star</strong> appears this year. If your job is related to art, writing, publishing, 
                  entertainment, creativity, acting or speech, then you have the chance to show 
                  your talent to people and open the door for your better job opportunity.</p>
              <p>Money: Cow people's money luck is connected with the career luck in 2009. 
                  Since your career performance won't get any good anticipation, therefore to increase a 
                  good income becomes remote possible. Plus, an <strong>Unlucky Broken Star </strong>shows in 
                  the money area. That means it's hard for you to pile up wealth into your 
                  savings. In short, money comes, then money goes this year. Therefore, you shouldn't do any 
                  short term risky investment. Anything related to money, you need to think twice 
                  before you leap. If you don't have any financial plan, then it's hard for you to 
                  balance your expense and income.</p>
              <p>Love: Because the <strong>Knowledge Star</strong> comes into your life, it implies the 
                  wisdom, talent and

If you are married, then you might have more argument with 
                  your spouse or children. If you are in love, then you will have less times to meet 
                  your lover and the love relationship becomes distant. If you are a senior, then 
                  you have to pay attention on the health of your spouse to avoid visiting 
                  hospital. If you are single, it's not a good time to pursuit the impossible 
                  dream.</p>
              <p>Health: The <strong>Unlucky Year Star</strong> comes strongly to you in 2009. Many 
                  things will disturb Cow people. Worry and
                  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><br>anxiety will bring you lots of mental and physical pressure. Therefore, you need <br>fully pay attention on your health. You have to stay alert for any changes of <br>your body. Because you might lose your focus, you need to pay attention on the <br>safety while your are walking and driving on the street to avoid the traffic <br>accident.</span></p>

                  fortune in career, wealth. health, love and family will below expectation in 
                  2009. But you don't have to despair or give up. In your career, you just have to 
                  hold on your job position, keep your profile low, work harder for your daily 
                  job. You need to follow your financial plan and do not waste unnecessary 
                  expense. You need to remember to show the care and love to your family members, 
                  spouse or lover. You also have to watch your own health. In this case, you will 
                  have a peaceful the year of the Cow.</p>

                  more than before, you won't have too much left for saving. This tells you that 
                  every time you shop or purchase something, you have to make sure you really need 
                  the merchandise. The other sign shows someone might deceive your money 
                  investment. That means something might happen and force you to use your savings 
                  to pay for that event. Therefore, you shouldn't be greedy in any investment and 
                  don't do any risky business even with your close friends or relatives in the 
                  year of the Cow. Otherwise, your wealth will decrease a lot.</p>
              <p>Love: No matter that you are single, in love or married, your love 
                  relationship is not bad in 2009, because there is a <strong>Love Star </strong>coming to 
                  you. If you are single, you have good chance to meet your companion, even 
                  develop a closer relationship. If you are in love, then your love relationship 
                  will become stronger and closer. If your partner is ready, then you might get 
                  married this year. If you are married, you will be giving and receiving the love 
                  more from your spouse. However, you need to keep the distance from the opposite 
                  sex outside to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>Health: There is a tiny <strong>Unlucky Health Star</strong> around you in 2009. But it 
                  won't cause any serious disease. Tiger people should have a good health in the 
                  year of the Cow. Only some might have the pressure or obstacle from their job 
                  and feel gloomy or depressed. As long as you know how to relax yourself to 
                  reduce the stress and let alone unnecessary concern, you should have good energy 
                  and spirit entire year.</p>
              <p>Fortune: The luck of Tiger people in the year of Cow is fair. The unlucky 
                  part is in the career and wealth area. So don't expect you will have high job 
                  performance or good financial achievement. In your career, since the <strong>Unlucky 
                  Stars</strong> attack on your weakness of the personality, if your can persist your 
                  determination, keep yourÂ humble attitude to face the challenge, then you will 
                  have a better chance to succeed. In the wealth, you need to plan your financial 
                  strategy in the beginning of the year. Then make sure to follow your plan to 
                  balance your budget. Otherwise, your monthly expense will exceed your income. 
                  Your should have good health during the entire year. You have excellent luck in 
                  love relationship in 2009. However, I shouldn't look for new relationship, if 
                  you already have your lover or spouse. This is because that new relationship 
                  might not last to the next year.</p>

              job promotion or salary raise is possible. However, you still have two 
              <strong>Unlucky Stars</strong> appearing in this year. Someone might try to block your 
              career opportunity, which could extract your concentration and then impact your 
              judgment. Therefore, you need to work on projects with caution to avoid any 
              mistake and stay away the argument with others.</p>
              <p>Money: You have two <strong>Lucky Stars</strong> coming money area this year. One of 
              them is the <strong>Money Star</strong>. Certainly that's is a good sign to increase the 
              wealth. Since you have good luck in the career area. Either you work for someone 
              or you own the business, the career opportunity should bring you more income 
              than in 2008. However, this Money Star is not a <strong>Windfall Star</strong>. The money 
              won't automatically come into your door. You still need to find it, plan it, 
              work on it, then bring it into your pocket. Therefore, if you are lazy and wait 
              for it, then you will lose the money opportunity in the year of the Cow.</p>
              <p>Love: Many <strong>Unlucky Stars</strong> gather in emotion area. You are used to 
              protect your ego. You are afraid of hurting your feelings in love. Your passion 
              for love will cool down. There will be no progress in love relationship. If you 
              are still single, it will be difficult to find someone you like to talk with you 
              this year. If you are married and in love, then your love relationship won't 
              show any closer sign. Instead, you will have some minor disagreements with your 
              lover often, which might impact on each other's daily mood and work. The married 
              people also have to pay attention on their spouse's health in 2009.</p>
              <p>Health: An <strong>Unlucky Star</strong> shows the sign of loneliness and isolation to 
              you in 2009. The lonely emotion could affect people's health. If you encounter 
              difficulty at work and feel frustration in love, then your health will be 
              impacted right away.

If you are a senior Snake people, 
              then you need to pay more attention on your health. If you often feel 
              uncomfortable, then you must visit doctors to take care the pain at once. 
              Otherwise, a small illness might become a serious disease.</span></p>
