              <p class="first">WASHINGTON
              - Wash your hands, folks, especially you ladies. A new study found that
              women have a greater variety of bacteria on their hands than men do.
              And everybody has more types of bacteria than the researchers expected
              to find.</p>
              <div id="adlrec"></div>
              <p>"One
              thing that really is astonishing is the variability between
              individuals, and also between hands on the same individual," said
              University of Colorado biochemistry assistant professor Rob Knight, a
              co-author of the paper.</p>
              <p>"The sheer number of bacteria species
              detected on the hands of the study participants was a big surprise, and
              so was the greater diversity of bacteria we found on the hands of
              women," added lead researcher Noah Fierer, an assistant professor in
              Colorado's department of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
              <p>The
              researchers aren't sure why women harbored a greater variety of
              bacteria than men, but Fierer suggested it may have to so with the
              acidity of the skin. Knight said men generally have more acidic skin
              than women.</p>
              <p>Other possibilities are differences in sweat and oil
              gland production between men and women, the frequency of moisturizer or
              cosmetics applications, skin thickness or hormone production, he said.</p>
              <p>Women also may have more bacteria living under the surface of the skin where they are not accessible to washing, Knight added.</p>
              <p>Asked if guys should worry about holding hands with girls, Knight said: "I guess it depends on which girl."</p>
              <p>He
              stressed that "the vast majority of the bacteria we have on our body
              are either harmless or beneficial ... the pathogens are a small
              minority."</p>
              <p>The researchers took samples from the palms of 51
              college students _ that's 102 hands _ and tested the samples using a
              new, highly detailed system for detecting bacteria DNA.</p>
              <p>They
              identified 4,742 species of bacteria overall, only 5 of which were on
              every hand, they report on Monday's online edition of Proceedings of
              the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
              <p>The average hand harbored 150 species of bacteria.</p>
              <p>Not
              only did individuals have few types of bacteria in common, the left and
              right hands of the same individual shared only about 17 percent of the
              same bacteria types, the researchers found.</p>
              <p>The differences
              between dominant and non-dominant hands were probably due to
              environmental conditions like oil production, salinity, moisture or
              variable environmental surfaces touched by either hand of an
              individual, Fierer said.</p>
              <p>Knight said the researchers hope to repeat the experiment in other countries where different hands are assigned specific tasks.</p>
              <p>While the researchers stressed the importance of regular hand washing, they also noted that washing did not eliminate bacteria.</p>
              <p>"Either
              the bacterial colonies rapidly re-establish after hand washing, or
              washing (as practiced by the students included in this study) does not
              remove the majority of bacteria taxa found on the skin surface," the
              researchers said in their report.</p>
              <p>While the tests could determine
              how many different types of bacteria were present, they could not count
              the total amount of bacteria on each hand.</p>
              <p>The research was funded primarily by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.</p>
