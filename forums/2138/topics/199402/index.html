            <div class='col-md body'>The 99 Club<br><br>Once upon a time, there lived a King who, despite his luxurious lifestyle, was neither happy nor content.<br><br>One day, he came upon a servant who was singing happily while he  worked.<br>This fascinated the King; why was he, the Supreme Ruler of  the Kingdom, unhappy and gloomy, while a lowly servant was so joyous.<br><br>The King asked the servant, "Why are you so happy?"<br><br>The man replied, "Your Majesty, I am nothing but a servant, but my  family and I don't need too much -- just a roof over our heads and warm food to Fill our tummies."<br><br>The king was not satisfied with that reply. Later in the day, he sought the advice of his most trusted advisor. After hearing the  King's woes and the servant's story, the advisor said, "Your Majesty,  I believe that the servant has not been made part of The 99 Club."<br><br>"The 99 Club? And what exactly is that?" the King inquired.<br><br>The advisor replied, "Your Majesty, to truly know what The 99 Club is, let's place 99 Gold coins in a bag and leave it at this servant's doorstep."<br><br>Next day when the servant saw the bag, he picked it up and took it in. When he opened the bag, he let out a great shout of joy... So  many gold coins!<br><br>He began to count them. After several counts, he was at last convinced that there were 99 coins. "What could've happened to that last gold coin?<br><br>Surely, no one would leave 99 coins!" he wondered. He looked everywhere he could, but  that final coin was elusive.<br><br>Finally, exhausted, he decided that he would have to work harder than ever to earn that gold coin and complete his collection. And from that day, the servant's life was changed. He was overworked, horribly grumpy, and castigated his family for not helping him make that 100th coin. He stopped singing while he worked.<br><br>Witnessing this drastic transformation, the King was puzzled. When he sought his advisor's help, the advisor said, "Your Majesty, the servant has now officially joined The 99 Club.."<br><br>He continued, "The 99 Club is a name given to those people who have enough to be happy but are never contented, because they're always yearning and striving for that extra one, telling themselves: "Let me get that one final thing and then I will be happy for life." We can be happy, even with very little in our lives, but the minute  we're given something bigger and better, we want even more! We lose our sleep, our happiness, we hurt the people around us; all  these as a price for our growing greed and desires. That's what joining The 99 Club is all about."<br><br>You have reached the pinnacle of success as soon as you become uninterested in money, compliments, or publicity. ~Thomas Wolf<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Well, pals,<br>but i believe that we all need to haf something to look forward to each day, then u'll be happier and living. if one dun haf the vision of better things to come, u'll lose sight of the future, and u'll always think its better off in the past. Vision is the picture of the future, it gives hopes, it gives u a sense of purpose and destiny -- like a magnet it will draw u in the direction of ur destiny!! the clearer the vision, the more powerful the draw of magnet, i suppose. Faith supports ur vision, isnt it??!<br><br>I'd think this story is trying to get to us that ur vision is ur future but the important thing is, <strong>God is not against u having money, God is against money having u</strong>!!!<br></div>
