            <div class='col-md body'>A man walked into a quiet bar. He carried three ducks, one in each<br>hand and one under his left arm. He placed them one beside the<br>other<br>upon the bar. He had a few drinks and chatted with the ducks, and<br>with the bartender. The bartender was surprised, but experienced<br>enough to have learned not to ask people about animals they bring<br>into the bar, so he didn't mention the ducks.<br><br>They chatted for about another 30 minutes before the man with the<br>ducks had to go to the restroom. He left the ducks there on the<br>bar. The bartender was alone with the ducks. There was an awkward<br>silence as they all looked at one another. The bartender decided to<br>break the ice and try to make a little conversation.<br><br>"Say, what's your name?" he asked the first duck.<br><br>"Huey," replied the first duck.<br><br>"How's your day been, Huey?"<br><br>"Great. Lovely day. Had a ball. Been in and out of puddles all<br>day! What else could a duck want?" said the duck.<br><br>"Oh. That's nice," said the bartender. Then he said to the second<br>duck, "Hi. And what's your name?"<br><br>"Dewey," came the answer from duck number two.<br><br>"So how's your day been, Dewey?", he asked.<br><br>"Great. Lovely day. I've had a ball too! Been in and out of puddles<br>all day myself. If I had the chance on another day I'd do the same<br>again!" said the duck in reply.<br><br>So the bartender turned to the third duck and said, "So, you must be<br>Louie?"<br><br>"No," she said, "my name is Puddles. And don't even ask what kind of<br>day I've had."<br></div>

"I have no water, but I do have a selection of lovely ties for sale.""You must be crazy," the tourist replied. Close to death from thirst, he saw another nomad. "Water!" he gasped. "Give me some water.""I have no water," came the reply, "only these handsome ties that I'd be glad to sell you."The tourist stumbled on until, to his astonishment, he saw a magnificent hotel far in the distance. Crawling at last into the lobby, he croaked, "Please give me water.""I'm sorry, sir," the doorman said.

            <div class='col-md body'>A Yankee lawyer went duck hunting in eastern North Carolina. He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence.<br><br>As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly gentleman asked him what he was doing. The lawyer responded, "I shot a duck and it fell in this field, I'm going into retrieve it."<br><br>The old farmer replied. "This is my property, and you are not coming over here."<br><br>The indignant lawyer said, "I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything!<br><br>The old farmer smiled and said, "Apparently, you don't know how we do things here in North Carolina.

"Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up."<br><br>The Yankee attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old southerner. He agreed to abide by the local custom.<br><br>The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the Yankee lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second kick nearly wiped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on his belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up.<br><br>The Yankee lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get to his feet and said, "Okay, you old redneck southerner, now it's my turn."<br><br>The old North Carolina farmer smiled and said, "Naw, I give up. You can have the duck."<br></div>

The<br>&gt;wife did not want to<br>&gt;get pregnant and requested the husband to buy condom<br>&gt;from the shop nearby.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When the husband went out, the wife waited anxiously<br>&gt;in the room with all<br>&gt;the lights switched off... While the husband was out,<br>&gt;an Indian thief came<br>&gt; into the room.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The wife did not notice and thought that it was her<br>&gt;husband. She grabbed<br>&gt;the Indian and happily screwed away.The wife was so<br>&gt;exhausted that she<br>&gt;fell asleep immediately.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;In the mean time, the husband had a hard time looking<br>&gt;for a shop that sold<br>&gt;condoms and when he finally found one, he realized<br>&gt;that he had only one<br>&gt;20-sen coin.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He asked the shop owner to sell him one piece of<br>&gt;condom and the shop owner<br>&gt;asked him which quality that he wanted.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"The white condom, lowest quality, is 15 sen each.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The black condom, average quality, is 20 sen each.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And purple condom, the highest quality, is 25 sen<br>&gt;each".<br>&gt;<br>&gt;So, the husband chose the black condom as he had only<br>&gt;20 sen with him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When he reached the hotel, he found his wife sleeping.<br>&gt;Without a warning,<br>&gt;he jumped onto his wife and started making love. The<br>&gt;wife was surprised<br>&gt;that the husband was so energetic after the "first"<br>&gt;session.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A year later, the wife gave birth to a "black" baby<br>&gt;boy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;When the baby grows up, he asks the father, "Pa, why<br>&gt;am I black and you<br>&gt;are white?"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The father replied, "You are damn lucky already<br>&gt;boy......5 sen more and<br>&gt;you would be PURPLE now!!!!!!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>President Bush visits a primary school classroom. They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asks President Bush if he would like to lead the discussion of the word 'tragedy.'<br><br>So the president asks the class for an example of a tragedy.<br><br>One little boy stands up and offers: "If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs him over and kills him that would be a 'tragedy'."<br><br>"No," says President Bush, "that would be an accident." A little girl raises her hand. "If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy."<br><br>"I'm afraid not," explains President Bush. "That's what we would call a 'great loss'."<br><br>The room goes silent. No other children volunteered. Bush searches the room.<br><br>"Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?"<br><br>Finally, at the back of the room a small boy raises his hand. In a quiet voice, he says: "If Air Force One carrying you, Mr. President, were struck by a 'friendly fire' missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a' tragedy'."<br><br>"Fantastic!" exclaims President Bush. "That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a 'tragedy'?"<br><br>"Well," says the boy, "because it certainly wouldn't be a 'great loss', and it probably wouldn't be an 'accident' either".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A crusty US Marine Sergeant Major found himself at a gala event, hosted by a local liberal arts college. There were lots of young, idealistic ladies<br>in attendance, one of whom approached the Sergeant Major for conversation.<br><br>"Excuse me, Sergeant Major," she said, eyeing him interestingly "but you seem to be very serious.<br><br>Is something bothering you?"<br><br>"Negative, ma'am," the Sergeant Major replied stern-faced, "Just serious by nature."<br><br>The young lady looked at his awards and decorations and said wriggling her eyebrows cheekily, "It looks like you have seen a lot of action."<br><br>"Yes, ma'am!," replied the Sergeant Major huskily, "a lotta of action."<br><br>"You should lighten up a little," she winked. "Relax and enjoy yourself.<br><br>Now, don't take this the wrong way, but when was the last time you had<br><br>sex?"<br><br>The Sergeant Major looked at her and replied, "1955."<br><br>"Well, there you are!," she exclaimed. "No sex since 1955! That's a long<br><br>time."<br><br>"You think so?" he replies, glancing at his watch. " It's only 2030 now."<br></div>
