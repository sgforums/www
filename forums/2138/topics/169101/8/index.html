            <div class='col-md body'>One Monday morning a mailman is walking the neighborhood on his usual route. As he approaches one of the homes he noticed that both cars were in the driveway. His wonder was cut short by Bob, the homeowner, coming out with a load of empty beer and liquor bottles. "Wow Bob, looks like you guys had one hell of a party last night." the mailman comments.<br><br>Bob in obvious pain replies, "Actually we had it Saturday night. This is the first I have felt like moving since 4:00 am Sunday morning. We had about fifteen couples from around the neighborhood over for Christmas Cheer and it got a bit wild. Hell, we got so drunk around midnight that we started playing WHO AM I."<br><br>The mailman thinks a moment and says, "How do you play that?"<br><br>Well all the guys go in the bedroom and we come out one at a time with a sheet covering us and only our "privates" showing through a hole in the sheet. Then the women try to guess who it is."<br><br>The mailman laughs and says, "Damn, I'm sorry I missed that."<br><br>Probably a good thing you did," Bob responds. "Your name came up four or five times."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was a warm, sunny Sunday, so a man and his wife decided to take in the zoo. They spent the day, and at closing time they walked past the gorilla cage, and the man noticed the gorilla looking at his wife.<br><br>"That gorilla is getting excited just looking at your tits," he said. "Why don't you take your blouse off and we'll see what he does?"<br><br>At first she declined. But finally persuaded by her husband, she took off her blouse and bra. The gorilla went nuts. He started grunting and jumping up and down.<br><br>"Hey," the husband said, "let's really blow his mind. Take off all your clothes and we'll see what he does."<br><br>Again she said no and again he persuaded her. This time the ape really went bananas! He climbed up and down the bars, did flips, ran around in circles and tossed his food all over the cage.<br><br>The husband went over to the cage, opened the door and pushed his wife in.<br><br>"Now," said the husband with an evil smile, "tell HIM you have a headache!"<br><br>So Evil !!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
