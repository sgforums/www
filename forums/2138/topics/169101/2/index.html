            <div class='col-md body'>A cabbie picks up a nun. She gets into the cab, and notices that the very handsome cab driver wonÂ’t stop staring at her. She asks him why he is staring. He replies: Â“I have a question to ask you, but I donÂ’t want to offend youÂ”<br><br>She answers, Â“My son, you cannot offend me. When youÂ’re as old as I am and have been a nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about everything. IÂ’m sure that thereÂ’s nothing you could say or ask that I would find offensive.Â”<br><br>Well, IÂ’ve always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me.Â”<br><br>She responds, Â“Well, letÂ’s see what we can do about that: #1, you have to be single and #2, you must be Catholic.Â”<br><br>The cab driver is very excited and says, Â“Yes, IÂ’m single and Catholic!<br><br>Â“OKÂ” the nun says. Â“Pull into the next alley.Â” The nun fulfils the cab driverÂ’s fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush. But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying.<br><br>Â“My dear child,Â” said the nun, why are you crying?Â”<br><br>Â“Forgive me but I have sinned. I lied and I must confess, IÂ’m married and IÂ’m not a Catholic.Â”<br><br>The nun says, Â“ThatÂ’s OK. My name is Kevin and IÂ’m going to a Halloween party.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day a young man and woman were in their bedroom making love. All of a sudden a bumblebee entered the bedroom window. As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina.<br>The woman started screaming "Oh my God, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!"<br><br>The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation. The doctor thought for a moment and said "Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit."<br>The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said "OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval.<br><br>The young lady said "Yes, Yes, whatever, just get on with it."<br>So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, "I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper."<br>So the doctor went deeper and deeper.<br><br>After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement. She began to moan and groan aloud. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself, he then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises.<br><br>The husband at this point suddenly became very annoyed and shouted, "Now wait a minute! What the Hell do you think you're doing?"<br>The doctor, still concentrating, replied, "Change of plan. I'm gonna drown the bastard!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A husband, one bright sunny morning, turns to his lovely wife, "Wife, we're going fishing this weekend, you, me and the dog."<br><br>The wife grimaces, "But I don't like fishing!"<br>"Look! We're going fishing and that's final."<br>"Do I have to go fishing with you... I really don't want to go!"<br>"Right I'll give you three choices... 1 You come fishing with me and the dog... 2 You give me a BLOW JOB.... 3 or you take it up the ass!"<br><br>The wife grimaces again, "But I don't want to do any of those things!"<br>"Wife I've given you three options.. You'll HAVE to do one of them! I'm going to the garage to sort out my fishing tackle, when I come back I expect you to have made up your mind!" The wife sits and thinks about it.<br><br>Twenty minutes later her husband comes back, "Well! What have you decided? FISHING with me and the dog, BLOW JOB, or ass?"<br><br>The wife complains some more and finally makes up her mind, "O.K. I'll give you a blow job!"<br><br>"Great!" He says and drops his pants. The wife is on her knees doing the business.<br><br>Suddenly she stops, looks up at her Husband, "Oh! It tastes absolutely disgusting... It tastes all shitty!"<br><br>"Yes!" says her husband "The dog didn't want to go fishing either."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man had just been hired as the new managing director of a large high tech London-based corporation. The managing director who was stepping down, met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes. "Open these if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve," he said.<br><br>Things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later, sales took a downturn and the new MD was really catching a lot of heat. About at his wit's end, he remembered the envelopes.<br><br>He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, "Blame your predecessor." The new MD called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous MD. Satisfied with his comments, the press - and The City responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.<br><br>About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the MD quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, "Reorganise." This he did, and the company quickly rebounded.<br><br>After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company again fell on difficult times. The MD went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope. The message said: "Prepare three envelopes."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Labor Pills<br><br>Once a woman was in labor; she was having a really tough time dealing with the pain. The doctor came to her husband and her and told them of a new experimental drug that allows the woman to transfer 25% of the pain to the father. The husband feels really bad for his wife so he decides they will try it.<br><br>The wife takes the pill and a few minutes later the husband says, "I don't feel a thing. You women are babies. Take another pill I can handle this." So the wife takes another pill. Same thing happens. Her husband tells her to take another pill. Same thing. By now she has transferred 75% of her pain to her husband. She is feeling a little pain but her husband is still feeling nothing. He is convinced that women are complete wuses. He tells her, "Take another pill. This isn't hurting me at all. Let me take all the pain away." So she does. Now they are both feeling great.<br><br>A few hours later, the wife gives birth to a beautiful baby boy.

The sister purchased a pair of panties for herself. During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties.

If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears short ones that are easier to remove.These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart. I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again.<br><br>When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year. I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night.
