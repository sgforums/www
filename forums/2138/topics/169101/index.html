            <div class='col-md body'>A man was walking along a California beach and stumbled across an old lamp. He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a genie.<br><br>The genie said "OK, OK. You released me from the lamp... blah, blah, blah... This is the fourth time this month and I'm getting a little sick of these wishes so you can forget about three. You only get one wish!"<br><br>The man sat and thought about it for a while and said, "I've always wanted to go to Hawaii but I'm scared to fly and I get very seasick. Could you build me a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over there to visit?"<br><br>The genie laughed and said, "That's impossible! Think of the logistics of that. How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific?<br><br>Think of how much concrete... how much steel!! No. Think of another wish."<br><br>The man said OK and tried to think of a really good wish. Finally, he said, "I've been married and divorced four times. My wives always said that I don't care and that I'm insensitive. So, I wish that I could understand women...know how they feel inside and what they're thinking when they give me the silent treatment... to know why they're crying, to know what they really want when they say 'nothing' ... to know how to make them truly happy."<br><br>The genie said, "You want that bridge two lanes or four?"<br></div>

Finally, the lawyer offered her 10 to 1 odds, and said every time the blonde could not answer one of his questions, she owed him $5.00, but every time he could not answer hers, he'd give her $50.00. The lawyer figured he could not lose, and the blonde reluctantly accepted.<br><br>The lawyer first asked, "What is the distance between the Earth and the nearest star?"<br><br>Without saying a word the blonde handed him $5.00. then the blonde asked, "What goes up a hill with 3 legs and comes back down the hill with 4 legs?"<br><br>Well, the lawyer looked puzzled. He took several hours, looking up everything he could on his laptop and even placing numerous air-to-ground phone calls trying to find the answer. Finally, angry and frustrated, he gave up and paid the blonde $50.00<br><br>The blonde put the $50 into her purse without comment, but the lawyer insisted, "What is the answer to you question?"<br><br>Without saying a word, the blonde handed him $5.<br></div>

What happened?" asked the bartender politely.<br><br>"See, I met this beautiful woman who invited me back to her home. We stripped off our clothes and jumped into bed and we were just about to make love when her god damned husband came in the front door. So I had to jump out of the bedroom window and hang from the ledge by my fingernails!"<br><br>"Gee, that's tough!" said the bartender.<br><br>"Right, but that's not what really got me aggravated," the customer went on.<br><br>"When her husband came into the room he said, 'Hey great! You're naked already! Let me just take a leak.'<br><br>And damned if the lazy son of a bitch didn't piss out the window right onto my head?"<br><br>"Yeech!" the bartender shook his head. "No wonder you're in a lousy mood."<br><br>"Yeah, but I haven't told you what really, really got to me. Next, I had to listen to them grunting and groaning and when they finished, the husband tossed his condom out of the window. And where does it land? My damned forehead!" "Damn, that really is a drag!" says the bartender.<br><br>"Oh, I'm not finished. See what really pissed me off was when the husband had to take a dump. It turns out that their toilet is broken, so he stuck his ass out of the window and let loose right on my head !" The bartender paled. "That would sure mess up my day." "Yeah, yeah, yeah," the fellow rattled on, "but do you know what REALLY, REALLY, REALLY pissed me off? When I looked down and saw that my feet were only SIX inches off the ground!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Separation Letter...<br><br>Dear Husband:<br>I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you for good.<br>I've been a good woman to you for seven years and I have nothing to show<br><br>for it. These last two weeks have been hell.. Your boss called to tell<br>me that you had quit your job today and that was the last straw. Last<br>week, you came home and didn't notice that I had gotten my hair and<br>nails done, cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand new<br>negligee. You came home and ate in two minutes, and went straight to<br>sleep after watching the game. You don't tell me you love me anymore,<br>you don't touch me or any thing. Either you're cheating or you don't<br>love me anymore, whatever the case is, I'm gone. P.S. If you're trying<br>to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are moving away to West Virginia<br>together! Have a great life! Your Ex-wife<br><br>Dear ex-wife<br><br>Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true that<br>you and I have been married for seven years, although a good woman is a<br>far cry from what you've been. I watch sports so much to try to drown<br>out your constant nagging. Too bad that doesn't work. I did notice when<br>you cut off all of your hair last week, the first thing that came to<br>mind was "You look just like a man!" My mother raised me to not say<br>anything if you can't say anything nice. When you cooked my favorite<br>meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY BROTHER, because I<br>stopped eating pork seven years ago. I went to sleep on you when you had<br>on that new negligee because the price tag was still on it. I prayed<br>that it was a coincidence that my brother had just borrowed fifty<br>dollars from me that morning and your negligee was $49.99. After all of<br>this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out. So when I<br>discovered that I had hit the lotto for ten million dollars, I quit my<br>job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica. But when I got home you were<br>gone. Everything happens for a reason I guess. I hope you have the<br>fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said with your letter that<br>you wrote, you won't get a dime from me. So take care.<br><br>P.S. I don't know if I ever told you this but Carl, my brother was born<br>Carla. I hope that's not a problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A very successful lawyer parked his brand new BMW in front of the<br>&gt; office,<br>&gt; ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he got out, a runaway truck<br>&gt; sped by, too close to the curb, and completely tore off the driver's<br>&gt; door<br>&gt; of the BMW.<br>&gt; The lawyer immediately grabbed his mobile phone, dialled 999, and it<br>&gt; wasn't more than 5 minutes before a policeman pulled up. Before the cop<br>&gt; had a chance to ask any questions, the lawyer started screaming<br>&gt; hysterically. His BMW, which he had just picked up the day before, was<br>&gt; now<br>&gt; completely ruined and would never be the same, no matter how the body<br>&gt; shop<br>&gt; tried to make it new again. After the lawyer finally wound down from<br>&gt; his<br>&gt; rant, the cop shook his head in disgust and disbelief.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "I can't believe how materialistic you lawyers are," he said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "You are so focused on your possessions that you neglect the most<br>&gt; important things in life."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "How can you say such a thing?" asked the lawyer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The cop replied, "My God, don't you even realise that your left arm is<br>&gt; missing? It got ripped off when the truck hit you!!!"<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "My God!" screamed the lawyer...........<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (scroll down)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (scroll down)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (scroll down)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Where's my Rolex?!!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tech Support....<br><br>Dear Tech Support:<br><br>Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up alot of space and valuable resources. In addition , Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3 , Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6. I can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help!<br><br>Thanks,<br>A Troubled User. (KEEP READING)<br>_____________________________________________________________________________<br><br>REPLY:<br>Dear Troubled User:<br><br>This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed.<br><br>You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony-Child<br>Support. I recommend that you keep Wife1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application "Yes Dear" to alleviate software augmentation.<br><br>The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0 , Cook It 1.5 and Do Bills 4.2 .<br><br>However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5 . Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0 !<br><br>WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3 . This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system.<br><br>Best of luck,<br><br>Tech Support<br></div>

I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!"<br>His buddy looks at him and says, "Well, you're obviously taking the wrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, rub my hands on my wife's butt and say, 'Lets do it!' ....and she's always sound asleep.<br></div>
