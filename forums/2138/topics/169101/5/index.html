When he arrives, she seductively signals that he should bring his face close to hers.

"Is there anything I can do?"<br>"Yes there is. I need you to give him a message" she continues huskily, popping a couple<br>of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently.<br><br>"Tell him that there is no toilet paper in the ladies room."<br></div>

"Do you think we could have sex one more time? - After all, I've only got 12 hours to live."<br><br>"OK," said the wife and they had sex.<br><br>Four hours later, he nudged her in bed. "I just realized I've only got eight hours to live.<br>Could we have sex one last time?"<br><br>"Very well," she sighed. "It's the least I can do in the circumstances".<br><br>Four hours later, he woke her again. "I've only got fours to live. Would you mind if we had sex just one more time, our final act of love?"<br><br>This was too much for the wife. "Listen," she snapped, "you may not have to get up in the morning, but I do!"<br></div>

I have two male parrots<br>whom I have taught to pray and read the Bible.<br><br>Bring your two parrots over to my house and we will put them in<br>the cage with Francis and Job. My parrots can teach your parrots<br>to praise and worship. I'm sure your parrots will stop saying<br>that...that phrase in no time." "Thank you," the woman<br>responded, "this may very well be the solution."<br><br>The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's<br>house. As he ushered her in, she saw this two male parrots were<br>inside their cage, hold their rosary beads and praying.<br>Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in with them.<br>After just a couple of seconds, the female parrots exclaimed out<br>in unison, "Hi, we're prostitutes.

            <div class='col-md body'>President talks to Ah Beng during inspection of Guard of Honour<br>@National Day Parade<br><br>But then Ah Beng knows no English at all. Despite this, his physical<br>fitness and bravery enabled him to perform very well in the Armed<br>Forces<br>and became a member of the Guard of Honour elite contingent for<br>National<br>Day Celebration.<br><br>Normally, the practice is that the President will ask 3 fixed questions<br>when he stops to speak to a soldier during inspection at NDP. The<br>following are the 3 questions to be asked in the order listed :<br><br>1) How old are you?<br><br>2) How many years have you been in the force?<br><br>3) Did you participate in the 2 most prestigious major exercises in the<br>Force's history : Starlight and Moonlight?<br><br>Not knowing any English, Ah Beng needed to memorise his answers in<br>English in case the President stopped to speak to him. So Ah Beng<br>answers<br>were :<br><br>1) 30, sir!<br><br>2) 10, sir<br><br>3) Both, sir!<br><br>Ah Beng was very nervous and afraid that he would be asked by the<br>President. So he spent many hours daily to memorise the 3 answers for 3<br>months.<br><br>On National Day, the President suay suay stopped in front of Ah Beng<br>(probably because of his distinctive Ah Beng look and curious what an<br>ah<br>beng was doing in the elite force) and asked Ah Beng the 3 questions.<br>However, the President was not an elected one because he walked over<br>without any opponent and he was too overwhelmed by the occassion that<br>he<br>mixed up the sequence of the questions and started with the 2nd<br>question<br>first. The conversation went like this :<br><br>President : Soldier, how many years have you been in the force?<br><br>Ah Beng (nervously) : 30, sir!<br><br>President (looking astonished and wondering how such a youthful looking<br>man could have 30 years of service) : How old are you then?<br><br>Ah Beng (proudly) : 10, sir!i<br><br>President (perplexed and angry with the answers given by Ah Beng, and<br>totally forgot that he was supposed to ask only standard questions) :<br>Are you mad or am I crazy?<br><br>Ah Beng (very proudly and with head raised high high) : Both, sir!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A little boy came down to breakfast. Since he lived on a farm, his mother asked if he had done his chores. Â“Not yet,Â” said the little boy. His mother tells him he canÂ’t have any breakfast until he does his chores. Well, heÂ’s a little pissed, so he goes to feed the chickens, and he kicks a chicken. He goes to feed the cows, and he kicks a cow. He goes to feed the pigs, and he kicks a pig. He goes back in for breakfast and his mother gives him a bowl of dry cereal. Â“How come I donÂ’t get any eggs and bacon? Why donÂ’t I have any milk in my cereal?Â” he asks. Â“Well,Â” his mother says, Â“I saw you kick a chicken, so you donÂ’t get any eggs. I saw you kick the pig, so you donÂ’t get any bacon, either. I also saw you kick the cow, so you arenÂ’t getting any milk this morning.Â”<br><br>Just about then, his father comes down for breakfast, and he kicks the cat as heÂ’s walking into the kitchen. The little boy looks up at his mother with a smile, and says, Â“Are you going to tell him, or should I?Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(Hahaha..hillarious!)<br><br>A couple wants a divorce, but first they must decide who will be the main guardian of their child. The jury asks both the man and woman for a reason why they should be the one to keep the child. So the jury asks the woman first. She says, "Well I carried this child around in my stomach for nine months and I had to go through a painful birth process, this is my child and apart of me." The jury is impressed and then turns to ask the man the same question. The man replies, "OK, I take a coin and put it in the drink machine and a drink comes out, now tell me who does the drink belong to me or the machine"<br></div>

The mechanic shouted across the garage,"Hello Doctor, please come over here for a minute." The famous surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to the mechanic. The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked argumentatively. "So doctor, look at this, I also open hearts, take valves out, grind'em, put in new parts, and when I finish this will work as a new one. So how come you get the big money, when you and me is doing basically the same work?"<br><br>The doctor leaned over and whispered to the mechanic "Try to do it when the engine is running."<br></div>
