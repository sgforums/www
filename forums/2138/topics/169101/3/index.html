            <div class='col-md body'>An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully. From morning till night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about something. The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule. He tried to plow a lot.<br><br>One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch. Immediately, his wife began nagging him again.<br><br>Complain, nag, complain, nag; it just went on and on. All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet, caught her smack in the back of the head. Killed her dead on the spot.<br><br>At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement.<br><br>This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it. So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men.<br><br>The old farmer said, "Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."<br><br>"And what about the men?" the minister asked.<br><br>"They wanted to know if the mule was for sale."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking!<br><br>A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, "I think I can stand over the hole!" So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, "Grab for my 'thingy' and pull yourself up." And the chicken did and pulled himself to safety.<br><br>The moral of the story:<br><br>If you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up chicks.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I never quite figured out why the sexual urge of men and women differ so<br>much. And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. I have<br>never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.<br><br>FOR EXAMPLE: One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed.<br><br>Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says "I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me."<br><br>I said "WHAT??!! What was that?!"<br><br>So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...<br>"You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me<br>to satisfy your physical needs as a man."<br><br>She responded to my puzzled look<br>by saying, "Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in<br>the bedroom?"<br><br>Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.<br><br>The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with<br>her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big<br>unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on<br>several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to<br>take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to<br>compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We<br>went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond<br>earrings. Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was<br>one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because<br>she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play<br>tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I said, "That's fine, honey."<br>She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.<br>Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, "I think this is all<br>dear, let's go to the cashier."<br><br>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, "No honey, I don't feel like it."<br><br>Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled WHAT?"<br><br>I then said "honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're<br>just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy<br>your shopping needs as a woman."<br><br>And just when she had this look like she<br>was going to kill me, I added, "Why can't you just love me for who I am and<br>not for the things I buy you?"<br><br>Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either..but you get my drift<br></div>

If he curses while he tells you his wish list, leave a pile of dog poop in place of each gift he requests.Â”<br><br>Two days before Christmas, JustinÂ’s father asks him what he wants for Christmas. Â“I want a damn teddy bear lying beside me when I wake up. When I go downstairs, I want to see a damn train going around the damn tree. And when I go outside, I want to see a damn bike leaning up against the damn garage.Â”<br><br>On Christmas morning, Justin wakes up and rolls into a pile of dog poop. Confused, he walks downstairs and sees another pile under the tree. He walks outside, looks at a huge pile of dog poo by the garage, and walks inside. His dad smiles and asks, Â“What did Santa bring you this year?Â”<br><br>Justin replies, Â“I think I got a goddamn dog, but I canÂ’t find the son of a bitch!Â”<br></div>

Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today."<br><br>As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen."<br></div>
