            <div class='col-md body'>An elderly woman walked into the main branch of Chase Manhattan Bank building holding a large paper bag in her hand. She told the young man at the window that she wished to take the 3 million dollars she had in the bag and open an account with the bank. She said that first, though, she wished to meet the President of Chase Manhatten Bank due to the large amount of money involved.<br><br>The teller seemed to think that was a reasonable request and, after opening the bag and seeing the bundles of $1,000 bills which amounted to $3 million, he phoned the President to make the appointment for the woman.<br><br>The woman was escorted upstairs to the President's office. Introductions were made and she said that she liked to get to know the people she did businness with on a more personal level. The bank President then asked how did she come into such a large sum of money.<br><br>"Was it an inheritance?" he asked.<br><br>"No" she answered<br><br>"Was it from playing the Stock Market?" he inquired.<br><br>"No", She replied<br><br>He was quiet for a moment, trying to figure out how the elderly lady came into such a large sum of money.<br><br>"I won it by betting" she stated.<br><br>"As in horses?"<br><br>"No", she replied, "I bet on people."<br><br>Seeing his confusion, she explained that she would bet on different things with people. All of a sudden she said, "I'll bet you $25,000 that by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning your balls will be square."<br><br>The bank President figured that she must be off her rocker and decided to taker her up on the bet. He didn't see how he could lose. For the rest of the day, he was very careful. He decided to stay home that evening and take no chances, since there was $25,000 at stake.<br><br>When he got up in the morning and took his shower, he checked to make sure everything was okay. There was no difference in his scrotal appearance. He looked the same as he always had. He went to work and waited for the woman to come in at 10 o'clock, humming as he went. He knew, this would be a lucky day-how often did he get handed $25,000 for doing nothing?<br><br>At 10 o'clock sharp the woman was shown into his office. With her was a man. Then the bank President asked what the other man was doing in the office with her, and she explained to the President that he was her Lawyer and she always took him along on bets when large sums of money was at stake.<br><br>"Well", she asked,"What about our bet?" "I don't know how to tell you this", he answered with a smile,"But I'm the same as I've always have been, only $25,000 richer."<br><br>The lady seemed to accept this, but requested that she be able to see for herself. The bank President thought that this was a reasonable request and dropped his trousers. She instructed him to bend over, and she grabbed a hold of him. Sure enough, everything was fine. His balls were not square.<br><br>The bank President then looked up and saw the Lawyer standing across the room banging his head against the wall.<br><br>"What's wrong with him?", he asked.<br><br>"Oh, him", She answered, " I bet him $100,000 that by 10:30 this morning I'd have the President of the Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An Australian couple, both well into their 80s, goes to a sex therapist's office.<br><br>The doctor asks, "What can I do for you?"<br><br>The man says, "Will you watch us have sexual intercourse?"<br><br>The doctor raises both eyebrows, but he is so amazed that such an elderly couple is asking for sexual advice that he agrees.<br><br>When the couple finishes, the doctor says, "There's absolutely nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse." He thanks them for coming, he wishes them good luck, he charges them $50 and he says goodbye.<br><br>The next week, however, the couple returns and asks the sex therapist to watch again. The sex therapist is a bit puzzled, but agrees.<br><br>This happens several weeks in a row. The couple makes an appointment, has intercourse with no problems, pays the doctor, then leave.<br><br>Finally, after 5 or 6 weeks of this routine, the doctor says, "I'm sorry, but I have to ask. Just what are you trying to find out?"<br><br>The old man says, "We're not trying to find out anything. She's married and we can't go to her house. I'm married and we can't go to my house. The Holiday Inn charges $98. The Hilton charges $139. We do it here for $50, and I get $43 back from Medicare...! "<br></div>
