I'm not supposed to love u and not supposed to care... but u turned my life upside-down... Do u know because I'm sure u dun even understand... I wouldnt have to guess if u feel the same i feel for u, I wouldnt have to play this guessing game... Until I found the words to tell u how I feel, I've kept them hidden and try to make a deal...a deal with destiny...a deal with fate....<br><br>I always look into ur eyes and said a silent prayer... I looked into ur heart and wished I were there... Everytym I watched u walk away, but not wanting to let u go... Afraid to push u away from mi, I give in to ur every request... U looked at mi with ur charming eyes, I felt so special I wanted to cry... I long to say "I love u" instead I hold it within...<br><br>Not knowing what I was getting into, whether this new thing I was embarking on was worth all my while, or even my style... Not knowing if I'm setting myself up for heartache... Still, my curiousity would not let mi pass this chance...<br><br>U entered my world like a dream, that of which I never wish to wake... The tym I spent with u was heaven sent !! "Go with the flow" is ur motto, u played the game very well... If u feel the same as I for u, then its true oni tym wil tell... I struggle to hide the words for I fear u'll run... Do I keep silent juz so u'll stay??<br><br>I was reluctant not to let my feelings show, holding on to it not wanting to let these feelings go... Never even thinking I could look at u in this way becoz u dun belong to mi... I guess this is what I loved about u, not to mention all the crazy things u do !!!<br><br>I already have all these feelings for u, but one day if u like someone else, I will let u go... I dont want to hold on to feelings that arent there because u like someone else... At least that's how it seems... I'm not angry I'm just concern because I cant win a taken heart... I just wished I found u first... I know u'll never want to hurt anyone, thats why I'll let u go if u like someone else...<br><br>Dont stay around becoz of my feelings and thats something u shouldnt have to do... Tel mi now, I really dont know what the case may be, all I know is that u'r on my mind and I got to be with u even if it means mi getting hurt... Risking it all once again, juz for u...<br><br>Love,<br>Me</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>no more heartache le... coz i wanna WOO my guy back !!!!<br><br>the man I love so much, since he is never gotta be faithful and fair to anyone, not even mi.... all men are lidat... hear mi stereotyping them now coz it've happened to all the men I've met in my whole lifetym, I shouldnt be expecting him to be faithful (i've experienced it though...)<br><br>Since non of his faithfulness exist, I should not MAKE BELIEVE that he will be, trying so hard to make myself believe too... and when all else fails, I kept telling people of all my sadness and getting all over again in emotional wreck like a spoilt brat (but not oni spoilt brat complains, many of us do too)... so, in other words, I have to learn to enjoy the unfaithfulness he did and if I cant accept I cant blame anyone for it... not even him...<br><br>U may think that I am too stupid or devoted to think this way... but eventually, even if not him, the rest of the men out there are going to be unfaithful too... so why not choose someone I love and accept the unfaithfulness dan to choose a person I dun like??? Worse thing is, if anyone demands faithfulness or fairness from their partners, another party tries very hard to be (or make believe that they tried but is all lies) and fail in the end (exposed??), both are gotta get hurtfully painful and miserable for that !!<br><br>Dats life... is full of shit.. nothing can help except change our mindset...<br><br>The truth out there is, as long I learn to accept the negative things in life, such as loneliness, unfaithfulness, unfairness, cruelty, I will live with it and not get hurt so much anymore... I'm forced to understand and learning to deal with it by enjoying all of these things... In fact, its all these that makes life so spectacular, yet so miserable... u can choose to believe it as spectacular or miserable... juz like appreciating that roses have thorns or thorns have roses...<br><br>My tears these few days have made up a big swimming pool and I really cry so much that I think my tears might all juz dry up and no more left... but dats not true... Tears never dry until u made it so...<br><br>So I am back to woo the man i love again but with a different mindset of this entire thingy... I really love him though... juz wanna shower him with a little love every now and then... and when I leave singapore one day, I'll b happy with all the memories then... because, I'm truly devoted to him !! I should start enjoy loving him all alone and not to complain like a woman who mean to expect.. yeah, dats the word, EXPECTATION ??!<br><br>Ooh yeah, and I want to take alot of pictures of the things we do together so that I can have a whole album of memories when I gotta go Taiwan... Isnt that sweet?? (dont say its stupid even if u think it is!!)<br><br>hee hee... i'm hopping and skipping in delight all over again... hahar !! women are strange creatures too, coz after writing two ful pages of 'lost love quotes' dan decide a different mindset to treat her wounds...<br></div>
