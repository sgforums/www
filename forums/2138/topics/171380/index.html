How could she do this to me?<br>I threw her a hateful look and ran out.<br><br>The next day at school...<br>"Your mom only has one eye?!?!"...eeeee said a friend.<br>I wished my mom would just disappear from this world.<br>So I said to my mom, "Mom... Why don't you have the other eye?!<br>If you're only gonna make me a laughing stock, why don't you just die?!!!"<br><br>My mom did not respond...<br>I guess I felt a little bad, but at the same time, it felt good to think that I had said what I'd wanted to say all this time...<br>Maybe it was because my mom hadn't punished me, but I didn't think that I had hurt her feelings very badly.<br><br>That night...<br>I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water.<br>My mom was crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might wake me.<br>I took a look at her, and then turned away.<br>Because of the thing I had said to her earlier, there was something pinching at me in the corner of my heart.<br>Even so, I hated my mother who was crying out of her one eye.<br>So I told myself that I would grow up and become successful.<br><br>Then I studied real hard.<br>I left my mother and went to Singapore to study.<br><br>Then, I got married.<br>I bought a house of my own. Then I had kids, too...<br>Now I'm living happily as a successful man.<br>I like it here because it's a place that doesn't remind me of my mom.<br><br>This happiness was getting bigger and bigger, when...<br><br>What?! Who's this?!<br>It was my mother...Still with her one eye.<br>I felt as if the whole sky was falling apart on me.<br>Even my children ran away, scared of my mom's eye.<br>And I asked her, "Who are you?!" "I don't know you!!!" as if trying to make that real.<br>I screamed at her, "How dare you come to my house and scare my children!"<br><br>GET OUT OF HERE! NOW!!!"<br><br>And to this, my mother quietly answered,<br>"Oh, I'm so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address," and she disappeared out of sight.<br><br>Thank good ness... She doesn't recognize me. I was quite relieved.<br>I told myself that I wasn't going to care, or think about this for the rest of my life.<br><br>Then a wave of relief came upon me...<br><br>One day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house in Singapore.<br>So, lying to my wife that I was going on a business trip, I went.<br>After the reunion, I went down to the old shack, that I used to call a house... Just out of curiosity<br><br>There, I found my mother fallen on the cold ground.<br>But I did not shed a single tear.<br>She had a piece of paper in her hand....It was a letter to me.<br><br>"My son...<br>I think my life has been long enough now...<br>And... I wont visit Singapore anymore...<br>But would it be too much to ask if I wanted you to come visit me once in a while? I miss you so much..<br>And I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion.<br>But I decided not to go to the school.<br>For you...<br>And I'm sorry that I only have one eye, and I was an embarrassment for you.<br><br>You see, when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye.<br>As a mom, I couldn't stand watching you having to grow up with only one eye...<br>So I gave you mine...I was so proud of my son that was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye.<br>I was never upset at you for anything you did..<br>The couple times that you were angry with me..<br>I thought to myself, 'It's because he loves me..'<br><br>My son... Oh, my son... "<br><br>This message has a very deep meaning and is passed to remind people of the goodness they have enjoy was because of others directly or indirectly.<br><br>Pause a moment and consider your life!<br>Be thankful of what you have today compared to many millions who do not live lives as you do!<br><br>Do spend some time in prayer for your mum out there!<br></div>
