            <div class='col-md body'>Fond memories For those who born in the 70s and 80s.<br><br>1. You grew up watching He-man, MASK, Transformers, Silver Hawk and<br>Mickey Mouse. Not to forget, Ninja turtles, My<br>Little Pony and Smurfs too.<br><br>2. You grew up brushing your teeth with a mug<br>in Primary school during recess time. You will squat by a drain<br>with all your classmates beside you, and brush your teeth<br>with a coloured mug.The teachers said you must brush each side 10 times too.<br><br>3. You know what SBC stands for.<br><br>4. You pay 40 cents for Chocolate or Strawberry MILK every week in class.<br><br>5. You watch a very popular Malay dubbed Japanese drama on RTM1<br>about schoolgirls who possess powerful skills in volleyball called Meoro Attack.<br><br>6. You find your friends with pagers and handphone cool in Secondary school.<br><br>7. SBS buses used to be non-airconditioned. The bus seats are made<br>of wood and the cushion is red. The big red bell gives a loud BEEP!<br>when pressed. There are colourful tickets forTIBS buses.The<br>conductor  will check for tickets by using a machine which<br>punches a hole in the ticket.<br><br>8. Envelopes given to us to donate to Sharity Elephant every<br>Children's Day.<br><br>9. You've probably read Young Generation magazine.You know who's<br>Vinny the little vampire and Acai the constable.<br><br>10. You were there when they first introduced MRT here. You went<br>for the first ride with your parents and you would kneel on the<br>seat to see the scenery.<br><br>11. Movie tickets used to cost only $3.50. &amp;@%#$*@#$^*!@#&amp;^$<br><br>12. Gals are fascinated by Strawberry Short<br>Cake and Barbie Dolls.<br><br>13. You learn to laugh like The Count in<br>Sesame Street.<br><br>14. You longed to buy tibits called Kaka (20 cents per pack), and<br>Ding Dang (50 cents per box), that had a toy in it and it changes<br>every week not forgetting the 15 cents animal crackers and the ring pop, where<br>the lollipop is the diamond on the ring.<br><br>15. You watched TV2 (also known as Channel 10) cartoons because<br>Channel 5 never had enough cartoons for you.<br><br>16. Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Three<br>Investigators, Famous Five and Secret Seven are probably the thickest<br>story books you ever thought you have read. Even Sweet Valley High<br>and Malory Towers.<br><br>17. KFC used to be a high class restaurant that<br>serve food in plates and let you use metal forks and knives.<br><br>18. The most vulgar thing you said was asshole and idiot<br>and THE MOST EXTREME WAS 'super white'...you just<br>couldn't bring yourself to say the hokkien relative.<br><br>19. Catching was the IN thing and twist as the magic word.<br><br>20. Your English workbooks was made of some<br>damn poor quality paper that was smooth and yellow.<br><br>21. CDIS were your bestfriend<br>22. The only computer lessons in school involved funny pixellised<br>characters in 16 colours walking about trying to teach you maths.<br><br>23. Waterbottles were slinged around your neck<br>and a must everywhere you go.<br><br>24. Boys loved to play soccer with small plastic<br>balls in the basketball court.<br><br>25. Teng-teng, five stones, chapteh, hentam<br>bola and zero point were all the rage with the girls and boys too...<br><br>26. Science was fun with the balsam and the angsana being the most<br>important plants of our lives, guppies and<br>swordtail being the most important fish.<br><br>27. Who can forget Ahmad, Bala, Sumei and<br>John, eternalized in our minds from the textbooks. Even Mr Wally &amp; Mr.<br>Yakki. What abt Miss Lala??? And Zaki and Tini in Malay Textbooks<br>28. We carry out experiments of our own to get yourself badges for<br>being a Young Zoologist/Botanist etc.<br><br>29. Every Children's day and National day<br>you either get pins or pens with 'Happy Children's Day 1993' or dumb<br>files with 'Happy National Day 1994'.<br><br>30. In Primary six you had to play buddy for the<br>younger kids like big sister and brother.<br><br>31. We wear BM2000, BATA, or Pallas shoes.<br><br>32. Your form teacher taught you Maths, Science and English.<br><br>33. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br><br>34. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained,<br>and you find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your feet,<br>and wear your dry and warm socks and shoes.<br><br>35. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br><br>36. There would be spelling tests and mental<br>sums to do almost everyday.<br><br>37. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if<br>your parents gave you $3 or more for pocket money everyday.<br><br>38. You see Wee Kim Wee's face in the school hall.<br>39. You freak out when the teacher tells you to<br>line up according to height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl<br>40. Boys like to catch fighting spiders.<br><br>41. Collecting and battling erasers was a pastime for boys.<br><br>42. Autograph books were loaded with "Best<br>Wishes", "Forget Me Not", and small<br>poems like "Bird fly high, hard to catch.Friend like you, hard to forget".<br><br>43. Class monitors and prefects loved to say "You talk somemore, I<br>write your name ah!"<br><br>44. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br><br>45. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br><br>46. You brought every single book to school, even though there was<br>one thing called the timetable.<br><br>Spread this heart warming messagearound, you<br>don't get something like this very often.<br><br>For those who are born in those days... remember the good old days?<br>For those who arent.... know what u missed out..?<br><br>Does/can the present be exchangable for the past?<br><br>U decide.<br><br></div>

In Primary six you had to play buddy for the<br>younger kids like big sister and brother.<br><strong>yup we had this call the buddy reading thingy too.</strong><br><br>32. Your form teacher taught you Maths, Science and English.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>33. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>34. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained,<br>and you find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your feet,<br>and wear your dry and warm socks and shoes.<br><strong>YUP definitely. haha. I was very afraid i will be late becuz of this.</strong><br>35. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>36. There would be spelling tests and mental<br>sums to do almost everyday.<br><strong>ya and smth call xi zi for the chinese.</strong><br>37. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if<br>your parents gave you $3 or more for pocket money everyday.<br><strong>2 is consider more already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></strong><br>38. You see Wee Kim Wee's face in the school hall.<br><strong>oh this one! Our principal and teachers kept telling us he was once from our sch.. now guess which sch am i from b4? </strong><br><br>39. You freak out when the teacher tells you to<br>line up according to height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>40. Boys like to catch fighting spiders.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>41. Collecting and battling erasers was a pastime for boys.<br><strong>yup! dunnoe if its de same but for us, we keep flipping the erasers till one stake on another.</strong><br>42. Autograph books were loaded with "Best<br>Wishes", "Forget Me Not", and small<br>poems like "Bird fly high, hard to catch.Friend like you, hard to forget".<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>43. Class monitors and prefects loved to say "You talk somemore, I<br>write your name ah!"<br><strong>ya and den they submit the name to teachers lol.i was one of those who get caught and also once the one who catch lol.</strong><br>44. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br><strong> for me, dat time only 20 to 30 pupils</strong><br>45. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <strong>and above butt.</strong><br>46. You brought every single book to school, even though there was<br>one thing called the timetable.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
