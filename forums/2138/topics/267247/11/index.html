              <p>Bob Dylan - Hurricane</p>
              <p><span style="color: #474747; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 23px;">Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Enter patty valentine from the upper hall.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">She sees the bartender in a pool of blood,<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Cries out, my god, they killed them all!<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Here comes the story of the hurricane,<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The man the authorities came to blame<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">For somethin that he never done.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The champion of the world.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Three bodies lyin there does patty see<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And another man named bello, movin around mysteriously.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I didnt do it, he says, and he throws up his hands<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I was only robbin the register, I hope you understand.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I saw them leavin, he says, and he stops<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">One of us had better call up the cops.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And so patty calls the cops<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">In the hot new jersey night.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Meanwhile, far away in another part of town<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin around.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Number one contender for the middleweight crown<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Just like the time before and the time before that.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">In paterson thats just the way things go.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">If youre black you might as well not show up on the street<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">less you wanna draw the heat.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowlin around<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">He said, I saw two men runnin out, they looked like middleweights<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And miss patty valentine just nodded her head.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Cop said, wait a minute, boys, this ones not dead<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">So they took him to the infirmary<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And though this man could hardly see<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">They told him that he could identify the guilty men.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Four in the mornin and they haul rubin in,<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The wounded man looks up through his one dyin eye<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Says, whad you bring him in here for? he aint the guy!<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Yes, heres the story of the hurricane,<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The man the authorities came to blame<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">For somethin that he never done.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The champion of the world.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Four months later, the ghettos are in flame,<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Rubins in south america, fightin for his name<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">While arthur dexter bradleys still in the robbery game<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And the cops are puttin the screws to him, lookin for somebody to blame.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Remember that murder that happened in a bar? <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Remember you said you saw the getaway car? <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">You think youd like to play ball with the law? <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin that night? <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Dont forget that you are white.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Arthur dexter bradley said, Im really not sure.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Cops said, a poor boy like you could use a break<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">We got you for the motel job and were talkin to your friend bello<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Now you dont wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Youll be doin society a favor.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">That sonofabitch is brave and gettin braver.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">We want to put his ass in stir<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">We want to pin this triple murder on him<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">He aint no gentleman jim.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Rubin could take a man out with just one punch<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">But he never did like to talk about it all that much.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Its my work, hed say, and I do it for pay<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And when its over Id just as soon go on my way<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Up to some paradise<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And ride a horse along a trail.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">But then they took him to the jailhouse<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">All of rubins cards were marked in advance<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The judge made rubins witnesses drunkards from the slums<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And though they could not produce the gun,<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The d.a. said he was the one who did the deed<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And the all-white jury agreed.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Rubin carter was falsely tried.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The crime was murder one, guess who testified? <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Bello and bradley and they both baldly lied<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">How can the life of such a man<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Be in the palm of some fools hand? <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">To see him obviously framed<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Couldnt help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Where justice is a game.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">While rubin sits like buddha in a ten-foot cell<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">An innocent man in a living hell.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Thats the story of the hurricane,<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">But it wont be over till they clear his name<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">And give him back the time hes done.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The champion of the world.</span></p>
