He said,<br>"Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,<br>Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your Grandma so."<br><br>We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together.<br>Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever.<br>But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead<br>I found this letter, and this is what it said:<br><br>If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.<br>I'll meet you when my chores are through;<br>I don't know how long I'll be.<br>But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.<br>And between now and then, till I see you again,<br>I'll be loving you. Love, me.<br><br>I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away,<br>In the doorway of a church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray.<br>I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years;<br>But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears.<br><br>If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.<br>I'll meet you when my chores are through;<br>I don't know how long I'll be.<br>But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.<br>And between now and then, till I see you again,<br>I'll be loving you. Love, me.<br>Between now and then, till I see you again,<br>I'll be loving you. Love, me.<br></div>
