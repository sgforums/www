              <p>When you get caught in the rain with no where to run<br>When you're distraught and in pain without anyone <br>When you keep crying out to be saved <br>But nobody comes and you feel so far away <br>That you just can't find your way home <br>You can get there alone <br>It's okay, once you say<br>I can make it through the rain <br>I can stand up once again on my own <br>And I know that I'm strong enough to mend<br>And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith<br>And I live one more day and I make it through the rain <br>And if you keep falling down don't you dare give in<br>You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly<br>And you'll find what you need to prevail <br>What you say is <br><br>I can make it through the rain <br>I can stand up once again on my own <br>And I know that I'm strong enough to mend<br>And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith <br>And I live one more day and I make it through the rain <br><br>And when the rain blows, as shadows grow close don't be afraid <br>There's nothing you can't face <br>And should they tell you you'll never pull through <br>Don't hesitate, stand tall and say <br><br>I can make it through the rain <br>I can stand up once again on my own <br>And I know that I'm strong enough to mend<br>And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith <br>And I live one more day and I make it through the rain <br><br>I can make it through the rain<br>And I live once again<br>And I live one more day <br>And I can make it through the rain <br>(Yes you can) <br>You will make it through the rain</p>

              I could never be<br>

              The days would all be empty<br>
              The nights would seem so long<br>
              With you I see forever oh so clearly<br>
              I might have been in love before<br>
              But it never felt this strong<br>

              Our dreams are young<br>

              One thing you can be sure of<br>
              I'll never ask for more than your love<br>
              <br>
              (Chorus 3)<br>
              Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
              You ought know by now how much I love you<br>
              The world may change my whole life through<br>
              But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br>
              <br>
              If the road ahead is not so easy,<br>

              I love you just the way you are<br>

              [Verse 1:]<br>
              Many guys have come to you<br>
              With a line that wasn't true<br>
              And you passed them by (passed them by)<br>
              Now you're in the center ring<br>
              And their lines don't mean a thing<br>
              Why don't you let me try (let me try)<br>
              Now I don't wear a diamond ring<br>
              I don't even have a song to sing<br>
              All I know is<br>

              If I ever saw a girl<br>
              That I needed in this world<br>
              You are the one for me (one for me)<br>
              Let me hold me in my arms<br>
              Girl, and thrill you with my charms<br>
              I'm sure you will see (you will see)<br>
              The things I am sayin' are true<br>
              And the way I explain them to you<br>
