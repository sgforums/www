So I asked him go coffeeshop so that i can haf some supper lah...<br><br>All of sudden I dont feel like going anymore coz of damn laziness, so I msned him and let him know that I'll meet him tomorrow lah...<br><br>he said...:<br>"tomorrow then..<br>just remember to give me a kiss as an apology.<br>if no kiss = one BOX on ur head. haha"<br><br>Woah lau, I'm so angry and pissed coz this is not the first tym he say this kinda thing liao lor... he is abit thick-skinned but i didnt say i am pretty until what lor... even mi ugly but friends oni leh !! No need say this kinda thing right??<br><br>So here's my reply:<br>"siao arh<br>hahaha... not funny..."<br><br>Obvious enuff that I am NOT appreciating that right??! Somemore he can add oil to fire..<br><br>He said:<br>"haha<br>kiss me only mah~~<br>tomorrow around 10pm then?<br>ok?"<br><br>SEE !! Ok... Cool... Breathe... Cool...<br>I said:<br>"i wil never do that lor<br>u dun freak mi out "<br><br>Honest mah !! What is wrong with that??! He cannot take it when he can joke or make fun of others and people cannot have the right to tell him straight off meh?? Got this kinda thing anot??! If he cannot accept mi being frank and direct, dan dun start this lah...<br><br>In the very beginning when I asked to meet him, he ALREADY knows that i am mending my heartache recently and i am already so upset liao, he thinks that I have time to play around with him for this kinda stuffs?? intention of meeting him is to pour sorrows lah coz he is considered a nice friend who listens when i am down and sharing a bit of advice... not to take for granted but i appreciates his presence, i juz dont like to joke this kinda thing with him coz of some reasons... last tym told him before that i dun like to joke about this kinda thingy with him... was hoping he understand but he doing it now again?? what is his intention??<br><br>He replied angrily:<br>"im not intersted in ur kiss lah. even if u say ok, i also need to consider wor. say until i care so much like tat. -.-"<br><br>Piangz !!!<br>Now I become bad person looking as if I am the one asking to kiss him !!<br><br>So I reprimated him:<br>"u started it first now u come blame mi... what is wrong with u??"<br><br>And he replied:<br>"i know. its only when u put the word "freak" i got pissed."<br><br>Make sense anot?? if now I go and threaten to stab someone, and that someone report police and say i threaten to stab him, i got angry and really go stab him... police ask mi why i said coz i threaten to stab is kidding oni and he reported police, dats why i got worked up and stab him for real !! (Of course this is juz an example lah...) so who started it?? of course the "kidding" one who started first right?? u wan threaten and wan to blame people for telling police, got this kinda thing anot??<br><br>He started this whole thing first and now say I provoked him and pissed by mi saying "freak" !!!??<br><br>Finally I buay tahan and exploded... I could have shouted at him right in the face if he is in front of mi...and mayb I'd also gif him a BIG TIGHT SLAP too !! (apologise... abit violent here... so now i say the slap i'm kidding oni, can?? does dis means he got no right to be angry if he sees this one day?? *shrugs<br><br>So I screamed (virtually) :<br>"dun u think that u saying that would freak mi out?? dan u dun start i wouldnt say that and u wun get pissed mah... or u think dis funny to joke about that?? ask urself why u do that in the first place? watever u say now i become the bad person to say the word freak first lah?! my fault? watever u say now i become the bad person to say the word "freak" first lah?! my fault? bb"<br><br>And I shut off my msn... Pals, tel mi !! If u tel mi i'm wrong, i will repent and sincerely apologise and accept my own fault... I cant think clearly now coz it juz happened...<br><br>woah lau... my heart very fragile now lor... i'm already having a broken heart liao and this have to happen??! Haiz...<br></div>
