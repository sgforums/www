(yeah i agree with some of u guys' replies... thankx alot ya !!) lastly, can he tek it when it go wrong??<br><br>i am not perfect either, i have my flaws and tend to be unable to deal with responsibilities properly... i can oni try my best to learn how to handle responsibilities, though might never be the right way each tym... to err is human... i do not bear grudges against him or blame him, coz i shouted (virtually) at him too, which i flared my temper first... i will show my true self when it comes to friends, i dun think i should pretend that i can beat around the bush when it comes to things i consider alittle serious... it is no virtue about being frank and honest, so is it juz a weapon to get hurt afterall?? or i should be fake to this friend in order to avoid arguements with him??<br><br>anyway, binz, thank Q for coming around...</div>
