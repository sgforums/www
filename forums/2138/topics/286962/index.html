I needed algebra to work out the 1st and 3 question.

I think they must have learned one-step ahead, because frankly speaking, unless you have algebra to back you up, number 1 would mean trial-and-error.

The gun uses hydraulics to power up and now my task is to close the breech block which i had opened using hydraulics. The breech block is cocked and powerful springs will cause it to slam back when I release it unless someone is there to catch on to the wheel to trun it slowly and cause it to close slowly.<br><br>Apparently I slipped my hand into the gun and used the tool to whack the mechanism and the idiot I was working with did not turn the wheel at all. U know? It's like you twist a rubber band, then use something to hold it in that position, then if you release it, it would just spin back uncontrollably? The idiot never turned the wheel to the max, and the result is that he's essentially was just holding the wheel nothing more. It can't possibly catch the breech block as it closes.<br><br>So I whacked the mechanism, and the breech block just slammed. IN FRONT OF MY HAND. There was a huge WHAM! and the workshop almost collapsed. Ok lah, I won't lose my hand. I didn't. But the shock I had was more than enough.<br><br>And you know what's more farked up? Later I needed him to use a tool that's like a hammer to hit another lever and he used the OTHER SIDE of the bloody hammer to hit. Ain't he a cuckoo??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
