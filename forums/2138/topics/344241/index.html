              nurture and educate many children never to have more than<br>two... We will

              what to do, it's<br>happened." - PM Lee<br><br><br>'You know, the cure for all 
              this talk is really a good dose of<br>incompetent government. You get that 
              alternative and you'll never put<br>Singapore together again: Humpty Dumpty 
              cannot be put together<br>again... and your asset values will be in peril, your 
              security will be<br>at risk and our women will become maids in other people's

              the<br>best part is, I know the CPF money won't run away. CPF will still 
              be<br>around for a long, long time to come. Not only is it earning 
              good<br>interest, my capital is protected.<br><br>Leaving the best for 
              last...<br>"Right now we have Low Thia Khiang, Chiam See Tong, Steve Chia. We 
              can<br>deal with them. Suppose you had 10, 15, 20 opposition members 
              in<br>Parliament. Instead of spending my time thinking what is the 
              right<br>policy for Singapore, I'm going to spend all my time thinking 
              what's<br>the right way to fix them, to buy my supporters votes, how can I 
              solve<br>this week's problem and forget about next year's challenges?"PM 
              Lee<br>Hsien Loong, 3 May 2006.<br><br><strong>AND last but not least, here's what MM 
              Lee said in April 2007:-<br>....... you have to pay the market rate or the man 
              will up stakes and<br>join Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers or Goldman Sachs and 
              you would<br>have an incompetent man and you would lost money by
