It also<br>points to what you have to learn and the<br>challenges<br>you are facing.<br><br>To figure out your Birth Number, add all the<br>numbers in the birth date together, like in the<br>example, until there is only one digit.<br>A Birth Number does not prevent you from being<br>anything you want to be; it will just color your<br>choice differently and give you a little insight.<br>Example: March 20, 1950<br>3 + 20 + 1950 =1973<br>1 + 9 + 7 + 3 =20<br>2 + 0 =2<br>2 is the Birth Number to read for the birth date in<br>the example.<br><br>#1 THE ORIGINATOR<br>#2 THE PEACEMAKER<br>#3 THE LIFE OF THE PARTY<br>#4 THE CONSERVATIVE<br>#5 THE NONCONFORMIST<br>#6 THE ROMANTIC<br>#7 THE INTELLECTUAL<br>#8 THE BIG SHOT<br>#9 THE PERFORMER<br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br># 1 - THE ORIGINATOR<br>1's are originals.
