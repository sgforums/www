            <div class='col-md body'>A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she<br>lay her<br>pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to<br>the<br>bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head sadly and<br>said, "I'm so sorry, your Duck uddles has passed away."<br><br>The distressed owner wailed, "Are you sure?"<br><br>"Yes, I am sure. The duck is dead," he replied.<br>"How can you be so sure," she protested.<br>"I mean, you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might<br>just be in a coma or something."<br><br>The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room, and<br>returned a few moments later with a black Labrador Retriever.<br><br>As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind<br>legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the<br>duck from top to bottom. He then looked at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.<br><br>The vet patted the dog and took it out, and returned a few moments<br>later with a cat.<br><br>The cat jumped up on the table and also sniffed delicately at the<br>bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its<br>head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.<br><br>The vet looked at the woman and said, "I'm sorry, but as I said, this<br>is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."<br><br>Then the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and<br>produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.<br><br>The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. "$150!", she cried,<br>"$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!!!<br><br>The vet shrugged. "I'm sorry If you'd taken my word for it, the bill<br>would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now<br>$150.00.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Drunk and falling down<br><br>A drunk had been at a pub all night. At last call, the drunk stood up to leave and fell flat on his face. He tried to stand one more time, to the same result.<br><br>He figured he'd crawl outside to get some fresh air, since maybe that would sober him up. Once outside, he stood up and fell flat on his face. So he decided to crawl the four blocks to his house.<br><br>When he arrived at the door he stood up and again fell flat on his face.<br><br>He crawled through the door and into his bedroom. When he reached his bed he tried one more time to stand up.<br><br>This time he managed to pull himself upright, but he quickly fell right into bed and was sound asleep the second his head hit the pillow.<br><br>He was awakened the next morning by his wife shouting, "So you've been out drinking again, have you?!"<br><br>"No! What makes you say that?" he asked, putting on his best innocent expression.<br><br>"The pub called... you forgot your wheelchair again."<br></div>

"Uh...2 million<br>boleh lah," replies the Malay  applicant. "Two million? That's a lot of<br>money! Even the aneh before you only asked for one million!"<br><br>"You see, Datuk," explains Mat. "I have 4 wives and 15 children ... so<br>20 of us in the family, we need a lot of money to support ourselves..."<br>"I see," says Dr. M. "Okay, can you ask the Chinese guy to come  here<br>now?"<br><br>The Chinese guy comes in and Dr. M asks, "Ah Chong, this is a dangerous<br>mission, how much do you think you should be paid?" Ah Chong thinks for<br>a while, and suddenly says, "3 million."  Mahathir is shocked.<br><br>"What?!?!"<br>3 million? Why so much?!"<br><br>Ah Chong beckons Dr. M to come closer, and whispers, "One million you<br>keep, one million I keep, and then one more million to send the aneh<br>into  space."<br></div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>true true</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jokes to share...<br><br>A young executive was leaving the office at 6 p.m. when he found CEO standing in front of a shredder with a piece of paper in his hand. "Listen," said the CEO, "this is a very sensitive and important document, and my secretary has left. Can you make this thing work?" Certainly," said the young executive. He turned the machine on, inserted the paper, and pressed the start button. "Excellent, excellent!" said the CEO. As his paper disappeared insidethe machine,"I just need one copy."<br><br><strong>Lesson I - Never, never assume that your BOSS knows everything</strong><br><br>An American and a Japanese were sitting on the plane on the way to LA when the American turned to the Japanese and asked, "What kind of ese are you?" Confused, the Japanese replied, "Sorry but I don't understand what you mean. The American repeated, "What kind of -ese are you?" Again, the Japanese was confused over the question. The American, now irritated, then yelled, "What kind of -ese are you...Are you a Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese!, etc......???<br><br>The Japanese then replied, "Oh, I am a Japanese." A while later the Japanese turned to the American and asked what kind of 'key' was he. The American, frustrated, yelled, "What do you mean what kind of '-key' am I?!" The Japanese said, "Are you a Yankee, donkey, or monkee?"<br><br><strong>Lesson II - Never insult anyone.</strong><br><br>There were these 4 guys, a Russian, a German, a British and a French, who found this small genie bottle. When they rubbed the bottle, a genie appeared. Thankful that the 4 guys had released him out of the bottle, he said, "Next to you all are 4 swimming pools, I will give each of you a wish. When you run towards the pool and jump, you shout what you want the pool of water to become, then your wish will come true."<br><br>The French wanted to start. He ran towards the pool, jumped and shouted<br>WINE". The pool immediately changed into a pool of wine. The Frenchman<br>was so happy swimming and drinking from the pool. Next is the Russian's<br>turn, he did the same and shouted," VODKA" and immersed himself into a<br>pool of vodka.<br>The German was next and he jumped and shouted, "BEER". He was so<br>contented with his beer pool. The last is the British. He was running<br>towards the pool when suddenly he steps on a banana peel. He slipped<br>towards the pool and shouted, SHIT!!!!!!!........."<br><br><strong>Lesson III - Think twice before you say something, because sometimes<br>what you say accidentally does happen.</strong><br><br>A junior manager, a senior manager and their boss are on their way to a<br>meeting. On their way through a park, they come across a wonder lamp.<br>They rub the lamp and a ghost appears.<br>The ghost says, "Normally, one is granted three wishes but as you are<br>three, I will allow one wish each" So the eager senior manager shouts, I<br>want the first wish. I want to be in the Bahamas, on a fast boat and<br>have no worries for a month. "Pfufffff, and he is gone.<br>Now the junior manager could not keep quiet and shouts, "I want to be in<br>Florida with beautiful girls, plenty of food and cocktails for a<br>month."<br>Pfufffff, and he is also gone. Then it's the boss's turn, and he says<br>calmly "I want these two idiots back in the office after lunch"<br><br><strong>Lesson IV- "Always allow the bosses to speak first".</strong></div>
