              <p>for as long as you are sticking to your notice period, 1 week or 1 month, you are ok. i will cut the crap of lunch/dinner thingy. alwaysdisturbed is right, loyalty is over-rated today in the working world. you should just do this without too much emotion. this will be best for everyone.</p>

              <p>Employment is a fair thing, you don't have to feel bad.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think you should keep everything professional and short. I had once read that a tender letter should not include too much details such as your future intentions.</p>
              <p>Just keep the letter simple and to the point, sentence such as "I would like to tender my resignation with effect from date __/__/__. <span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Thank you for the opportunities you have provided <span> </span>me during my time with the company."</span></p>
              <p>If she asked for a 1 on 1 chat, you don't have to reveal full details either. Just make it plain simple that you are leaving on goodwill. Making stories, real or fake will lead to complications. Not advisable.</p>
              <p>Good Luck.</p>

              <p>your boss thought that you can take over your mentor's work, now that you are leaving, it will put her in a very tight spot.</p>
              <p>but i guess the business will still have to continue with or without your mentor and you. don't worry the business will adapt.</p>

              <p>I can't say much in this case...i have to leave for my studies...its not that i don't like the job...so...i hope that she will "let me go"...because at the way things are looking...she may force me to stay...</p>

              <p>Looks like your boss is gonna have quite a little headache. </p>
              <p>Have you discussed about your studies with your boss before?  If its something that is "out of the blue" to her, it might really cause her to freak out. </p>
              <p>I'd reccommend informally informing your boss first.  At least she can immediately start the human resource process.</p>
