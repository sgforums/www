            <div class='col-md body'>You don't compare your body to a sculpture by Michelangelo, but you know you're far from a Kindergarten art project! All in all, you've got a healthy dose of body confidence, and that's a rarity in today's world. You've managed to avoid a significant amount of the pressure that society and the media impose on women. Occasionally, however, you might fall prey to the super-skinny ideal. But your strength and healthy outlook enable you to quickly dismiss that unattainable trend. Whether it's an incredible metabolism or a great mindset, your positive body image allows you to have your cake and eat it too! And if you occasionally turn down the cake for fear of lumps and dimples -- don't fret. It's natural for a woman to be self-critical sometimes, and it's not vain to want to look your best. So, as long as you keep these criticisms in perspective, you're in great shape!</div>

You've managed to overlook the pressure that society and the media impose on women. That's a huge feat, and we commend you for that. It is getting more and more difficult for a woman to look in the mirror and think, "I'm hot stuff." Whether it's an incredible metabolism or a terrific outlook, your healthy body image allows you to have your cake and eat it too! Congratulations, you've successfully avoided falling prey to the body trap! The thought of bathing suit season probably makes you excited for summer, rather than nauseous in anticipation. And chances are that you look in the mirror without pinching and cringing. Keep in mind, however, that it's normal to be occasionally self-critical. And it's natural for a woman to want to look her best. As long as you keep a healthy perspective, you're in great shape!</div>
