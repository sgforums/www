Like other vehicles and even pedestrians, it must pull to the side of the road to let the emergency vehicles pass. Our answer comes from Bill Madison, a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles.<br><br>Everyone else we queried thought the question was unique, to say the least.<br><br>"That's about the craziest thing I've ever heard," said an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. "I don't even know how people have time to think about stuff like that."<br><br>Undaunted, we pressed on.<br><br>"OK," a California Highway Patrol officer said in a tone that suggested he didn't take the question seriously.<br><br>Finally, Madison responded. "The mail truck is not even in the running, unless the guy is a complete idiot," he said.4<br>A similary query posed by us to the United States Postal Service produced the reply that the USPS was also unaware of any laws granting mail trucks right of way status.<br><br>Okay, so if the mail truck doesn't have the right of way, then who does? "Street Smart" also provided an answer to this from a California DMV spokesman:<br>. . . once the mail truck is safely to the side of the road, the question becomes trickier. Madison speculated that dispatchers would solve the situation before it arose. If they did not, he said it would make sense for the police car to go first and then the firetruck. The ambulance would go last, he said, because if "five seconds makes a difference, you probably aren't going to save the guy anyway."4<br>We have to wonder about that answer. If five seconds makes a difference, the fire department probably isn't going to save the burning building, and the police probably aren't to catch the fleeing criminal either.<br><br>A couple of weeks after the "Street Smart" article, another astute Los Angeles Times reader provided his own answer:<br>I am glad that it was established that the mail truck would not even be in the running, but I am disappointed that it was not pointed out that Section 21806 of the California Vehicle Code makes that clear.<br><br>Section 21800 answers the question of which of the remaining three vehicles has the right of way. To make it short, the vehicle to the left of the mail truck has the right of way.<br><br>Since everybody has to yield to the vehicle on his right, whoever sees the mail truck on his right gets to go first.<br><br>Easy, huh?<br></div>
