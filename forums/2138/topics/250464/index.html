            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Hope you all don't mind I post this here... I saw the thread on "Am I A Fireman Yet? " . I think this story also quite nice so I decide to share it with you all <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes, in the way other people treat that child."Then he told the following story:<br><br>Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked,"Do you think they'll let me play?" Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his<br>son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.<br><br>Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play, not expecting much. The boy looked around for guidance and said, "We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning." color=black size=4&gt;<br><br>Shay struggled over to the team's bench put on a team shirt with a broad smile and his Father had a small tear in his eye and warmth in his heart. The boys saw the father's joy at his son being accepted.  In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his<br>father waved to him from the stands. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.<br><br>At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible 'cause Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.<br><br>However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognizing the other team putting winning aside for this moment in Shay's life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact.  The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.<br><br>The game would now be over, but the pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.<br><br>Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the head of the first baseman, out of reach of all team mates.  Everyone from the stands and both teams started yelling, "Shay, run to first! Run to first!" Never in his life had Shay ever ran that far but made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.<br><br>Everyone yelled, "Run to second, run to second!" size=2&gt;<br><br>Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to second base. By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball, the smallest guy on their team, who had a chance to be the hero for his team for the first time.  He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and he too intentionally threw<br>the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head. Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.<br><br>All were screaming, "Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay"<br><br>Shay reached third base, the opposing shortstop ran to help him and turned him in the direction of third base, and shouted, "Run to third! Shay, run to third" As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams and those watching were on their feet were screaming, "Shay, run home! Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the "grand slam" and won the game for his team.<br><br>That day,<br>said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world.<br><br>Shay didn't make it to another summer and died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making his Father so happy and coming home and seeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the<br>day!<br><br>AND, NOW A LITTLE FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY: We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people think twice about sharing. The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools and workplaces.<br><br><strong>A wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats it's least fortunate amongst them.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really love the verse "Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay". If you fall for somebody don't pretend that it didn't matter. Love is something that can't you can afford to have mind games. Quickly tell your love, you love him/her so.<br><br>Tree<br><br>The reason I'm called tree is because I'm good at painting trees. Overtime I start to use a tree on the right hand corner as a trademark for all my watercolors painting. I have dated 5 gals when I was in Pre-U. There's one gal who I love a lot but never dare go after her. She doesn't have a pretty face, doesn't have a good figure, doesn't have outstanding charm. She is just a very ordinary gal. I like her. I really like her. Like her innocent, like her frankness. Like her cuteness, like her intelligence and her fragility. Reason for not going after her is because I felt somebody so ordinary like her is not a good match for me. I'm also afraid that after we are together all the good feelings will vanish. I'm also afraid other's gossips will hurt her. I felt that if she's my gal, she will be mine ultimately &amp; I don't have to give up everything just for her. The last reason, made her accompany me for 3 years. She watch me chase after gals, and I have make her heart cry for 3 years. She wants to be a good actress and I'm a very demanding director. When I kissed my 2nd girlfriend, she bumped into us. She was embarrassed but smile &amp; say "Go on!" before running off. The next day, her eyes was swollen like a walnut. I purposely didn't want to think about what causes her to cry but laugh at her the whole day. When everybody go back home, she was alone crying in the classroom. She didn't know that I returned from soccer training to get something. I watch her cry for an hour or so. My 4th girlfriend didn't like her. There was once when both of them quarreled. I know that based on her character she's not the type that will start off the quarrel. But I still sided with my girlfriend. I shouted at her and her eyes was filled shocked. I didn't care about her feelings and walked off with my girlfriend. The next day, she still laugh &amp; joke with me like nothing has ever happened. I know that she's very hurt but she didn't know that my heart ache is as bad as hers.<br><br>When I broke up with my 5th girlfriend, I asked her out. After going out for a day, I told her that I have something to tell her. She told me that coincidentally, she has something to tell me too. I told her about my break up and she told me about her getting together. I know whose the guy. He has been going after her for quite a while. A very cute guy full of energy, lively and interesting. His pursuit for her has been the talk of the school. I can't show her my heart ache but could only smile &amp; congratulate her. When I reach home, the heart ache is so strong that I can't stand it. It's like a heavy weighted stone on my chest. I couldn't breath. Wanted to shout but can't. Tears rolled down &amp; I broke down &amp; cry. How many times have I seen her cry for the man that doesn't acknowledge her presence too.<br><br>During graduation, I read a sms in my hp. It was send 10 days ago when I broke down and cry. I haven't read it since then. It says "Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay"... ...<br><br>Leaf<br><br>During Pre-U days, I like to collect leaves. Why? Because I felt that for a leaf to leave the tree she has been relying on for so long it takes a lot of courage. During the 3 years of Pre-U I was on very close terms with a guy. Not BGR kind but as buddy kind. But when he had his 1st girlfriend, I learnt a feeling I never should have learnt - Jealousy. The sourness in the heart can't be describe by using a lemon. It's like 100 rotten sour lemon. Sourness to the extreme limit. They were only together for 2 mths. When they broke up, I hide my strong sense of happiness. But after a mth, he got together with another gal. I like him &amp; I know he like me. But why won't he pursue me? Since he love me why he doesn't want to make the first move?<br>Whenever he had a new girlfriend, my heart would hurt. Time after time, my heart was hurt. I begin to suspect that this is a one sided love. If he don't like he, why does he treat me so well. It's beyond what you will normally do for a friend. Liking a person is very heart wrenching. I can know his likes, his habits. But his feelings towards me I can never figure out. You can't expect me a gal to ask him right?<br><br>Despite that, I still want to be by his side. Care for him, accompany him, love him. Hoping that one fine day, he will come &amp; love me. It's like waiting for his phone call every night, wanting him to send me sms. I know that no matter how busy he is, he will make time for me. Because of this, I waited for him. The 3 years were the hardest to go through &amp; I really want<br>to give up. Sometimes, I wonder should I continue waiting. The pain and hurt, the dilemma accompany me for 3 years. Till the end of my 3rd year, a 2nd year junior begins to go after me. Everyday he pursuit me relentlessly. From outright rejection to a point in time when I felt that I'm willing to let him have a small footing in my heart. He's like a warm &amp; gentle wind, trying to blow a leaf away from the tree. In the end, I realized that I didn't want to give this wind a small footing in my heart. I know this wind will bring this badly battered leave far away &amp; better land. Finally I left tree, but the tree only smile &amp; didn't ask me to stay. Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay... ... ...<br><br>Wind<br><br>Because I like a gal called leaf. Because she's so dependent on tree so I have to be a gust wind. A wind that will blow her away. When I first met her, it was 1 mth after I transfer to the new school. I saw a petite person looking at my seniors &amp; me playing soccer. During ECA time, she will always be sitting there. Be it alone or with her friends looking at him. When he talks with gals there's jealousy in her eyes. When he looked at her, there's a smile in her eyes. Looking at her became my habit. Just like she likes to look at him. One day, she didn't appear. I felt something amissed. I can't explain the feeling except it's a kind of uneasiness. The senior was also not there as well. I went to their classroom, hid outside and saw my senior scolding her. Tears were in her eyes while he left. The next day, I saw her at her usual place, looking at him. I walked over and smiled to her. Took out a note &amp; gave to her. She was surprised. She looked at me, smiled &amp; accept the note. The next day, she appeared &amp; pass me a note and left.<br><br>Leaf's heart is too heavy and wind couldn't blow her away. It's not that leaf heart is too heavy. It because leaf never want to leave tree. I replied her note with this statement and slowly she started to talk to me &amp; accept my presents &amp; phone calls. I know that the person she loves is not me. But I have this perseverance that one day I will make her like me. Within 4 mths, I have declared my love for her no less than 20 times. Every time, she will divert away from the topic. But I never give up. If I decide I want her to be mine, I will definitely use all means to win her over. I can't remember how many times I have declared my love to her.<br><br>Although I know she will try to divert but I still bear a small ray of hope. Hoping that she will agree to me my girlfriend. I didn't hear any reply from her over the phone. I asked "what are you doing? How come you didn't want to reply?" She said, "I'm nodding my head". "Ah?" I couldn't believe my ears. "I'm nodding my head" She replied loudly. I hang up the phone, quickly changed and took a taxi and rush to her place &amp; press her door bell. During the moment when she opens the door. I hugged her tightly.<br>Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her<br>to stay... ... ...<br><br>If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money<br>can't buy... ... ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good mood and always has something positive to say.<br><br>When someone would ask him how he was doing, would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!"<br><br>He was a natural motivator.<br><br>If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.<br><br>Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Michael and asked him, "I don't get it! You can't be a positive person<br>all of the time. How do you do it?"<br><br>Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say to myself, you have two choices today.<br><br>You can choose to be in a good mood or ... you can choose to be in a bad mood.<br><br>I choose to be in a good mood.<br><br>Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or ... I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it.<br><br>Every time someone comes to me<br>complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or... I can point out the positive side of life.  Choose the positive side of life.<br><br>"Yeah, right, it's not that easy," I protested. "Yes, it is," Michael said.<br><br>"Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood.<br><br>The bottom line: It's your choice how you live your life."<br><br>I reflected on what Michael said. Soon thereafter, I left the Tower Industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it.<br><br>Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a serious accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.<br><br>After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Michael was released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.<br><br>I saw Michael about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna see my scars?"<br><br>I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone through his mind as the accident took place.<br><br>"The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my soon to be born daughter," Michael replied. "Then, as I lay on the ground, I  remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or .. I could choose to die. I chose to live."<br><br>"Weren't you scared? Did you lose\ consciousness?" I asked.<br><br>Michael continued, "...the paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared.  In their eyes, I read "he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take action."<br><br>"What did you do?" I asked.<br><br>"Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me," said Michael.  "She asked if I was allergic to anything.  "Yes, I replied." The doctors and nurses stopped working as<br>they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, "Gravity."<br><br>Over their laughter, I told them, "I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead."<br><br>"Michael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully.<br><br>Attitude, after all, is everything.  "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.. Each day has enough trouble of its own." After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.<br></div>
