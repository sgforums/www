Some years later, they chatted after having dinner together. They discussed the gifts they were able to give their elderly mother who lived far away in another city.<br><br>The first said, "I had a big house built for Mama."<br><br>The second said, "I had a hundred thousand dollar theatre built in the house."<br><br>The third said, "I had my Mercedes dealer deliver an SL600 to her."<br><br>The fourth said, "You know how Mama loved reading the Bible and you know she can't read anymore because she can't see very well. I met this preacher who told me about a parrot that can recite the entire Bible. It took twenty preachers 12 years to teach him. I had to pledge to contribute $100,000 a year for twenty years to the church, but it was worth it. Mama just has to name the chapter and verse and the parrot will recite it."<br><br>The other brothers were impressed. After the holidays Mom sent out her Thank You notes.<br><br>She wrote:<br>"Milton, the house you built is so huge. I live in only one room, but I have to clean the whole house. Thanks anyway."<br><br>"Marvin, I am too old to travel. I stay home and I have my groceries delivered, so I never use the Mercedes. The thought was good. Thanks."<br><br>"Michael, you gave me an expensive theatre with Dolby sound. It could hold 50 people, but all of my friends are dead, I've lost my hearing and I'm nearly blind. I'll never use it. Thank you for the gesture just the same."<br><br>"Dearest Melvin, you were the only son to have the good sense to give a little thought to your gift. The chicken was delicious. Thank you."<br><br>Love<br>Mama<br><br>3 very tired backpackers checked into an inn late one night. They were told that the inn was already full and there was only a small room with a queen sized bed to offer. Since there were no other nearby inns around and they were too exhausted to look elsewhere, the 3 of them agreed to share the bed among themselves for the night.<br><br>The next day, the man that slept on the left side said to the other two ," You know, I had a very weird dream last nite ! I dreamt that I was having a wank ! ".<br><br>The man that slept on the right replied, "Hey, me too ! I dreamt that I was having a wank as well. Very weird !".<br><br>Then the guy in the center shook his head and said, "Shame on you two, having dreams like that. I had a normal dream. I dreamt that I went skiing ... "<br><br>A passenger plane on a cross-country trip runs into a terrible storm. The plane gets pounded by rain, hail, wind and lightning. The passengers are screaming. They are sure the plane is going to crash and that they are all going to die. At the height of the storm, a young woman jumps up and exclaims, "I can't take this anymore! I can't just sit here and die like an animal, strapped into a chair. If I am going to die, let me at least die feeling like a woman. Is there anyone here man enough to make me feel like woman?" She sees a hand raise in the back, and a muscular man starts to walk up to her seat.<br><br>As he approaches her, he takes off his shirt. She can see the man's muscles even in the poor lighting of the plane. He stands in front of her, shirt in hand and says to her, "I can make you feel like a woman before you die. Are you interested?" Eagerly, she shakes her head and exclaims, "Yes!" The man hands her his shirt and says, "Here, iron this."<br></div>
