              <div><br>A man sat at a metro station in 
              Washington DC and started to play the<br>violin; it was a cold January morning. 
              He played six Bach pieces for about<br>45 minutes. During that time, since it 
              was rush hour, it was calculated that<br>thousand of people went through the 
              station, most of them on their way to<br>work.<br><br>Three minutes went by and 
              a middle aged man noticed there was musician<br>playing. He slowed his pace and 
              stopped for a few seconds and then hurried<br>up to meet his schedule.<br><br>A 
              minute later, the violinist received his first dollar tip: a woman threw<br>the 
              money in the till and without stopping continued to walk.<br><br>A few minutes 
              later, someone leaned against the wall to listen to him, but<br>the man looked 
              at his watch and started to walk again. Clearly he was late<br>for 
              work.<br><br>The one who paid the most attention was a 3 year old boy. His 
              mother tagged<br>him along, hurried but the kid stopped to look at the 
              violinist. Finally the<br>mother pushed hard and the child continued to walk 
              turning his head all the<br>time. This action was repeated by several other 
              children. All the parents,<br>without exception, forced them to move 
              on.<br><br>In the 45 minutes the musician played, only 6 people stopped and 
              stayed for<br>a while. About 20 gave him money but continued to walk their 
              normal pace. He<br>collected $32. When he finished playing and silence took 
              over, no one<br>noticed it. No one applauded, nor was there any 
              recognition.<br><br>No one knew this but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of 
              the best<br>musicians in the world. He played one of the most intricate pieces 
              ever<br>written, with a violin worth 3.5 million dollars.<br><br>Two days before 
              his playing in the subway, tickets for Joshua Bell's<br>performance at a theater 
              in Boston were sold out and the seats averaged<br>$100.<br><br>This is a real 
              story. Joshua Bell playing incognito in the metro station was<br>organized by 
              the Washington Post as part of an social experiment about<br>perception, taste 
              and priorities of people. The outlines were: in a<br>commonplace environment at 
              an inappropriate hour: Do we perceive beauty? Do<br>we stop to appreciate it? Do 
              we recognize the talent in an unexpected<br>context?<br><br>One of the possible 
              conclusions from this experience could be: If we do not<br>have a moment to stop 
              and listen to one of the best musicians in the world<br>playing the best music 
              ever written, how many other things are we 
              missing...?<br></div>
