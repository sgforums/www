What a treat would it be now, all these years later, to reacquaint ourselves with that treasure advisor, to learn again those lessons he or she shared when we were young. Mitch Albom was given that opportunity. He spent several months regularly visiting his college professor, Morrie Schwartz, during the elder man's final year of life. Tuesdays with Morrie is Albom's best-selling tribute to the man who gave him so much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>people, I would like to introduce a new book by the infamous vampire novelist aka ANNE RICE and her new book companied by new directions in literature....<br>2005's CHRIST THE LORD: OUT OF EGYPT.<br><br>`Christ of the Lord: Out of Egypt' by Anne Rice tells the story of a seven-year old Jesus who moves to Narzareth after leaving Egypt. Based on the gospels and the scholarship of the New Testament, the novel is told from the perspective of the young Jesus character himself, and from it, one is provided with the capacity to discern the true nature of various aspects of his life relative to his life, ranging from to labor divisions to issues of personal privacy.<br><br>Unfortunately, I'm not able to get it yet.. seems it's not available in singapore even though it has been released in the states</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Chrysalids<br>by John Wyndham<br><br>It is some time hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of years after an atomic war shattered civilization and left large parts of the world uninhabitable. Among the rural people of what used to be Newfoundland, the danger of mutation has led to a strict and ruthless definition of what constitutes humanity. Any deviation from the norm is considered an abomination. If livestock, it is slaughtered. Humans are banished to the barbarous lands known as the Fringes.<br><br>David Strorm is a young boy being raised by a religious-zealot father who takes the commandments against mutation even more seriously than his society requires. Dad is such a meanie that when his sister-in-law appears, begging for the life of a baby whose mutation she considers slight, he banishes her from his sight with a loud ringing sermon about her wickedness. David, a secret telepath who shares thought-communication with several others his own age, knows his survival depends on his father never being allowed to find out what he is.<br><br>One day in early childhood, David meets a young girl named Sophie, and discovers she's hiding an extra toe. He likes her, so he promises to keep her secret. Her fate provides him a stern warning about what might be his own.<br><br>Then his younger sister Petra is bornÂ—and she has a mutation so powerful it endangers David and his telepath friends ...</div>

Not captivating enuff to keep mi hooked on, hence I spent almost three months on this book...<br><br>Anyway, here are some reviews on this book:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The San Diego Tribune</span>: "The first person narrator is Olivia and her unrelenting nemesis from childhood on her half sister, Kwan Li... Its Kwan's haunting predictions, her implementation of the secret senses, and her linking of the present with the past that causes this novel to shimmer with meaning..."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">USA Today</span>: "Amy Tan is a wonderful story-teller, and the story's many strand - Olivia's childhood, her courtship and marriage, Kwan's ghost stories and village tales - propel the work to its climictic but bittersweet end."</div>
