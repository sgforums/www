              <p>This is a very easy game. There is a few trick to it.</p>
              <p> A very long post, coz this is one of my stress realse game. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>In the world map,</p>
              <p>1) choose to attack those bigger map. Reason is on bigger map, there is more
                          resources and AI will have 2 or 3 base. Meaning 2or3 computer player vs you.
                          The bigger map oso mean that they can have enough resource to support more then
                          3players. AI give u a handicap if you attack them early on, meaning instead of
                          2 or 3 base, they will only have one.</p>
              <p>To deal with 2 or 3 base, u need a resonable large initial start off strike
                          force, the honoury guard. At start, while multitasking the base  building,
                          rush all ur force
                          to one of the their base and kill it off. Which can be done in a mere 5to10min
                          into the game.</p>
              <p>2)Try attacking map that give off honoury guard 1st. Coz honoury guard are
                          stronger and arent include into the population cap.</p>
              <p>3) The only hard map that give in game bonus are the one that call the last
                          stand or something where u cant make unit and have to destroy 3 computer player
                          (Orge). One way to win this will be to have alot of honoury guard. The others
                          is to rush the base and forego capturing of lookout pt. (just 2 or 3 will do).
                          Computer start off with limited unit, so if u push early in the game and wipe
                          out 1or2 base early, u will most likely win. The necron truely shine in this
                          map. It 2 main strongest unit can teleport. At start teleport it into the computer
                          base, and b4 u know it. 1 base is gone. Elder is the hardest to play in this
                          map. Coz they need energy to replace most of their unit, &amp; basic unti kinda
                          die too easy.</p>
              <p>4) The space port is the other hard map. Best to attack it 1/2 way thru the
                          game. at start, just move ur
                          strike unit to the bottom to kill off one computer player. Make sure u fun let
                          any builder escape.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the RTS map</p>
              <p>1) You can forget abt place unit to guard those map you had conqure eariler
                          coz, all the building that had been build remain even after you won. So in
                          short, b4 u win, make sure u have 2 or 3 base fully build. I normally build 2nd
                          or 3 base very near to computer spawn area. This make defending easy and fast.
                          U need to atleast defend 5 time to gain an upgrade to ur heros. I think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) reason of build more then one base is to rise ur energy building cap. 6max per base.
                          Beside, base oso give 6max turret. except neron 4max. and ogre unlimited. This
                          oso help kill the computer faster when defending.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unit wise.</p>
              <p>For elder, they are more fun to play, but think the weakest among all. Elder
                          can be rather irritating to play, coz they r either very slow or fast but do
                          little damage. Since there is only 2 main type of damage, anti troop or vehicle/building.
                          Just divide your troop into 2 big gp. 1 shortcut key for each. so Juz focus
                          attack on one unit to the next. For anti troop, i only build wap spider mainly.
                          best coz they move at normal pace and can teleport. Their bomb do come in handy.
                          Alot of damage. If cap is reach for the unit. think it is 3, i will build one
                          dark reaper.</p>
              <p>for anti vehicle, i get 2 (cant rem the name) of those orange super short
                          range, but large gun. Normally put them on speed, coz of their range, take ages
                          to even hit the enemy if not. I dun build alot coz most vehicle are anti vehicle.</p>
              <p>I tend to skip those weapon platform. Too much work, esp when u gp them with
                          troop unit. I only go for 2 vehicle unit, namely those walker and prism (Main
                          unit, 2max)</p>
              <p>Walker coz
                          they deal out alot of melee damage, cheap to build, abit weak and die rather
                          fast. Prism is irritating to enemy if used correctly. It break up formation,
                          rending them unable to attack. So if u use it enemy, make sure to put all ur troop on shooting
                          stand, meaning no melee even when close. That is when the combo of walker and
                          prism come in. Walker
                          are vehicle, hence wont get thrown back, so this mean it get to wack the enemy
                          when they are in disarray. Prism keep the troop lying on the ground.</p>
              <p>The sniper, well those are a gd support unit. one is more then enough, but
                          since there is 2 such unit in the strike guard, i dun normally get them. They
                          dun do damage or kill at all, but they have super long range, hence put them on
                          shooting stand, since they r invisible, u can really leave them alone, for they
                          dun really get kill. But the morale damage they coz really shine. Afew shot
                          from them, u see enemy morale drop to zero, they break and run ard like fools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For tal</p>
              <p>This is a very fun and easy unit to play with. 1st of all, dun go machine path.
                          Cant rem the name.. but build a kal commander post or smt that allow u to build
                          T-rax. T-rax not really great, but can take an awful lot of punishment. Their
                          stealth unit r only good at capturing lookout pt. or if u upgrade them to anti vehicle,
                          they actually fair better. esp their EMP. Very useful to have.</p>
              <p>unit to build is those nasty dog. They are a troop killer. They r fast and
                          keep the enemy troop busy in melee. hence cant shoot back. can take load of hit
                          too. 2max.</p>
              <p>next is there regular super long range fire warriors. Those are a must have.
                          which make the bulk of ur
                          army. 4~5 is will shred the enemy in no time. But i keep it to 3 to prolong the
                          game. Remember to increase their damage and since they have like 8 in a gp, (i
                          get 2 addon unit rather then shield, unless IMO since they out range most other
                          unit. and i forget to turn it on 90% of the time) Pathfinder, they are useless.
                          But they are the only unit to see invisible enemy unit. But i use the
                          commander(hero) to do that. hence my 1st gear is tat ability to see stealth
                          unit. Pathfinder, low damage and short range.</p>
              <p>the other troop to get is those predator like unit that can heal themselves
                          by cannibalize. Those are a tone down version of the dog. But there is like
                          10or 12 in a gp. Take an awful long time to even kill of one unit of those.
                          Very gd at disrupting the enemy troop formation.</p>
              <p>Vehicle unit to get, there is that giant ape like thingy, get those till u
                          hit the vehicle cap. Those are like unstoppable tank. They do melee too. But
                          rem to leave 5 vehicle cap for ur
                          t-rax.</p>
              <p>The reason why tie is so easy to play is b'coz their tanker unit are really
                          powerful and can take alot of hit. Even their weaker tanker have numbers to
                          make up for it. Which they can produce faster then u can kill them. Add that to
                          their super long range shooter, the shooter can stay at a safe distance and
                          concentrate their shot.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The tactic to win a dog fight is simple.</p>
              <p>To win a dog fight, always send in ur
                          melee to prevent their shooter form firing effectively. Then use ur shooter to pick off
                          their unit one at a time. Concentrate ur
                          hit one unit then move on to the next.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>This is a very easy game. There is a few trick to it.</p>
              <p> A very long post, coz this is one of my stress realse game. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>In the world map,</p>
              <p>1) choose to attack those bigger map. Reason is on bigger map, there is more resources and AI will have 2 or 3 base. Meaning 2or3 computer player vs you. The bigger map oso mean that they can have enough resource to support more then 3players. AI give u a handicap if you attack them early on, meaning instead of 2 or 3 base, they will only have one.</p>
              <p>To deal with 2 or 3 base, u need a resonable large initial start off strike force, the honoury guard. At start, while multitasking the base  building, rush all ur force to one of the their base and kill it off. Which can be done in a mere 5to10min into the game.</p>
              <p>2)Try attacking map that give off honoury guard 1st. Coz honoury guard are stronger and arent include into the population cap.</p>
              <p>3) The only hard map that give in game bonus are the one that call the last stand or something where u cant make unit and have to destroy 3 computer player (Orge). One way to win this will be to have alot of honoury guard. The others is to rush the base and forego capturing of lookout pt. (just 2 or 3 will do). Computer start off with limited unit, so if u push early in the game and wipe out 1or2 base early, u will most likely win. The necron truely shine in this map. It 2 main strongest unit can teleport. At start teleport it into the computer base, and b4 u know it. 1 base is gone. Elder is the hardest to play in this map. Coz they need energy to replace most of their unit, &amp; basic unti kinda die too easy.</p>
              <p>4) The space port is the other hard map. Best to attack it 1/2 way thru the game. at start, just move ur strike unit to the bottom to kill off one computer player. Make sure u fun let any builder escape.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the RTS map</p>
              <p>1) You can forget abt place unit to guard those map you had conqure eariler coz, all the building that had been build remain even after you won. So in short, b4 u win, make sure u have 2 or 3 base fully build. I normally build 2nd or 3 base very near to computer spawn area. This make defending easy and fast. U need to atleast defend 5 time to gain an upgrade to ur heros. I think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) reason of build more then one base is to rise ur energy building cap. 6max per base. Beside, base oso give 6max turret. except neron 4max. and ogre unlimited. This oso help kill the computer faster when defending.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unit wise.</p>
              <p>For elder, they are more fun to play, but think the weakest among all. Elder can be rather irritating to play, coz they r either very slow or fast but do little damage. Since there is only 2 main type of damage, anti troop or vehicle/building. Just divide your troop into 2 big gp. 1 shortcut key for each. so Juz focus attack on one unit to the next. For anti troop, i only build wap spider mainly. best coz they move at normal pace and can teleport. Their bomb do come in handy. Alot of damage. If cap is reach for the unit. think it is 3, i will build one dark reaper.</p>
              <p>for anti vehicle, i get 2 (cant rem the name) of those orange super short range, but large gun. Normally put them on speed, coz of their range, take ages to even hit the enemy if not. I dun build alot coz most vehicle are anti vehicle.</p>
              <p>I tend to skip those weapon platform. Too much work, esp when u gp them with troop unit. I only go for 2 vehicle unit, namely those walker and prism (Main unit, 2max)</p>
              <p>Walker coz they deal out alot of melee damage, cheap to build, abit weak and die rather fast. Prism is irritating to enemy if used correctly. It break up formation, rending them unable to attack. So if u use it enemy, make sure to put all ur troop on shooting stand, meaning no melee even when close. That is when the combo of walker and prism come in. Walker are vehicle, hence wont get thrown back, so this mean it get to wack the enemy when they are in disarray. Prism keep the troop lying on the ground.</p>
              <p>The sniper, well those are a gd support unit. one is more then enough, but since there is 2 such unit in the strike guard, i dun normally get them. They dun do damage or kill at all, but they have super long range, hence put them on shooting stand, since they r invisible, u can really leave them alone, for they dun really get kill. But the morale damage they coz really shine. Afew shot from them, u see enemy morale drop to zero, they break and run ard like fools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For tal</p>
              <p>This is a very fun and easy unit to play with. 1st of all, dun go machine path. Cant rem the name.. but build a kal commander post or smt that allow u to build T-rax. T-rax not really great, but can take an awful lot of punishment. Their stealth unit r only good at capturing lookout pt. or if u upgrade them to anti vehicle, they actually fair better. esp their EMP. Very useful to have.</p>
              <p>unit to build is those nasty dog. They are a troop killer. They r fast and keep the enemy troop busy in melee. hence cant shoot back. can take load of hit too. 2max.</p>
              <p>next is there regular super long range fire warriors. Those are a must have. which make the bulk of ur army. 4~5 is will shred the enemy in no time. But i keep it to 3 to prolong the game. Remember to increase their damage and since they have like 8 in a gp, (i get 2 addon unit rather then shield, unless IMO since they out range most other unit. and i forget to turn it on 90% of the time) Pathfinder, they are useless. But they are the only unit to see invisible enemy unit. But i use the commander(hero) to do that. hence my 1st gear is tat ability to see stealth unit. Pathfinder, low damage and short range.</p>
              <p>the other troop to get is those predator like unit that can heal themselves by cannibalize. Those are a tone down version of the dog. But there is like 10or 12 in a gp. Take an awful long time to even kill of one unit of those. Very gd at disrupting the enemy troop formation.</p>
              <p>Vehicle unit to get, there is that giant ape like thingy, get those till u hit the vehicle cap. Those are like unstoppable tank. They do melee too. But rem to leave 5 vehicle cap for ur t-rax.</p>

              <p>If anyone is playing the Ork, there is bug there that u might wanna explore. The Ork population cap is reset everytime u reload the game. It is fix in the patch. SO if urs is still the version 1, u can have a unlimited ork horde.</p>
              <p>One more tips abt orks is that their population count is base on individual troopper rather then a unit on a whole. So it is wiser to build more unit with smaller tropper count then lesser unit of large troopper count. Reson is that in every unit, the troop upgrade is limit to like 4 in a unit for shooter and slurge. Beside, u get more unit leader, which r stronger.</p>
