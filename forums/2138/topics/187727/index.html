            <div class='col-md body'>When I was young, I have two friends who were very close to each other.<br>They played with each other everyday. It was like, if you see A, you<br>would see B next to him. They were always together.<br><br>A loved fried eggs. Whenever he went out for lunch or dinner , without<br>fail, he would ask for fried egg on top of his noodles, fried rice, etc.<br><br>One day, A involved in an accident and died.<br><br>B was devastated. B went to the cemetery to pray everyday.<br>He would go<br>to the nearest restaurant and ta pao a box of fried rice with an egg on<br>top to be offered to A when he went to pray to him.<br><br>The next day, he opened the box and there was no egg inside!<br>B was petrified. He thought, must be A who came and took the fried egg<br>away.<br><br>The same thing happened the next day and the day after that.<br><br>B was confused. So, one day, he asked the chef to make the same fried<br>rice with a fried egg again. Then, he went to the cemetery to offer it<br>to A. Curious, he opened the box to check for the egg. He was angry to<br>find that, there was no fried egg in the box after all.<br><br>Feeling that he had been cheated, he went back to the restaurant and<br>demanded to see the Chef. "Where is the fried egg?? I told you there<br>must be a fried egg inside!! You have cheated me for a few days now!<br>Gimme back my money!!"<br><br>Then, the Chef got really angry and opened the box - the fried egg was<br>inside the box.<br><br>The<br>Chef said, "Stupid! You open the box upside down. No wonder you cannot<br>see the egg!!"<br><br>_______________________________________________________________________<br><br>When I was young, I went to town to work with a group of friends during<br>our summer holidays of two months. Being young and away from home for<br>the first time, we drank and smoke like nobody's business.<br><br>One night, we were pissed drunk and flagged the last bus down to go<br>home.<br><br>Being tired, we slept in the bus.<br><br>It had been awhile that I fell asleep. I was awake by the chilly wind. I<br>was shocked to find that there was no one in the bus, and I was the last<br>passenger. I looked in front to check out for the driver. But the driver<br>was no where in sight. Yet, the bus was moving.<br><br>I panicked shitless. I rubbed my eyes to make sure that I was not<br>dreaming. The night was dark and cold.<br><br>I hysterically jumped out from the bus and tried to run as hard as I<br>could to get away.<br><br>Then I heard someone yelled at me from<br>behind the bus.<br><br>"Hey! Don't run away! Come over here and help to push the bus!" yelled<br>the bus driver.<br><br>I saw my other friends helping to push the bus, which broke down while I<br>was asleep.<br></div>
