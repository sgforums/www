Your stress style follows the path of many steadfast folks: Think of the Brits with their "stiff upper lips," or the Germans with their cool-as-a-cucumber reserve. It amazes those who know you, but stress hardly seems to affect you. In fact, friends might even say you're oblivious to the tension in your life.<br><br>But being in denial about stress doesn't really make it go away. Small problems may seem to take care of themselves when ignored, but major life issues need attention to be resolved in a positive way. The next time you're faced with serious stress, pull your head out of the sand and try giving the situation your full attention for a change. You might be surprised to find that your coping skills are actually quite good Â— even if they're a little rusty.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i.emode.com/tests/stress/images/buddha_s.gif"><br>You're a Buddha. Eyes half-closed, a slight smile playing on your lips Â— you accept even the most stressful situations with ease. Nothing seems to surprise you. In fact, you may even tell people that you anticipated the problems you encounter. Stress happens, you might say, so why fight it?<br><br>Peacefulness takes you a long way toward handling stress, but there's more to it than the path of least resistance. Often, stress is a sign to take action, to make a change, or Â— at the very least Â— to get up and jump out of the way! Your placid pace could cause a bottleneck in the stress-processing plant, allowing problems to stick around much longer than necessary. Try moving a little faster the next time you're faced with a sticky situation, and see if you can't be cool and courageous at the same time.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're a Soother. When trouble strikes, you somehow seem to avoid being hit. Those around you may encounter crises, of course Â— which is when you launch into action. You're best at helping others ease their stress, offering a kind word or a well-timed "everything's going to be okay." You're a walking affirmation!<br><br>Of course, wearing a smile all the time can be exhausting. We're all only human, and stress happens to the best of us Â— including you. When you find yourself under stress, you may have to fight the tendency to shut off the phone, crawl under the blankets, and hide from the world. But it's worth it to show your true feelings, even when they're less than upbeat. Let the people you've nurtured in the past help you out in your time of need. You deserve the attention. And tomorrow is another day! So take it easy.<br><br></div>
