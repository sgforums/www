            <div class='col-md body'>I just think its sad why the girl thought about it this way.<br>The guy was being opportunistic...the girl thought that she could still get him back. But whoever is able to "monopolize" the situation will always have the upperhand advantage.<br><br>Usually, girls in these situations will just suffer depression at the end of everything while the guys just get free sex in exchange. Well, but you can't say its the guy's fault because she whether was unwilling/willing she did sleep with him on a regular basis.<br><br>I won't say this is worse than rape. Rape is by strangers and usually you get abused physically and mentally. This situation is just emotional abuse. So it's not worse than rape, its just that the girl doesn't know how to choose between the grey zones. She knew she was wrong but still she did it. She will just regret that part of her life when she looks back, she can choose to remember or forget and feign ignorance. Rape will cause permanent damage because you can never erase that part of your life.<br><br>So it's not worse than rape. Its just plain stupidity.</div>

But whoever is able to "monopolize" the situation will always have the upperhand advantage.<br><br>Usually, girls in these situations will just suffer depression at the end of everything while the guys just get free sex in exchange. Well, but you can't say its the guy's fault because she whether was unwilling/willing she did sleep with him on a regular basis.<br><br>I won't say this is worse than rape. Rape is by strangers and usually you get abused physically and mentally. This situation is just emotional abuse. So it's not worse than rape, its just that the girl doesn't know how to choose between the grey zones. She knew she was wrong but still she did it. She will just regret that part of her life when she looks back, she can choose to remember or forget and feign ignorance. Rape will cause permanent damage because you can never erase that part of your life.<br><br>So it's not worse than rape. Its just plain stupidity.</div></blockquote>agreed</div>
