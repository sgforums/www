            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 1 - Never walk without a document in your hands.</span><br><br>People with documents in their hands look like hardworking employees heading<br>for important meetings. People with nothing in their hands look like they're<br>heading for the cafeteria. People with a newspaper in their hand look like<br>they're heading for the toilet. Above all, make sure you carry loads of<br>stuff home with you at night, thus generating the false impression that you<br>work longer hours than you do.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 2 - Use computers to look busy.</span><br><br>Any time you use a computer, it looks like "work" to the casual observer.<br>You can send and receive personal e-mail, chat, and generally have a blast<br>without doing anything remotely related to work. These aren't exactly the<br>societal benefits that the proponents of the computer revolution would like<br>to talk about but they're not bad either. When you get caught by your boss<br>-- and you will get caught -- your best defence is to claim you're teaching<br>yourself to use new software, thus saving valuable training dollars.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 3 - Keep a messy desk.</span><br><br>Top management can get away with a clean desk. For the rest of us, it looks<br>like we're not working hard enough. Build huge piles of documents around<br>your workspace. To the observer, last year's work looks the same as today's<br>work; it's volume that counts. Pile them high and wide. If you know somebody<br>is coming to your cubicle, bury the document you'll need halfway down in an<br>existing stack and rummage for it when he/she arrives.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 4 - Use voice mail.</span><br><br>Never answer your phone if you have voice mail. People don't call you just<br>because they want to give you something for nothing -- they call because<br>they want you to do work for them. That's no way to live. Screen all your<br>calls through voice mail. If somebody leaves a voice-mail message for you<br>and it sounds like impending work, respond during lunch hour when you know<br>they're not there -- it looks like you're hardworking and conscientious even<br>though you're being a devious weasel.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 5 - Look impatient &amp; annoyed.</span><br><br>One should also always try to look impatient and annoyed to give your bosses<br>the impression that you are always busy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 6 - Leave the office late.</span><br><br>Always leave the office late, especially when the boss is still around. You<br>could read magazines and storybooks that you always wanted to read but have<br>no time until late before leaving. Make sure you walk past the boss' room on<br>your way out. Send important e-mail at unearthly hours (e.g. 9:35 p.m., 7:05<br>a.m., etc.) and during public holidays.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 7 - Use sighing for effect.</span><br><br>Sigh loudly when there are many people around, giving the impression that<br>you are under extreme pressure.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 8 - Opt for the stacking strategy.</span><br><br>It is not enough to pile lots of documents on the table. Put lots of books<br>on the floor etc. (thick computer manuals are the best).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 9 - Build your vocabulary.</span><br><br>Read up on some computer magazines and pick out all the jargon and new<br>products. Use the phrases freely when in conversation with bosses. Remember;<br>they don't have to understand what you say, but you sure sound impressive.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule No. 10 - Don't get caught.</span><br><br>MOST IMPORTANT: Don't forward this to your boss by mistake!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
