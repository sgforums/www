            <div class='col-md body'>I dun believe its juz so simple... otherwise many wouldnt have died... i'm not sure, anyone tried this before??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>i received this from an email dis morning anywayz...<br><br><strong>'Needles Can Save The Life Of A Stroke Patient'</strong><br><br>Keep a syringe or needle in your home to do this... It's amazing and an<br>unconventional way of recovering from stroke, read it through it can help<br>somebody 1 day.<br><br>This is amazing, if it works. Please keep this very handy... Excellent tips.<br>Do take a minute to read this. You'll never know. One's life may depend on<br>you.<br><br>My father was paralyzed and later died from the result of a stroke. I wish I<br>knew about this first aid before.<br><br>When stroke strikes, the capillaries in the brain will gradually burst. When<br>a stroke occurs, stay calm. No matter where the victim is, do not move<br>him/her. Because, if moved, the capillaries will burst. Help the victim to<br>sit up where h e is to prevent him from falling over again, and then the<br>bloodletting can begin.<br><br>If you have in your home an injection syringe that would be the best,<br>otherwise, a sewing needle or a straight pin will do. Place the needle/pin<br>over fire to sterilize it, and then use it to prick the tip of all 10<br>fingers. There are no specific acupuncture points, just prick about an mm<br>from the fingernail. Prick till blood comes out. If blood does not start to<br>drip, then squeeze with your fingers.<br><br>When all 10 digits is bleeding, wait a few minutes then the victim will<br>regain consciousness.<br><br>If the victim's mouth is crooked, then pull on his ears until they are red.<br>Then prick each ear lobe twice until two drops of blood comes from each ear<br>lobe. After a few minutes the victim should regain consciousness.<br><br>Wait till the victim regain his normal state without any abnormal symptoms<br>then take him to the hospital, otherwise, if he was taken in the ambulance<br>in a hurry to the hospital, the bumpy trip will cause all the capillaries in<br>his brain to burst. If he could save his life, barely managing to walk, then<br>it is by the grace of his ancestors.<br><br>I learned about letting blood to save life from Chinese traditional doctor<br>Ha Bu-Ting who lives in Sun-Juke. Furthermore, I had practical experience<br>with it. Therefore I can say this method is 100% effective.<br><br>In 1979, I was teaching in Fung-Gaap College in Tai-Chung. One afternoon I<br>was teaching class when another teacher came running to my classroom and<br>said in panting, "Mr. Liu, come quick, our supervisor has had a stroke!"<br><br>I immediately went to the 3rd floor. When I saw our supervisor, Mr. Chen<br>Fu-Tien, his color was off, his speech was slurred, his mouth was<br>crooked-all the symptoms of a stroke.<br><br>I immediately asked one of the practicum students to go to the pharmacy<br>outside the school to buy a syringe, which I used to prick Mr. Chen's 10<br>fingers tips. When all 10 fingers were bleeding (each with a pea-sized drop<br>of blood), after a few minutes, Mr. Chen's face regained its color and his<br>eyes' spirit returned, too. But his mouth was still crooked.<br><br>So I pulled on his ears to fill them with blood. When his ears became red, I<br>pricked his right earlobe twice to let out 2 drops of blood. When both<br>earlobes had two drops of blood each, a miracle happened. Within 3-5 minutes<br>the shape of his mouth returned to normal and his speech became clear. We<br>let him rest for a while and have e a cup of hot tea, and then we   helped<br>him go down the stairs, drove him to Wei-Wah Hospital. He rested one night<br>and was released the next day to return to school to teach.<br><br>Everything worked normally. There were no ill after-effects. On the other<br>hand, the usual stroke victim usually suffers irreparable bursting of the<br>brain capillaries on the way to the hospital. As a result, these victims<br>never recover.<br><br>Therefore stroke is the second cause of death. The lucky ones will stay<br>alive but can remain paralyzed for life.<br><br>It is such a horrible thing to happen in one's life. If we can all remember<br>this bloodletting method and start the life-saving process immediately, in a<br>short time, the victim will be revived and regain 100% normality. We hope<br>you can tell others about this first aid method. By doing so, stroke may be<br>removed from the list of major causes of death.<br><br>Forward this after reading. It will be a good deed indeed. The greatest risk<br>is not taking one... Make a difference!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally don't believe any of it...<br><br>let's give you the background. a stroke is basically like a heart attack, only this one happens to the brain. the tissue is deprived of oxygen, and when that happens, it becomes damaged, and if it goes on long enough, it dies. that then leads to a loss of function controlled by that tissue.<br><br>strokes can generally be classified into two basic groups, ischemic or hemorraghic. an ischemic stroke happens when a blood vessel leading to the brain becomes partially or totally blocked, cutting off blood supply to the brain. this is the more common form of stroke and makes up about 90% of all stroke cases.<br><br>the end result of a hemorraghic stroke is basically the same as an ischemic.  the affected brain tissue is deprived of blood, this time, due to the fact that the blood vessels leading up to the brain having burst instead of becoming blocked. this can happen for a variety of reasons. this is a rarer form of stroke though, and is the more deadly of the two, the mortality rate is about 75%.<br><br>because of all this, i just can't see how pricking the ten fingers can help a stroke patient. also, the email got it wrong by bringing up the point of the patient's mouth being crooked. that happens only AFTER the stroke has occured, specifically about 12 to 24 hours after, and depending on severity of damage. also, capillaries don't rupture as easily as they say it does. besides, you need a lot of capillaries rupturing before you can get that kind of effect. the best thing to do if you think that someone is having a stroke or a heart attack is to get the person to a hospital IMMEDIATELY. the chances of surving such an attack deteriorates drastically once it's past the 1st hour since the onset of symptoms set in. so try your best to get the person into a hospital within the hour...<br><br>hope that helps... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
