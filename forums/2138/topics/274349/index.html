            <div class='col-md body'>since some of us are already discussing the scary encounters in Fairlady's Guide to 7th Month thread, we shall not interrupt the topic too much. That shall be a Facts guide for those who doesnt know the Dos and Donts.<br><br>Post here for ur encounters..<br><br>here's mine - happened two years ago during 7th month:<br><br>mi used to do recording projects overnyt in skool, two years ago. and there's this tym when mi and another two female students were taking a short break at the vending machine in skool, but we locked ourselves in the skool, locked all entrances, in case bad guys come in.<br><br>while we'r at the vending machine in skool when we heard someone trying to open the door knob of a studio in front of us, Studio 3. the studio is locked and there's definitely no one inside, but the sound is so obvious that someone is trying to open the door knob from inside!!!! nbz. super scary. and the best part is, we can see the studio from the glass window beside the door, and there's NO ONE LAH!! its juz dark and we dare not peep in closely in case there's a floating head looking back at us. or worse, headless. ok i'm imagining.<br><br>so finally we decide to run back to our studio, Studio 4, and hide there, but the only route back to our studio is: to pass by the huge glass window of studio 3, risking the possibility of seeing ghost. then we realised, its 2.45am.........<br><br>as we are discussing if we should get out of skool for tym being or walk back to studio, we heard the turning of the door knob getting louder and louder. damn. we'r scared stiff. anywayz, we cuddled and RAN back to our studio 4.<br><br>two of us fell asleep and one ger stayed up to finish up her mix-down (yes, thats our ex-moderator PrincessNezz). we woke around 5am and she told us that while we'r sleeping, there's this lady in translucent white standing right in front looking at us for a long tym. my friend saw it but pretended that she din knw din see it. Ugh. damn.<br><br>after we woke and she told us abt it, i realised i've got alot of horrible rash all over my body super itchy. saw doc and he said he suspect biten by bug but dunno wat bug it could be.<br><br>Eww. come to think of it i'm still scared.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last year I was touched in the hair. I was trying to sleep at around 9:30pm, lying on my right side, left side (back) facing the wall. Bed's head was against the other wall.<br><br>Then this stroking sensation, at my hair above my left ear, like fingers running thru hair. At first I stun for a while, wondering what that might be. Strangely I was calm, but freaked out and slept with the lights on til morning. I'm a member of a paranormal group, so I suppose I can accept such stuff to an extent without over reacting Wink<br><br>2nd night, happened again, this time lighter sensation, also while lying in bed.<br><br>3rd night, yet again, this time as I was doing my homework.Shocked This time just a slight touch.<br><br>I have a friend with the gift of spirit communication and third eye. Had to ask him to ask the spirit to leave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghost Story #1<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  When I was young, I lived in a deserted kampong deep in the<br>&gt; jungle.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Every night, my mother would ask me not to go home too late as<br>&gt; there<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; won't<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be any transportation after a certain time.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One night, before going home, I ta pao kueh teow soup for<br>supper. I<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; late and I waited for the taxi/bus but there was none. I was<br>&gt; getting<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; worried<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as the night was getting darker and darker. So I tried to flag<br>down<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; private<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vehicles to take me home.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There was no one stopping for me, till one motorcyclist took<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pity on<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me and stopped to give me a lift. He was a man with a kind face.<br>I<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; accepted<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his offer and got onto his motorbike.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On the way home, we would pass by a temple. At night, the temple<br>&gt; would<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; look<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; eerily spooky with the dim lights from the candles.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; At first, the motorcyclist was warm and friendly. When the<br>temple<br>&gt; was<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; approaching, the motorcyclist eyes grown bigger and bigger. His<br>&gt; kind<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; face<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; turned to a face of anger. He was muttering something loud but<br>was<br>&gt; not<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; audible to me. I was so scared that I closed my eyes in order<br>not<br>&gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;see<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; angry face.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Then, the motorcylist stopped in front of the temple and then<br>&gt; yelled<br>&gt; at<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; "Your kueh teow soup is so hot!! It is burning my thigh! Can you<br>&gt; please<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; move<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it away???"<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>************************************************************************<br>&gt; ****<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;*************************<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Ghost Story #2<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When I was young, I have two friends who were very close to each<br>&gt; other.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; They played with each other everyday. It was like, if you see A,<br>&gt; you<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; see B next to him. They were always together.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A loved fried eggs. Whenever he went out for lunch or dinner ,<br>&gt; without<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fail,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he would ask for fried egg on top of his noodles, fried rice,<br>etc.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One day, A involved in an accident and died.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; B was devastated. B went to the cemetery to pray everyday.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He would go to the nearest restaurant and ta pao a box of fried<br>&gt; rice<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with an<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; egg on top to be offered to A when he went to pray to him.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The next day, he opened the box and there was no egg inside!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; B was petrified. He thought, must be A who came and took the<br>fried<br>&gt; egg<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; away.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The same thing happened the next day and the day after that.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; B was confused. So, one day, he asked the chef to make the same<br>&gt; fried<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rice<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with a fried egg again. Then, he went to the cemetery to offer<br>it<br>&gt; to<br>&gt; A.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Curious, he opened the box to check for the egg. He was angry to<br>&gt; find<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there was no fried egg in the box after all.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Feeling that he had been cheated, he went back to the restaurant<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; demanded to see the Chef. "Where is the fried egg?? I told you<br>&gt; there<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; must be<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a fried egg inside!! You have cheated me for a few days now!<br>Gimme<br>&gt; back<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; money!!"<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Then, the Chef got really angry and opened the box - the fried<br>egg<br>&gt; was<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; inside the box.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The Chef said, "Stupid! You open the box upside down. No wonder<br>you<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cannot<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; see the egg!!"<br>&gt;</div>

I<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; late and I waited for the taxi/bus but there was none. I was<br>&gt; getting<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; worried<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as the night was getting darker and darker. So I tried to flag<br>down<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; private<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vehicles to take me home.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There was no one stopping for me, till one motorcyclist took<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pity on<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me and stopped to give me a lift. He was a man with a kind face.<br>I<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; accepted<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his offer and got onto his motorbike.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; On the way home, we would pass by a temple. At night, the temple<br>&gt; would<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; look<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; eerily spooky with the dim lights from the candles.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; At first, the motorcyclist was warm and friendly. When the<br>temple<br>&gt; was<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; approaching, the motorcyclist eyes grown bigger and bigger. His<br>&gt; kind<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; face<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; turned to a face of anger. He was muttering something loud but<br>was<br>&gt; not<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; audible to me. I was so scared that I closed my eyes in order<br>not<br>&gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;see<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; angry face.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Then, the motorcylist stopped in front of the temple and then<br>&gt; yelled<br>&gt; at<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; "Your kueh teow soup is so hot!! It is burning my thigh! Can you<br>&gt; please<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; move<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it away???"<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>************************************************************************<br>&gt; ****<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;*************************<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Ghost Story #2<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When I was young, I have two friends who were very close to each<br>&gt; other.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; They played with each other everyday. It was like, if you see A,<br>&gt; you<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; see B next to him. They were always together.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A loved fried eggs. Whenever he went out for lunch or dinner ,<br>&gt; without<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fail,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he would ask for fried egg on top of his noodles, fried rice,<br>etc.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One day, A involved in an accident and died.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; B was devastated. B went to the cemetery to pray everyday.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He would go to the nearest restaurant and ta pao a box of fried<br>&gt; rice<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with an<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; egg on top to be offered to A when he went to pray to him.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The next day, he opened the box and there was no egg inside!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; B was petrified. He thought, must be A who came and took the<br>fried<br>&gt; egg<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; away.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The same thing happened the next day and the day after that.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; B was confused. So, one day, he asked the chef to make the same<br>&gt; fried<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rice<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with a fried egg again. Then, he went to the cemetery to offer<br>it<br>&gt; to<br>&gt; A.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Curious, he opened the box to check for the egg. He was angry to<br>&gt; find<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there was no fried egg in the box after all.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Feeling that he had been cheated, he went back to the restaurant<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; demanded to see the Chef. "Where is the fried egg?? I told you<br>&gt; there<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; must be<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a fried egg inside!! You have cheated me for a few days now!<br>Gimme<br>&gt; back<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; money!!"<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Then, the Chef got really angry and opened the box - the fried<br>egg<br>&gt; was<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; inside the box.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The Chef said, "Stupid! You open the box upside down. No wonder<br>you<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cannot<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; see the egg!!"<br>&gt;</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Encountered a few times but 2 really stuck in my head.<br><br>First was when i am still living in AMK ave 10. It was the holidays and i was still in sec sch. Went to bed pretty late that day, but cant remember what time.<br>I shared the bedroom with my brother and i lay on my bed trying to sleep. Suddenly can heard a noise at my hear, it soarted softly and starts getting louder and louder and louder till i open my eyes. Then i saw something floating directly above me staring at me straight in the eye. Cant remember the face but confirm is a female. Was super shocked and stunned but i dont dare to do anything nor move an inch. Then i close my eyes, hoping it will go away and at the same time i counted the time (could hear the clock ticking). After 5 mins, i open my eyes and lucky, no more, i run to the toilet to pee, and after calming myself down, went back to bed.<br><br>The next day, after i woke up, i thought i was just scaring myself and its my imagination, so i didnt tell anybody. That night, i slept after watching discovery and can remember its 2AM. I lay on the bed and close my eyes. Before long, knn can hear the same noise becoming louder and louder at my ear again, but this time i immediately turn my head towards the door, sit up with my eyes closed and almost sprint to my mum's bedroom in an instant. Went to pee and then slept beside my sister in her room.<br><br>The next encounter was after i moved place. A week after i moved, i need to set up the internet for my computer but the eternet cable was not long enough. I headed down to AMK to buy then my friend told me he has a 20 meter one. So i head down to his place after dinner together with him. I sat at the seat at the playground while he went up to bring to cable (he was renting the room and so it wasnt nice for me to head up). I sat there alone for like 15 mins and throughout the wait, i was just smoking and looking around. When he came down, he walked another path which would passby me, but slightly more faraway. As he pass by, he keep on staring at me and i find it weird, so i signal for him to quickly come, dont play already. Then after we moved to another location, he told me when he came down and exit the lift, he saw a lady sitting beside me, and really close to me. Its almost as if the lady and i were lovers. As he get closer, he find the lady weird (but he cannot explain it), which is why he took that weird path and stare at me, but as he was walking and staring at me, the lady was gone. Knn when he told me this, it spoilt my whole mood for the night.</div>
