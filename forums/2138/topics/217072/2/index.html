His mother said, "At Christmas you send a letter to Santa to ask for what you want, don't you?"<br><br>"Yes," replied Johnny, "but it isn't Christmas."<br><br>His mother said, "Yes, but you can send a letter to Jesus and ask him."<br><br>Johnny sat down with a pen and paper and started his letter:<br><br>Dear Jesus,<br><br>I've been a good boy and I would like a new bike.<br><br>Your Friend,<br>Johnny<br><br>He thought about this and decided to start a new letter.<br><br>Dear Jesus,<br><br>Sometimes I'm a good boy and I would like a new bike.<br><br>He thought about this and decided to write another letter.<br><br>Dear Jesus,<br><br>I thought about being a good boy and I would like a new bike.<br><br>He thought about this and decided that he didn't like that one either. He left and went walking around depressed when he went by a house with a small statue of Mary in the front yard. He picked up the statue and hurried home. He put the statue under the bed and started his new letter.<br><br>Dear Jesus,<br><br>If you want to see your mother again, send me a new bike!<br><br>Your Friend,<br>Johnny</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Cut in Pray<br><br>Little Johnny needed $100 very badly and his mother told him to pray to God for it. He prayed and prayed for two weeks, but nothing turned up. Then he decided to write God a letter requesting the $100. When the postal authorities received the letter addressed to God, they opened it up, and decided to send it to the President.<br><br>The President was so impressed, touched and amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little Johnny $5. He thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy.<br><br>Little Johnny was delighted with the $5 and sat down to write a thank-you letter to God which reads as follows: Dear God, Thank you so very much for sending me the money. I noticed you sent it through Washington. As usual those *******s deducted $95 as tax.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bill Gates dies in a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory, being sized up by God.<br><br>"Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before, in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to go."<br><br>Bill replied, "Well, what's the difference between the two?"<br><br>God said, "I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision.<br><br>"Fine, but where should I go first?"<br><br>"I'll leave that up to you."<br><br>"Okay then," said Bill, "Let's try Hell first."<br><br>So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was shining; the temperature perfect. He was very pleased.<br><br>"This is great!" he told God. "If this is Hell, I really want to see Heaven!"<br><br>"Fine," said God, and off they went.<br><br>Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.<br><br>Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision.<br>"Hmmm. I think I'd prefer Hell," he told God.<br><br>"Fine," retorted God, "as you desire." So Bill Gates went to Hell.<br><br>Two weeks later, God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and tortured by demons.<br><br>"How's everything going?" he asked Bill.<br><br>Bill responded, his voice filled with anguish and disappointment,<br><br>"This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beaches, the beautiful women playing in the water????<br><br>"That was a Demo Version. This is the Release Version," replied God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One night, a Delta twin-engine puddle jumper was flying somewhere above New Jersey. There were five people on board: the pilot, Michael Jordan, Bill Gates, the Dalai Lama, and a hippie. Suddenly, an illegal<br>oxygen generator exploded loudly in the luggage compartment, and the passenger cabin began to fill with smoke. The cockpit door opened, and the pilot burst into the compartment.<br><br>"Gentlemen," he began, "I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that we're about to crash in New Jersey. The good news is that there are four parachutes, and I have one of them!" With that, the pilot<br>threw open the door and jumped from the plane.<br><br>Michael Jordan was on his feet in a flash. "Gentlemen," he said, "I am the world's greatest athlete. The world needs great athletes. I think the world's greatest athlete should have a parachute!" With these<br>words, he grabbed one of the remaining parachutes, and hurtled through the door and into the night.<br><br>Bill Gates rose and said, "Gentlemen, I am the world's smartest man. The world needs smart men. I think the world's smartest man should have a parachute, too." He grabbed one, and out he jumped.<br><br>The Dalai Lama and the hippie looked at one another. Finally, the Dalai Lama spoke. "My son," he said, "I have lived a satisfying life and have known the bliss of True Enlightenment. You have your life ahead of you; you take a parachute, and I will go down with the plane."<br><br>The hippie smiled slowly and said, "Hey, don't worry, pop. The world's smartest man just jumped out wearing my backpack."</div>

In Germany we can take a lung out of one person and put it in another, and have him looking for work 4 weeks!"<br><br>A Russian doctor said, "In my country, medicine is so advanced that we can take half of a heart from one person and put it in another, and have them both looking for work in two weeks!"<br><br>The American doctor, not to be outdone, said, "HAH!

That's impossible," the guy scoffs.<br><br>"Not at all. Take a look," the other man replies, and with that he walks over to the window and opens it. He climbs over the sill and falls out. He drops 10... 20... 30... 40...50 feet, comes to a stop, and whoosh -- he comes right back up and sails back through the window. "See? It's fun. You should try it," he says.<br><br>"Try it? I don't even believe I saw it!" the first man shouts.<br><br>"It's easy. Watch, I'll do it again." And with that, he falls out the window again.

It's a blast," he says.<br><br>"Well, what the heck, I'll give it a try," the first man says, and proceeds to fall out the window. He falls 10... 20... 30... 40... 50...60...70...80...90... 100 feet and splat -- he ends up as road pizza on the sidewalk.<br><br>After watching this, the second guy casually closes the window, heads back to the bar and orders a drink.

            <div class='col-md body'>There was this couple in bed one night. The wife had curled up ready for sleep and the husband put his bedlamp on and read a book. As he was reading he stopped and reached over to his wife and started fondling with her ****y. He did this only for a very short while then stopped and went back to reading his book. The wife then got up and started stripping off in front of him.<br><br>The husband was confused and asked, "What are doing taking all your gear off?"<br>The wife replied, "You were playing with my ****y. I thought it was foreplay for something a bit heavier".<br><br>The husband said, "No, not at all".<br>The wife then asked," Well, what were you doing then?"<br><br>"Oh", he said, "I was just wetting my fingers so I could turn the pages in my book!".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pierre, a French fighter pilot, takes his girlfriend, Marie, out for a pleasant little picnic by the river Seine. It's a beautiful day and love is in the air, so Marie leans over to Pierre and says: "Pierre, kiss me!"<br><br>So our hero grabs a bottle of red wine and splashes it on Marie's lips.<br><br>What are you doing, Pierre?" shrieks Marie.<br>Well, my name is Pierre, the French Fighter Pilot, and when I have red meat I like to have red wine!"<br><br>His answer was good enough for Marie, and things began to heat up. So she says: "Pierre, kiss me lower."<br>Our hero rips off her blouse, grabs a bottle of white wine and starts pouring it all over her breasts.<br><br>"Pierre, what are you doing?"<br>"My name is Pierre, the French Fighter Pilot, and when I have white meat I like to have white wine!"<br><br>They resume their passionate interlude and things really steam up. Marie leans over once more and softly whispers into his ear: "Pierre, kiss me lower.<br><br>Pierre tears off her underwear, grabs a bottle of Cognac and sprinkles it all over her genital area. He grabs a match and lights it on fire.<br><br>Patting the flames out furiously, Marie screams, "PIERRE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!?"<br>"My name is Pierre, the French Fighter Pilot, and when I go down, I go down in flames!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A guy went into a restaurant and was taken to a table by the head waiter. As he sat in the chair, he knocked the spoon onto the floor. The head waiter reached into his pocket, pulled out another spoon and placed it on the table.<br><br>The guy asked, " How come you had the spoon in your pocket?"<br><br>The head waiter responded, " We had a resource management team come through and look at our jobs to suggest ways we could improve. They found that 31% of our customers knock their spoon onto the floor. If we carry one with us, it saves time by not having to go to the kitchen to get a clean one."<br><br>"That's a good idea," the guy said.<br><br>After finishing his meal, the guy got up to pay for his meal. As he was paying, he noticed that the head waiter had a piece of string hanging from his fly and told the waiter about it.<br><br>The head waiter acknowledged the string. "The resource management team suggested ways to improve our jobs. They suggested that if we have a piece of string attached to our fly, we can pull on the string and the old fella will drop out. That way we haven't used our hands and we don't need to wash them, thus saving time."<br><br>"What a great idea" says the guy. He paid for his meal and turned to leave the restaurant. As he reached the door he realised that there was something wrong with that idea. He turned to the head waiter and asked, "...how do you get your old fella back in your pants?"<br><br>" Well I don't know about the other guys, but I use the spoon."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One Sunday morning George burst into the living room and said, "Dad! Mom! I have something very important to tell you. I am getting married to the most beautiful girl in town. She lives a block away and her name is Susan."<br><br>After supper, George's dad took him aside for a little chat."Son, I have bad news for you," he confessed. "When I was young I used to fool around with women a lot, and Susan is actually your half sister. I'm afraid you can't marry her."<br><br>George was terribly broken-hearted. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. And a year later he came home and very proudly announced: "Dianne said yes! We're getting married in June."<br><br>Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. "Dianne is your half sister too, George. I'm awfully sorry about this."<br><br>There was nothing left but for George to feel so much anger and grief. He decided to see his mother about his problems. "Dad has done so much harm. I guess I'm never going to get married," he complained. "Everytime I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl's my half sister."<br><br>With tears in her eyes and with so much hesitation, his mother said, "George, don't pay any attention to what your dad says. As you see, I did some fooling around myself, and he's not really your father."</div>
