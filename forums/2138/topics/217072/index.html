The Ah-Long asks the Runner: "Where is the 500K you embezzled from me?"<br><br>The Lawyer, using sign language, asks the Runner where the money is hidden.<br><br>The Runner signs back: "I don't know what you are talking about."<br><br>The attorney tells the Ah-Long: "He says he doesn't know what you're talking about. That's when the Ah-Long pulls out a 9 mm pistol, puts it to the Runner's temple, cocks it, and says: "Ask him again!<br><br>The Lawyer signs to the Runner: "He'll kill you for sure if you don't tell him!"<br><br>The Runner signs back: "OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind carpark C at Mount Faber!<br><br>The Ah-Long asks the Lawyer: "Well, what'd he say?"<br><br>The Lawyer replies: "He says you don't have the balls to pull the trigger."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Three couples, one elderly, one middle-aged, one young and newly wed apply for membership in a church. The pastor informs them that the requirement for new parishioners is that they abstain from sex for two weeks. The couples agree and go their separate ways.<br><br>After two weeks, they return. The pastor asks the elderly pair if they were able to abstain for two weeks. "No problem at all, Pastor," replies the old man.<br><br>"Congratulations!" says the pastor. "Welcome to the church." He turns to the middle-aged couple and asks if they were able to abstain for two weeks. "It was difficult," replies the husband. "By the end of the second week, I had to sleep on the couch, but we did it."<br><br>"Congratulations on overcoming temptation," says the pastor. "Welcome to the church." He then turns to the newlyweds and asks if they were able to abstain for two weeks.<br><br>"At first it was no problem," says the husband. "But one day my wife was reaching for a can of corn on the top shelf, and she dropped it. When she bent over to pick it up, I was overcome with lust and took advantage of her right there."<br><br>"You understand, of course, that this means you will not be welcome in our church," says the pastor.<br><br>"We know," says the young man. "We're not welcome at the supermarket anymore either."</div>

She suspiciously looked at her students but didn't say anything. Instead, she rubbed it off.<br><br>The next day, she came in and saw another drawing of an even bigger penis on the board. She frowns and rubs it off.<br><br>The third day, she came in and saw another penis drawn on the board. This time, it's huge, covering up almost half of the space.<br><br>She couldn't take it anymore so she screams out to the room full of noisy children, "Why do you kids like drawing this penis on the board? And why is it getting bigger each day?"<br><br>Little Johnny then screams out back to her, "The more you rub it, the bigger it gets."</div>
