There is, however, a catch . . .. you may<br>choose any man from a particular floor, or you may choose to go up a<br>floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! So, a<br>woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband . .<br><br>On the first floor the sign on the door reads:<br>Floor 1 - These men have jobs and love the Lord.<br><br>The second floor sign reads:<br>Floor 2 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, and love kids.<br><br>The third floor sign reads:<br>Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, and are<br>extremely good looking.<br>"Wow," she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.<br>She goes to the fourth floor and sign reads:<br><br>Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, are drop- dead<br>good looking and help with the housework.<br>"Oh, mercy me!"she exclaims, "I can hardly stand it!"<br>Still, she goes to the fifth floor and sign reads:<br><br>Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love the Lord, love kids, are drop- dead<br>gorgeous, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak.<br>She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor and the sign<br>reads:<br><br>Floor 6 - You are visitor 4,363,012 to this floor.<br>There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that<br>women are impossible to please.<br><br>Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>A guy goes to the supermarket and notices a beautiful blonde woman wave at him and say hello.<br><br>He's rather taken back, because he can't place where he knows her from. So he says, "Do you know me?" To which she replies, "I think your the father of one of my kids."<br><br>Now his mind travels back to the only time he has ever been unfaithful to his wife and says, "My God, are you the stripper from my bachelor party that I laid on the pool table with all my buddies watching, while your partner whipped my butt with wet celery and then stuck a carrot up my arse???"<br><br>She looks into his eyes and calmly says, "No, I'm your son's maths teacher."<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Two elderly residents were sitting alone in the lobby of their nursing home one evening.<br><br>The old man looked over and said to the old lady, "I know just what youÂ’re wanting; for $5 IÂ’ll have sex with you right over there in that rocking chair."<br><br>The old lady looked surprised but didnÂ’t say a word.<br><br>The old man continued, "For $10 IÂ’ll do it with you on that nice soft sofa over there, but for $20 IÂ’ll take you back to my room, light some candles, and give you the most romantic evening youÂ’ve ever had in your life."<br><br>The old lady still says nothing, but after a couple moments starts digging down in her purse. She pulls out a wrinkled $20 bill and holds it up.<br><br>"So you want the nice romantic evening in my room," says the old man with a satisfied smirk.<br><br>"Get serious," she finally says, rolling her eyes. "I want four times in the rocking chair."<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>A boss walked into the office one morning not knowing that his zipper was down, and his fly wide open.<br><br>His secretary walked up to him and said, "Boss this morning when you left your house, did you close your garage door?"<br><br>This was not a phrase that her boss understood, so he went into his office looking a bit puzzled.<br><br>When he was about done with his paper work, he suddenly noticed that his zipper was not zipped up. He zipped up and remembering what his secretary had told him, finally understood.<br><br>He then intentionally went out to ask for a cup of coffee from his secretary.<br><br>When he reached her desk, he said, "When you saw the garage door open did you see my Jaguar parked in there?"<br><br>The secretary smiled for a moment and said, "No, Boss, I didn't. All I saw was a Mini with 2 flat tyres."<br><br></div>
