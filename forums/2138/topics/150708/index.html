Independence isn't necessarily a good thing for the responsibilities that come with it may juz be too daunting. However, time can change the outcome. So before jumping on a conclusion, probably u would want to think abt when is the ideal time for u fly. Coz i wouldnt want u fall even before u know how to flap ur wings. Be objective and rational with ur thoughts n not let emotions dictate ur decisions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary...<br><br>I'm sure I gotta take a chance to mit up with *him as long I'm given a chance next week... Though should haf be completing my project and take it as a nice lil' reward for my eyes to see someone I'd really love... I find it so impossible to love someone so much like him, and it kinda makes mi feel that I could never love another or as willing to give as much as I am now...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>For example, I have always been so excited to be beside him, for no reason at all... Even if it was oni for a second or two, I would feel extremely overjoyed for an entire day... I know it isnt an infatuation or anything like dat... I have been thru so many guys whom I took a liking for (or love??), he's just not like another being in this world...<br><br>the thing about him that makes him so different from any other guys who have really liked mi is that he doesnÂ’t seem to demand anything emotionally, at all... Though there is a particular reson behind this, and I'm extremely afraid of losing freedom. and esp privacy means alot to mi...Somehow it just feels that I do not haf that 'gf' qualities, not that I am pick-mi-up-on-the-street kinda girl, I'm just soooo afraid of commitments... Dats also another reason why I can never go back to church... One day, perhaps, I might change...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I can, and am willing to, asking myself to give in as long it is for his gud... As for did he ever felt anything for mi, he probably does, initially, but I think maybe because I love him so much to the extend IÂ’m giving him more then he would have need (mind I used the word "need", maybe its just a "want" in his life, but saying a "need" makes mi feel beter)... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I loved his company for all I know, he never makes mi feel bored regardless whatever he does... people said "the prob with men is their need to possess a women", he doesnt behaves that way neither does he makes a woman feel tied-up or trapped... See the point, he is really a unique individual, I really cant imagine there is such a gem stil existing in this world...<br><br>He is ever so busy and I didnt seem to mind as much... It feels very nice when he'd drop mi a lil' surprise now and then, and that's what kept mi going these few months when tyms are hard... I just cant explain all the emotions he've made mi feel, but all I can say is this guy makes mi feel as if I cant never get enuff of him... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Jur <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
