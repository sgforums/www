            <div class='col-md body'>Dear "Diary"(note the " "),<br><br>There are several issues coursing thru my usually lazy mind. I'm a usually reserved person. Keep-to-myself kinda person. There are times i really wish to express out my feelings n concerns. Tell someone wat seems to be eating me from inside out. But I juz dun seem to be able to bring myself to do so.<br><br>Sometimes I hate myself for forcing myself to go through struggles alone. BUt i must admit, it does make me more seemingly psychological n emotionally inert. I dont show it thru my appearance. But that definitely hasnt necessarily made me a stronger person. I may perpetually seem to be surrounded by pple but i constantly feel alone. I like solitude, physically. It gives me alot of personal space that i crave. Room to relax my soul n mind. But being the sole keeper of my baggage is tiring.<br><br>One of my faults for my a current situation would that I consider too much abt others' feelings, thoughts and expectations. Hence, so as not to hurt or to please them, I do things that r at my own expense. No matter how tactful a person may be, comments will always leave a mark on a person's feelings, ego etc.<br><br>I've loosen up alittle as time gone by, but still, I move ahead individually most of the time, trying to find my place in this world.<br></div>

It's gonna be so boring...and i'm gonna be all insecure again...cause there's no way i can contact W...and prob, he's off "socializing" somewhere else...i guess things will change more after i come back...once he start hanging with his group of friends...or gal friends...Te worst part is, when i need the most comfort, my greatest circle of trust are not with me...and there's no way to contact them either...sigh....

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br>Went out with W last noght...But things didn't get better...I kept quiet because i was feeling unwell...And it gives the funny awkward atmosphere to both of us...Later on i tot i had to say sumthin...But the words i said came out wrong...And it hurt his feelings instead...I can see his eyes turning red...like as if he was really hurt...I felt bad, but i din noe why...my ego disallowed me to apologize....even later at night after he drove me home...when he was waiting for me to say sumthin...I just got out of the car and slammed the door....And later when i saw him again on MSN, i ignored him and set myself on away mode... I felt like i've wasted 2 chances that he gave me...I should have said sorry when i could...I hope things will turn out for the better...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary....<br><br>Have been pumping myself with too much coffee because I had a drink too much and ended up sleepless now... People have been telling mi that I should be myself, and they presumed that I have been pretencious all along... Why should I be lying to them anyway?? To mi, everything is just temporary, a character of a person changes overnyt... Changes in life is not so much what happens to u, where u live and all that other external bullshit so much, I still think that its all about what u feel and how u perceive the world around u... U decide ur own fate...<br><br>The extraordinary thing about life is that U are the author of ur own destiny and U are the director for it too... And the way I see it, my perception of the world is gud enough for mi... Living can be a drag as it is... All the nonsence we have to deal with everyday, and irritataing annoying people that are so full of themselves u wished u could give them a BIG tight slap, esp the customer who pissed mi off so much at workj just now... "Cool" I told myself... I am calmer than I thought I would be... Eventually, we need every little bit of something we like to make life seem easier...<br><br>The mysterious person I have been talking about finally sms-ed mi regardless his busy schedule... I was caught by surprise and felt kinda loved deep down... Somehow it feels so right... Love is a burden from the people u dun want love from, but it feels so freaking sweet from affection, care and all loving stuffs from people u do want... A lil' message or phone call from him makes mi feel happy, relaxed, and like I wanna to spend more tym with him, I missed him so much, which is a nice feeling... Its just like food to body, not too much, not too little, u just have to strike the balance, and u know it is essential !!<br><br>Love,<br>Jur<br><br></div>

" im like, yay</div>
