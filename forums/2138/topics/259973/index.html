            <div class='col-md body'>If you think you are fat, you probably are.  Do not ask us. We refuse to answer<br><br>Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, Put it down.<br><br>Do not cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair.<br><br>One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair, and by then, you are stuck with her.<br><br>Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again!<br><br>If you ask a question you don't want an answer to; expect an answer you do not want to hear.<br><br>Sometimes, we are not thinking about you. Live with it.<br><br>Do not ask us what we are thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun formation and monster trucks.<br><br>Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.<br><br>Shopping is not a sport, and no, we are never going to think of it that way.<br><br>When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.<br><br>You have enough clothes.<br><br>You have too many shoes.<br><br>Crying is blackmail.<br><br>Your ex-boyfriend is an idiot.<br><br>Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work. Strong hints do not work. Obvious hints do not work. Just say it!<br><br>No, we do not know what day it is. We never will. Mark anniversaries on a calendar.<br><br>Yes, peeing standing up is more difficult. We are bound to miss sometimes.<br><br>Most guys own three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?<br><br>Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.<br><br>Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That is what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br><br>A headache that lasts for 5 months is a problem. See a doctor.<br><br>Foreign films are best left to foreigners.<br><br>Do not fake it. We would rather be ineffective than deceived.<br><br>It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.<br>No, it does not matter which quiz.<br><br>Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after 7 days.<br><br>If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br><br>If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br><br>Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway; it is genetic.<br><br>Don't rub the lamp if you don't want the genie to come out.<br><br>You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done-not both.<br><br>Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.<br>Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.<br><br>Women wearing Wonderbras and low-cut blouses lose their right to complain about having their boobs stared at.<br><br>More women should wear Wonderbras and low-cut blouses. We like staring at boobs.<br><br>The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out.<br><br>ALL men see in only 16 colors, like windows default settings. Peach is a fruit, not a color.<br><br>Pumpkin is also a fruit.<br><br>If it itches, it will be scratched.<br><br>Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.<br><br>If it is OUR house, I do not understand why MY stuff gets thrown in the closet/attic/basement.<br><br>We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.<br><br>If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.<br><br>If we hear from an old girlfriend, we will briefly fantasize about having sex with her. But do not worry; the fantasy includes you AND her, together.<br><br>What the hell is a doily?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>50 things girls wished guys knew.<br><br>1.You have to tell a girl how you feel about her...we make no assumptions.<br><br>2. It never hurts to work out...take your own advice.<br><br>3.Girls like sex just as much as guys... if not more.<br><br>4. Not all girls masturbate... we just don't and no we are not lying.<br><br>5. We hate porn.<br><br>6. Hmmm...guys in Jeeps...yummm<br><br>7. Girls need food, water and compliments to survive.<br><br>8. We think about you all the time.<br><br>9. Being able to make us laugh is so much more impressive than how much you can bench-press.<br><br>10. We may think you are gay if you wear tighty-whities on a regualr basis.<br><br>11. Hold our hand.<br><br>12. No backseat drivers...NONE<br><br>13. Girls generally don't like giving head, so you better be ready to reciprocate if and when you get it.<br><br>14. We are not your all night resteraunt<br><br>15. Anything we say or do during that 5 days durning the month can't be held against us.<br><br>16. If you hold our hand while you are driving we will be thouroughly impressed. (especially if it's a stick)<br><br>17. Under no circumstances will we have a threesome<br><br>18. You look hot in all hooded articles of clothing<br><br>19. If you think for any reason that we don't like you then we probably don't.<br><br>20. Having us over while you and your friends play video games is not considered "quality time"<br><br>21. Just because we groom ourselves on a regular basis, does not mean we are high maintanence.<br><br>22. Never comment on how much a girl eats... ever.<br><br>23. Keep in mind, we with-hold sex when we're mad at you... so you might wanna get around to apologizing.<br><br>24. You can't force us to like sports... especially those associated with the WWE.<br><br>25. We're typically smarter than you, so get over it and stop whining when we get better grades than you!<br><br>27. The ability to play guitar will help you get laid.<br><br>28. We're sorry... Brad Pitt IS hot... Get over it!!!<br><br>29. Walks in the rain, kisses on the forhead, and cooking dinner for us, will get you everywhere.<br><br>30. Just because we're in a serious relationship, doesn't mena we plan to marry you someday, so stop being so damn scared!<br><br>31. If you're developing such good finger skills playing video games, you better put them to good use sometimes.<br><br>32. Anything you say or do to another girl, that you wouldn't want us to know about is considered cheating.<br><br>33. If we can admit that we're wrong, you're expected to do the same.<br><br>34. The exuse "I can't dance" is unacceptable...we'll appriciate the simple fact that you're trying.<br><br>35. On that note, if you refuse to dance, expect us to dance with other guys, lots of em.<br><br>36. Think before you speak... it makes a world of difference.<br><br>37. Not all girls kiss on the first date, get over it, we're creatures of mystery.<br><br>38. Make fun of our clothes... prepare to die<br><br>39. We don't always expect you to pay for us, but it doesn't hurt to at least offer every once in awhile.<br><br>40. Being able to keep a conversation going over the phone is a very important skill<br><br>41. The "little things" in a relationship, are really the biggest.<br><br>42. Foreplay isn't something we should have to ask for...it's a prerequisite.<br><br>43. Don't screw us over...especially if we have and older brother or any protectice guy friends...they will hunt you down and kill you.<br><br>44. If you're gunna look at other girls, at least make sure we don't see you doing it.<br><br>45. Just because we're still just "hanging out" doesn't make it ok to sleep with your ex-girlfriend, friend with benifets, etc.<br><br>46. No girl just want to be your "friends with benefits".<br><br>47. We're sensitive too, be gentle(and we're not talking about our hearts guys).<br><br>48. One word when it comes to smoking...quit.<br><br>49. We reserve the right to hate all of your ex-girlfriends<br><br>50. If we happen to trip, fall, etc, while wearing exceptionally high shoes that we love, go ahead and laugh...we will be... that is unless we hurt oursleves!</div>
