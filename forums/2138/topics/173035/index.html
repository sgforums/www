            <div class='col-md body'>Boys &amp; Girls<br>These are some facts about girls:<br><br>When a girl says that she's sad, but she isn't crying, it means that she's crying in her heart.<br><br>When she ignores you after you've done something wrong, it's best to give her some time to cool down before touching her heart with an apology.<br><br>A girl can't find anything to hate about the boy she loves (which is why it is so hard for her to 'get over him' after the relationship's over.)<br><br>If a girl loves a boy, he will always be on her mind every minute of the day, even though she flirts with other guys.<br><br>When the boy she likes smiles and stares deep into her eyes, she will melt.<br><br>A girl likes to hear compliments, but usually not sure how to react to them.<br><br>When a particular boy flirts with a girl very often, a girl would start thinking the boy likes her. So if you treat a girl just as a friend, go easy on the smiles and stare ok?<br><br>If you don't like a girl who likes you, break it to her gently.<br><br>If a girl starts avoiding you after you reject her, leave her alone for a while. If you still treat her as a friend, talk to her.<br><br>Girls enjoy talking about what they feel. Music, poetry, drawings and writing are ways of expressing themselves (which explains why most girls like writing journals).<br><br>Never tell a girl that she is useless in anyway.<br><br>Being too serious can turn a girl off.<br><br>When the boy she likes calls her for the first time, the girl may act uninterested during the call. But as soon as the phone is back on the hook, she will whoop with joy and immediately start telephoning her friends to spread the news.<br><br>A smile means a lot to a girl.<br><br>If you like a girl, try making friends with her first. Let her get to know you.<br><br>If a girl says she can't go out with you because she has to study, leave.<br><br>But if she still calls you or expect a call from you, stay.<br><br>Don't try to guess a girl's feelings. Ask her.<br><br>Hearing the words "I ♥ you" is a great reassurance to a girl that she is beautiful.<br><br>After a girl falls in love with a guy, she'll wonder why she never noticed him before.<br><br>If you need tips on how to flirt with a girl, read romance stories.<br><br>When class pictures come out, a girl would first check who is standing next to her crush before actually looking at herself.<br><br>A girl's ex-crush will always be in her memory, but the boy she loves now stays in her heart.<br><br>Girls love having fun!<br><br>A simple 'Hi' can brighten a girl's day.<br><br>A girl's best friends usually knows best what she is feeling and going through.<br><br>Girls hate it when a guy pays attention to them just to get close to their 'prettier' friend.<br><br>Love means devotion, caring and happiness to a girl, in this order.<br><br>Some girls care about looks, some care about brains, but ALL girls want a boy who will love and care for them.<br><br>Girls want nothing more than to feel loved.<br>When girls says:<br><br>FINE<br>This is the word that girls use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up.<br><br>FIVE MINUTES<br>If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour.<br>Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.<br><br>NOTHING<br>This is calm before the storm. This means 'something' and you should be on your toes. arguments that begin with 'Nothing' usually ends in 'Fine'.<br><br>GO AHEAD<br>This is a dare, not permission. Don't do it.<br><br>LOUD SIGH<br>This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by boys. A 'Loud Sigh' means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time arguing with you over 'Nothing'.<br><br>THAT'S OKAY<br>This is one of the most dangerous statements that a girl can make to a boy. 'That's Okay' means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding on how and when you will pay for your mistake.<br><br>THANKS<br>A girl is thanking you. Do not question it or faint. Just say you're welcome.<br>Never do these to girls:<br><br>make her cry (never ever let a girl drop a tear for you!)<br><br>compare her with other girls (the least thing you want to do!)<br><br>let her wait (this is very important!)<br><br>raise your voice at her (if you don't want her to leave you!)<br><br>neglect her (try it and she'll say goodbye!)<br><br>force her (no forcing please!)<br><br>humiliate/insult/criticise her (that's the worse!)<br><br>order her (she's your girlfriend, not your maid!)<br><br>show her disrespect (we girls need respect like you boys too!)<br><br>lie to her (please be honest! honesty is the best policy in relationship!)<br><br>leave her alone (she needs you every now and then!)<br><br>pretend (be the real you!)<br><br>be insensitive (girls are sensitive, so please be sensitive towards us!)<br><br>be domineering (never even be possesive!)<br><br>take her for granted (although she's yours now, but treat her sweet!)<br><br>rank her with your friends (she's always number 1 in your heart!)<br><br>sleep with other girls (ha, if you want her to leave you, do it by all means!)<br><br>forget the goodbye kiss (leave her a lingering feeling!)<br><br>forget to hug (girls love hugs!)<br><br>forget the 3 words 'I ♥ you' (this means a lot to them!)<br><br>spend her money (boys, be take the initiative to buy her clothes etc! so she'll be pleased)<br>What boys should do:<br><br>Boys should NEVER make a girl waits.<br><br>Boys should ALWAYS BE THERE for their girl.<br><br>Boys should NEVER LIE, because the girls are SMART these days.<br><br>Boys should ALWAYS be the BEST in everything, so that the girl can learn from boy, but don't be too arrogant.<br><br>Boys should be MORE patient and understanding when its the "time of the month" for the girls.
