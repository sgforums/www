                  Aries Employee Profile (March 21 - April 19)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Aries employees make excellent troubleshooters. They'll usually want<br>
                  to be out in the field at a variety of different work sites fixing<br>
                  things. They certainly won't be happy for very long behind a desk in a<br>
                  9 to 5 schedule. The bored Aries employee who has been forced into a<br>
                  square hole will typically be restless, angry, and careless with<br>
                  details. No amount of money would compensate for being stuck in a<br>
                  routine job. Money in fact isn't why they are working at all. They do<br>
                  want to be paid fairly and need a status position to satisfy their<br>
                  competitive tendencies--but even more importantly, they'll want<br>
                  challenging new projects They typically like to have a sense of<br>
                  responsibility and need to feel needed. In return, they'll give their<br>
                  all and provide detailed, consistent work. They will literally work<br>
                  themselves to exhaustion to prove themselves. If you want to keep your<br>
                  Aries co- worker productive and happy, you'll want to give them the<br>
                  opportunity to work independently or let them help and lead less<br>
                  experienced workers.<br>

                  Taurus Employee Profile (April 20 - May 20)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Taureans make some of the best employees. They are loyal, hardworking,<br>
                  and no-nonsense.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They work methodically and follow projects through until they are complete.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Some may appear to work a little too slowly-usually because they are<br>
                  so careful-but they will always finish what they start.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They thrive on structure, schedules, and routine. You'll find them<br>
                  doing the same exact thing at the same time every day.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Taureans, however, are not exactly the malleable workers that they<br>
                  often appear to be.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  If they have to work in a chaotic environment, they won't be happy and<br>
                  will be prone to child-like temper tantrums and stubbornness. They<br>
                  might react similarly if they have to work around ignorant people or<br>
                  at a job where there is no obvious potential for advancement. Taureans<br>
                  will be very unhappy if there isn't a ladder for them to climb. Even<br>
                  in the worst situations, they will find a way to advance slowly,<br>
                  winning over the most difficult people who may stand in their way of<br>
                  progress.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Taurus employees will only take so much patiently and happily before<br>
                  they feel they are being taken advantage of.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They will gladly accept orders and do whatever dirty work needs to get<br>
                  done, but they expect rewards.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They want material gain, salary increases, and the potential for more power.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  To make your Taurus employees happy, be sure to give them projects<br>
                  through which they will see tangible results-<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  hopefully something that will allow them to express their unique<br>
                  creativity in addition to their practical side.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They don't want to feel mired in details for long periods of time.<br>
                  Make sure to schedule regular performance and salary reviews.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  This show of respect should keep them loyal to the company.<br>

                  Gemini Employee Profile (may 21 - june 21)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Gemini employees can have difficulty concentrating on one thing for<br>
                  long periods of time.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They have quick-moving minds and love to talk and communicate their<br>
                  ideas with others. They thrive on social interaction -- even if their<br>
                  jobs don't particularly support it. You'll be able to find them<br>
                  wandering from desk to desk gossiping about all the sordid news in the<br>
                  office. They can be powerful persuaders in their speech and make ideal<br>
                  salespeople and mediators. They love to negotiate and can work out the<br>
                  best Deal for everyone involved. When properly stimulated, they can<br>
                  manage to keep their wandering mind focused and actually be quite<br>
                  productive. When they are bored, bogged down with mundane detail-work,<br>
                  or forced to work with people who they consider droll, they can become<br>
                  mean-spirited and gossipy. Their moods can fluctuate vastly day to<br>
                  day, as well as their productivity. It is really against t heir nature<br>
                  to be forced into an average workday schedule and environment. They<br>
                  are happier travelling. lf they are in an office they will need<br>
                  constant new stimulation. Most will be wanting advancement if they see<br>
                  this as a way to escape the limitations of their jobs. This can<br>
                  motivate them to put extra effort into their job. If you work with a<br>
                  Gemini, try to avoid getting into any debates with them they will<br>
                  surely win and it could end in some hard feelings on your part. They<br>
                  will need an accepting environment-one that supports their need for<br>
                  multi-tasking.<br>

                  Cancer Employee Profile (june 22 - july 21)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  The Cancer employee isn't at work to feed their ego -- their job is<br>
                  just a job and a means to get paid.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They work steadily and are usually very reliable. You'll be able to<br>
                  depend on them to show up on time and do what is necessary.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They won't get involved in power struggles or get upset when someone<br>
                  advances before them.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They are able to accept the situation because they see it simply as a<br>
                  rung on the ladder up.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Their motivation is security. They'll want more money the longer<br>
                  they've stayed at a job.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They don't want to have to worry about how they'll make ends meet<br>
                  tomorrow so they'll need a stable position without much risk.<br>
                  Cancerian workers can slip into some dark moods on occasion. During<br>
                  these periods productivity tends to drop-as well as everyone else's in<br>
                  the office. Their moods can be so strong everyone becomes affected. To<br>
                  avoid the frequency of these occurrences,<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  managers and co-workers should try to make the work environment as<br>
                  homey as possible-keep it well heated, cozy, and friendly.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Don't press them to reveal their true inner thoughts-their tendency is<br>
                  to be secretive and protective,<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  and they could see prying as an attempt to disturb their security.<br>

                  Leo Employee Profile (july 22 - august 21)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Leo workers want to be first and at the center of the office.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Even if they can't lead, they'll look for every opportunity to<br>
                  increase their own status<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  and if someone else seems ahead of them, look out. They will make it<br>
                  clear that they aren't happy by pouting and complaining.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They want advancement so much that they'll take on more responsibility<br>
                  and carry a heavier load than anyone<br>
                  else does in the office. And they are self-promoters. It is likely<br>
                  that they are telling everyone in the office<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  what a great job they are doing as well as giving everyone unwanted advice.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They know they are superior and want everyone to know it as well.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  This arrogance can sometimes cause problems when working with management.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  But typically, they are just hard workers out to demonstrate just how<br>
                  good they really are.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They thrive in sales positions - they can promote a product or company<br>
                  just as well as they promote themselves.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Their strength and arrogance isn't just show either.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  In a crisis situation, Leos really demonstrate their true courage.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Leos want to lead and will be pushing for more responsibility and rewards.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They are happy to train and mentor new co- workers as they enjoy<br>
                  giving advice and being in positions of authority.<br>
                  If you are trying to manage a Leo employee, you'll need to give them<br>
                  plenty of praise, responsibility, and independence.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They will certainly want to help lighten your load of management<br>
                  responsibilities.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Just be careful- the next thing you know they could be taking over your job.<br>

                  Virgo Employee Profile (august 22 - September 22)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  In the right situations Virgos love to work. They make ideal<br>
                  employees, happily working late into the night to make sure everything<br>
                  is perfect and in order. If you are looking for an employee who<br>
                  doesn't mind starting from rock bottom in the most entry-level<br>
                  position at the company, hire a Virgo. They'll have no complaints<br>
                  about the position being beneath them. They are CONTENT with basic,<br>
                  honest hard work. Their contentment isn't always apparent, however..<br>
                  They love to complain and worry. They are quick to criticize the way<br>
                  things are done around the office and are the first ones to grumble<br>
                  disapprovingly at what they consider to be extravagance or laziness.<br>
                  They are blunt and honest and don't mince words over what they feel<br>
                  just isn't right. Usually, this will be brought on by someone doing<br>
                  a half-baked job or not being considerate of other co-work ers. You'll<br>
                  want to constantly reassure them, but this will do little to quell<br>
                  their<br>
                  anxieties. They actually enjoy worrying, and there is little you can<br>
                  do about it. Just give them a detail - oriented project and let them<br>
                  work<br>
                  alone on it. You won't have to supervise a Virgo worker. They'll check<br>
                  all the facts before getting started and catch their own errors when<br>
                  they are done. To keep a Virgo employee happy, you should also make<br>
                  sure their environment is orderly and calm. You should also provide<br>
                  small gestures of appreciation. They don't need extravagance, just let<br>
                  them know you appreciate them in small ways that won't embarrass them.<br>
                  They will probably just shrug their shoulders and say, 'It's no big<br>
                  deal.' But deep down inside they need these little reassurances.<br>

                  Libra Employee Profile (September 23 - October 22)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Libra employees are detailed, dedicated workers with sensitive<br>
                  natures. Managers and co-workers sometimes find them difficult to get<br>
                  a handle on. They pick up the energy of the office and are unable to<br>
                  prevent it from affecting them. Loud noise, flashy colors, and<br>
                  discordant vibrations will put them off so much that they will have<br>
                  difficulty fulfilling their obligations at work.<br>

                  One day they may seem like the most bright, hardworking, ambitious<br>
                  employee around. The next day they might be down, irritated, and<br>
                  unable to produce. Co-workers shouldn't fret when Libra employees are<br>
                  in a dark mood. It really won't last, as a happy state of mind can<br>
                  come over them just as quickly. When Libra employees are in a balanced<br>
                  frame of mind, they can be a powerful presence at work-they have a way<br>
                  of gracing everything they touch. Underneath that mess of moods, they<br>
                  really are basically happy and stable people. They are capable of<br>
                  profound logical thought and evaluate all sides of a situation before<br>
                  acting. They are one of the most intelligent Signs around. They are<br>
                  expert researchers and mediators. And their sensitivity to their<br>
                  environment makes them naturals at keeping things looking great. They<br>
                  will easily help others resolve conflicts and can act as a go-between<br>
                  with workers and management so that everyone ends up happy. If you<br>
                  want to keep your Libran worker smiling, give them the respect they<br>
                  are due and put them in a position where they can project their great<br>
                  charm and diplomacy. They won't be CONTENT to take orders for very<br>
                  long, either- make sure they are given increased<br>
                  responsibility.<br>

                  Scorpio Employee Profile (October 23 - November 21)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Scorpio employees usually exude a quiet self-confidence. They are<br>
                  self-sufficient and do not depend on others for a sense of self-worth.<br>
                  They keep their private life separate from work and take complete<br>
                  responsibility for their actions and their situation. They don't make<br>
                  excuses; they just take care of business and expect everyone else to<br>
                  do the same. Those who don't, co- workers and managers- will have to<br>
                  endure the Scorpio wrath. They don't mind being completely vocal about<br>
                  what they feel is wrong with any given situation. And if you tread on<br>
                  their fire be sure to expect retaliation. They won't take insults or<br>
                  opposition lying down. If you manage a Scorpio employee, be sure to<br>
                  follow through with your word and don't break any promises-Scorpio is<br>
                  keeping track and building up some heavy resentments<br>
                  against you if you do. You may not even be aware of it until too<br>
                  late-but when Scorpio gets too m much, you'll be sure to know. Scorpio<br>
                  employees will react towards those around them exactly as they are<br>
                  treated. When they get what they want, they will be very accepting. If<br>
                  you are trying to work with or motivate a Scorpio co-worker, be sure<br>
                  to treat them respectfully and act professionally. Give them<br>
                  challenging work that allows them to utilize their awesome<br>
                  self-confidence and courage.<br>

                  Sagittarius Employee Profile (November 22 - December 21)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  The Sagittarian employee is head strong, cheerful, and willing to<br>
                  help. They exude self-confidence and take on tasks like there's no<br>
                  tomorrow. They are willing to tackle even the toughest of projects as<br>
                  long as it is challenging and gets them out of the routine. Lucky for<br>
                  them, their shining personalities and honest enthusiasm seem like a<br>
                  bright spot in the office- otherwise co-workers might begin to build<br>
                  animosity towards someone so arrogant and extravagant. Their tendency<br>
                  to exaggerate and take on more then they can handle usually results in<br>
                  missed deadlines and dropping the ball-not because they are lazy of<br>
                  procrastinate, but because their enthusiasm just gets the better of<br>
                  them sometimes. Don't let their nonchalance fool you-they really do<br>
                  care about what they are doing. They just have an easy-going attitude<br>
                  that allows them to keep on smiling even when they just messed up big<br>
                  time. Just because they are flexible and easy-going doesn't mean they<br>
                  won't tell you exactly how they feel-what is working for them and what<br>
                  isn't. And they won't just blindly take orders - they need to<br>
                  understand the method and reason behind the process. If you are trying<br>
                  to motivate your Sagittarian employee, be sure<br>
                  to feed them plenty of challenging new projects and hint that some<br>
                  business trips might be on the horizon once deadlines are met. And<br>
                  whatever you do, try not to question their intentions - it is the<br>
                  quickest way to make them upset. They aren't capable of deceit.<br>

                  Capricorn Employee Profile (December 22 - January 20)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  A Capricorn employee with too much to do is a happy worker. They need<br>
                  plenty of projects and responsibility. There is no sadder sight than a<br>
                  Capricorn worker without a sense of responsibility. They need to be<br>
                  needed. They are covertly ambitious - usually not flashy or obvious<br>
                  about it-but you will usually know that they are serious and<br>
                  determined about advancing themselves. They are completely scrupulous,<br>
                  so much so that they can be self-disparaging. But they are no<br>
                  pushovers. They can wear down even the toughest customers. Their<br>
                  persistence is incredible. Once they set their sights on a goal, they<br>
                  work away at it until the bitter end-whether the goal be that hard<br>
                  sell or the new hardware release. Capricorns don't work for free,<br>
                  however. They expect to be paid handsomely and be given more and more<br>
                  responsibility. They need to come out ahead of the pack in the end,<br>
                  and they see the work environment as their primary vehicle. They won't<br>
                  go in for the typical office gossip and politics, though. They want to<br>
                  get down to business at work and see it as no place for fooling<br>
                  around. With a strong sense of duty and respect towards their<br>
                  superiors, it is rare they will join in on boss-bashing or knocking<br>
                  the system. They can get frustrated, however, with blue sky management<br>
                  schemes that lack common sense, and they will interject their dry<br>
                  sense of humor in the most critical ways. If they want change, they<br>
                  will be unyielding. If all their effort leads to naught the result<br>
                  will be deep moods of darkness and depression with a sense of<br>
                  hopelessness. Keep your Capricorn employee happy by paying them fairly<br>
                  and giving them plenty of hard work. Arrange for a path of advancement<br>
                  within your organization for them. If you don't, you might find them<br>
                  looking for other opportunities.<br>

                  Aquarius Employee Profile (January 21 - February 19)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  The Aquarius employee can't tolerate unfairness in the office. Hair<br>
                  brained schemes will get the positive attention they deserve if an<br>
                  Aquarian has anything to do with it. They'll try to help everyone see<br>
                  the good side of a bad situation if it's the last thing that they do.<br>
                  They are so smart-they can't help but hold management in disdain if<br>
                  they feel that they are being unfair and unintelligent. It isn't that<br>
                  they are overly ambitious and think they could be doing a better job-<br>
                  just that they think people in power should know better.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Most Aquarius workers are still looking for themselves and will want<br>
                  to try their hand at a variety of jobs in the workplace.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Whatever they are doing, they will do conscientiously. They usually<br>
                  have strict personal codes that include a strong work ethic.<br>
                  Their bright, off-beat intelligence, and trustworthiness will<br>
                  typically gain them many friends-in and out of work.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Beneath that sometimes odd-ball behavior is solid, concrete thinking<br>
                  and sensitivity to co-workers.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Keep your smart Aquarius co-worker happy by giving them plenty of<br>
                  opportunity to learn news kills.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  Raises are less important to them. No amount of money will make it<br>
                  worth their while to stay in a stagnant position.<br>
                  Don't let them get too bored or they will simply find another job as<br>
                  easily as they found this one-their genius is easy to spot.<br>

                  Pisces Employee Profile (February 20 - march 20)<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  The Pisces employee can be a loyal and hard-working, if<br>
                  unconventional, worker. In the right position, they are able to keep<br>
                  their daydreams in check and buckle down on the detail work-giving<br>
                  their all to the boss and corporation whom they feel are worthy of<br>
                  devotion. On the flip side, there is no image of extreme misery like<br>
                  that of an ill-placed Pisces worker. They will act as though their<br>
                  cubicle were a prison cell as they daydream of their own business or<br>
                  next vacation. Unhappy Pisces workers usually won't stick<br>
                  around too long. Often Pisceans will drift from one job to another<br>
                  looking for that ideal environment to which they will be able to<br>
                  commit<br>
                  and feel a sense of purpose. And if things are going in a bad<br>
                  direction at the office, Pisces will be the first to sense it.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  They'd rather pick up and leave then wait until the problem reaches a<br>
                  head. Pisces are often misunderstood by their co-workers. Typically<br>
                  timid and introspective, they usually keep their true nature hidden,<br>
                  for fear it wouldn't fit with the corporate culture.<br>
                  <span>Â </span><br>
                  What motivates a Pisces employee to not only stick around but also<br>
                  excel? Try compliments. And show them how their work impacts the<br>
                  entire organization. They need to know that what they are doing is<br>
                  worth something on a grander scale. Acceptance of their unconventional<br>
                  organization and planning will be necessary. Just because their sales<br>
                  report isn't in the typical format doesn't mean it is any<br>
                  less effective. Keep their environment bright and upbeat; and an<br>
                  after-work cocktail wouldn't hurt</span></pre>
