            <div class='col-md body'>To My Dearest Wife,<br><br>During the past year, I have attempted to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of only once every 10 days. The following is a list of why I didn't succeed more often:<br><br>-We will wake the kids - 54 times<br><br>-It's too late - 15 times<br><br>-I'm too tired - 42 times<br><br>-It's too early - 12 times<br><br>-It's too hot - 18 times<br><br>-Pretending to be asleep - 31 times<br><br>-The neighbors will hear - 9 times<br><br>-Headache or backache - 26 times<br><br>-Sunburn - 10 times<br><br>-Your mother will hear us - 9 times<br><br>-Not in the mood - 21 times<br><br>-Watching the late show - 17 times<br><br>-Too sore - 26 times<br><br>-New hairdo - 6 times<br><br>-Wrong time of the month - 14 times<br><br>-You had to go to the bathroom - 19 times<br><br>Of the 36 times that I DID succeed, the result was not always satisfying because 6 times you just laid there, 8 times you reminded me that there was a crack in the ceiling, 4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with, 7 times I had to wake you up to tell you I was finished, and once I was afraid that I had hurt you because you started thrashing around and breathing heavy. Let's try to improve this, shall we??<br><br>Love, Your Hubby<br></div>

Here are the REAL reasons you didn't get more than you did this past year:<br><br>-Came home drunk and tried to screw the cat - 23 times<br><br>-Did not come home at all - 36 times<br><br>-Did not come - 21 times<br><br>-Came too soon - 38 times<br><br>-Went soft before you got it in - 19 times<br><br>-Cramps in your leg - 16 times<br><br>-Working too late - 33 times<br><br>-You had a rash, probably from a toilet seat - 29 times<br><br>-Caught yourself in your zipper - 15 times<br><br>-You had a cold and your nose kept running - 21 times<br><br>-You had burned your tongue on hot coffee - 9 times<br><br>-You had a splinter in your finger - 11 times<br><br>-You lost the notion after thinking about it - 42 times<br><br>-Came in your pajamas after reading a dirty book - 16 times<br><br>The reason I laid still was because you had missed me and were screwing the sheet. You seemed to be having a good time and I didn't want to move and spoil it for you. I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling. What I said was, "Would you like me on my back or kneeling?" The time I was thrashing around and gasping was when you farted and I was fighting for air. Maybe you can work on your "shortcomings?"<br><br>Love, Your Wife<br></div>
