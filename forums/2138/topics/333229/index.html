              <p>the day i leave this horrible company.</p>
              <p>I hate the pretension! I hate it i hate it I HATE IT. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can still tolerate the pretentious tho, thats why i've never wanted to mix around with colleagues, neither do i believe that colleagues can ever be friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the unjustice is the treatment i am receiving, from all my colleagues, and the ways they 'torture' mi till the very last few days before i go for my maternity. its totally unthinkable.</p>
              <p>how would you react if ur heavily preggie colleague is told to climb up and down the bloody chair to get stuffs from top of the shelves? not one or two items to bring down, its HUNDREDS of cds! imagine the load and the danger of doing that.</p>
              <p>and how would you react if the same colleague is told to also climb up and down the stairs from one storey to another, get over thousands of cds, and climb back the stairs to office, and climb up again to get another load of cds.... and this goes on for DAYS! not just once or twice a day, mind u, its more than ten tyms a day.</p>
              <p>what would u do if ur colleague took hundreds of cds from the shelves that u've packed properly, took them down, use them, and threw it on ur desk asking YOU, THE PROGRAMMER, to clear the shit for her?? and the best part is that knowing very well that these cds are high up on the shelves, u will be required to climb up and down the ladder just to put it back, and she just told u to do it even when its OBVIOUS that u'r heavily preggie. This brainless lazy unsympathetic selfish b!tch colleague will NEVER be able to be responsible if anything were to happen to u and the baby. And when u told her u didnt took the cds, u'r not gonna clear it, she says "oh but its only a few cds..." (c'mon we are not blind, its not "afew", its over hundreds!!), replied her that "i'm sorry i cant do it becoz i am not the one who made a mess out of all these cds in the first place, and secondly, I CANT CLIMB. She simply smirk and made a fuss out of it in front of boss. b!!!TTTTCCCCCHHHHHHH.</p>
              <p>Anywayz, she isnt the only one who does these kinda things to mi.</p>
              <p>lots more.. and u will never imagine how horribly torture i am in this company.</p>
              <p>this is really the worse workplace i've ever been in, tho i've seen really horrible office politics and stuffs, but this is the worse of them all.</p>
              <p>there was even this period of tym when i wasnt logging in to noiseology becoz i was so caught up with so much work, so stressed up, unappreciated, and unfairly blamed for all 'mistakes' done by others, unable to speak up, i do not know how to tell everyone how horrible this company is. becoz all people told mi is: aiyah, its lidat one la, u go anywhere work also the same la... NO ITS NOT THE SAME! why wun anyone believe what a hell this place is??! i cried for one entire week everyday at work, and i finally went up to the twelve storey of my own block almost about to jump. it was my baby's kicks that made mi go on stronger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its so hard to get over, but i am really looking forward to move on, esp after my maternity...</p>
