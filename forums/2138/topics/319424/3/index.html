              <p>Yeah...oh well =/...haha...yeah the ff7 ost is crazy...i think
              the people are buying for the cover lol...i'm not sure why...its
              weird...</p>
              <p>Yeah...garland was actually trying to stop kuja and his
              madness...yeah...zidane knew what it was like...actually both of
              them are similar in many ways...like they tend to question their
              existence often...but zidane was lucky...because he was in good
              hands...baku and the tantalus peeps...like blank, marcus,
              cinna...he found a family...unlike kuja...he was alone from the
              very beginning...and to him for garland to acknowledge his
              power...he thought acquiring power was the only way to prove his
              worth...quite sad if you ask me...how could he die....its stupid if
              he did lol...</p>
              <p>Hahah...yours is really the head-on attack type...coz only vivi
              uses spells...ok quina does use some spells too like mighty
              guard...frog drop too right? (the one that you need to catch frogs
              from all of the qu's marshlands) hahaha....yeah i've heard...</p>
              <p>Amarant...i don't really use him LOl...i don't know why...but
              his attack rating is rather high...as compared to freya....</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>is the cover even that nice? although i've to admit that the cds and the booklet inside looks kinda impressive.</p>
              <p>actually yeah in this game, you can actually sympathize with the antagonist kuja.. he was lonely and sad from the very beginning.. unlike zidane who was sent to gaia the moment he was created, and funnily, zidane couldn't remember anything about his supposed mission..</p>
              <p>yeah i mean ff9 has alot of that stupid item abilities like auto haste, auto regen etc so healing isn't really that important, plus quina has a decent healing party heal spell like white wind, althought the frog drop is what makes her really really strong..</p>
              <p>yeah amarant looks scary, but throwing items is dumbright stupid..lousy ability..tsk..</p>

              <p>Hmmm it looked special...but seriously the price is ridculously high...yeah...the cds and booklet that were added were well designed...that could be why so many of them are bidding for it...</p>
              <p>Haha...i think garland was hoping that zidane finishes his mission...but i think throughout the game...that mission was never stated...zidane and kuja were his "sons"...apparantly because he lost track of zidane...he created kuja to finish his mission...which kuja literally translated to "mass murder"...</p>
              <p>Hahaha yeah...the fact that items were easy to steal (even before you reach the next town to get), money was so easy to earn (you literally earn x3 of what you could in ff12), guardian forces are easy to get (hey you just need the jewels then the rest is training) and with abilities like level up (that speeds leveling)...i think its safe to say its a fool proof FF game to not be able to complete...the only hard parts are the side quests...(chocobo treasure hunting...Excalibur 2 quest...the Mysterious book in the library quest and the Ozma side quest)...other than that its supposed to be easy to complete...</p>

              <p>it has to be, i can't think of any other reason, the ff7 music isn't even a masterpiece in the first place, besides aerith theme..but in the states it is widely regarded as the best final fantasy of all time..</p>
              <p>yar ff9 was way too easy to play, money was never really in need as well, you could basically rely on drops and steals.. unless when it comes to synthesising..i never even used those ediolons except once each to see their attack animation, waste too much time and i don't like eiko or garnet either..hahaha.. excalibur 2 has gotta be the toughest quest, even ozma seems like the easiest among all side bosses that i've played. the weapons in ff7 and ff8 were so much harder, and ff9 has all those stupid armour abilities that are like cheating, you practically never needed much white magic.</p>
              <p>yar, its a lousy ability, and yes some of the stuff that you throw to get high damage is quite expensive and so not worth it! i mean comparing quina who uses only 10mp to get 9999 dmg each time..LOL~</p>

              <p>Yeah according to many the storyline was the best...i'm not much of a fan of the fave innocent chars dying (Aerith especially...) she shouldn't die...sigh =(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Haha...yeah apparantly the eidolons are rather useless...sometimes to humour myself...i just like to see how ugly they got from ff8...Ifrit was horrendously drawn...i think his former glory was never restored only until ff10...at least he looked more decent in ff10... haha...i think carbuncle was supposed to be cute until it looked like another playful puppy...zzz</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I didn't try the Excalibur 2 quest...but i know for Ozma's you need Shadow armlet...(- 100% shadow damage...) the game was a lil too easy for veteren players...and the animation was too kiddish...unless you're talking about the amano art which was very nice...quina is gay~ her damage is madness...</p>
