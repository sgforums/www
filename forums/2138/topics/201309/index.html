            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a333/JurCanny_/FABATT1.jpg"><br><br>From the Imperial Tung Shu comes this incredible poem of the four seasons ascribed to the legendary Yellow Emperor. From the poem can be obtained general indications of what life holds in store for a newborn baby. It is believed that depending on your season of birth, your life can be full of burdens or full of abundance. It all depends on which part of the Emperor's body you were born on. We present here brief predictive details of the four seasons poem for those wishing to investigate how, and at what stage of their life, they will enjoy the patronage and goodwill of the Emperor.<br><br>The incredible Chinese Tung Shu is filled with the most fascinating esoteric information relating to destiny analysis, as well as the meanings of signs, marks and symbols. One of the more tantalizing chapters relate to making a quick and general forecast of a person's life destiny, based on the seat assigned to us when we are born. This is based on the season of one's birth, as well as the time of birth i.e. the exact time when the baby is expelled or removed from the mother's womb.<br><br>Thus you first need to determine the season of birth - spring, summer, autumn or winter. The season of spring would be March, April and May; the season of summer would be June, July and August; the season of autumn would be September, October and November; while the season of winter would be December, January and February.<br><br>Next, you will need to determine your hour of birth based on the 12 earthly branches. This divides a 24-hour day into twelve time segments of two hours each, with each time segment representing one of the Chinese astrological animals. With these two pieces of information, you then need to look at the illustrations of the Yellow Emperor wearing the robes of the seasons - green robes for the spring, red robes for the summer, white robes for the fall and blue robes for the winter.<br><br>Look at the Emperor that corresponds with your season of birth, then locate on which part of the Emperor you were born based on your time of birth. Note from the time chart of the twelve time segments that each two-hour period has a special name. Locate the hour name on the Emperor's body and then check against the meaning given. For example, if your hour pillar is Mao in the season of summer, you look for the illustration of the Emperor in the summer season, locate where your hour name is located on his body and then read the meaning given under summer.<br><br>Use the table and diagram here to determine on which part of the Emperor you were born, then refer to the descriptions below to find your destiny.<br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a333/JurCanny_/FABATT2.jpg"><br><br>*****************************************<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Born in the Spring (March, April, May) </strong></span><br><br><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a333/JurCanny_/FABATT3.jpg"><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Cher</span><br>Born on the Emperor's Head</strong><br>You will hold a high position in life.

And like the wanderer, life is unsettled and transient.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Sen &amp; Yiu</span><br>Born on the Emperor's Feet</strong><br>This indicates that there will be two marriages in your life. This is especially true for women born into this position.
