LOVE can never be selfish... That the original of love in its true form.... There ain't really such things as 'selfish love'.... It's just a contamination term.... Where humans add in the word 'love' so as to spare themselves of the 'selfishness'....</strong><br><br>true enuff, there isn't such a term as 'selfish love'. however, wat i stated was that humans are creatures controlled by their feelings, not that love is selfish. if u'r talking abt what love ought or ought not to be, it might be too much a sweeping statement.<br><br><strong>I guess I have a clarification to make? You're a human... MOST of the people are... But I don't really consider myself one...? And I believe I'm NOT one of the kind... In other words, I'm not ALONE....</strong><br><br>i seek to ask wat u r then ... devil, or inhuman? then wat does a devil or some1 inhuman know abt love?<br><br><strong>Your PRESUMPTION that no one can truly be selfish is BASED on the fact that 'everyone have their hearts rule their minds...' Which I don't totally agree with you... And I believe there'll be many out there who would agree with me on this one.... You can make it sounds INSPIRATIONAL and KIND to put things in such way... But 'skipping a step' is not a directive method if you wanna derive on the CORRECT SPOT?<br>Memories can never be FOREVER...  That... Is just another folklore made up by HUMANs....</strong><br><br>Every1's entitled to their personal opinions, perhaps it's juz that our perceptions abt love differ so much that i, on my part, m willing to pass on this 'Memories lasts forever' thing.<br><br>'Nothing can stand the assault of sustained thinking.'[/B]</blockquote>hehehehehe  well..... what can i say?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And another thing, I don't know about the rest of you but to me some memories do stay with you forever or at least until the end of your lifespan. These memories leave such a deep impression on you that it is impossible to leave them behind.<br><br>This brings me to a scientific theory: Scientists (the brain guys) have proposed that our brains possess infinite prowess (we only use about 10% of our brain during our lifetime). What we read, do or experience is never really forgotton - just stashed away in a remote part of our memory. A simple thing, action or picture can unleash the "flood gates" and trigger a cascade of memories.<br><br>Note: Psychics are believed to be people who are able to utilize the capabilities of their brain. Government experiments have shown this theory to be promising.<br><br>Now that that is said would any of you be interested in the wave theory? What about the occurence of a resonance cascade? Or Einstein's theory of photoelectric emission?     :p<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"I have memories..."</span> - Ends Of Time</strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Ends Of Time (edited 01 August 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe. It has gotta do with the way he was brought up. A victim of circumstances no less...<br>Perhaps this brief background information of Rui sourced from the net might shed some light on his behavior and hopefully improve your overall opinion of him.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Hanazawa Rui is the quiet, sensitive guy in the F4. He is 18 years old, and is next in line to inherit his father's company. Because he is the heir, Rui's father was always very strict with him as a child, grooming him for his future position. This has left Rui an introvert who expresses his emotions through the beautiful music he plays on his violin.<br><br>Quiet and secretive, Rui spends most of his days out of classes, and sitting on a school staircase, staring off into space, lost in his own thoughts. Although he seems aloof at most times, Rui is aware of what goes on around him though he pretends not to care. Rui is the most calm and serious of the F4. He also seems to be the most compassionate of the guys as well, helping Tsukushi out of trouble several times. While Doumyouji always tends to get Tsukushi into trouble, it is Rui who is like the knight in shining armor who appears to aid her. Rui is a complete opposite of Tsukasa with his simplicity and gentleness.<br><br>Hanazawa Rui is the object of Tsukushi's affections, however Rui's feelings for her are hard to discern. His introverted nature makes him difficult to talk to sometimes. Tsukushi has a hard time reading what he is feeling. Sometimes it seems Rui is interested in Tsukushi, while at others it appears that she is merely a source of mild amusement.<br><br>Calm as he may be, Rui tends to act rather impulsive in certain situations. And because of this impulsiveness, Rui has never failed to complicate matters especially when he became Tsukushi's shoulders to cry on whenever she breaks down from all the stress in school.<br><br>Rui seems to be in love with a girl from his youth, Toudou Shizuka, an incredibly beautiful and famous idol girl. She is two years older than Rui, but they grew up together, and a special bond formed between them. Rui's exact feelings towards Shizuka are somewhat hard to fathom as well. At some points he seems utterly infatuated with her, while at others he seems interested in Tsukushi. It takes something highly amusing to crack Rui's solemn expression.</strong></blockquote>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"No beginning and no end"</span> - Ends Of Time</strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Ends Of Time (edited 10 August 2001).]</div>
