I also believe that love is something that no one person can fix the limits of, because it is as infinite and mysterious as the stars that it's written on. No one really should attempt to explain it, because it is one of the greatest natural phenomena in the world that all people should just have blind faith in.

In other words you should know when to quit - there's no point in insisting on a losing situation!<br><br>It is a well known fact that quotes do contradict each other at times. That's why we are made to argue for and against the validity of a quote in GP. The result? No quote is ever absolute - only true to a certain extent. But hey! They make for a great mouthful of words right. Apart from sounding really cool, they add a certain value to our lives!<br><br>Question time! Who are you Devil1976.

I believe that we are critical enough to know the limitations of a quote. Thanks anyway for the comments - shows that you actually ponder about those quotes.<br><br>By the way how did you find this place?<br>By means of scent?
