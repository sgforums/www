            <div class='col-md body'>A1<br><strong>EVERYTIME</strong><br>Written by: Ben Adams, Christian Ingebrigtsen, Mark Read<br><blockquote>"Everytime" is one of our favourite songs. It just came to us automatically I think, in three different places at three different times. Ben, Mark and I got together at Mark's house one night - Paul was working in a pub at the time 'cause we didn't have a record deal and we didn't have any money to live anywhere, so Paul had to work for us all! We were at home writing songs and we just came up with all these ideas we'd had a few days earlier and brought them together. We're really proud of this song, we really love it. When we recorded it, Lionel Richie came up to us in the studio and said he loved the song and really praised it.Another funny thing is that all the voices on the record are ours. We recorded 115 voices to make it sound like a gospel choir! - CHRISTIAN</blockquote>Mark: Lately I'm not who I used to be<br>Someone's come and taken me<br>Where I don't wanna go<br>If I knew exactly what I have to do<br>In order to be there for you<br>When you were feeling low<br><br>Ben: And all the things we ever wanted<br>Were once yours and mine<br>Now, I know we can revive it<br>All the love we left<br><br>Paul: Everytime I kiss I feel your lips and<br>Everytime I cry I see your smile and<br>Everytime I close my eyes I realise that<br>Everytime I hold your hand in mine<br>The sweetest thing my heart could ever find<br>And I have never felt this way<br>Since the day I gave your love away<br><br>Christian: Save me, I've fallen from my destiny<br>You and I were meant to be<br>I've thrown it all away<br>Now you're gone<br>It's time for me to carry on<br>But baby I just can't go on<br>Without you by my side<br><br>Ben: And all the things we ever wanted<br>Were once yours and mine<br>Now, I know we can revive it<br>All the love we left<br><br>Paul: Everytime I kiss I feel your lips and<br>Everytime I cry I see your smile and<br>Everytime I close my eyes I realise that<br>Everytime I hold your hand in mine<br>The sweetest thing my heart could ever find<br>And I have never felt this way<br>Since the day I gave your love away<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"No beginning and no end"</span> - Ends Of Time</strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Ends Of Time (edited 15 July 2001).]</div>
