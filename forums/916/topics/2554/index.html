            <div class='col-md body'>Let me think...<br>During the 2001 PU3 cruise, me and one of my friend were so worn out the first night that after attending the first morning activity - a talk, we went back to our cabin to catch up on some sleep.<br>Now here's the funny part, we woke up at about 10 am and realised that we missed breakfast! Because food was served only during meal time we did not find anything to eat. Famished we walked around like a pair of hungry ghosts in search of munchies. This was when we ran into one of our female classmate whom we later found out missed breakfast too! Desperate we checked our time-table and to our relief found out that one of the restaurant was serving tea...<br>at the restaurant we were surprised to see hordes of JIans from the Commerce and Arts faculty...well the time-table did say that they were having a galley tour. A teacher and Mrs Arul spotted us and came over. She was quick to point out that we over-slept and ushered us to a table. A little embarassed we did what she said and joined the other classes for the galley tour so that we can get some eats. Well...we finished the tour had a cookie and coffee and was in time for lunch! While we were chowing down on muffins, bread and cookies our Science counter-parts were just starting their tour of the galley.<br><br>This story may not seem very funny now, you have to be there to experience it, but its a shard of my memory that I will never misplace.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"No beginning and no end"</span> - Ends Of Time</strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Ends Of Time (edited 04 August 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the most taken for granted lesson in JI is PE. How I wish I was as fit as I was in JI now. Though the teachers push you real hard, it was worth it.

PE lessons kinda fun - it brings back fond memories of my secondary school days, namely ECA.<br>I seem to have some kind of problem with one of the new PE teacher though...he seems to be picking on me!<br>Yeah, Mr Chuah's still here and Mr Azman just joined us again.
