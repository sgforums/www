He lived in the States since then. He has practical and scientific mind yet warm and generous heart. He is a gentle person, but doesn??t like to talk much. Since he grew up in the states, he doesn't speak much Korean. He fell in love with Hee-Jin when he first met her as her doctor. He did everything to cure her as a doctor. Although he knows that Hee-Jin doesn't love him as a man but only respects him as her doctor, he expects nothing from her. He knows that Hee-Jin is fighting cancer only to go back to Jin-Heon. He is just happy that he can help her and take care of her. When Hee-Jin suddenly left America without completing her treatment period, he follows her to Korea. As her physician, he stays at the same hotel with her and continues taking care of her. His only concern is her health and happiness. He truly hopes that Hee-Jin will be fully recovered soon and finally get Jin-Heon back.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Gals out there, beware of these show and both the lead guys have high voltage of electricity that could electrocute you till you can't say a word.<br><br>Yet your attention can never leave Sam Soon because of her attitute, her words, and her character. She is plump but with dignity... and her own thinking... never to let guys manipulate her, although she is afraid that she will be left on the shelf. Hyun bin has officially been promoted in my hall of fame to the top this week ^^<br><br>Although Daniel Henney is so much more good looking, i know i prefer Hyun Bin type of guy, slightly childish, chauvinist, yet showing love in his own little way...... *Melt just by thinking*</span><br><br>Do remember to catch it on CHannel U, 10pm Monday to Friday! *hope i didn't get the timings wrong* Please correct me if i'm wrong.. I watched the dvds =X</div>
