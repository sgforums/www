              <p>This post in this all religions forum which I set up during my backsliding moments in life was to declare to God and all who visit this forum that I am a christian, again.</p>
              <p>I was born a taoist. I became a christian in my JC years. Something bad happened to me which made me doubt the goodness of God. I turned to Satan and became a Satanist for a few months. Then, for 2 and a half years, I was confused about what religions to believe in.</p>
              <p>A few months ago, God came to me in a dream, to tell me a message similar to this: how sad he is when I turn away from Him and chose to live in sins. God's presence was very real in that dream.</p>
              <p>When I woke up, I could still feel God's presence being with me. I had not felt a touch of God's presence at all for about over two years in my life. I talked to God that whole night, but did not actually believe that he had come back in my life.</p>
              <p>During my moments as satanist and as a person without religion, I had often remembered how close I used to be with Jesus and how loud I could hear His voice. However, somehow Jesus suddenly disappeared and I could not hear His voice. Many moments, even as a satanist and a person without religion, I did try to cry out to God but He never answered me. I never heard the sweet, gentle voice of Jesus that I used to be able to hear.</p>
              <p>I was doubtful that night that God really returned to me, but I had a sweet time talking to Him and listening to His voice. The next day, God remained with me, and told me to tell my family, friends and relatives who I had told I would not be a christian anymore that I am a christian, again.</p>
              <p>I was so happy to be with God, again. God's presence was with me for three days, and then, His presence was less felt, but I knew He is real and I knew that God is not evil. So I decide to follow Jesus, again. I only feel sorry that I doubt His presence for 2 over years in my life, and that I am so lacking in faith.</p>
              <p>God is faithful, and I am glad, very glad to be a christian, again. :)</p>
              <p>P/S: Some of you may remember my satan's message in which I talked about wanting to start a satanic coven here in Singapore. Well, for those of you, christians who spoke against me then, or prayed for me, thank you. I am glad to be back in the hands of the Trinity God, of the christian God, and of the Most High God of the universe.</p>
