              <p class="MainTitle"><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><img src="http://www.christianaggression.org/img/tactics_charity.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="188"><br><strong>Missionaries take advantage of those in need, <br>especially the poor and children, to convert them</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MainBody"><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Most Missionary organizations disguise their conversion efforts as charity organization. Often in the press, we hear about “faith-based initiatives” but that is just a euphemism for aggressive and violent conversion organizations. In the Western media, Missionaries are portrayed as true saviors who feed the hungry and nurse the sick.</span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">However, Missionaries do not do this for the good of humanity, but instead to convert people to Christianity. Missionaries have also decided to target the poorest for conversions, not because they are the neediest, but rather, because they can be easily bribed into changing their faith, and they can not easily report to the press the atrocities which the Missionaries have inflicted upon them.</span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Some people wonder fail to see the maliciousness of conversion through charitable acts. They say that though they are converting, Missionaries are also helping the poor which is more important. However, this is wrong because in times of need humans will often do anything if lured by material possessions. For example, prostitution is a despicable but existing profession because people are lured so much by money that they will sell their bodies. Similarly, one who is converted through “charitable” means is selling their religion and moral beliefs for material possessions. Just as prostitution is wrong and despicable, regardless of the prostitutes financial situation, conversion is also wrong regardless of the converts financially situation. Therefore conversion through charitable inducement is a forcible conversion.</span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Conversion should only happen through spiritual persuasion and not through the gifting of material possessions.</span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Below are some of the tactics which Missionaries use in the name of charity to convert:</span></p>
              </div>
              <blockquote>
              <div class="MainBody"><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>1. Gifts –</strong> By far the most common means of conversion is by buying the poor. In one tribal village, Missionaries promised the head of each household pair of nylon pants if he converted to Christianity and a motorbike if he converted his whole family. In a matter of a few months, the Missionaries had “spread the gospel” along with pants and motorbikes to the entire village.</span></div>
              <div class="MainBody">
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">To convert rich and middle-class non-Christians, Missionaries, who are well-funded by Western churches, buy their way in by giving money, computers to universities, and scholarships to children of influential officials.</span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">In other cases instead of feeding the starving, Missionaries give away a walkman with a tape of the Bible in their own language to brainwash them instead.</span></p>
              </div>
              <div class="MainBody">
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Mahatma Gandhi wrote the following on one incident which he witnessed: <br><em>"Only the other day a missionary descended on a famine area with money in his pocket, distributed it among the famine stricken, converted them to his fold, took charge of their temple and demolished it. This is outrageous."</em></span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>2. Adoption &amp; Child Sponsorship – </strong>Many innocent looking child sponsorship programs, such as Christian Children's Fund and World Vision, that often advertise on U.S. television are guilty of forced conversions. Many often say, “For 50 cents a day, you'll make a real impact on the life of a child and their community!” However, instead of nurturing these children as they claim, they use this money to buy children of poor non-Christian families (like slaves!). The children unwillingly are then separated from their mothers and are raised by Missionaries who brainwash them with Christian fundamentalist ideas. In other cases, Missionaries will “bribe” the entire family of the child to convert to Christianity.</span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>3. Jobs -</strong> In 1999, the Indian Church of Christ in Assam was caught red-handed for forcibly converting at least 14 Hindus. Over a period of six months the missionaries belonging to this Church offered money, jobs and other economic benefits to these extremely poor Hindus if they adopted Christianity. These Hindus were threatened with dire consequences if they revealed to anyone the circumstances under which they had been converted. However, two brave individuals who had been forcibly converted came to the police and told them the details of how Christian priests had lured them to their residence with the promise of jobs and money. In return for this favor, the priests then asked these individuals to convert to Christianity.</span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>4. Loans - </strong>When conversions by force not being possible, the methods that are applied are inducements and fraud. Inducements are called “social service” or “charitable” activities. In most cases, the social service benefits were provided only to those who agreed to convert. A loan given to a tribal is cancelled if he, along with his family, becomes a Christian. This inducement has been documented in Madhya Pradesh, though the practices that have been narrated are the ones that are a common practice all over India, and indeed in the rest of the world.</span></p>

              </blockquote>
              <div>
              <div class="MainBody">
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>Summary</strong><br>True social service should be done without expecting anything in return from the recipient. Otherwise it becomes a debased and at best can have an accidental redeeming value. If the motive is bad, then the social service has no real merit. There are many organizations that are doing noble service without expecting anything in return. And in offering such services, the Hindus are very actively involved.</span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">During his meetings with the Christian missionaries, Mahatma Gandhi had said that they are doing social service with the ulterior motive of conversions. He asked them to give up this offensive program. He also said to them that if this situation continued in a free India he would ask the foreign missionaries to leave the country.</span></p>

              <div class="MainBody">
              <div>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><img src="http://www.christianaggression.org/img/tactics_deception_missionary.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"><br><strong>Missionaries often use devious tactics to decieve<br>innocent villagers in order to convert them.</strong></p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Christian Missionaries on one hand preach high moral values, yet at the same time, they follow the lowest most despicable ones in order to convert people to their religion. Missionaries especially prey on the poorest, most rural folk under the guise of helping them out of poverty when in fact they have chosen to convert them because they are the most uneducated and therefore most likely to fall for their deception.</p>
              </div>
              <blockquote>
              <div class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>1. Fake Medicines – </strong>One common tactic employed by Missionaries is to give a sick villager fake medicines which have no medicinal value and ask them to worship in the name of their faith for wellness. After several days, the missionary gives the villager an identical dose of the medicine, but this time it is the real medicine. Then the missionary will instruct the villager to now pray to Jesus. Soon after, due to the medicine and not due to Jesus, the villager will be cured. The uneducated and gullible villager, however, will attribute his cure to Jesus and convert to Christianity.</div>
              <div class="MainBody">
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>2. Floating Idols –</strong> In rural villages in India, Missionaries and place a stone or metal idol of a Hindu Deity in bring a bucket of water. The statue will sink in the bucket. Next the Missionary bring a wax-coated idol of Jesus or Virgin Mary (though Christianity prohibits idols) and places that in the bucket. Due the wax-coat, the Christian idol will float. The Missionary will then conclude that because the Christian idol floated, it is “higher” and, therefore, better than the Hindu one. The uneducated villager, not knowing anything about buoyancy or density, falls for the Missionary’s ridiculous explanation and converts to Christianity.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>3. Fraudulent Saints –</strong> Often Missionaries will disguise themselves as religious leaders of the local religion and subtly attempt to convert the locals.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">The classic example was that of Robert de Nobili, a Jesuit from France, who came to India in the early 17th century. He adopted the saffron robe, started to live in a hut, squatted on the floor for conducting his discourses, became a vegetarian and gave up liquor, projected that he was a Brahmin saint from Rome and that the Bible was one of the lost Vedas (Hindu holy scriptures), and generally tried to pass himself as another Hindu sanyasi (saint). He was successful, and many Hindus came to him for spiritual reasons of which many he converted.</div>
              <div class="MainBody">
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Though Nobili used this tactic centuries ago, this deceitful and treacherous method is still in use by Missionaries even today.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>4. Blasphemy &amp; Impurity –</strong> Another tactic used my Christian is to somehow make the victim impure to their religion in some way. Then the Missionary will convince the victim that they can no longer practice their old faith due to their blasphemy, and therefore they must accept Christianity.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="MainBody">
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">The most infamous incident is known as the “Sepoy Rebellion”. In 1857, British General Lord Canning gave orders for the British to mix crushed cow and pig bones into the salt, butter and sugar rations of his Indian troops. In addition the British greased Enfield rifle cartridges with cow and pig fat. After some time, it was discovered by the troops that the rations they had consumed and the mouth-loaded cartridges had been contaminated with animal fats. This led many devout Hindu and Muslim to believe they were no longer pious members of their respective religions and so many were forced to convert. This outrage led to a massive war-like rebellion by the Hindu and Muslim troops which was eventually quelled by British.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">By making one impure to their religion, shows the paramount of hatred and disrespect that Christian Missionaries have for all other religions.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="MainBody">
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>5. Guilt &amp; Accusations –</strong> In 1975, Christian Missionaries were unsuccessful in converting the Panare Native Americans of the Colorado Valley. The missionaries had converted the Bible to their native language, but the peaceful and simple tribe could not understand the concepts of sin, guilt, war and plagues. So instead, the missionaries changed the Bible so that instead of the Romans and others, the Panare were responsible for the death of Jesus. One excerpt read:</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">”The Panare killed Jesus Christ, because they were wicked. Let's kill Jesus Christ, said the Panare. The Panare seized Jesus Christ. The Panare killed in this way. The laid a cross on the ground. They fastened his hands and his feet against the wooden beams, with nails. They raised him straight up, nailed. The man died like that, nailed. Thus the Panare killed Jesus Christ…</p>

He will burn also the Panare themselves. God will exterminate the Panare by throwing them on the fire. It is a huge fire. I am going to hurl the Panare into the fire, said God.”</p>

Missionaries seem to go to any extent to convert others, even if it requires gross deception and misrepresentation of their own holy book, the Bible will for the benefit of “winning souls”.</p>

False Identities –</strong> To convert a more educated and pious individual, a Missionary will pretend that he/she has a religious background that is the same as yours.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">For example, a Missionary who is targeting a Hindu may tell the Hindu that he (or a Christian friend or acquaintance) was once an orthodox Hindu, or that he had a solid Hindu education, a traditional Hindu family life, etc. This is almost always an outright lie so that you will open up to him. The hidden message that he is attempting to convey is that he came to believe in Jesus after knowing and overcoming all of the Hindu objections, and therefore, the Hindu he is targeting should also try to follow the same path, (which he never really took).</p>
              </div>
              <div class="MainBody">
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Usually, all that is necessary to expose this type of hoax is to ask him about various small details of Hindu life that any observant Hindu child would know, and see how he responds. In almost all cases, he will begin to hedge about the extent of his "background" and "Hindu knowledge". Unfortunately, most Hindu or targets of other religions are themselves not knowledgeable enough to be able to expose this type of deception and quite often Missionaries are successful.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>7. Secret Baptism –</strong> Another tactic that is deceptively employed by Missionaries is to “baptize” a victim without their knowledge. Then to reveal that they had been baptized and they must convert to Christianity. Though well-documented, it is little known that the most famous perpetrator was Mother Teresa and her sisters.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="MainBody">

Material aid was a means of reaching their souls, of showing the poor that God loved them. In the homes for the dying, Mother taught the sisters how to secretly baptize those who were dying. Sisters were to ask each person in danger of death if he wanted a ‘ticket to heaven’. An affirmative reply was to mean consent to baptism. The sister was then to pretend she was just cooling the person’s forehead with a wet cloth, while in fact she was baptizing him, saying quietly the necessary words. Secrecy was important so that it would not come to be known that Mother Teresa’s sisters were baptizing Hindus and Moslems.”</p>

Miracles –</strong> One of the most despicable ways of deception is how Missionaries pray on young rural school children. The school bus will stop suddenly. Young kids are told that they must pray 'Krishna' to try and restart it, but it fails to do so. Then they try 'Rama', then 'Guru Nanak', then 'Allah' etc. Finally, after exhausting the common names in India for spiritual authority, they are asked to say 'Jesus' all together, and at that time the bus suddenly starts. Everyone applauds the demonstration of Jesus' love and power.</p>

Miracle Boxes –</strong> Missionaries will place "Miracle boxes" are put in local churches: The gullible villager writes out a request - a loan, a pucca house, fees for the son's schooling. A few weeks later, the miracle happens, paid for by Western Christian donations. And the whole family converts believing it is a miracle of Jesus, making others in the village follow suit.</p>

              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Missionaries have set up thousands of Christian schools, colleges and other education institutions in India, through funding from foreign churches. These schools are simply established for subtle proselytization of the masses. Because many of these schools were set up in India under British rule, there is a common misconception that these schools have a higher standard of education and discipline.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">It is very important that all children be raised in their respective religious traditions. The first impressions are the most lasting, and they are what the children have to deal with throughout their lives. This is because early impressions are locked in the memory pattern of their subconscious minds. And Missionaries make use of this fact, to attempt to subtle convert children at a young age.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Though these institutions are open to people of any religion, they discriminate against non-Christian faiths and attempt to convert students by the following means:</p>

              <div>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>1. Curriculum Control -</strong> The entire education system in Guyana is controlled by that dominant class that promotes Westernized and Christian orientation. Having appropriated the power to define and delimit what is legitimate and not, this social bloc has monopolized the curriculum constructing it in a way that deliberately emphasizes western and Christian mores while at the same time deliberately excluding and de-emphasizing anything Hindu and Islamic in particular and Indian in general. By just going through the textbooks produced in Guyana one can hardly imagine that this is a country with a population that is half Hindu and Muslim</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">.<strong>2. Dominance of Missionary Schools - </strong>Over the years there have been successful attempts through the instrument of the state to de-emphasize Hindu and Muslim contributions to the development of education in Guyana while at the same time reinforcing and glorifying the Christian contribution. In 1976 all denominational schools (and other institutions) were required by the government of the day to change their names in order to de-link them from their religious and ethnic background. <br><br>While the government made sure that schools with Indian, Hindu and Muslim names complied with the requirement, Christian schools were never really affected. Thus Indian Educational Trust College became Richard Ishmael Secondary, Muslim Trust College became Brickdams Secondary school, Hindu college became Cove and John Secondary and Maha Sabha Secondary became Leonora Secondary. On the other hand, officially and otherwise, St. Stanislaus, St. Joseph's, St. Rose's, St, Agnes, St. John's, Sacred Heart, Stella Maris, Christ Church and others have retained their former names and their distinctive histories.</p>

Defamation -</strong> Under the guise of moral education in schools when a Hindu or Muslim child is forced to listen to a Christian functionary who by force of habit and dogmatic indoctrination must invariably, subtly and otherwise, denigrate the Hindu and Muslim traditions, this is in violation of the fundamental right and the civil liberty of the child.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Priests, nuns and teachers in Christian schools often defame and blasphemize Hinduism and other religions in their regular lessons. Hindu students who graduate from such institutions usually do not convert to Christianity, but through the influence of their Christian mentors, they end up mocking temples/mosques, scriptures and their own religious leaders for the rest of their lives.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>4. On Campus Prayers – </strong>Most Christian institutions have mandatory daily prayers. In many schools, non-Christian students are unjustly forced to attend Christian masses and recite Christian prayers.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">In other schools, non-Christians have their respective prayer sessions at the same time. However, the Christian prayers are held in air-conditioned chapels, while non-Christians wishing to pray must hold their services outside in the hot Indian sun. Naturally, many non-Christian students will decide to seek shelter in the chapel and are essentially forced to attend Christian services.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>5. Christian Only Teachers - </strong>Some Christian schools only employ Christian teachers and lecturers for all subjects. These Christian teachers often defame other religions and preach about Jesus Christ in the middle of physics, chemistry, etc. lectures to students who have come to learn their academic material and not about Chrstianity.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>6. Beatings –</strong> In Assam, India, at the English medium Ashapalli High School it is mandatory for all students to attend church every day before classes begin. Even after following the bigoted ways of this missionary school, the Hindu and Buddhist children are ill-treated and physically abused by the Christian staff of the school.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Kalindi Rani Chakma was a class VIII Buddhist student of the school; therefore she was abused mentally and physically on a daily basis by her Christian teachers. One such revolting incident has put her future academic career in jeopardy.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">One evening Kalindi Rani was called to the Principal, H. Lamare's residence due to alleged non-compliance of her daily routines. Once there Kalindi Rani was incessantly caned by Lamare. She begged for him to stop, but he continued to beat her because of his blind hatred for all Hindus and Buddhists. While he beat her he asked her, "Why don't you believe in Christ? What is the use of worshipping Buddha and Kali?</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">As a result Kalidi Rani went into shock and suffered several painful bruises throughout her whole body. She did not attend school until the day after the incident. When she went back to school, once again, Lamare abused her-both verbally and physically. She is now terrified of attending school.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Lamare did not punish Kalindi Rani because she did not complete her daily tasks. He beat her like a mad man because she was a heathen pagan who did not worship Christ. He has been given the divine sanction to do so by the Church establishment in India. Like other Christian Fundamentalists, he too was brainwashed to believe that followers of Christ are superior to the “heathen pagans”!</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><strong>7. Scaldings -</strong> In another display of Christian Missionary barbarism, a nun belonging to the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta, scalded four little Hindu girls with a hot knife.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Sister Francesca is the nun in charge of Missionaries of Charity's Mahatma Gandhi Welfare Center. A young Hindu girl named Kavery was playing inside the center with three other girls when the nun approached them and accused them of stealing money. The nun then heated a knife on an electric heater and pressed in on the hands of the four children.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">When Kavery's father, Kabiram, heard about the incident he went to the Bowbazar police station to file a complaint, but the police refused to register a case until the local residents forced them to do so. The head of Missionaries of Charity, Sister Nirmala, said that as a disciplinary action she has asked the guilty nun to discontinue her duties and take rest for the time being! Is this a punishment or a reward for following the torture of non-Christians?</p>

Children who attend these schools are subjected to physical abuse, verbal defamation of their respective religions and daily brainwashing of Christian fundamentalism. In the end, there is no reason to send children to such cruel and criminal institutions, as it is not one’s academic background but one’s morality that makes a person.</p>

Many of these hospitals operate under the guise of provide free or cheap medical care to rural and poor communities. However, most of these hospitals are providing these benefits not for goodwill but for conversion.</p>

Denial of Treatment –</strong> Often Christian hospitals publicize their services as pro-bono and for the needy and general public. However, when poor non-Christians require treatment, they are either force to convert or pay a large fee for the services. The incident below describes one shocking ordeal of how 17 Hindus because they refused to convert:</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">The Serang Christian Eye Hospital was set up in the Gumma block of Gajapati district by the Baptists of Canada to supposedly provide health care to tribals. The hospital is run by the Council of Christian Hospitals, which has its head office in Bangalore. The poorest of the tribals are misled into receiving free treatment at this hospital in exchange for their souls. The victims are operated upon then pressurized to convert to Christianity, or else told that they will have to cough up the payment for the operations.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Dr Sadguna Raju, a Christian convert and ophthalmologist attached to the Serang hospital, operated upon 27 patients on August 30 and 31 of 2000.<em>Out of these at least seventeen of them are now blind in one eye</em>. Dr Raju left Orissa a day after the operations and the tribal Hindus were given no post-operational care at all. Many times the arrangements for these "quickie" operations are makeshift and rampant malpractice increases the chance that patients could be infected in the operation theater itself. In fact at the post-operative stage the Christian doctors had even noticed the deterioration in the condition of some patients but they chose to do nothing about it as the tribals had refused to convert.</p>

Some of them have had to turn to begging for their livelihood after this devastating trauma.</p>

Fake Medicines – </strong>One common tactic employed by Missionaries is to give a sick villager fake medicines which have no medicinal value and ask them to worship in the name of their faith for wellness. After several days, the missionary gives the villager an identical dose of the medicine, but this time it is the real medicine. Then the missionary will instruct the villager to now pray to Jesus. Soon after, due to the medicine and not due to Jesus, the villager will be cured. The uneducated and gullible villager, however, will attribute his cure to Jesus and convert to Christianity.</p>

Intentional Denial of Medicines –</strong> In a New Tribes Mission (NTM) mission camp, many of the natives either died from starvation or from diseases transmitted by the missionaries for which they had no immunity against. In one such mission camp in Paraguay, the German anthropologist, Dr. Mark Munzel, reported that food and medicine were deliberately withheld by the missionaries. From a total of 277 natives in April 1972 only 202 survivors were left three months later. A US congressional report confirmed that 49% of the camp population had vanished!</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">In Bolivia, William Pencille, of the South American Missionary Society, was called in to help when white ranchers moving into the tribal areas came upon the Ayoreos. Pencille persuaded these natives to stop resisting the encroachment of the cattlemen and to settle on a patch of barren land beside a railroad tract. The natives, having no resistance to common diseases of the "modern" man, began to die. Throughout all this Pencille had the means to save the lives of these people. He had access to many modes of transport, including an airplane, and to funds which could easily have been used to buy medicines for them. Yet this is what he said: "It's better they should die. Then I baptize them (on the point of death) and they go straight to heaven."</p>

Secret Baptism – </strong>Another tactic that is deceptively employed by Missionaries is to “baptize” a victim without their knowledge. Then to reveal that they had been baptized and they must convert to Christianity. Though well-documented, it is little known that the most famous perpetrator was "Mother" Teresa and her sisters.</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><em>“For Mother (Teresa), it was the spiritual well-being of the poor that mattered most. Material aid was a means of reaching their souls, of showing the poor that God loved them. In the homes for the dying, Mother taught the sisters how to secretly baptize those who were dying. Sisters were to ask each person in danger of death if he wanted a ‘ticket to heaven’. An affirmative reply was to mean consent to baptism. The sister was then to pretend she was just cooling the person’s forehead with a wet cloth, while in fact she was baptizing him, saying quietly the necessary words. Secrecy was important so that it would not come to be known that Mother Teresa’s sisters were baptizing Hindus and Moslems.”</em></p>

Threats –</strong> Missionaries in addition to harming non-Christian patients in their hospitals will also mental harass patients who are already in physical pain. Below is an account of one such incident:</p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;"><em>“I remember a British friend of mine, an anthropologist researching the lore of a Nilgiris tribe a decade ago. One day he visited a village hospital to comfort a sick tribal. A troop of Christians from a particular denomination entered noisily, and kindly informed all the patients in the ward that unless they accepted Christ, they would soon die and go to hell for ever. Is this Jesus' love, or mental torture? Were the patients' human rights respected or violated?”</em></p>
              <p class="bodytext" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none; color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">- Michel Danino <br>(World Congress for the Preservation of Religious Diversity)</p>

They are only for though who are Christian and for those who not, they must forcibly convert in order to use their facilities. Christian Medical institutions and Missionaries show that other than Christians, they selfishly do not care for the well-being of anyone. Missionaries claim their lives are dedicated to “saving” others but we can clearly see that this “saving” only applies to Christians and for all others it very well may mean death.</p>

However, the sexual crimes against children and others outside the U.S. rarely make news. There are many cases of perverted Missionaries sexually exploited non-Christians and using this as a conversion tactic.</p>

Sodomy - </strong>On November 11, 2000 Indian police arrested David Berry, a 51 year old British national for brutally<em>sodomizing</em> and perpetrating savage sexual abuse on at least 11 minor Hindu boys in the holy temple town of Puri, Orissa. Berry was assisted in his heinous crimes by Bijoy Behera, a local schoolteacher and recent convert to Christianity. The police were forced to arrest the two Christians following a complaint lodged by a victim's father, Shree Banamali Senapati. Initially despite his lodging of the complaint, the police dismissed the case and refused to arrest the perpetrators, but were forced to act when an angry mob from the town besieged them and threatened dire consequences if the guilty were not punished. Shree Senapati was in tears as he related how Berry had sodomized his traumatized 12-year-old son at least eight times in his hotel room and elsewhere. The boy related to the police that Berry had forced him to have oral sex and kept him a virtual prisoner in the hotel room for hours. He also revealed that the Briton had sodomized at least 10 other school children, all below the ages of 12. The children were so traumatized by Berry's threats and Behera's beatings that they did not dare to confess to the horrors visited upon them until young master Senapati could take no more and broke down to his father.</p>

Stripping -</strong> On October 9, 2000 a group of converted Christians stripped a 12-year-old tribal Hindu boy and<em>paraded him naked</em> in Gasukia village after he opposed attempts to convert him to Christianity. He was taken to the village school and brutally <em>beaten</em> for "refusing to accept Jesus as his savior". This event naturally led to communal tension as the Hindus were outraged at the heinous crimes being forced on them.</span></p>

Rape –</strong> In January 2002, American Missionary Reverend Joseph Cooper and Sam Benson were expelled from India after Benson was accused of <em>raping</em> a young Hindu girl and Cooper was accused of making inflammatory remarks against Hinduism. Both currently walk free and Cooper is a preacher in Connecticut. Western Media only reported how Hindus had retaliated against Cooper but did not mention that he incited locals by saying Lord Krishna "spreads AIDS". American Pastor Benson Sam and his wife Sally also were found guilty of <em>abduction and rape of a minor girl.</em>The poor orphan girl named Laly had allegedly been sexually abused and harassed for four months at the Bible Christian Centre, which had resulted in the issue of non-bailable warrants against Sam Benson and his son.<br><br><strong>4. Rape and Murder - </strong>In February 2005, a 14-year old school girl in Orissa was raped and killed and her mutilated body thrown to a nearby railway crossing in Dhenkanal for refusing to convert to Christianity. “One day, three Christian leaders, Prashant Ghose, D. V. John Sarangi and Rabi Naik alias D'Souza came to my home and asked me to convert to their religion, Christianity,” Shri Bej said and added that they promised him help in the form of money and material in his only daughter Jyotirmayee’s marriage. However, Shri Bej turned down their proposal.<br><br>Then the local Church mandarins made a second attempt trying to allure Shri Bej’s wife Yasoda. “‘If you change over to Christianity, your daughter could get a good bridegroom as there are many well-to-do persons in our religion,’ Rabi Naik told me,” said a weeping Yasoda to Organiser and added that on that day, Shri Naik had threatened her with dire consequences if her family did not adopt Christianity.<br><br>Following this threat, Bej’s daughter Jyotirmayee, a student of Class VIII in Saudamini Smruti Vidyapeeth, was reported missing from her school. Jyotirmayee’s friends intimated her family about this. A concerned father went to the police station and reported the matter. But the local police did not take it seriously. The next morning, Jyotirmayee’s naked mutilated body was found on the railway tracks. With ample circumstantial evidence of Jyotirmayee being raped and murdered, the local people staged a road blockade demanding the arrest of the culprits.</span></p>

The Bej family is unable to understand the inaction on the part of police to arrest the culprits. The Bej family has accused the police station incharge, Jyoti Ranjan Mohapatra, and DSP Mandardhar Sahoo of conniving with the culprits and al</span></p></div></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div>
