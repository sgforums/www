              <p>Notice that the name of 'Lucifer' is called upon in the example given.
              If this ritual was being conducted between October 31-April 29, it
              would be Satan called upon instead.</p>
              <p>The ritual must have at least 4 participants to be performed correctly.
              There must be a Priest(ess), a celebrant, a deacon and at least 1
              person minimum to serve as the congregation.</p>
              <p><strong>Vestments</strong></p>
              <p><strong>ALTAR</strong>-The altar cloth should be Black and Red (to represent
              Satan) or Blue and White (To represent Lucifer)the candles should be
              black or brown and they shall sit in holders on the right and the left
              side of the idol. An Idol is defined as any statue, picture or other
              rendering that depicts Satan or a particular demonic spirit. There
              shall be a chalice of either wine, water or apple juice. There shall be
              a black plate upon which the hosts shall sit. A host in this context is
              defined as any wheat product (bread or crackers and such) that shall
              serve as the body of Satan. Some covens feel it is wrong to consume the
              body of Satan and so they substitute apple slices (to represent the
              fruit from the tree of knowledge) instead. Either way is acceptable.</p>
              <p><strong>PRIEST(ess)</strong>- Shall be robed in plain Black with a red girdle. He
              (she) shall have the book of the coven in which this ritual is to be
              hand written. A triangular hood with two eye slits is traditional
              however this is optional.</p>
              <p><strong>CELEBRANT</strong>-The celebrant wears a red robe or cloak and a black
              girdle is optional. The celebrant is armed with the weapon of the
              working. The weapon of the working is defined as any sword or dagger
              used to call the corners at the beginning of the ceremony. There shall
              be a pentagram inscribed on the floor (or as a rug for those of you who
              have carpeted ritual rooms) and the celebrant shall not leave the
              circle for the duration of the ritual.</p>
              <p><strong>DEACON</strong>-The deacon shall wear a black cloak or robe with a purple
              girdle optional. It is the deacon’s job to lead the congregation into
              the ritual room, light the candles and pass out the wine and host at
              the proper time. If anything goes wrong during the ritual (such as
              someone knocking on the front door, Dog Barking) it is the deacon's job
              to handle it.</p>
              <p><strong>CONGREGATION</strong>-Shall be dressed all in black with shoes removed.
              It is a good idea to provide mistles (booklets) containing the parts
              that the congregant shall say during the ritual.</p>
              <p><strong> THE RITUAL</strong> The ritual begins when all is set in place. The candles are lit and the
              deacon goes out to retrieve the congregation from an adjacent waiting
              area. The Priest and Celebrant should already be in place. The
              Celebrant inside the Pentagram and the Priest standing in the east (the
              altar should face south).</p>
              <p>Priest: <em>I
              proclaim this the sabbat night of the Cathedral of the Black Goat. Let
              this dwelling place be sanctified in the name of our masters......</em></p>
              <p><em>LUCIFER!</em></p>
              <p>(celebrant points sword east)</p>
              <p><em>ASTAROTH!</em></p>
              <p>(celebrant points sword south)</p>
              <p><em>Beelzebub!</em></p>
              <p>(celebrant points sword west)</p>
              <p><em>LILITH!</em></p>
              <p>(celebrant points sword north)</p>
              <p>CELEBRANT: <em>By the conquering worm that hath swallowed the sun, be their power mighty amongst us!</em></p>
              <p>PRIEST: <em>Lord
              Satan who art the shadow of the christian god whose presence cannot
              withstand thee, I speak these words of agony for thy glory. Thou art
              doubt and revolt, pride and knowledge. Thou livest again in us and
              around us though it be a troubled time when our enemy doth reign. Today
              thy sons and daughters are scattered and celebrate thy cults in their
              hideouts. But thy people have increased! We know that our dark Lord
              looks upon us with pride that thy true and orthodox ones are united.
              This world that denies thee thou inhabits, and the creator can only be
              blind with envy. Thou hast won Oh Satan--though anonymous and obscure
              for a few years yet. But the combing age shall proclaim thy revenge!
              Thou shalt be reborn again in the Anti-Christ!</em></p>
              <p><em>The science of mysteries, spurting suddenly like a black wave
              already quenches the thirst of the curious and uneasy. Men and Women
              see themselves mirrored in these waves of illusion which intoxicate and
              madden.
              Oh beautiful Satan, black goat of the world, I have fallen in love with
              thy tearstained face. The treacherous hordes of christians shall
              tremble before thy mighty hand!</em></p>
              <p>CONGRGATION: <em>AVE SATANAS!</em></p>
              <p>PRIEST: <em>Oh
              mighty Lord Satan, liberator of all, we implore thy presence amongst us
              HEAR OUR CALL! We come here in an attitude of worship, that thou might
              grace us with thy lordship.</em></p>
              <p>DEACON: <em>Lord of Darkness, Lord of Fire, in our hearts all others are forgotten for it is thee that we desire.</em></p>
              <p>PRIEST: <em>And
              if under a Black Moon know that thy witches and thy warlocks will
              faithfully dance unto thee. They shall feast unto thee and they shall
              drink unto thee!
              As it was, so now it be!</em></p>
              <p>ALL FEMALE PARTICIPANTS:<em>GLORY TO THE HORNS THAT IMPALE THE INFIDEL AND THE ROTTEN!</em></p>
              <p>ALL MALE PARTICIPANTS:<em>GLORY TO THE MILK OF THY BREAST, BLESSINGS TO SHOW US WE ARE NOT FORGOTTEN!</em></p>
              <p>ALL FEMALE PARTICIPANTS:<em>GLORY TO THY PHALLIC ROD!</em></p>
              <p>ALL MALE PARTICIPANTS: <em>GLORY TO THY HOOVES THAT SHALL TRAMPLE THE christian god!</em></p>
              <p>ALL PARTICIPANTS: <em>GLORY AND WORSHIP BE TO THEE, AS SATAN WILLS SO SHALL IT BE!</em></p>
              <p>PRIEST: <em>And
              so it is that Satan's progeny be scattered. However the sons and
              daughters of Lilith ye the very bloodline of Cain shall reunite. Though
              it is that we are alike in blood to the infidel, spiritually we are a
              different people. Ye it is the rite and responsibility of those who are
              chosen to rekindle the black flame and partake of thy essence.
              ('partake of thy gift' if apple is being substituted for the host)When
              human and Satan become one a power ensues that cannot be undone!</em></p>
              <p>(DEACON now lifts plate containing the host. CELEBRANT gives the plate
              a single tap with the sword saying the following incantation)</p>
              <p>DEACON:<em> By the power of this whack, be this bread thy essence black.</em></p>
              <p>(The DEACON then distributes the host to all the CONGREGATION serving then the PRIEST than the CELEBRANT and herself last)</p>
              <p>(DEACON now lifts Chalice containing wine. CELEBRANT gives plate a single tap with the following incantation)</p>
              <p><em>By the power of this thud be this wine our Master's  blood!</em></p>
              <p><em>And so thy Black Witches tread upon the earth with thy power in we that thy will can be.</em></p>
              <p>-At this time the ritual should receive a proper closing (ours is
              private), the candles should be extinguished, and the congregation
              should be led to a waiting area outside the ritual chamber.</p>
              <p>(more can be added to this ritual as proper closing however this is all that is necessary)</p>

              <p>This topic used to be sticky, as this forum used to be about Satanism. But since I decide to change this forum to include all religions other than Satanism, I had decided to unstick this thread.</p>
              <p>(I am still a Satanist, just that I believe that people are free to choose their own religions for themselves. And that having varieties of religions in this world to choose from is a good thing.)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Black Mass is actually a parody of the Catholic mass. Some rituals though can be perform alone, and best at that actually. Others might require a congregation. Black Mass orgies are actually up to the individuals. But you need to be certain if people just come for the orgies or are really interested in worshiping the Dark Lord. Not all Satanic websites rituals are "one ritual fits all."  You need to do some research and find what's most comfortable for you. </p></div>
