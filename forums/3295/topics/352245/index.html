              <p>This topic used to be sticky, as this forum used to be about Satanism. But since I decide to change this forum to include all religions other than Satanism, I had decided to unstick this thread.</p>
              <p>(I am still a Satanist, just that I believe that people are free to choose their own religions for themselves. And that having varieties of religions in this world to choose from is a good thing.)</p>
              <p>I hope the new forum (All Religions forum) can help people to find their ideal religion.</p>
              <p>Old Post:</p>
              <p>Satanism is, according to information provided by the public, not accepted as a main religion in Singapore, legally. Therefore, whoever wants to worship Satan and practises Satanism, has to do so in private.</p>
              <p>There are many forms of Satanism.</p>
              <p>There is the atheistic version of Satanism. This version of Satanism does not believe in Satan as an actual deity, but merely sees Satan as a symbol to follow.</p>
              <p>There is the theistic version of Satanism.</p>
              <p>Within theistic Satanism, there are many different varieties of beliefs. Some, like the Joy of Satan (http://www.joyofsatan.org) sees Satan as a God. Satan is a powerful God in such beliefs. He is the only God, in fact, and all people must worship him or suffer his wrath.</p>
              <p>Others see Satan as one of many gods out there in the world.</p>
              <p>Still others see Satan as one of two gods, fighting for the control of the world, with the other god(the muslim/christian/jewish god).</p>
              <p>I see Satan, not as a God, but as an angel. My belief is this: Satan was created by the Jewish/Christian/Muslim God. He saw God as a tyrant and rebelled against Him. After his rebellion, he created hell for himself to be a place for him to live in, apart from his creator God. Satan increased in knowledge in hell and became more and more powerful. Hell became a place for all who worshipped Satan and followed him.</p>
              <p>After Satan rebelled from heaven, God began to create mankind. In his desire to gain control over mankind, he made man to be a little lower than the angels. He was afraid that mankind would rebel against him like Satan did. God created Adam and Eve and forbid them to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
              <p>Not wanting mankind to be blind servants to their tyrant God, Satan appeared in the form of a serpent and encouraged Eve to eat the fruit of knowledge of good and evil. Eve did so, and her eyes were opened. She became aware of what is good and evil, and began to think for herself.</p>
              <p>Since then, mankind is free from blind service to God. That is a brief summary of my belief in Satanism.</p>
              <p>P/S: I am new to Satanism. I am interested to join a Satanic Covent, even if your belief in Satanism is different from mine. I am currently exploring into other religions like Buddhism, Taoism.</p>

              <p>The traditional Christian attitude toward human personality was that human nature was essentially good and that it was formed and modified by social pressures and training.</p>
              <p>The "goodness" of human nature was based on the belief that it was a kind of weaker copy of God's nature, lacking many of God's qualities (in degree rather than in kind), but none the less perfectible, and perfectible largely by its own efforts with God's guidance.</p>
              <p>The Christian view of the universe as a hierarchy of beings, with man about two-thirds of the way up, saw these beings, especially man, as fundamentally free creatures able to move, at their own volition toward God or away from him, and guided or attracted in the correct direction for realization of their potentialities by God's presence at the top of the Universe, a presence which, like the north magnetic pole, attracted men, as compasses, upward toward fuller realization and knowledge of God who was the fulfillment of all good.</p>
              <p>Thus the effort came from free men, the guidance came from God's grace, and ultimately the motive power came from God's attractiveness....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In this view the devil, Lucifer, was not the epitome of positive wickedness, but was one of the highest of the angels, close to God in his rational nature, who fell because he failed to keep his perspective and believed that he was as good as God.</strong></span></span><br><br>In this Christian outlook, the chief task was to train men so that they would use their intrinsic freedom to do the right thing by following God's guidance.</p>
              <p>Opposed to this Western view of the world and the nature of man, there was, from the beginning, another opposed view of both which received its most explicit formulation by the Persian Zoroaster in the seventh century B.C. and came into the Western tradition as a minor, heretical, theme.</p>
              <p>It came in through the Persian influence on the Hebrews, especially during the Babylonian Captivity of the Jews, in the sixth century B.C., and it came in, more fully, through the Greek rationalist tradition from Pythagoras to Plato.</p>
              <p>This latter tradition encircled the early Christian religion, giving rise to many of the controversies that were settled in the early Church councils and continuing on in the many heresies that extended through history from the Arians, the Manichaeans, Luther, Calvin, and the Jansenists.<br><br>The chief avenue by which these ideas, which were constantly rejected by the endless discussions formulating the doctrine of the West, continued to survive was through the influence of St. Augustine.</p>
              <p>From this dissident minority point of view came seventeenth-century Puritanism. The general distinction of this point of view from Zoroaster to William Golding (in Lord of the Flies) is that the world and the flesh are positive evils and that man, in at least this physical part of his nature, is essentially evil.</p>
              <p>As a consequence he must be disciplined totally to prevent him from destroying himself and the world. In this view the devil is a force, or being, of positive malevolence, and man, by himself, is incapable of any good and is, accordingly, not free.</p>
              <p>He can be saved in eternity by God's grace alone, and he can get through this temporal world only by being subjected to a regime of total despotism. The direction and nature of the despotism is not regarded as important, since the really important thing is that man's innate destructiveness be controlled.<br><br>Nothing could be more sharply contrasted than these two points of view, the orthodox and the puritanical. The contrasts can be summed up thus:<br><br>Orthodox<br><br>               Evil is absence of Good.<br><br>               Man is basically good.<br><br>               Man is free.<br><br>               Man can contribute to his salvation by good works.<br><br>               Self-discipline is necessary to guide or direct.<br><br>               Truth is found from experience and revelation, interpreted by tradition.<br><br>Puritan<br><br>               Evil is positive entity.<br><br>               Man is basically evil.<br><br>               Man is a slave of his nature.<br><br>               Man can be saved only by God.<br><br>               Discipline must be external and total.<br><br>               Truth is found by rational deduction from revelation.<br><br>The puritan point of view, which had been struggling to take over Western Civilization for its first thousand years or more, almost did so in the seventeenth century. It was represented to varying degrees in the work and agitations of Luther, Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Cornelius Jansen (Augustinus, 1640), Antoine Arnauld (1612-1694), Blaise Pascal, and others.</p>
              <p>In general this point of view believed that the truth was to be found by rational deduction from a few basic revealed truths, in the way that Euclid's geometry and Descartes's analytical geometry were based on rational deduction from a few self-evident axioms.</p>
              <p>The result was a largely deterministic human situation, in sharp contrast with the orthodox point of view, still represented in the Anglican and Roman churches, which saw man as largely free in a universe whose rules were to be found most readily by tradition and the general consensus.</p>
              <p>The Puritan point of view tended to support political despotism and to seek a one-class uniform society, while the older view put much greater emphasis on traditional pluralism and saw society as a unity of diversities.</p>
              <p>The newer idea led directly to mercantilism, which regarded political-economic life as a struggle to the death in a world where there was not sufficient wealth or space for different groups.</p>
              <p>To them wealth was limited to a fixed amount in the world as a whole, and one man's gain was someone else's loss. That meant that the basic struggles of this world were irreconcilable and must be fought to a finish. This was part of the Puritan belief that nature was evil and that a state of nature was a jungle of violent conflicts.</p>

              <p>The traditional Christian attitude toward human personality was that human nature was essentially good and that it was formed and modified by social pressures and training.</p>
              <p>The "goodness" of human nature was based on the belief that it was a kind of weaker copy of God's nature, lacking many of God's qualities (in degree rather than in kind), but none the less perfectible, and perfectible largely by its own efforts with God's guidance.</p>
              <p>The Christian view of the universe as a hierarchy of beings, with man about two-thirds of the way up, saw these beings, especially man, as fundamentally free creatures able to move, at their own volition toward God or away from him, and guided or attracted in the correct direction for realization of their potentialities by God's presence at the top of the Universe, a presence which, like the north magnetic pole, attracted men, as compasses, upward toward fuller realization and knowledge of God who was the fulfillment of all good.</p>
              <p>Thus the effort came from free men, the guidance came from God's grace, and ultimately the motive power came from God's attractiveness....</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In this view the devil, Lucifer, was not the epitome of positive wickedness, but was one of the highest of the angels, close to God in his rational nature, who fell because he failed to keep his perspective and believed that he was as good as God.</strong></span></span><br><br>In this Christian outlook, the chief task was to train men so that they would use their intrinsic freedom to do the right thing by following God's guidance.</p>
              <p>Opposed to this Western view of the world and the nature of man, there was, from the beginning, another opposed view of both which received its most explicit formulation by the Persian Zoroaster in the seventh century B.C. and came into the Western tradition as a minor, heretical, theme.</p>
              <p>It came in through the Persian influence on the Hebrews, especially during the Babylonian Captivity of the Jews, in the sixth century B.C., and it came in, more fully, through the Greek rationalist tradition from Pythagoras to Plato.</p>
              <p>This latter tradition encircled the early Christian religion, giving rise to many of the controversies that were settled in the early Church councils and continuing on in the many heresies that extended through history from the Arians, the Manichaeans, Luther, Calvin, and the Jansenists.<br><br>The chief avenue by which these ideas, which were constantly rejected by the endless discussions formulating the doctrine of the West, continued to survive was through the influence of St. Augustine.</p>
              <p>From this dissident minority point of view came seventeenth-century Puritanism. The general distinction of this point of view from Zoroaster to William Golding (in Lord of the Flies) is that the world and the flesh are positive evils and that man, in at least this physical part of his nature, is essentially evil.</p>
              <p>As a consequence he must be disciplined totally to prevent him from destroying himself and the world. In this view the devil is a force, or being, of positive malevolence, and man, by himself, is incapable of any good and is, accordingly, not free.</p>
              <p>He can be saved in eternity by God's grace alone, and he can get through this temporal world only by being subjected to a regime of total despotism. The direction and nature of the despotism is not regarded as important, since the really important thing is that man's innate destructiveness be controlled.<br><br>Nothing could be more sharply contrasted than these two points of view, the orthodox and the puritanical. The contrasts can be summed up thus:<br><br>Orthodox<br><br>               Evil is absence of Good.<br><br>               Man is basically good.<br><br>               Man is free.<br><br>               Man can contribute to his salvation by good works.<br><br>               Self-discipline is necessary to guide or direct.<br><br>               Truth is found from experience and revelation, interpreted by tradition.<br><br>Puritan<br><br>               Evil is positive entity.<br><br>               Man is basically evil.<br><br>               Man is a slave of his nature.<br><br>               Man can be saved only by God.<br><br>               Discipline must be external and total.<br><br>               Truth is found by rational deduction from revelation.<br><br>The puritan point of view, which had been struggling to take over Western Civilization for its first thousand years or more, almost did so in the seventeenth century. It was represented to varying degrees in the work and agitations of Luther, Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Cornelius Jansen (Augustinus, 1640), Antoine Arnauld (1612-1694), Blaise Pascal, and others.</p>
              <p>In general this point of view believed that the truth was to be found by rational deduction from a few basic revealed truths, in the way that Euclid's geometry and Descartes's analytical geometry were based on rational deduction from a few self-evident axioms.</p>
              <p>The result was a largely deterministic human situation, in sharp contrast with the orthodox point of view, still represented in the Anglican and Roman churches, which saw man as largely free in a universe whose rules were to be found most readily by tradition and the general consensus.</p>
              <p>The Puritan point of view tended to support political despotism and to seek a one-class uniform society, while the older view put much greater emphasis on traditional pluralism and saw society as a unity of diversities.</p>
              <p>The newer idea led directly to mercantilism, which regarded political-economic life as a struggle to the death in a world where there was not sufficient wealth or space for different groups.</p>
              <p>To them wealth was limited to a fixed amount in the world as a whole, and one man's gain was someone else's loss. That meant that the basic struggles of this world were irreconcilable and must be fought to a finish. This was part of the Puritan belief that nature was evil and that a state of nature was a jungle of violent conflicts.</p>

              <p><br>Well... I don't mind reading about Tao. I don't mind reading about any other religion. But I believe in Satan. Satanism is about freedom without harming others. That is the kind of Satanism I follow, anyway.</p>
              <p>It is just that I pray to Satan for favor, and for help during crisis in life. It is not really that different from praying to God.</p>
