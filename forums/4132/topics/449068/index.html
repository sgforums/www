              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Restroom Association (Singapore) has recommended that all public toilets should have a mandatory rating scheme.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The move came after a survey commissioned by the association found that eight in 10 respondents agree with the move.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The survey was conducted in December last year by Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Business and Accountancy students.<br><br>Currently, toilets are graded using a voluntary system called the Happy Toilet Programme.<br><br>One
               third of survey respondents want continued government intervention and 
              enforcement, although four in 10 felt that users should be responsible 
              for clean toilets.<br><br>However, only 18.2 per cent would consider 
              reminding others who dirty the toilets. Even fewer - 15.2 per cent - are
               willing to inform errant owners or cleaners to clean up dirty loos.<br><br>The
               survey also found that coffeeshop and hawker centre toilets are the 
              dirtiest, followed by those at bus interchanges, parks and MRT stations.<br><br>Male toilets were also found to be dirtier than female ones.<br><br>The survey also looked at what users wanted in terms of toilet design.<br><br>Nearly half - 43.6 per cent - said cubicle space was too tight.<br><br>Respondents
               also asked for better positioning of wash basins, soap dispensers, hand
               dryers and litter bins. For example, placing litter bins nearer to 
              urinals might solve the problem of littering in urinals.<br><br>Apart 
              from recommending a mandatory rating scheme, the Restroom Association 
              said it will also work with the government and toilet owners to look at 
              better toilet design guidelines, and specialised training of restroom 
              attendants.<br><br>It also wants to work with the Public Hygiene 
              Council, the Singapore Kindness Movement and the Keep Singapore 
              Beautiful Movement on more effective public awareness and engagement.<br><br>Tan
               Puay Hoon, the president of the Restroom Association (Singapore), said 
              it also wants to have stronger messages in public education campaigns.<br><br>Tan
               said: "To highlight that a dirty toilet, it can be a life-threatening 
              issue which a lot of us have never thought about. For example, if the 
              floor is wet and you step on it and you slip and you fall, once you hit 
              your head, it can be a life-threatening problem. <br><br>"Another 
              example is, (for) the one handling food, if they go to a dirty toilet 
              and they don't have the facilities and amenities to wash their hands, 
              when they come back to prepare the food, (they may contaminate the food)
               - this can be another life-threatening issue."<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              </p><h1>Mandatory toilet rating unfair       </h1>
              <p>
              </p><p>THE call by the Restroom Association Singapore for a mandatory 
              cleanliness rating system for public toilets (''Institute rating system 
              for loos''; last Thursday) seems to impose the onus of maintaining clean
               restrooms on the owners and operators of these facilities.</p>
              <p> Foodstalls are currently graded by the National Environment Agency on
               hygiene standards, but it would be unfair to implement the same for 
              restrooms.</p>
              <p> Foodstall operators have full control over the hygiene standards of 
              their stalls, but maintaining the cleanliness of restrooms is a shared 
              responsibility of both users and operators.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>The state of a toilet very much depends on its users. Soiled paper 
              strewn over toilet floors is a common sight, and arises from the 
              inconsiderate behaviour of users.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is costly and unfair to force owners to 
              hire cleaners to stand by their toilets and clean the mess created by 
              irresponsible users.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The provision of restrooms is a value-added 
              service for patrons, who choose to dine at a particular eating place not
               just because its toilets are cleaner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Restroom operators are also not ready for a 
              mandatory rating system as there are few comprehensive training 
              programmes to help them meet the required standards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, an audit system requires constant spot checks by the relevant bodies, and these are costly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A better solution is to encourage restroom users to be socially responsible through education and raising public awareness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Provide call buttons for users to alert 
              cleaners to restrooms that need cleaning after a mess has been created. A
               tip box could even be placed at the side of the call button.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the same time, offer cash incentives to operators who maintain clean restrooms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone has a part to play if we yearn for cleaner toilets in Singapore.</p>

              <h1>Reminders on restroom etiquette    </h1>
              <p>THE bid by the Restroom Association Singapore to improve the state of
               public toilets is encouraging (''Institute rating system for loos''; 
              last Thursday).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Restrooms are communal spaces and
               common etiquette dictates that we should keep them clean. We are put 
              off by smelly and dirty restrooms, and the onus of keeping them clean 
              should be on users, and not entirely on the cleaners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here are some things users can do:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Do not waste toilet paper and hand soap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Stand close to the toilet bowl or urinal to avoid dirtying the floor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Sit on the toilet seat if you are unsteady on your feet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Sanitary napkins should not be flushed down the toilet; wrap them up and put them in the pad disposal bin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Squat only on squatting toilets; pedestal toilets are only for sitting on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Don't dirty the toilet seat, and if you do, clean it properly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Flush when you are done, and lock the cubicle door so as not to embarrass others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Do not peek under the doors if the cubicle appears to be occupied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Wash your hands thoroughly after you are done, and do not litter in the restroom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The cliche that it takes two hands to clap 
              applies to restroom etiquette as well. If we observe good toilet 
              practices, it will make the work of the cleaners less onerous, and 
              restrooms more pleasant.</p>

              </p><h1>Owners don't know standards required</h1>
              <p>
              </p><p>THE problem of dirty toilets in coffee shops will remain unresolved 
              if we continue to point fingers (''Institute rating system for loos''; 
              March 15).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no way to catch a user 
              messing up the toilet, especially if he is locked inside the cubicle. So
               a sustained public education effort is the only way to reach out to 
              such people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately, and unfortunately, the responsibility lies with restroom owners and operators.</p>
              <p>The National Environment Agency (NEA) has a crucial role and should 
              set and make known the hygiene standards it expects in coffee shops, and
               enforce them rigorously islandwide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the cost of toilet maintenance goes up, as a result of higher hygiene standards required, so be it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Restroom owners and operators can either charge an appropriate usage fee, or include it in their product and service charges.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To create a level playing field, no coffee shop should be allowed to get away with dirty toilets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise, owners and operators of such 
              toilets may deliberately save on maintenance, and price their products 
              and services lower than those of their competitors. This would 
              disadvantage those who put in much effort and money in toilet 
              maintenance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the NEA's stringent enforcement for 
              higher standards of cleanliness, competent cleaning companies will have a
               viable option to provide quality service to coffee shops. This is 
              currently lacking because coffee-shop operators do not know the 
              standards required of them.</p>

              </p><p>I FULLY agree that operators who charge the public for using 
              restrooms must keep them clean at all times (''Institute rating system

              <p> </p>
              <p>Many public restrooms are not 
              well maintained. I do not mind paying more for a clean restroom, but not
               for the ones at People's Park Complex, where patrons are charged 20 
              cents to use toilets that are poorly maintained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poorly kept restrooms must be upgraded. Once a restroom is upgraded, keeping it clean is easier.</p>
