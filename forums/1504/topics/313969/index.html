              <h1 class="clr">Handphones will have to stay switched off on flights</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: You may soon be able to chat and send SMS on your mobile phone as you zoom from one European city to another.</p>
              <p>But, if you want to shout "I’m leaving on a jet plane" while flying
              from Singapore to Europe, or from the Republic to anywhere within Asia,
              you may have to wait awhile longer.</p>
              <p>A check with six
              international carriers — Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa, KLM
              Royal Dutch, Qantas and Singapore Airlines (SIA) — flying directly to
              destinations within Europe from the Republic revealed that they would
              not be allowing the use of mobile phones on their flights any time soon.</p>
              <p>This
              is despite the European Commission’s paving the way on Monday for
              in—flight use of mobile phones across the continent, when it introduced
              new rules harmonising the legal and technological conditions regarding
              their use. The 27 European Union member states have six months to
              comply with the new rules.</p>
              <p>Airlines such as Air France and
              Qantas, which are rolling out the use of mobile phones on their
              flights, have limited their use to some flights within Europe and
              Australia respectively.</p>
              <p>While the subject is on the radar screens
              of airlines and aviation regulators across Asia, they will be watching
              the rollout in Europe with interest before deciding to introduce the
              use of such devices, say industry observers.</p>
              <p>For example, flag
              carriers may have to comply not just with their own countries’
              regulations, but also of those they would be flying over, noted
              Assistant Professor Terrence Fan of the Singapore Management University.</p>
              <p>Some
              airlines have been quick to announce plans allowing the use of mobile
              phones on their flights. European low—cost carrier Ryanair, for
              example, will fit 20 planes with mobile—phone technology by June,
              followed by the rest of its fleet, reported The Times.</p>
              <p>Last
              month, Emirates said it would be investing some US$27 million (S$37
              million) to equip its fleet with a system allowing mobile phones to be
              used safely. The service will only be activated when the aircraft is at
              cruising altitude, and cabin crew will have full control over the
              system, including the ability to prevent voice calls at certain times,
              such as during night flights.</p>
              <p>For passengers who need to make
              urgent calls but can’t use their mobile phones, the option now is to
              use a plane’s satellite phones. For example, a passenger on SIA will
              need to pay a minimum of US$5.90 for the initial minute, and US$0.59
              for every six—second block thereafter.</p>
              <p>While they agree that
              there is a high demand among passengers to use mobile phones on
              flights, aviation analysts TODAY spoke to were divided over when they
              would be rolled out in Asia.</p>
              <p>Unlike the EU, there is no single
              aviation regulatory body on the continent to implement a common
              framework allowing the use of mobile phones, said Assistant Professor
              Fan.</p>
              <p>"Technically, it can be done. But, I don’t know if there is enough political will. It could drag on for some time," he added.</p>
              <p>Flight
              International regional managing editor (Asia) Nicholas Ionides,
              however, is more optimistic, saying travellers would be using mobile
              phones on flights here in the "next few years".</p>
              <p>"The use of
              mobile phones in flight is inevitable and will become a fact of life.
              It’s just a matter of time, and getting the regulators on board," he
              said.</p>
              <p>Even if the regulators are agreeable, the final call may still be with the airlines.</p>
              <p>"You don’t want phones ringing and people talking while you are sleeping on a flight," said aviation consultant Prithpal Singh.</p>
              <p>Said
              an SIA spokesperson: "This is a matter still under study and a decision
              has yet to be made. We will decide on whether or not to introduce such
              a service onboard based on the needs and preferences of our customers,
              as well as the social implications and regulatory requirements." —
