              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Apologies the below mail is an expression of an incident that had make me totally helpless on how I can assist a visiting friend to <span id="lw_1243094191_2" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span>, a country I am so proud of. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">This visiting friend who is a graduate has no criminal records in both China and Singapore was detained and deported based on immigration officer stringent assessment at moment of time which had no doubt keep Singapore away from overseas criminals on 23 May 2009 at approximately 10 pm via CA969.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Feeling so excited with an overseas friend visiting me on a Friday night, had ended up being so helpless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">She was first in Singapore during last Christmas and New Year period. And was impressed of Singapore night life, cleanliness, safety, friendly and caring people she met. This poor girl was so cheered up after the first visit and had gained back confidence in life whose beloved father deceased on the very same year. Unfortunately, these good memories she had had prompted her extension of each stay in Singapore though of her tight budget which I assumed may have resulted in today's incident. Praises at home for Singapore to friends with no doubts had prompted her to join friends on every possible trip. But in this incident, I could feel the sadness, helplessness and uncertainly when I managed to communicate with her just at moment when she was escorted to the departure flight back to <span id="lw_1243094191_3" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Beijing</span> on 23 May 2009 at 09:32 via CA976. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">My stay at airport from being so excited from 9pm, to being totally helpless in need of advised and assistance to a visiting friend till morning with her departure, with regardless of endless call to Changi airport immigration T1 East hotline at 62148010, which was not answered throughout the period, I was so helpless on how I can assist a visiting friend from overseas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Do admit my negligence to Singapore Immigration procedures practiced at <span id="lw_1243094191_4" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Changi Airport</span> . She, with a valid visa from Singapore Embassy in Tianjin China, a flight ticket to and return, and of a budgeted visit to Singapore with approximately S$4k in cash was rejected entrance due the frequency of visits which is less then 3 months from her last, as enlightened by an immigration officer at hotline in the morning at 8 am. I am sad and lost, if I had the knowledge, I would have advised her of this visit. Which had resulted in her future entrance to Singapore as advised.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Even though of feeling down and helpless at the moment, I would like to praise and thanks the professional services provided by Changi Airport T1 information counter who keeps answering to my endless seek for help throughout the night and to Ministry of Foreign Affair of advises at time I am totally lost. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">I too sincerely apologized to Changi airport immigration T1 West hotline, Departure hotline and an unknown immigration department who had expressed great depressed with my endless call throughout the night begging for help and assistance.</span></p>

              <p>Well, if its base on my point of view. It just somehow make me think this way, maybe due to the nature of my sideline.I've seen such issues &amp; believe me, there is more to it. I do not know if your letter is written to the bese of your knowledge or it is to divate attention base on the innocence it projects as the way you write is to cover up certain things, which not all ppl will know or understand unless they hv some knowledge in it. (If it is as what i assume,i may be wrong.)</p>
              <p>You want me to "pi cha" your lobang? Or you want me to explain my views?(which this might show many ppl the insight of your intention) ICA views?Or you want me to share wid you how the whole thing operate?</p>
              <p>Or you want me to keep it as it is, base on the innocence your letter to favour your situation,giving you the benifit of doubt.</p>
              <p>*To TS: Of cos i hv limited knowledge, but i believe base on my 4 years of experiance, maybe i can share wid you better foolproof way.</p>
              <p>EDITED:The SGD$ 4k is only part of it, you gotta hv something xtra to make it seems more real; as per from your writing, there is already something that i see that let the cat out of bag.Phillipino, thais &amp; vietnumise ongoing rate is only taking SGD$2k nia.. why need $4k so much for prc? She hv to pay higher when she step foot on SG lea..</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The moment I just need to be advised. Or could it be otherwise like abusing of their rights and authorities?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are all visitors deported not knowing what had been wrong, and get assistance from ICA. Why ICA is not providing any advises or assistance during the approximate 12 hours? What if it is due to minor problems/misunderstanding that can be resolved during the 12 hours?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Just feeling like, an innocent on the road who look like a criminal, have their heads put on chopping board, with mouth covered, and executor wearing ear phone with full burst of music. As if I am not going let you to talk, and even if you manage I am not going to hear. And chop off your head. </span></p>

              <p>I gv u the benifit of doubt that she is your closed friend cos u will get so worked up with her issue, but why is that she get the visa herself?(meaning that she is not under tour group.)</p>
              <p>Is true that immigrations check for ppl travelling into singapore for $, because again&gt; some ppl might make that as a exucse to work during their so called "free &amp; easy" tour. Why u dun be here sponserer?</p>
              <p>Do you know there are a type of "ah-long version's ä¿�å§† sysdicate" that work together? Some ppl that wan to earn $ using social visa pass long know custom will check for money,  then (1)over their country,they pass her money, when reach singapore,(2) sg ppl collect from them with an 10-25% of the amount.These ppl are using the loopholes.</p>

              <p>All over the world, thousands, if not millions of people travel and pass through immigration checkpoints everyday. Immigration Officer serves, not one, but thousands or millions of travellers. <br><br>Do you seriously expect them to serve you on hands and feet individually - a personalised service? Do you expect Singapore immigration Office to be special from the rest of the world, opening 24 hrs a day?<br><br>If it is minor problem, your friend will not be detained - simple as that. Your friend has breached the term of travelling into Singapore- simple as that. <br><br>If it is other minor problem like sickness or crime - it will be handled by the ambulance/hosiptal and the police respectively - and not by the immigration Officer or by the Immigration Office.</p>
              <p>Like anywhere else, have the right doccuments ready and meet the requirements of the host country - pass through else you will be detained. <br><br>If I go to Shanghai and break its immigration law, do you think Shanghai, China will be lenient and kind to me just because I like Shanghai so much?</p>
