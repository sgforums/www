            <div class='col-md body'>Fast reply? no lar..no mood to work...hahaha<br><br>well it is true that u will be trained to do those..but not all. U will be asked or assessed which are ur areas of strength. U may go to A&amp;P ( Airframe &amp; Powerplant) or Avionics N Instruments, later when u garner enough wrinkles n time &amp; purple bar , u may opt for DAE ( Defect Analysis Engineer ).<br>Even though u may be an expert at Electronics N avionics but u cannot sign OFF nor repair ,say a FMS problem if you are rated A&amp;P. Means u only troubleshoot HUll n Engine. Because tat is wat is on your rating!<br><br>Thing is u will suffer a bit at first as all rookies do..but good thing abt LAE is you will be out there, releasing planes, fillin out Techlogs, SNAGGING planes, sianing kebayas, ( many kebayas kena sianed by LAEs n end up...MARRIED!)<br>u may also ask to fly as SPANNER or attached to line. so u dun get caught up in workshop! ( if thats wat u want )..<br><br>Besides SIAEC, STA ( ST Aero &amp; Engineering ) , SASCO ,EAGLES aviation need AME or LAE as well. do a google...under careers. After u get ur rating &amp; LAE license U may work for any airlines , or with MRo like Haeco, Techo which are companies in HKG, XIAMEN, CHINA, or GAMCO or EK ENG in Arab states. $$$<br>of coz in Singapore u need to be type rated after ur Air Law, U will know things like SAR,JAR,FAR, EASA 147,66,21, etc...HF&amp;EM..<br>Salary? it depends..OT is what the guys aiming for!<br>jus my 0.02cts!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sarius:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey thanks for the fast reply!<br><br>Yea I know there's a bond of 5 years.<br><br>I read on the website that I will "acquire the skills to service and maintain modern jet planes, advanced computer-controlled engines, sophisticated flight computer systems and electronic flight instrumentation."<br><br>It sounds like a really challenging role...which is of course what I'm looking for!

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow!<br><br>Thanks for that bunch of info megatron! It seems like I really did find the right place and people to ask  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Are you an LAE by any chance? Cos you seem to know an awful lot about what they do! Feel free to add more info if you happen to remember some more.. hehe<br><br>Hmm... I guess my mind is more or less made up. Thanks again for the advice bro!<br><br>Kopiosatu, yea I did think about training to be a pilot... but I am still more inclined towards engineering.<br><br>How's the working environment/culture in SIA? I heard there are alot of politics... but then again... there're politics everywhere you go right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
