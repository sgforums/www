              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #ff0000;">From my friend...</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To whomever this may concern,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am writing in today due to a recent devastating experience in a local (Singapore) airline ticketing company branch of China Eastern Airlines located at 138 Robinson road #18-01, The corporate office Singapore 068906. On the afternoon of 26<sup>th</sup> October 26, 2009, I went down to assist my friend in the payment of the fee incurred due to the postpone of the air ticket that he had with the airline company.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Much to my dismay, the service that I was presented was least expected from a reputable airline company since it had been established for quite a while. The staff that I was served by, Mary, not only suspected the creditability of my card in the presence of my identification card as a proof of my identity; was rude and even commented that it was her lunch hours rudely and left without settling the payment or the matter itself when I requested to speak to the manager for her rude display of attitude despite her frontline position.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">She even rudely commented that it was her lunch hours and me, as a customer whom she is attending to with her full of attitude service, had to wait for her to return from her lunch just to settle a case that was a mere matter of minutes if she were to really attend to the matter itself. May I ask, what about a customer like me who had wasted my lunch hours just to rush down to the venue to try to settle the matter for my friend? Was my lunch hour any less valuable than hers? Was the money that I would be paying to the airline company not even worth anything? Or was it the standard procedures that the airline company had in the first place?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I was utterly disgusted by the service that was rendered to me or perhaps that had been the way that this airline company had been treating their customers all along.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I understand that customers may not be right every time but in such a prestige customer service environment, one would expect the least level of customer service.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I wonder if the company is competence enough to manage their staffs but the fact shown otherwise. Not only the manager was not around during lunch hours, there were neither presence of personnel whom I can speak to in the absence nor someone to oversee the overall operation in the absence of the manager whom was on shift.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I really hope that there is a very good explanation to what I had experienced or perhaps that is what you would called it as “uniquely Singapore” especially when it involved a foreign friend of mine.</span></p>
