            <div class='col-md body'>i've been in the IT line even since i've left sec school but i'm now eyeing for a change in the industry to gear myself more towards aviation.<br>ever since i've learnt and heard about the perils of a commercial pilot i've been yearning and wanting to be come one some day...<br><br>how ever i don't have much qualifications sadly... i have o levels but was only enought to get me to ite which i took the higher nitec in IT and then graduated from there to go to ns and then early this yr started on a couple of IT field jobs in the industry... not too long ago i quitted... gonna be 22 soon end of this yr. currently studying part time dip in NYP in eng. infor<br><br>i'm now thinking of taking up a full time dip next year which hopefully i'd be able to get into using my itc cert... i'm actually eyeing the dip in aerospace electronics in sP, mechatronics and ECE in NP and also nyp and also in TP, mechatronics and electronics... but i need yr advice guys and (gals... i've noticed and browsed thru the threads) on which pathway and course i should apply for and pursue... the above mentioned are the only available courses that i'm applicable and eligible to apply for given my qualifications of itc in iT. or at least those are the relevant ones...<br><br>i don't really have gd grades for my ite with gpa as low as 2 and below but i applied for my part time dip with nyp using this itc. so i'm not that optimistic... hopefully though... any1 of u know of any1 that entered any poly course with these grades? ful time ones i mean.. the last time i tried tp i got rejected. that was way back in ... does it help if i have working experience or i have some modules that i did pretty gd in my 1st sem of part time dip that i can prove to the course managers that i can study in another course in another field totally?? coz frm what i 've found out and researched i can't...<br><br>coz if u see the modules for mechatronics for the various polys its only in thired year that i get to specialise in aviation or aeronautics whereas for aerospace electronics in sp and als othe elcetronics and comp eng in NP,<br>second year can go into aero specialisation alerady...<br>i've already applied for mechatronic in nyp full time<br>with mechatronics i can at least have some hope of entering either ntu or nus mech eng deg which has aero specialisation. but with electronics i don't stand any chance frm what i've found out on their website. mechatrnoic has higher chance so do u think is the right choice to put mechatrnoic first choice and then followed by electronics or ... how?<br>coz electrnoics i can't specialise in anything in nus or ntu they don't have any thing to do with aero in their deg programmes.<br><br>i'm also thinking of takin my o levels again but sad to say i'v ejust learnt that i an't take pure physics as private candidate if  i were to take eng , maths and comb sci of phy and chem + pure physics and another subje prob geog or add. maths...<br>if so or true... then is there anyway like any private instituition that will allow or write me some docs to prove to moe that i really am worthy of takin physics pure? i didn't take pure physics during my sec sch but only phy chem as comb sci...<br>and is it possible to take add maths and norm maths?<br><br>sorry rather long i think i better stop now as no pt i keep typing but pple don't wana read so long story...<br>anyway if i don't get to be a pilot i'd still be happy to be at least some personnel workin in the aviation industry say in sia or caas or sia engineering or sats... prob in some engineering stuff...<br>hope u guys and gals can give me some true advice or some pilots or aviation enthusiast ooutt there...<br><br>thanks for reading if u had... no need to ans all just some would more than be appreciated...</div>
