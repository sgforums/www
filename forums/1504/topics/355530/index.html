              <p>Hi, my friend and I are interested in joining the Singapore youth flying club, and would like to know what our chances of getting in are. How many people get in annually?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span></strong></p>
              <p>I am a bit shortsighted, about 300 degrees in each eye, and I'm also overweight (but not obese, BMI about 27 &gt;_&gt;) I also have a history of asthma, last attack was maybe 2 years ago. </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My friend</span></strong></p>
              <p>My friend is a little more complicated. He has perfect eyesight, and is also overweight but not obese, and his doctor also told him that he was predisposed to developing asthma, but when he told the school nurses about it during the yearly medical checkups in school the nurses just put "history of asthma". (You know how they have the pre-made templates, the moment you mention the word asthma they click on a button and immediately a sentence condemning you with asthma appears.)</p>
              <p>He has never actually had an attack, and doesn't even own an inhaler of any sort, preventive or fast-relief. Does this mean that his doctor didn't think he was enough of an asthmatic to warrant the use of an inhaler? How much will the records in his health booklet affect his chances of getting in? I read that you could do an MCT test to get a negative on asthma, how much will this cost? If you do get a negative on the MCT for asthma, will your records still count against you?</p>
              <p>As for weight, our plan is to start shedding it so that by the time we apply our chances will be better. What are the chances for overweight but not obese people?</p>
              <p>Also, is it true that medical-wise, as long as you pass it won't affect your chances of getting in? Besides the interview, what other things do they take into account when picking candidates? How much do your academic and cca records affect your chances of getting in?</p>

              <p>For you basically they accept up to no more than 450 degrees in each eye. They don't accept overweight people, height wise also. Must be more than 160cm in height. Rough figure about 60 apply... filter with all the medical records from health booklet etc, drop to about 20 who will receive a letter to inform when you will turn up for the interview. Interview i think is the killer part, from 20 cut to around 5. Afterwhich is medical, hearing test, vision test, blood test, measurements test, see leg long enough, arm long enough etc, or too tall or too short.</p>
              <p>For interview, you'll be facing a panel of ex-airforce guys who are presently the instructors at the SYFC, one of them graduated from TOP GUN school in the US. Interview wise it's just about your personality, your attitude etc... Interest in a military career is sort of encouraged especially since the SYFC is just a front for recruiting potential pilots for the RSAF.</p>
              <p>CCA records wouldn't matter much but stuff like NCC or sporty stuff tend to look good on paper. Of course it all boils down to whether you are able to speak or not during the interview.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Wow thanks for bothering to reply at all. I think we will be fine for CCA records/ academic records, no black marks so far. Heightwise, I think I will be fine too, about intermediate height. Btw, may I know how long the process takes? I know sec 4 students can apply after prelims, will I be disadvantaged if I apply later? If I apply right after prelims, when will the medical testing etc. be? Soon after I apply, or the year after? Also, when will we actually be accepted, if we apply after prelims?</p></div>
