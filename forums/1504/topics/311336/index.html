              <h1 class="clr">Flight enthusiasts gearing up for inaugural A380 flight to London</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Some flight enthusiasts who flew on the inaugural Airbus
              A380 to Sydney in October last year will now also be on the plane’s
              first commercial flight to London on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The group, which calls themselves "First to Fly", consists of 18 people — mostly guys and two women — from different countries.</p>
              <p>To commemorate the flight, T—shirts and caps have been made to remember their latest feat.</p>
              <p>Ian
              Goodwin, Team Leader, "First to Fly", said, "We got together on the
              internet forum first, then these flights came up and we booked. A lot
              of us met for the first time last year on the Sydney flight and now we
              are back together again for the London flight."</p>
              <p>Most in the group are flying economy class.</p>
              <p>However, two members are not scrimping — they are flying first class again.</p>
              <p>One
              of them, Gino Bertuccio, said, "14 hours — I will have a lot more time
              to just enjoy it because the flight to Sydney was really short. All the
              excitement of getting up and down the plane and just looking around did
              not allow me to enjoy as much as I could."</p>
              <p>However, before the group gets on the first flight to London, they have another aerial journey right here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore Airlines sent them details by email in mid—January of the first flight to London.</p>
              <p>On Monday night, the enjoyed a whole capsule on the Singapore Flyer to themselves — with drinks included.</p>
              <p>And
              just like they did for their first flight to Sydney, the group has set
              up a website to commemorate their flight to London; as the site says,
              "history only records the names of those who were there first." — CNA/ms</p>

              <h1 class="clr">World's Biggest Jet Flies to London</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE - A Singapore Airlines A380, the world's biggest airplane,
              took off Tuesday from Singapore for London on its first commercial
              flight to Europe.</p>
              <p>With 449 passengers on board, flight SQ308 was scheduled to land at
              Heathrow Airport in the British capital at 3:05 p.m. local time (11:05
              a.m. EDT).</p>
              <p>The carrier hosted a send-off event for passengers at
              Singapore's Changi Airport to commemorate the double-decker plane's
              European commercial debut. Passengers took pictures and helped
              themselves to breakfast ahead of boarding.</p>
              <p>"I booked an extra
              ticket just for this experience," said Christian Ernst, 25, of Germany,
              who made a special stopover in Singapore on his way from South Korea to
              Frankfurt. "I'm very excited to be on the first flight of the A380 to
              Europe."</p>
              <p>The A380, as tall as a seven-story building, can seat
              more than 800 passengers in an all-economy class configuration.
              Singapore Airlines has opted for 471 seats in three classes _ 12
              Singapore Airlines suites, 60 business class and 399 economy class
              seats.</p>
              <p>Each luxury suite is equipped with sliding doors, a
              23-inch LCD TV, a full bed and a leather seat. Two of the suites can be
              joined to provide double beds.</p>
              <p>Powered by four Rolls Royce Trent
              900 engines, the A380 ends the nearly 37-year reign of the U.S.-made
              Boeing 747 jumbo jet as the world's most spacious passenger plane. The
              747 jumbo jet generally carries about 400 passengers.</p>
              <p>Airbus, the
              European manufacturer of the A380, says the new plane is the most fuel
              efficient and quietest passenger jet ever built, from inside and
              outside.</p>
              <p>"I'm really interested in this technology," said Ernst,
              a mechanical engineering student who booked an economy seat on the main
              deck. "I've also visited the production line in Hamburg and now I
              really want to experience the plane flying in the air."</p>
              <p>Singapore
              Airlines took delivery of the jet, the carrier's third, at the Airbus
              delivery center in Toulouse, France, last Tuesday and will fly it daily
              between Singapore and London.</p>
              <p>Currently the plane's sole
              operator, the carrier has deployed its two other A380s on daily
              services between Singapore and Sydney. It has firm orders for a further
              16 such planes.</p>
              <p>Singapore Airlines will also start flying another
              A380 jet, its fourth and yet to be delivered, on its Singapore-Tokyo
              route from May 20.</p>
              <p>The first A380 was delivered to Singapore
              Airlines on Oct. 15, 2007, 18 months behind schedule because of wiring
              problems and after billions of dollars in cost overruns for Airbus.</p>
              <p>Dubai-based Emirates will become the second airline with the plane when it takes its first delivery in August.</p>
