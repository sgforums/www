              <p><strong>Singapore Airlines reports drop in passengers, cargo</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines (SIA) on Tuesday reported a large
              drop in passenger numbers and cargo shipments as the worldwide economic
              slump further hit global aviation. <br> <br> The airline, seen as a bellwether for the industry, said it carried
              1.18 million passengers in February, down 20.2 per cent from the same
              month last year. <br> <br> The carrier said it filled 69.7 per cent of available passenger seats
              during the month, down 7.1 percentage points from a year earlier. <br> <br> Cargo volumes slipped 16.9 per cent and the airline filled 56.7 per
              cent of available freight space, down 5.5 percentage points from last
              year. <br> <br> Europe registered the biggest decline in the passenger and cargo markets for SIA, according to the airline. 
              <br> <br> "The prevailing global economic crisis has significantly dampened
              travel demand, translating to weaker uplifts," the airline said. <br> <br> SIA, one of the world's most respected airlines, said last month it
              would ground 17 passenger aircraft over the financial year from April
              2009 to March 2010 and was not ruling out the possibility of deferring
              plane orders. <br> <br> The airline's management has met with the company's labour unions about
              plans to cushion the impact of the downturn, including asking staff to
              take voluntary unpaid leave, early retirement and shorter work months. <br> <br> SIA reported a 42.8 per cent fall in net profit in the third quarter to December from the year before. 
              <br> <br> Net profit came in at 337 million Singapore dollars (220 million US),
              from 590 million dollars, on revenue of 4.16 billion dollars which was
              down 2.6 per cent year-on-year. - AFP/vm </span></p>

              <p>And they are still flying the Singapore - Moscow - Houston route... OMG... The Singapore to Moscow sector is almost always full but the Moscow - Houston is like -_-... Flew it recently... First Class only had one person, biz was 50% full only and economy was prolly around the same... Hope the cargo makes money for them...</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The check-in queue at Houston airport was like empty... Ground staff said that this was very normal and they have doubts that this flight will carry on in the foreseeable future. Prepare for the Moscow to Houston sector to be axed. SAfrica flights might also be cut(as in reduced).</p>
