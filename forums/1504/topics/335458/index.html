              <p><cite class="auth">AFP - <span>2 hours 44 minutes ago</span></cite></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 30, 2008 (AFP) - Asian airlines face bleak business in
              the next two years amid a global recession and must deal with the
              challenges or risk extinction, an industry conference was told Thursday.</p>
              <p>Carriers from Asia and the Middle East, which are generally seen as
              having healthier balance sheets, will not escape the financial turmoil
              which has spilled over to affect the global economy, speakers at the
              conference said.</p>
              <p>"Looking ahead, I think we are facing, frankly,
              a couple of dark years for the aviation business," said Peter Harbison,
              executive chairman of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation consultancy.</p>
              <p>"The
              thing we all realise by now is this is not just another downturn," he
              told the Aviation Outlook Asia conference in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Harbison
              warned against airlines being complacent, saying any carrier that
              refused to take the challenges seriously would be at risk.</p>
              <p>"There
              is no airline in this region -- and that probably goes for most of the
              world too -- that can be confident they will still be here this time
              next year," Harbison said.</p>
              <p>"This is going to be a watershed, if
              it's not already, not just for the industry but for the global
              economy... Any airline that thinks otherwise is seriously at risk."</p>
              <p>Apart
              from having to cope with slowing travel demand, particularly in the
              lucrative corporate travel segment, airlines also must deal with
              volatilities in foreign currencies which will impact their hedging
              strategies, said Harbison.</p>
              <p>Currency instability "has created
              massive problems for airlines in terms of their risk management, in
              terms of their hedging," he said.</p>
              <p>"If that stays as an issue, it is going to continue to be highly disruptive for the treasuries of the airlines."</p>
              <p>Andrew
              Herdman, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines,
              told the conference the mood in the industry had dramatically altered
              in the last few months.</p>
              <p>"You saw the way everything has fallen off the cliff... so the mood has changed," Herdman said.</p>
              <p>He said the surge in oil prices to record levels of above 147 US dollars in July was "killing airlines' profitability".</p>
              <p>While prices have since halved to about 70 dollars a barrel, the revenue outlook for carriers remained extremely gloomy.</p>
              <p>"It's still the number one cost for almost every airline in the world," Herdman said of fuel expenses.</p>
              <p>Despite
              the gloomy environment, Damien Horth from Swiss banking giant UBS sees
              a window of opportunity for airlines to undertake changes that will
              result in a stronger industry.</p>
              <p>"There's not a lot of industry
              change during the boom times... We have a big opportunity for change in
              the aviation industry given what's going on right now," said Horth,
              head of transport research at UBS.</p>
              <p>"It does need to change more
              through this downturn," he said, adding he felt there were too many
              subsidies being given out within the sector.</p>
              <p>Horth also said the
              balance sheets of the region's airlines "are actually quite weak", with
              the exceptions of Singapore Airlines and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific.</p>
              <p>"2009 is going to be very, very difficult indeed," he said.</p>
