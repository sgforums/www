              <p>SINGAPORE, March 26 - Singapore Airlines said on Wednesday that it had
              to ground an Airbus A380 on Monday and transfer passengers to two
              smaller Boeing 747s bound for Sydney, after a fuel pump failed to work.
              This was the fourth incident in three months for the world's largest
              passenger jet since it entered commercial service with Singapore
              Airlines in October, following two years of delivery delays caused by
              wiring glitches.</p>
              <p>"The cause has been traced to the premature failure of a new fuel
              pump provided by Airbus," Singapore Air spokesman Stephen Forshaw said
              in a emailed statement, adding the plane has since been repaired and
              returned to service on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Singapore Air is currently the
              world's only airline to operate the A380, with three of the superjumbos
              operating daily flights from the city-state to Sydney and London. It
              has another 16 of the aircraft on order.</p>
              <p>Airbus is competing with Boeing for new orders from Asian airlines.</p>
              <p>An
              A380 rolled off the tarmac in Singapore after a fault with a tow truck
              in January, while another was grounded in February due to a fuel pump
              defect and a third aircraft was grounded in Sydney earlier this month
              due to problems with its brakes. "The problem is similar to the problem
              which affected another aircraft a month or so back, but it is important
              to mention, it is not the same problem, and not the same aircraft,"
              said Forshaw, referring to the February incident.</p>
              <p>Despite the
              series of mishaps, Singapore Airlines insisted that the A380's
              reliability since entering service "has been generally excellent".</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Airbus A380 to Sydney delayed by fuel line problem</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, March 29, 2008 (AFP) - An Airbus A380, the world's biggest
              passenger airliner, bound for Sydney was delayed for more than an hour
              Saturday due to a "fuel line" problem, the carrier said.</p>
              <p>The glitch on the Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight was the third time
              in two months when an A380 flight was delayed due to a fuel issue.</p>
              <p>"Tonight's
              flight to Sydney, SQ221, will incur a delay of about one hour while
              some rectification work is done on a fuel line that carries fuel
              between the respective tanks," SIA spokesman Stephen Forshaw said in a
              statement to AFP before the plane took off.</p>
              <p>He gave no further details.</p>
              <p>A
              check with Singapore's Changi Airport flights website showed SQ221,
              originally scheduled to depart at 8:30 pm (1230 GMT), took off from
              Terminal 3 for Sydney at 9:50 pm.</p>
              <p>In January, SIA grounded
              another A380 flight to Sydney after it became unhinged from a tow truck
              and accidentally touched grass on the side of the tarmac.</p>
              <p>SIA
              acquired its first A380 in October last year, becoming the first
              airline to operate the double decker aircraft with the launch of
              commercial services from Singapore to Sydney in the same month.</p>
              <p>The airline began commercial flights to London on the A380 on March 18.</p>
