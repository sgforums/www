            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I am new to this thread. Hope I can gain some insight into being a commercial airline pilot.<br><br>I have a keen interest in flying since young. After graduating from U a few years back, I have been thinking of enrol into SIA as a commercial pilot. But am totally unaware of the lifestyle of a commercial pilot. Do they have to socialise and drink a lot? Is the lifestyle very 'complicated' (pardon me to say this) between pilot &amp; the steward/stewardess?<br><br>Sorry if I sound too straightforth but am not really good at socialising and my gf is not very supportive of me being a SIA pilot.<br><br>Hope some of you could give a fair advice.

Btw, r u a fresh uni grad from S'pore too?<br><br>Ermm...know that there are a few commercial pilots in this thread. Appreciate if you could provide more insights into the lifestyle of a commercial pilot. Its a bond of many years, hence I have to do some research before deciding whether to be one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> . Thks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me speak to the lifestyle of a pilot in the US.<br><br>First, you live and die by seniority.  Seniority is everything.  What base you get, what seat and in which aircraft will be determined by seniority.  The schedule you fly each month is bid on by seniority.  If there is a layoff, it's nice to have seniority over some poor souls below you.<br><br>Typically trips are 4 days long and can consist of between 8 and 12 legs.  Our duty time is usually up to 12 hours, though it can go up to 14 by union contract and 16 by regulations.  The schedule can be punishing.  Van will leave the hotel sometimes as early as 0530 and you won't get to the hotel that night till 2000.  Rest during the over night averages 9-12 hours.  During the day, we could be flying several legs with little time to pee or eat.  So we get to the hotel hungry and tired.  But occasionally we get nice long layovers that make it all worthwhile.  Like next week, I'll be spending a whole day on a beach in Mexico, while the rest of the country freezes their butts off in the snow.<br><br>But, having said all that, I can't imagine myself doing anything else.  It is such an easy job.  Sometimes I don't even feel like I'm flying.  Flying a glass equipped airplane is really a data entry job.  Babysit the computer and make sure it doesn't do anything stupid.  As a First Officer it's a little more stressful because how much you enjoy the trip wil depend a lot on how the Captain is.  Many are really laid back and make the trip really fun.  Others are a pain in the ass to work with and you just sit there, staring out into space, praying for the trip to end.<br><br>Really, pilots here live for the lifestyle outside of work.  In a month I get between 15 and 16 days off.  I have to go home to my son, but many single pilots and flight attendants I know travel everywhere on their days off.  Benefits are excellent.  We get unlimited free travel for spouse or designated companion, children and parents.<br><br>Another aspect of pilot life here is commuting.  It allows us to live where we want and still work where we want.  For example, I am based in Texas and live in California.  When I need to get to work, I hop on the plane and when I'm done I fly home.  It is an additional source of stress because we fly standby, so there is the possibility of not making it to work, or having to spend your last day off hoping one seat is open for you to get to work.<br><br>Overall, it' can be a tough life, but it is definately worth it.  Sometimes I don't appear enthusiastic about the job, but I am living the dream.</div>
