Said that the food was horribel, come in those paper bags and contained an inedible sandwich. Got PTV in Economy but she said movies and games quite stale.<br><br>Think I will ask for u Finnair's service when my friend returns from Frankfurt via Helsinki via Bangkok 10 days later.<br><br>Garuda leg space very crammed, according to my mum but food was rather nice.  Although i wish to take their A330 to Shanghai or Beijing.<br><br>Still remembered not very long ago GA858 was notorious for using the trijets, which i dun like as the rear is ultra noisy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finnair is okay. I flew via Finnair to Helsinki last November and the journey was pretty okay. I'm not one who's choosy about food, so I'm not sure if that is of any help. Legroom was limited, as in any economy class seat. Not sure how I survived the 10-hour flight from BKK to HEL.<br><br>SQ22</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The great attraction about flying Finnair is the MD-11. Very few MD-11 passenger operators, I think that may the deciding factor for me. Ohh well, have to see.<br><br>Thanks for your output guys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, Swiss anytime for me!!!<br><br>they now use A340, with TV screens and the legroom is really quite generous for economy class! The food is ok, service is ok. Night flight too, so when u reach bangkok, u can stay one night and start off early in the morning.<br><br>most of all, tickets to bangkok are only $190! I think Valuair now charges $199.<br><br>I have no good feelings for the MD-11. Really hated the 2-5-2 configuration. Swiss used to operate MD-11, but the aircrafts are really getting old. Nowadays I go for planes that have a personalised screen for every seat now. Guess it's the norm nowadays.</div>
