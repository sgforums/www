              <p>I made a flight booking to Macau on 14 Jan 2010 and return to Singapore on 18 Jan 2010 few months back. Recently I received an email from Tigerairways stated that the flight schedule has been reschedule to 14 Jan 2010 (departure) and 19 Jan 2010 (return). In their email, their give me 4 options: 1. To change the flight <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">within 7 days either side of the flight dates above; 2. To change flight to any other date beside that +/- 7 days period with additional cost; 3. Refund the air ticket fate; 4. Flight credit to be issued to the value of the fare and to be used later. </span></p>
              <p>Not wanting to spend another day away, I called to the Tigerairways's customer service center to make amendment to departure on 8 Jan 2010 and return on 11 Jan 2010. The customer service officer who attended to me, named Jessica, told me that I can only change to date that falls WITHIN 7 DAYS either side of date. I was thinking: ok, maybe it should be 19 Jan - 7 days = 12 Jan, so I rescheduled again to 12 Jan instead. To my surprise, she told me the earliest would be 13 Jan because the 7 days term is INCLUSIVE of the departure and return date!!! I try to made complaint and argue with the customer service officer because in the email it did not stated that the 7 days either side is inclusive of the departure/return dates. After consulted her manager, they still insist that they are correct and will not entertain any changes beyond 13 Jan.</p>
              <p>First, I think this is unfair to me as a consumer to accept that because it is NEVER stated the inclusive of neither departure nor return date when calculating the 7 days period in their email to me. Secondly, I would like point out that Tigerairways has been react very poor in their customer service response. I was waiting for the phone for more than 30 minutes in order to get through and that was the 3rd time I made the call. I hope the management of Tigeriarways should look into this matter seriously. The terms should be stated clearly and not to be informed to the consumer only the time when we made the change.</p>
              <p>Â <span style="font-size: x-small;">By the way, anyone have suggestion how to made a formal complaint beside to CASE? Thanks.</span></p>
