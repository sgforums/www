Some of the survivors have life-threatening injuries.<br><br>An official at One-Two-GoÂ’s crisis hotline in Bangkok says two of the 43 survivors are cabin crew and the rest are passengers. She says that on board the aircraft were 123 passengers and seven crewmembers, 78 of them foreign nationals. Both pilots and three of the five flight attendants were killed.<br><br>The airline official says the MD-82 was operating as flight OG269 from BangkokÂ’s secondary Don Muang airport. It departed Bangkok at around 14:30 and its scheduled arrival time was 15:50.<br><br>The aircraft ran off the runway on landing in heavy rain, breaking apart and bursting into flames.<br><br>One-Two-Go launched four years ago as ThailandÂ’s first low-cost carrier, operating MD-80-series and Boeing 747 Â‘ClassicÂ’ aircraft on domestic routes. It is a subsidiary of Orient Thai Airlines, which mainly operates international services.<br><br>The One-Two-Go official says the MD-82 was registered as HS-OMG. According to FlightÂ’s ACAS database, HS-OMG was built in November 1983 and was originally operated by the former Trans World Airlines. It had a manufacturerÂ’s serial number of 49183.<br><br>Powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-217 engines, the aircraft had only been in service with One-Two-Go since March this year, when it was purchased by parent company Orient Thai.<br><br>ACAS shows that as of November last year the aircraft had accumulated nearly 63,000 flight hours and more than 33,000 takeoffs and landings.</div>

But your statement does not sound fair to the budget airlines in general.<br><br>It just happens that the aircraft that crashed belongs to a budget carrier. Remember SQ 006? It crashed during a typhoon, and belonged to one of the most reputable carriers in the world. But to say then that SIA isn't safe is unfair. Same goes to the budget carriers around the world. Budget carriers are relatively safe. But there are certain carriers that you may need to keep out.</div></blockquote>Well, because i know pilots who pilot them and they tell me about their maintenance issues. Not to mention , when i first flew it... i dont know what happened , there were sounds from the back of the plane , n somemore , it flew into turbulence , i am not talking about frontal.. i am talking about turbulence hitting the back of the plane. Tail end. I thought the plane broke in half and the 3 female passengers beside me started crying and freaking out.... after that..  thats it. I be honest.. i freaked out.. and thought that was it. lol. Now THAT is shocks that shorten ur lifespan!<br><br>Thats why to be safe and to have a lower chance of technical failures and sudden mishaps , i prefer NOT to fly budget airlines. After weighting the problems and seeing quite a few budget airline planes crashing around the world.<br><br>I know it doesnt sound fair in general to ALL budget airlines, but most of those that crashed due to something wrong with the plane were budget airlines.<br><br>Taiwan case for SQ was due to human error on the runway. And its 1 case in the history of SIA right ?<br><br>True there are some budge airlines we have to watch out.  But to me , if i can , i would fly the normal ones lo.</div>
