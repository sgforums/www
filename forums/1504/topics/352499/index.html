              Tiger Airways Flies in the Face of Singapore
              Posted: 2009/03/19
              From: Mathaba
              
              Mathaba news can reveal that numerous sources and an investigation by our news network has shown a pattern of sub-zero customer service and mis treatment of passengers by the airline.
              
              Customers hoping to either make a booking or to attempt to complain about serious mis treatment by the airline are held in an endless phone loop listening to a recording saying that Tiger Airways is "center of Asia Pacific aviation's low cost airline of the year" without giving information as to where such a seemingly fraudulent claim emenates.
              
              Our investigators have also caught out the airline cheating its advertisers - including Hertz Rent-a-Car - by placing advertising in a location that is not visible to the most common browsing window size, whilst allowing a slither of clickable area to appear immediately to the left of the scroll bar.
              
              This is a well known trick used by some unscrupulous web masters to generate false clicks which concealing the ad from view, as many people aiming for the narrow windows scroll bar to move down the page erroneously hit the ad which is placed in this forbidden position. Reputable web advertising agencies such as ads.heyu.net ban any web site found to use such practices, and monitor the display of ads on their network to prevent such abuse.
              
              The DoubleClick agency handles Tiger Airways advertising income, with both the agency and Tiger Airways earning roughly 50% each from the advertisers which are being cheated by the airline with its unscrupulous methods of generating false clicks whilst concealing the advertisement.
              
              Mathaba News Agency contacted the airline to inform them about this practice and no action was taken, although Tiger Airways had promised to have a senior manager contact the agency to address our complaints.
              
              The Editor of IMTnews.com purchased a ticket at Chinese New Year from Manila to Singapore, and the next day Tiger Airways canceled and reversed the confirmed booking without informing neither the payee nor the passenger. The passenger was forced to purchase a new ticket at higher cost in cash at Manila Clark airport far from the city, in order to fly.
              
              The Australian St George Bank, reputed to be the leading business bank in Australia, expressed astonishment at the reversal since the booking took place via their secure system which uses the very latest and most advanced security technology, which our ICT Editor says is vastly superior to that used by Tiger Airways.
              
              The editor who has travelled 59 countries on countless airlines told Mathaba that in all his 45 years he had never had a similar experience of the reversal of a sale, moreover without informing either payee or passenger via SMS nor Email about the reversal. Instead, the happless passenger was told at the check-in counter at Manila's Clark airport that "your ticket is fraudulent, if you want to fly you have to buy a new one."
              
              Calling the various international and national call centre numbers of Tiger Airways results in being cut off or having to listen to the endless self-congratulating loop recording for durations from over half an hour without answer to being cut of several times after from only a few minutes to 15 minutes.
              
              The Singapore number was constantly engaged, presumably from irate former passengers for the airline, which sources in the tourism and travel industry have told Mathaba has a bad reputation for not being able to handle or not wishing to answer callers.
              
              Other complaints include booking elderly into the emergency exit seats who then have to rebook without compensation for fare difference, and misplacing frequent fliers who book the extra leg space room again without compensation. Apologies from the airline are also not forthcoming.
              
              With the western economic collapse and Singapore having banked on the (western) banking system, corners may be cut while the reputation of Singapore in increasingly as a high cost low service destination not suited to tourists, and this is exacerbated by the abysmal performance of Tiger Airways.
              
              Tiger Airways as well as others with information relevant to conducting an investigation and possible legal action against the Airline, are invited to contact Mathaba News via our contact form: http://www.mathaba.net/contact.shtml
