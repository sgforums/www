            <div class='col-md body'>Finally.....the news we had all been waiting for...<br><br><strong>SIA places an order for 31 Boeing planes </strong>In a deal worth US$7.35b, it will receive 18 of the 777-300ER planes from 2006 to 2010, with an option to buy another 13<br><br>By Christopher Tan<br><br>IN WHAT some have seen as another sign of a rosier outlook, Singapore Airlines (SIA) has placed an order for as many as 31 Boeing 777-300ER planes worth US$7.35 billion (S$12.6 billion) - its second major purchase in four years.<br><br>Eighteen of the recently introduced aircraft, each capable of taking up to 350 passengers to Europe, will be delivered from 2006 to 2010.<br><br>SIA has an option to buy another 13, a decision it will take later, according to SIA spokesman Stephen Forshaw.<br><br>He said yesterday that the value of the purchase is based on American aircraft maker Boeing's list price and includes the cost of spare parts.<br><br>'We never disclose actual prices of our transactions,' he said.<br><br>The purchase is SIA's second major order since 2000, when it inked a US$8.85 billion deal with European consortium Airbus Industries for 25 A380 planes. These have about the same range as the 777-300ERs but can each carry 500 or so passengers.<br><br>The first of these super carriers - of which 10 are firm orders - is scheduled to arrive in 2006.<br><br>Head of research at Kim Eng Securities, Mr Seah Hiang Hong, was not unduly excited over SIA's latest purchase, saying 'they have made several big orders in the past'.<br><br>'They've been expanding steadily,' he said. 'It's all part and parcel of their fleet renewal process.'<br><br>The average age of SIA's fleet of 29 Boeing 747s, 55 Boeing 777s and five super long-range Airbus 340-500s is five years.<br><br>But other observers viewed the move as a sign of confidence.<br><br>'If you don't see your market growing, then you won't buy,' G K Goh's senior analyst Teo Hiang Boon explained.<br><br>Mr Teo noted that SIA, among the world's most profitable carriers, had 'long-maintained' that it would increase its capacity by 4-6 per cent a year.<br><br>Another analyst, quoted by Bloomberg news agency, said SIA 'obviously expects some pretty heavy traffic'.<br><br>Asked about the 2006 delivery of its Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus 380s, SIA's spokesman Mr Forshaw said: 'We make orders according to our needs.'<br><br>SIA said in its statement yesterday that it had not ordered any new short-haul planes, although it had 'sought proposals from manufacturers for suitable aircraft to operate on its regional routes'.<br><br>SIA posted post-tax earnings of $259 million for its first quarter this year, versus a loss of $312 million in the same period last year, which was ravaged by Sars.<br><br>But industry watchers have raised the possibility of rising oil prices eroding its profitability.<br><br>They reckon earnings could shrink by as much as 1.5 per cent for every 1 per cent rise in the price of fuel.<br><br>from Straits Times, 26 Aug 2004</div>
