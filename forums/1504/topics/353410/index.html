              <p>This is an internal memo for Singapore Airlines staff.</p>
              <p>________________________</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With immediate effect, all employees of the Singapore Airlines Groupare to take one day off per month(w/o pay) indefinitely due to fall in traffic and demand. Staff can either opt to take the one day off per month(w/o pay) or use their leave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore Airlines Pilots(foreign country based) whose contracts with the airline will be due for renewal soon will NOT be renewed(aka terminate of contracts). This is a precursor move towards retrenchments. Prepare for outsourcing and merger of departments within the SIA Group. Divesting of the cargo division and other units such as SATS Catering will proceed as per planned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some flights of SQ have been noticed to have a sharp drop in passenger capacity. SIN-LHR is one of them. Plans to put tri-daily A380s have been put on hold as there is spare capacity on board. Singapore Airlines will put twice daily A380s and one B77W instead. Paris will be flown with daily A380 and the B77W will be put to use for the SIN-LHR flight. Amritsar will be cancelled and flights to Seoul will be periodically cut(in between days depending on demand and info from Ticketing Dept). Reductions of flights to Seoul is due to the sudden depreciation of the Korean Won and lack of feeder traffic. The Singapore - Incheon Seoul - Vancouver flight has been terminated due to lack of premium passengers on the route.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The SIN-DME-IAH flight has been running at below 40% capacity on most days. First class has been known to run empty, business class at 50% and economy class at below 50%. Cargo is high yield. However the expense of putting a B77W might not be justified in the long term. The SIN-DME-IAH will remain in the Northern Summer schedule. However it remaining in the Northern Winter schedule has to be reevaluated. Cabin crew doing the route have to take a 10 days long week which cannot be justified with current loads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cost-cutting will be implemented. Steven Forshaw of the SQ PR Dept has left the company. A staff will be appointed as Interim Manager.</p>

              <p>LMAO... He was paid very well(in excess of $16k per month) and most of the time he was on leave or jetsetting. He was quite clever actually, resigning instead of waiting for the company to retrench him.</p>

              <p>SQ is definitely not immune to global turn of events. In fact it is less immune.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many factors. Usually in a country where there is demand for domestic traffic(China) travel tends to be up quickly and domestic flights are money makers if the airlines do it right. Singapore has no domestic market.</p>
              <p>Secondly Singapore is at the crossroads of the Kangaroo Route, the link between Australia and Europe. This Kangaroo Route traffic is highly profitable for SIA. However SIA is seriously affected by this. Less people are willing to spend money travelling these days, more so for high premium pax. Problem for SIA is magnified becoz its fares are always at the premium compared to other airlines and that if people on both sides refuse to travel the effect is multiplied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is also too far south to be an Asian hub, though it is now to a certain extent. HKG/BKK is better suited. However Singapore has a better biz environment. But if the Biz traffic is the most severely affected, what does that tell you about Singapore Airlines Biz Class loads...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SIA is a well managed airline not like Alitalia, Olympic and TAP Air Portugal. But there are many factors that make SIA a profitable airline. However if these factors work AGAINST the airline, one can only expect SIA to not make normal profits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In SIA terms, profits which are not what they use to be = cut-cost = Retrenchments, out sourcing etc.</p>
