According to this revised plan, the first A380 will be delivered in October 2007. Thirteen more will be delivered in 2008 and 25 in 2009. The industrial ramp-up will be completed in 2010, when 45 A380s are going to be delivered.<br><br>Fully aware of the impact this has on their development plans, Airbus is in close contact with its customers and is doing its utmost to find ways and means to alleviate the burden this represents for them.<br><br>In June, the amount of work to be done to finalise the installation of the electrical harnesses into the forward and rear section of the fuselage had been underestimated. Beyond the complexity of the cable installation, the root cause of the problem is the fact that the 3D Digital Mock up, which facilitates the design of the electrical harnesses installation, was implemented late and that the people working on it were in their learning curve.<br><br>Under the leadership of the new Airbus President and CEO Christian Streiff, strong measures have been taken, which, in addition to management changes, include the implementation of the same proven tools on all sites, as well as the creation of multi-national teams to better use the best skills available. Simultaneously, training is being organised to swiftly bring the employees using those tools to the optimum level. With the right tools, the right people, the right training and the right oversight and management being put in place, the issue is now addressed at its root, although it will take time until these measures bear fruit.<br><br>Furthermore, in order to regain its competitive edge and to counter the financial impact of the delay as well as the weakening Dollar, Airbus is launching the Power8 programme. The objective of the programme is to reduce costs, save cash and develop new products faster. The development cycle times are to be reduced by two years while the overall productivity is to be increased by 20 per cent. The programme aims at annual cost savings of at least Â€ 2 billion from 2010 onwards and delivering some Â€ 5.0 billion in cumulative cash savings by 2010.<br><br>Airbus will this year deliver around 430 aircraft, the highest ever, with a plan to deliver even more next year. It currently has an order-book of some 2,100 aircraft, filling the production lines for the next 4.5 years. The measures here-above should allow Airbus to even better satisfy its customers and be even more competitive.<br><br>Airbus is an EADS joint company with BAE Systems<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It is a good thing it has this delay.. make sure the plane is all ok before all delivery to their customers. And also this is the opportunity for all Airports around the world to become "The A380 ready"....<br><br>Airbus A380 delays... but i think it goin to be forgotten once this bird going to enter the services.<br><br>Good news is.. the airbus are getting the certification soon.. only this "touch - ups" that cause the whole picture..<br><br>Well.. Hope This is going to be the last delay by Airbus..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good luck to Mr Streiff. It may even be delayed later than Oct 07. 500km of wiring is no mean feat.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's sad to hear that the delivery is delayed yet again. However, am truly glad that at least SQ and LH is reiterating their stand not to cancel their current orders and certainly looking forward for the A380 to become one of the success stories of the aviation world.<br><br>Regarding compensation, all options are open. But IMHO, leasing newly-built aircraft like an A346 just for SQ as an interim measure is not really a good idea. As most of us know, the A346 has not garnered any new major orders recently. Even EK has opted to defer their A346 deliveries which is due to begin next year.<br><br>I doubt that Airbus would want to build new A346s as compensation for SQ, only having to find new owners for the birds once it's returned to Airbus. The market has shown right now that the A340 Family is dying. This will incur more losses for Airbus should this compensation plan goes ahead.<br><br>I foresee that SQ will get a much sweeter deal with their commitment for 40 A350XWBs. I'm hoping SQ will sign the contract to lease 19 A333s from Airbus.<br><br>Oh yes, anyone noticed that SQ kept stating that their firm orders for the A380 is 19?</div>
