              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jetstar flight from Singapore turns back due to passengers' argument over phone</strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A Jetstar plane bound to Australia was delayed in Singapore and police were called in after three passengers were involved in a heated argument over a phone. <br><br>Jetstar flight 3K161 was scheduled to depart Changi Airport at 11.20pm on Friday (Dec 22) and arrive at Darwin at 5.20am the next day. <br><br>In an email to Channel NewsAsia, Jetstar Group spokesperson Robin Goh said that the aircraft was taxiing towards the runway for take-off when the captain decided to return to the gate. <br><br>Three passengers were involved in the dispute, which verbal threats were made, he said, adding that local authorities took custody of the passengers involved at the gate. <br><br>Channel NewsAsia understands that the dispute happened between a 47-year-old Australian man and a 55-year-old Filipino-Australian. <br><br>The argument started when the Filipino-Australian told the Australian that he should have his phone switched off. <br>Advertisement<br><br>As the dispute became more heated, the cabin crew decided to call in police for help. <br><br>Police said they were alerted to a case of public nuisance on board a flight at 11.26pm. <br><br>A female passenger claimed she heard the word "bomb" used during the argument. However, she is believed to have misheard the word as no other passengers heard the word being used.  <br><br>Both men, along with the 55-year-old man's wife, who was also involved in the dispute, eventually alighted the plane and are currently still in Singapore. <br><br>Police said that two men, aged 47 and 55, are assisting with investigations. <br><br>Mr Goh said the flight eventually resumed at 7.15am on Saturday, more than eight hours after the plane was scheduled to originally depart from Singapore. <br><br>Meal vouchers were distributed to all customers due to the delay, said Mr Goh. Additionally, families with young children were granted lounge access for greater comfort.<br><br>"We take safety and security seriously and we don’t tolerate threats or disruptive behaviour by passengers on our flights," he added.</p>
