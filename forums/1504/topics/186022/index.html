However, you do not have a PPL and therefore SIA has to train u on the Cessna in the college to get you a PPL. Thereafter you will go on to ATPL and then flying as a first officer on an SIA jet. So I doubt you can join SFC by yourself. =/ But I might be wrong. You should give them a call and check instead. =)<br><br>Other ways include going to other clubs/schools to get the license. Some flying schools on Malaysia offer programs that will get you an ATPL. Messey University in New Zealand (I think) provides a degree in air transportation. =)</div>
