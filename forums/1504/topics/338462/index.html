              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) has cancelled all flights to and from Bangkok from Wednesday.
              <br> <br> The carrier said this is due to the deteriorating security situation
              and a lack of operational service staff at the Suvarnabhumi Airport in
              Bangkok.
              <br> <br>Customers whose flights have been cancelled should contact their
              travel agent, or SIA's Reservations Service Centre in Singapore at 6223
              8888 if they had booked their flights directly with SIA.
              <br> <br> SIA said efforts will be made to accommodate customers on flights to Bangkok when the security situation stabilises.
              <br> <br> The airline will make an assessment on its flight operations and will issue an advice on its website.

              <p><strong>Bangkok-bound flights from Changi Airport cancelled for 2nd day</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: All Bangkok-bound flights from Changi Airport were cancelled for a second straight day.
              <br> <br> Changi's airline counters, which were besieged on Wednesday by confused
              travellers, are experiencing quieter times. As various carriers posted
              regular updates on the situation in Bangkok, many passengers stayed
              away and opted to change their travel plans.
              <br> <br>Singapore Airlines, which usually ferries some 2,000 passengers to
              and from Bangkok daily, said it is presently not accepting check-ins
              for any flights to Bangkok or through Singapore to Bangkok.
              <br> <br>It is gearing up for the backlog of passengers, which will only
              worsen with each day of the impasse. The airline is also prepared to
              get passengers out through other ports if there is a demand for it.
              <br> <br>Stephen Forshaw, vice-president, Public Affairs, Singapore
              Airlines, said: "We are looking at a whole range of factors, including
              more flights using our regional carrier, SilkAir, to Phuket and Chiang
              Mai. People from Bangkok are already taking land transport to those
              destinations.
              <br> <br>"(Travelling) from Bangkok to Phuket can be anything up to 12 hours
              on the highway, but some people realise this is what they have to do.
              We are closely monitoring demand on those flights. SilkAir is looking
              to put in more flights if there is demand or we may use larger aircraft
              from SIA like 777. But at this point, there is no need to do that."

              <p><strong>Singapore Airlines to resume Bangkok flights Friday</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) will resume flights from
              Bangkok's main international airport on Friday, the airline said, after
              protesters ended an eight-day blockade of the regional aviation hub.
              <br> <br>The first SIA flight from Suvarnabhumi international airport to
              Singapore will leave Bangkok early Friday afternoon, the airline said.
              <br> <br>Foreign carriers had been using the Vietnam War-era U-Tapao
              airport, southeast of Bangkok, during the blockade by Thai
              anti-government protesters but SIA said it will stop its U-Tapao
              flights Thursday night.
              <br> <br>Thai Airways operated the first international flight out of
              Suvarnabhumi on Wednesday, and a spokeswoman for the Thai airports
              agency said normal operations will resume on Friday.
              <br> <br> SIA urged customers to be patient, saying "some delays may be expected" with the airport newly reopened.
              <br> <br>SilkAir, the regional wing of Singapore Airlines, will now operate
              just one additional flight to the Thai resort destination of Phuket as
              Bangkok capacity increases, SIA said. The extra flights will continue
              until Sunday, it said.
              <br> <br> Singapore-based Jetstar Asia, which had been using U-Tapao, said its service to Suvarnabhumi will resume Friday evening.
              <br> <br>Tiger Airways, also based in Singapore, said on its website that it
              plans to resume some Singapore-Bangkok flights on Friday, "subject to
              confirmation by the Thai authorities that Bangkok airport has resumed
              normal operations."
              <br> <br>The Singapore foreign ministry said late Tuesday that it had helped
              490 of its nationals leave Thailand through U-Tapao, Phuket or the
              northern Thai city of Chiang Mai, leaving about 120 Singaporeans still
              stuck in Bangkok.
