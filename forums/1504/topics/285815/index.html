We've been in discussions with them about the airplane. We have been in discussions with Japanese carriers, we have been in discussions with Chinese carriers," Airbus sales chief John Leahy told reporters.<br><br>"I would like to believe that we should have new orders by the middle of next year."<br><br>Singapore Airlines on Monday was the first airline to receive the A380, after a delay of nearly two years that lost planemaker Airbus billions of dollars in a crisis leading to thousands of job cuts and a management reshuffle at the Franco-German group.<br><br>Some of Singapore Airlines' 747 aircraft will be converted to freighter planes for use by its air cargo business, said executive Bey Soo Khiang at a news conference on Wednesday.<br><br>An airline official told Reuters the company operates 19 Boeing 747s.<br><br>Earlier this week, Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Chew Choon Seng said the B747, the biggest passenger aircraft for four decades until the arrival of the A380, was a plane based on outdated technology.<br><br>A spokesman said the airline, the world's biggest by stock market value, had decided against ordering the updated version of Boeing's 747, the B747-8. It has made firm orders for 20 Boeing's B787 or Dreamliner, as well as 20 Airbus A350 XWBs.<br><br>It has an option for an additional six A380s. The plane has a list price of $300 million but airlines are usually given deep discounts.<br><br>"I think they want to get the airplane into operation now but I think it's inevitable that Singapore will have return orders," Leahy said.<br><br>The carrier has turned the A380 delivery into a huge celebration, unveiling a new cabin with individual first-class suites, a welcome party with Singapore's prime minister, and a charity auction for seats on the first regular flight on Oct. 25.<br><br>Airbus parent EADS's 12-billion-euro programme to produce a new class of mammoth plane hit various technical problems, most recently in fitting each jet's 500 km of wiring.</div>

Regular service on the route begins on October 28.<br><br>The superjumbo is enormous -- each wing could hold about 72 cars, and each plane contains more than 500 kilometres (300 miles) of wiring. It could carry 853 passengers in an all-economy configuration.<br><br>But in what could be a trend, Singapore Airlines has installed just 471 seats to offer more space, particularly in business and first class.<br><br>SIA's version has 399 economy seats, 60 business seats, and a "Suites" class of 12 compartments with 58-centimetre (23-inch) flat-screen televisions, sheets by French designer Givenchy and a full-length bed behind sliding doors.<br><br>"This week, the game changes and we in Singapore Airlines are very proud to be the launch customer," Bey said.<br><br>"What you see tonight is not just a step but a quantum leap in the standards of air travel."<br><br>Reporters were shown mock-ups of the three new cabins, complete with SIA stewardesses in their trademark figure-hugging uniforms.<br><br>SIA, which early on began advertising that it would be "first to fly" the A380, had expressed disappointment with holdups in the superjumbo.<br><br>But all was forgotten Wednesday as the airline took out full-page advertisements in Asia to herald its Suites class and trumpet the arrival of the plane.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, SIA chairman Stephen Lee, and Airbus chief executive officer John Leahy were to give welcoming speeches at the airport ceremony before the prime minister toured the aircraft.<br><br>The A380 problems over the past two years provoked management changes as well as a politically sensitive cost-cutting plan at Airbus.<br><br>Even as it celebrated delivery of the A380, the European aerospace group EADS, the parent of Airbus, announced Wednesday that delivery of its first A400M military transport plane to the French airforce would be delayed by at least six months.<br><br>The A380 was also recently at the centre of an insider-trading scandal, with top managers and key shareholders suspected of selling shares in EADS before the A380 production problems were made public.<br><br>But 16 airlines have placed firm orders for the A380 -- which some analysts have called a "white elephant". Dubai-based Emirates is the leading client on a customer list of predominantly Asian, European and Gulf-based carriers.<br><br>Airbus says the A380 will offer the lowest cost per passenger of any airliner, will emit less carbon dioxide per passenger, and significantly reduce takeoff and landing noise.<br><br>"The big step coming with these aircraft is the economics of it, the efficiency of it," said Tom Ballantyne, chief correspondent for industry publication Orient Aviation.<br><br>The A380 will allow the phasing out of SIA's Boeing 747 jumbos over the next three-to-four years, Bey said.<br><br>"More than simply a big airplane, the newest industry flagship will change forever the way the industry operates," the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation consultancy said in a report.<br><br>Ballantyne said SIA will have the A380 market to itself for almost the next year, until Australian carrier Qantas takes delivery of its first superjumbo.<br><br>"It's a Singapore Airlines thing, being first," Ballantyne said. "It gives them a huge marketing edge."</div>

It is also a source of pride for all Singaporeans and a symbol of the nationÂ’s relentless drive for excellence.<br><br>But being a top airline alone is not enough, said the Prime Minister, it also needs good airport infrastructure to complete the travel experience. "In this regard, the launch of the A380 is a milestone not just for SIA, but also for Changi Airport. Changi is the first airport in the world to handle commercial A380 operations."<br><br>ChangiÂ’s preparedness, said Mr Lee, will stand it in good stead as a key international air hub and strengthen SingaporeÂ’s position as a gateway to the Asia Pacific.<br><br>SIA has purchased 19 Airbus A380 planes in all and five are expected to be delivered next year. The doubleÂ—decked aircraft offers greater efficiency, lower fuel emissions and less noise compared to existing longÂ—haul jets.<br><br>The new A380 planes are expected to replace SIAÂ’s fleet of 14 Boeing 747 jets, which will be phased out in three to four years.<br><br>The superjumbo will be flying to Sydney on 25 October on a charity flight, which has raised some S$1.9 million through an auction of the seats onboard.<br><br>SIA will then use the A380 to operate a daily service between Singapore and Sydney. Come next year, A380 planes will also be used to launch a daily service to London.<br><br>A big welcome party, that took almost 18 months to organise, was laid out for the arrival of A380 at Changi Airport Terminal 3, a S$1.75 billion facility that will open its doors to the public only in January next year.<br><br>The 380,000Â—square metre terminal is seven storeys high and located directly opposite Terminal 2.<br><br>Its main feature is a unique roof architecture which allows natural light into the building. There is also a fiveÂ—storey vertical garden called the Â’Green WallÂ’ which spans 300 metres.<br><br>Terminal 3 will have some 100 retail, food and beverage outlets, and service concessions.<br><br>It will handle 22 million passengers annually, bringing Changi AirportÂ’s total annual passenger handling capacity to about 70 million.

He spent 21 years of his career as an instructor pilot and 14 years as a management pilot.<br><br>Married with two sons, the captain said no special preparation is required to fly the jumbo jet.<br><br>"Although itÂ’s bigger and heavier, the A380 does not pose any special problem that the pilot has to cope with the extended conversion and training on the ground with the airplane should suffice."<br><br>He added: "ItÂ’s a good feeling... itÂ’s a nice aeroplane. ItÂ’s fantastic in its response. Despite its size and its weight, the aeroplane is very agile. It has a fantastic engineering design." Â— CNA/so</div>
