Cant remember the eyesight requirments, check with them. Some of my course mates back then wear spects too but as long as you're within the degree requirments, you're fine. CCA grades arent that important. Just show your enthusiasm for flying and great interest in aviation and planes during the interview so they will feel its worth it to splash money on you. And only the lucky ones get to the PPL (private pilots licence) stage. You're only given 3 months to complete your BFC (basic flying course) and there are lots of factors they can chop you during these 3 months and out you go from yfc; reasons like insufficient flights, poor performance etc. You really require a great deal of luck, time and pray hard the wx doesnt play you out on your sortie. I bet the haze must be doing lots of damage now. Btw, my entire class except 1 guy got chopped.<br><br>So even if you complete your PPL course, you only get a PPL-R, not a true PPL yet so you need to convert at a later date. YFC is affiliated and unofficially run by RSAF so you got better luck joining RSAF, afterall, its an 'unofficial air-grading squadron'. All flights are paid for by your parents and all tax-payers. Just need to folk out 50 bucks for the course materials. Good deal eh? Study hard first man, you got a long way to go.</div>
