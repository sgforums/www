            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there.If I may share my 0.02cts,<br>I ASSuMe you are talking about Flight Engineer as the one that flies onboard n is part of the OCS( Operating Crew System). they are a dinasaur  breed after the B744 came about with technology that replaces the FLight engineer with a single chip. You can differentiate them from the pilots  from the colors on their bars, it is purple wz 3 black stripes. Some of them are also holders of CPL themselves.<br>On the old aircraft that carry the flight engineer as the A300-B4 n later FWD FAcing series,the DC10, L1011,DC8, B74-1/2/3.etc. the FE job  instil lookin after the overall technical health n overview of the aircraft, from fuel, temp, monitoring, BUG speeds, performance. he sit in front of a  panel full of gauges, (arnd 220) if I rememeber correctly .<br>Before the flight, the FE calculates the fuel together wz the captain .F/O and the flt dispatcher over the fuel plan, the pilots wud look further  at flight plan n nav log n ATS clearance. He then calculate the BUG speeds n hand over to the captain for final check after the final weights are finalised  n loadsheet presented.<br>He wud also do the walk around  prior to flights and final check wz the ground engineer or AME for release.<br>ON some freighters ,even though it's the B744, some airlines still carry FE either as a union requirements or Operational requirement, sum of them double up as a loadmaster and ensure all pallets, locks, nets, tie-down points n cargo are firmly secured before the door is closed.the FE also make sure the LIR (Load Instruction Report ) tally wz the weights label that are on the cargo itself.<br>It is no mean feat as a B747 freighter carries up to a full config of 38 pallets position &amp; he has only less than an hour to do all these checks  before door closed n he is up there for " BEFORE take off checks wz his team.<br><br>Well, I hope these helps you to understand what a FE role is or was!<br>FYI, since early 1990s, before 1996, SIA has already laid off the FE n offer either Golden handsakes, role switch to pilot, instructors andeven cabin crew! with the arrrival of the B744.
