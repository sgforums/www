            <div class='col-md body'>You folks must have heard of the last-minute denial of landing rights by the Indonesian government to Valuair. Everyone's guessing what was happening, and Valuair's bosses were reportedly baffled as to what had gone wrong.<br><br>You see, Singaporeans are known to be organised and go by the book, so all the paperwork should have been in order. What could go wrong?<br><br>My boss had a simple explanation. The airline folks forgot to give coffee money to the authorities in Jakarta. Civil servants are paid measely sums in Indonesia and they survive on undertable money.<br><br>My boss should know. He travels to Jakarta frequently for business. In fact, on a recent trip with him, I had to carry some IT equipment in my suitcase and he prepared Rp20,000 in case the X-ray scanner folks made things difficult for me. Our working partner in Indonesia also attests to this way of doing things in that country. So I believe what my boss said has some truth in it.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>SQ22</div>
