              <p>I think the service personnel at the call centre really didn't
              want to help at all. She was rude to challenge a customer to lodge
              a complain even though the terms and conditions are stated as such.
              The point here really is the service level we get from a reputable
              airline. This is a disgrace to SQ especially when her counterpart
              at Paragon is able to offer a solution.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Honestly, if you worked as a service personnel for one day, you can go crazy at the stupidity and sheer insolence you encounter.  In this case, the terms and conditions were already stated and the customer should be thankful and appreciative that they even bothered to help make amendments in the end and not just enforce the terms and conditions strictly. </p>
              <p>If the customer makes a mistake because he/she didn't bother to read the terms and conditions, and as a result suffer penalties, whose fault is it?  Clear-cut - the customer's own fault. </p>
              <p>Stop blaming service personnel just because you can't get things done your way.  If you've made a bad mistake or a bad decision, acknowledge your error and be grateful for any help you do get instead of kpkb'ing.</p>

              <p>Erm, TS never fly before ah? Do you not know that changes make on the flight tickets is very expensive? It costed about 50 bucks per letter...</p>
              <p>So, consider cheap if you top up around 200plus if you got all 3 ticket's date wrong... What painfull lesson? O... I agree... never ask you gf to book your tickets again... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Seriously for SQ side... I do not see any problem. Your GF might be very unreasonable on the phone and I think that the attendant would had asked her superior before she ask her to proceed with the case complain which means, they cannot do anything about it.</p>
              <p>And btw... how much did you pay total for the air fare?</p>

              <p>Hello belle_lim</p>
              <p>When you have simmered down, do a little reflection and you will realise that the fault does not rest with SIA.  It is still one of the finest airline in the world, like it or not.  No, I am not working for SIA.</p>
              <p>Terms and conditions are there for a very good reason.  Internet booking, whether it is promotion or not, is as simple as 123.  If your friend could make a mistake on the date, even after checking, then clearly everyone knows whose fault it is. </p>
              <p>This has got nothing to do with empathy.  It also does not mean that we are "living in a world of cold and heartless people".  We are all level-headed, understanding and reasonable people who see things in the correct perspective.  I do hope that the same applies to you and your friend too.</p>
              <p>It is good that you'd spent 4 good years studying abroad and flying to and fro on SIA.  But 4 years abroad does not give you the entitlement to think that you are above the rest and have every right to correct your "wrong" in ways you perceived as acceptable.</p>
              <p>If you want to rest your case, then do it only after admitting that the blame and mistake rest squarely on your friend and yourself for your way of thoughts. </p>
              <p>No sympathy for you in this case.</p>
              <p> </p>

              I understand where you are coming from. SQ is supposed to be a top-notch airline. But no one is perfect also. Should they be able to offer an alternative, it should be considered a bonus. However, if they fail to do so, it's also not their fault. Don't just look at things from one point of view. Have you ever tried thinking from the operator's perspective?
              
              Let's be fair and understand that no one likes to be threatened. We also canâ€™t compare the staff at the call center and those at paragon. Those at paragon are definitely well-trained as they are the 'image' of the company. 
              
              Just let this incident pass ba. May their service during the flight be a saving grace and continue to uphold the image you have for SQ!!!

              <p>See.. every single one of us here pointed the finger at TS' and his gf. What does this show?</p>
              <p>Hmmmm.. anyway, are you a PPS Solitaire or Life member? And even if you are, don't even think you're all that great. Please don't bank on your loyalty to SQ to have things your way. One of the biggest mistakes people make - based on loyalty and also contribution in monetary profit to get the things they want. Spoilt brats.</p>
              <p>Contribution in monetary profit. - 'I spend XXX amount travelling on SQ every year. Surely this little change is nothing compared to the money I contribute to SQ right? If you don't give me what I want, I never wanna take SQ again. I will fly with other carriers'</p>
              <p>Another example: I spend XXX amt on the phone bills, data services, overseas call, internet. Help me to waive off this amt cause I have never made this call, downloaded this before. If not, I will cancel your service and go to another service provider.</p>
              <p>3rd eg: I'm a member of XXX country club. Why is there no priority in booking? I wanna complain!</p>
              <p>Say, your 100k - 250k/yr worth of airfare as contribution to the company's coffers are peanuts..no, i mean seasame seeds. Oh wait, I bet you don't even reach a quarter of that amount.</p>
              <p>Who the f*ck do you think you are? And so what IF you happen to be a CEO/Director of whatever sh*t company? Bunch of bloody snobs yea?</p>
              <p>I think you have never thought from a service personnel or business' POV. Your 4 years of overseas education taught you nothing but sheer arrogance and had moulded your stinking character to an all new shallow level.</p>
              <p>I think you/your gf must be shouting to this svc personnel or making life difficult for her. Sad sods.</p>
