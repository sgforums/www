              <p><strong>SIA proposes pilots take unpaid leave to help cut costs</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) has proposed its pilots take
              unpaid leave to help the company cut costs. Airlines around the world
              are facing falling passenger numbers amid the global financial crisis.
              <br> <br>Speaking to Channel NewsAsia, President of the Air Line Pilots
              Association of Singapore (ALPA-S), P James said SIA is suggesting that
              captains take three days of leave without pay every month, while first
              officers take four days.
              <br> <br>Captain James said his union is still discussing this proposal with
              SIA. But he said the union wants SIA to provide figures on how much the
              proposal will affect the company's bottom-line before deciding on
              whether to accept it.
              <br> <br>Captain James added that the pilots' pay structure has already
              factored in cost-saving measures and said the airline needs to explain
              why further measures are necessary.
              <br> <br> A captain's average basic salary starts at S$10,000 a month, while a first officer's starting pay is S$6,000.
              <br> <br> When contacted, SIA declined to comment as discussions with the union are ongoing.      - CNA/vm

              <p>Talking about mergers, I drove past Northwest's hangar earlier this week and spotted a couple of ex-NWA A330s freshly repainted in Delta colours. It's hard to believe that NWA, which has been based here in MN for several decades, will soon cease to exist as a corporate entity. A few of my friends in the flying club fly for NWA, and they had to switch over to the new Delta uniforms on April 1st.</p>

              <p>I agree. Delta's white/blue colour scheme doesn't hold a candle to NWA's silver/red livery.</p>
              <p>What was weird, though, was seeing an ex-NWA 744 in Delta colours. Delta hasn't had a 747 in its fleet since 1976.</p>
