              <p>PERTH, Australia: Up to 40 people were injured after a mid—air incident
              forced a Qantas flight — flying from Singapore to Perth — to make an
              emergency landing on Tuesday, a police officer said.</p>
              <p>The Airbus A320 (flight QF 72) made a successful emergency landing
              at an airfield in the Western Australian town of Exmouth after issuing
              a mayday emergency call, Sergeant Greg Lambert of the West Australian
              Police said.</p>
              <p>The Qantas aircraft was due to land in Perth at 3pm local time, but it encountered severe turbulence.</p>
              <p>Qantas
              confirmed that a number of passengers and crew members were injured,
              many of them were believed to have sustained fractures and lacerations.</p>
              <p>It is unclear yet if there are any Singaporeans on board the Qantas flight.</p>
              <p>"It
              is understood up to 40 people were injured during a mid—air incident,"
              Lambert told the Australian Associated Press. "The nature of the
              mid—air incident is unknown."</p>
              <p>Emergency services and medical
              staff were on standby at the airport, which lies about 1,100 kilometres
              northeast of the state capital of Perth, he said.</p>
              <p>Australia’s
              national carrier Qantas, which has suffered a spate of incidents in
              recent months, told AFP it had no information about the incident, but
              was working to find out more.</p>
              <p>Qantas also owns the discount airline Jetstar, which operates around 29 Airbus A320s on domestic routes.</p>
              <p>In
              July, an exploding oxygen bottle punched a huge hole in the side of a
              Qantas Boeing 747—400, forcing an emergency landing in the Philippines.
              No passengers were injured in the mid—air drama.</p>
              <p>Air safety
              investigators announced a safety review of Qantas, which has long been
              known as the world’s safest airline, after two other incidents occurred
              involving its aircraft within two weeks.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Foreign Affairs Ministry (MFA) said there
              are no reports of Singaporeans injured on the Qantas flight that made
              an emergency landing in Exmouth, Western Australia.
              <br> <br> The flight had been en route from Singapore's Changi International Airport to Perth when it encountered severe turbulence.
              <br> <br>The ministry added that it is monitoring the incident and that the
              Singapore High Commission in Canberra is in close contact with Qantas
              and the relevant authorities. Both are ready to help any affected
              Singaporeans.
              <br> <br>MFA's 24-hour Singapore hotline is +65 63798800, while the

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Heated debate online on Qantas scare</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <p>The Qantas flight scare has sparked a heated debate online.</p>
              <p>The question is whether the incident is due to the turbulent weather or is it another case of the airline's malfunctioning.</p>
              <p><em>Claire Huang reports from Melbourne.<br> </em><br> Consumers here are split into two camps over the traumatic Qantas flight Airbus 330-300 from Singapore to Perth.<br> <br> But many are still fiercely rooting for the airline in their internet postings, saying the cause is still unclear.<br> <br> One parent of a passenger onboard the troubled flight wrote on the
              message board that those injured were the ones who didn't buckle their
              seatbelts.<br> <br> So has this deterred consumers from taking Qantas flights?<br> <br> Local media reports said a poll conducted by UMR Omnibus, one of
              Australia's research companies, showed that confidence in the national
              carrier has dipped.<br> <br> But for Professor Terence Lee, who took a three and a half hour Qantas
              flight from Melbourne to Perth recently, the latest incident has little
              bearing on his confidence in Qantas.</p>
              <p>Despite the occasional delays, Mr Lee, who has been taking Qantas for at least 15 years, says he will continue to do so.<br> <br> And he has already bought tickets for the whole family via the same airline when he goes back to Singapore in December.<br> <br> "Airline incidents are bound to happen at some point or other, for
              every airline and having a few incidences, wouldn't necessarily
              translate into a higher risk in that regard," Mr Lee told 938Live.<br> <br> Others I spoke to, including students and businessmen, said they're not surprised that this incident happened.<br> <br> A University of Western Australia student, Nishta, who has travelled
              with the airline, explained there're often several hiccups before or
              during the flight.</p>
              <p>For example, she said, when her mother recently travelled from
              Singapore to Sydney, the flight was delayed for two hours and airlines
              officials cited mainternance checks as the reason. - 938Live</p>

              <p><strong>38 Singaporeans on board Qantas mid-air jet incident</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Australian airline Qantas has confirmed that 38
              Singaporeans were on board QF 72 which made an emergency landing at
              Learmonth on Tuesday.
              <br> <br>Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said most of the
              injured Singaporeans were given outpatient treatment while a few are
              under observation and in stable condition.
              <br> <br> Qantas said up to 74 passengers were injured in varying severity, from abrasions and contusions to fractures.
              <br> <br>MFA and Singapore's High Commission in Canberra said they are in
              contact with the injured Singaporeans or their next-of-kin. The High
              Commission is monitoring the situation and will provide consular
              assistance to them.
              <br> <br>Qantas said 131 of those on board were Australians. There were also
              53 Britons and 40 Indian nationals. So far, the airline has not
              released details of the names of affected passengers. <br> <br> 14 passengers are in serious condition, but none life-threatening.
              Another 30 were sent to a hospital in Perth and others treated for
              minor conditions.
              <br> <br> Qantas' Chief Executive Officer said the carrier is investigating the cause of Flight QF72's sudden altitude change.
              <br> <br>The Airbus 330's black box and cockpit voice recorder have been
              removed for investigations by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.
              <br> <br>The flight took off from Singapore and was on its way to Perth when
              the incident happened. About 48 kilometres from Learmouth, the aircraft
              which was cruising at 37,000 feet, nose-dived unexpectedly. - CNA/vm </span></p>
