            <div class='col-md body'>Tiger Airways- how now?<br><br>Sep 13, 2006<br><strong>Tiger Airways tells passengers: 'Keep clear of the aisle, we are coming to sell food and drinks' </strong><br>I returned to Singapore from Hanoi on Tiger Airways. It was the first time that I travelled on Tiger Airways and it gave me a different perspective of what budget airlines mean. I expect no service but not arrogance.<br>The following is what I heard and observed during the flight:<br>"You cannot eat outside food on board." This was what the flight attendant told a non-English speaking passenger. The poor passenger was embarrassed and had to put away her pastry.<br>I have not been told nor have I read of this prohibition from the time I booked the ticket till I checked in. If there is such a rule, it should be stated clearly on the ticket or boarding pass.<br>"Keep clear of the aisle, we are coming to sell food and drinks", said the voice over the PA system.<br>In all my years of travelling, no airline has ever made such a demand on its passengers. Flight attendants are expected to make way for passengers and not the other way around.<br>"Switch off your hand phones, otherwise we will issue a warning letter or confiscate the phone."<br>While this warning was given after the third reminder that hand phones should not be used on board, is it necessary to announce the threat over the PA system?<br>With this experience, I'd rather pay a few dollars more to travel on the full service airlines to enjoy full service and be greeted with friendly smiles and attitudes. All this adds up to make a trip more pleasant.<br>William Teo Jui Wah<br>-----------------<br><br>Home &gt; ST Forum &gt; Story<br>July 26, 2007<br><strong>Woe after woe for Tiger Airways passengers </strong><br>I WAS on board Tiger Airways Flight TR 152 from Singapore to Phuket last Thursday. At about 7.10am the plane made its way to the runway and proceeded to take off. After travelling some distance, it started to slow down and eventually came to a stop. The pilot announced that there was a 'configuration problem' and that it would be investigated. He then taxied the plane to the side.<br>After some time, he announced that he could not find anything wrong and would attempt another take-off. He then taxied the plane to the runway for take-off. Again, the plane travelled a short distance before coming to a halt. The pilot announced that he would have engineers investigate the problem and the plane was subsequently taxied to the terminal gate.<br>More time elapsed and eventually the pilot announced that the 'problem was more involved' than he initially thought. We were transferred to another plane.<br>En route to the runway, the second plane stopped for a considerable length of time. The pilot eventually announced that the weather-detection radar was faulty and he would have to get it replaced. We made another trip to the terminal gate and the plane finally took off after the faulty radar was replaced.<br>Approaching Phuket airport, the landing was aborted, with the pilot saying that visibility was poor and he would have to make another approach. We circled Phuket; the second attempt was also aborted as visibility had not improved. Prior to the third landing attempt, the pilot remarked that 'it was just not his day'. This statement further undermined the confidence of passengers. We finally touched down at about 11.35am, Phuket time.<br>Several serious issues arise from this incident. Firstly, why did the pilot attempt a second take-off when there was a configuration problem?<br>Another issue is the question of maintenance. The reserve plane also had faulty equipment. How does Tiger Airways ensure that its planes are airworthy?<br>There has been a spate of incidents involving budget airlines of neighbouring countries.<br>This incident involving Tiger Airways raises concerns as to whether safety standards are being compromised.<br><br>Passengers need strong reassurance from the airline that such incidents will not recur.<br><br>Johnny Ong Hock Lam<br>Latest comments @  <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_142618.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_142618.html</a><strong></strong></div>
