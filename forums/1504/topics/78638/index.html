            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A380 to cost US$281m: Airbus chairman </strong><br><br>PARIS : Airbus has put a catalogue price of 281 million dollars (234.6 million euros) on its future super-jumbo A380 model and expects at least one major Japanese airline to buy it, chairman Noel Forgeard said.<br><br>Speaking before a ceremony to open massive production facilities at Toulouse, southern France, later on Friday, he said: "The catalogue price of the A380 is 281 millions dollars (235 million euros) apiece."<br><br>Forgeard told US cable news television CNBC: "I'm very confident that at least one major Japanese carrier will operate the A380 for a very simple reason.<br><br>"Others carriers like Air France, Singapore or Lufthansa will operate the A380 in Tokyo Narita and then it will obviously put a huge pressure on the operators if they do not have the A380," he said in reference to the Japanese capital's main airport.<br><br>The plane, expected to carry more than 500 passengers, is being developed by Airbus, which is 80-percent owned by the European Aeronautic Defense and Space company (EADS) and 20 percent by BAE Systems of Britain.<br><br>Forgeard acknowledged that airlines rarely pay the catalogue price for planes, noting also that market prices were currently stable.<br><br>"In general, airplanes are sold today at about the same price in current dollars as three years ago, before September 11" terror attacks against the United States, he said.<br><br>"This is good for the airlines but it's (a) more difficult environment for us," the Airbus chairman said, before adding that his company was making "huge progress" in productivity.<br><br>The future super-jumbo will also be highly fuel efficient, Forgeard told France Inter radio, consuming around three litres (0.78 gallons) per passenger for 100 kilometers.<br><br>"The fact that oil is very expensive is very favorable for the A380 because it will be the most economical plane in existence," consuming "less than a small car," he claimed.<br><br>Forgeard admitted however that high oil prices could hurt the airline sector in general.<br><br>Speaking on the delicate issue of job relocations, he said Airbus does not have "a policy of relocalisation in the aim of finding lower prices elsewhere.<br><br>"Our base is primarily European but it could happen that in order to reach certain important markets, for example in China or Russia, we have to pay a price on the industrial level."<br><br>- AFP<br>=====================================================<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Courtesy channelnewsasia.com Friday, May 7th 2004</span></div>
