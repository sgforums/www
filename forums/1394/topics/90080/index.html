            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.lambiek.net/artists/sutherland_david/sutherland_bashstreet.jpg"><br><br>Anyone here a fan of 'The Bash Street Kids'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Hee hee, short introduction. From left to right,<br><br><strong>Danny</strong> - The leader with the soul of a pirate. Wears a skull and crossbones sweater that his grandma knitted him, and a floppy red school cap which indicates his rebellious nature. He is quite crafty with his own sort of intelligence. (My favourite)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Sidney</strong> - Toots' twin brother and the keeper of a dozen animals. He wishes to become a vet when he grows older because he knows more about animals than anything. Sidney always has spiky hair resembling a chimney sweeper's brush in which he takes pride. (Lord of the jungle)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Plug </strong>- The hideously ugly one who uses his face to his best defence. He's so ugly that when he pulls a face he becomes handsome. He also has a good sense of humour. His name comes from the word pug. He later appeared in his own comic, called simply 'Plug' (1977 - 1979), which starred him and his two pets, Pug, from Pup Parade, and Chunkee the Monkey. His name used to be Pug - the L was added when Smiffy had a spare one when spelling the word "sily". Plug's "real name" was first revealed as "Percival Proudfoot Plugsey" on the cover of 'Plug', although earlier issues of the Beano give him the name Claude. (Beware his eye power)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Fatty</strong> - A boy that can never stop eating. (The human dustbin) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Smiffy</strong> - The naive, somewhat dumb one who often confuses genders and nouns. He can be very kind and aware of things, but most of the time he can't even remember simple sums. He has two brothers, Whiffy and Normal Norman. (Beware of his head, breaks almost anything!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Toots</strong> - Sidney's twin sister and the girl of the class and the youngest. A classy tomboy who can be as bossy as Danny when she wants to be, but has more of a heart than any of her friends. She is very tough and the boys have no problem letting her join in their games. (Actually a very sweet girl)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br><strong>Wilfred </strong>- An interesting boy, with thoughts hidden behind the depth of his green jumper. He often resembles a tortoise and has a mystery about his neck that he never reveals. Whenever he takes off his jumper all we see is a vest up to his nose. (The mystery one)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><strong>Spotty</strong> - A short character who is often compared to Christmas pudding. He is quite handy when he wants to be, and his attire (like his extraordinarily long tie) often helps the kids out in tough situations. In the 1981 Beano Book, it was revealed that Spotty has 976 spots. (Christmas pudding... I like!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Erbert</strong> - A shortsighted boy who can see perfectly well without spectacles. But with them, he is as blind as a bat. (Remind of me)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(Not in picture)</strong></span><br><br><strong>Teacher</strong> - never "Teach" although sometimes "Sir" - is also worth a special mention for having to put up with Class 2B all these years.<br>Cuthbert Cringeworthy - The brightest child in the class, a teacher's pet that tends to be bossy, rude, and spoiled. He has a name for every letter of the alphabet. His first appearance in the strip was in 1971. He looks very much like Teacher (a play on the DC Thompson comics' tradition that pets look like their owners (e.g. Dennis the Menace and Gnasher) and his status as teacher's pet).<br><br><strong>Janitor</strong> - The school's janitor. He hates litter and rule breakage. He seems to enjoy bossing Winston about.<br><br><strong>Winston</strong> - The school's cat. He is often seen mopping the floor with Janitor.<br><br><strong>Head</strong> - The pompous and portly school headmaster. He is very fond of tea and biscuits.<br><br><strong>Olive </strong>- The school cook, who first appeared in the strip in 1980. Everyone hates her food, as the ingredients for it include items such as old books and the like. On the other hand, she has a high opinion of her cuisine.<br></div>
