            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2004 Mazda RX 8</strong></span><br><br>Mazda has announced that the rotary powered sports coupe first seen as the concept model RX-Evolv two years ago and shown as the RX-8 at the Detroit Motor Show in January this year will now go into production to bring a rotary engine car back into the Mazda line up and will carry the name RX-8.<br><br>The stylish design and innovative packaging offers a sleek sports coupe that is a true four seater, with easy access to the rear passenger compartment through the freestyle four-door configuration that has removed the need for a central B pillar.<br><br>Powered by an ingenious normally aspirated 250 bhp 1.3-litre rotary engine, coupled to a five speed manual transmission with a short throw gear change and 50:50 weight distribution, the RX-8 will meet the expectations of drivers who want the excitement and performance of a true sports car and those whose life style demands a four seater, but want the spirited driving experience of a performance car.<br><br>The striking styling gives an athletic and stable impression with a dynamic feeling of motion. The classic rear-wheel-drive layout places visual emphasis on the rear wheels, the eye is drawn from the aggressive front air intake along the curvaceous body to the beautifully formed rear. Short front and rear overhangs underline the vehicle's look of stability, the low front end can only be made possible by the compact rotary engine and the front wheel arches stand high and clear of the bonnet to allow a clear view of the front corners.<br><br>There are a number of innovative design touches that point to the car's power source; the rotor shape is used on the power bulge on the bonnet, the rear fog light, the gear stick and in the front seat headrests.<br><br>The insightful interior is exciting yet functional, all instruments are placed ergonomically close to the driver for ease of use, and the driver and front seat passenger are held firmly in place by lightweight bucket seats. The gear stick is placed so the hand falls naturally to it and is placed on an aluminium central transmission tunnel that runs the full length of the cockpit.<br><br>The rear passengers enter through the innovative freestyle door system; the rear doors are hinged at the rear and the B pillar has been removed; this allows easy access to the rear and sleek coupe styling, something that cannot be achieved with traditional coupes or conventional four door design. As a safety measure, the rear doors can only be opened when the front doors are open. When the front doors are closed the rear doors are locked safely into the bodywork by top and bottom latches and cannot be opened accidentally, thus making the Mazda RX-8 a true coupe design when driving but an easy access four door car when loading and unloading.<br><br>The boot of the RX-8 is also highly functional with enough space for luggage or two sets of golf clubs.<br><br>The Mazda RX-8 boasts front-midship layout: with the next-generation compact RENESIS rotary engine mounted 60mm further back and 40mm lower than in the RX7, the engine centre of gravity is behind the front axle giving the car a perfect 50:50 front/rear weight distribution. With a 2,700mm wheelbase the RX-8 is tremendously nimble and controllable with excellent high-speed handling.<br><br>The RENESIS rotary engine, thanks to a redesign of the side intake and side exhaust ports, has high maximum outputs or 250 bhp at 8,500 rpm and torque of 152 lb-ft at 7,500 rpm.<br><br>The transmission tunnel that runs the length of the cockpit also houses a backbone that runs from the front to the rear bulkhead enhancing rigidity and allowing a reduction in body panel thickness and weight; this also contributes to safety in the event of a collision. Other weight saving designs include a carbon fibre propeller shaft and lightweight closed section power plant frame which locks the entire powertrain into a single rigid unit enhancing direct and liner acceleration and crisp shift operation.<br><br>"While the RX-8 is a genuine sports car, it also delivers the functionality of a 4 door, 4 seater. Embodying unprecedented value, it really is a 'sports car like no other.' Expect great things at next year's launch," said Masazumi Wakayama, Executive Officer, General Manager, Domestic Marketing Div.<br><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/08/mazdarx8_2.jpg"><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/08/mazdarx8_1.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/01/rx802_engine2.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2003 Mazda Atenza/Mazda 6</strong></span><br><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/01/atenza_4.jpg"><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/01/atenza_5.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/01/atenza_6.jpg"><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/01/atenza_inter.jpg"></div>

ItÂ¡Â¦s a two-seat, mid-engine, rear-wheel drive roadster designed for the sports car enthusiast on a budget.<br><br>Capable of performing with vehicles that cost nearly twice its price, the MR2 Spyder has had an enormous impact on the way consumers think about Toyota products.<br><br>Developed to deliver true driver enjoyment, the lightweight MR2 Spyder features a wide, low-slung platform, a long wheelbase, and a mid-mounted engine for superior handling.<br><br>Power is supplied by the same 1.8-liter twin-cam 16-valve four-cylinder engine offered in the new Celica GT. The engine features VVT-i cylinder head technology, which is a variable-valve timing with intelligence system similar to the design currently used in Lexus engines. Rated at 138 hp at 6,400 rpm and 125 lbs.-ft. of torque at 4,400 rpm, the MR2 SpyderÂ¡Â¦s favorable power-to-weight ratio has contributed to a zero-to-60 acceleration time of 6.95 seconds.<br><br>Power is applied to the rear wheels of the MR2 Spyder through a standard five-speed manual transmission or a new-for-2002 sequential manual transmission (SMT). The MR2 Spyder is the first U.S.-market Toyota model to feature this new, sophisticated transmission. The clutch pedal and gear selector have been replaced with a single shifter. The SMT clutch and gear selector operations are performed by ECU computer controlled actuators and the engine is also equipped with electronic throttle control to allow the ECU to reduce torque during shifts.<br><br>Upshifts or downshifts are achieved by moving the selector to the + or - positions. SMT includes standard steering wheel mounted shift buttons and cruise control. The lack of a clutch pedal provides the convenience of an automatic transmission with the interaction of a manual transmission.<br><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/12/mr2_spyder02_01_800.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Toyota Celica GT-S 2002 is all about "Action"</strong></span><br><br>Type: Inline-4<br>Displacement cu in (cc): 109 (1794)<br>Power bhp (kW) at RPM: 180(134) / 7600<br>Torque lb-ft (Nm) at RPM: 130(176) / 6800<br>Acceleration 0-62 mph s: 6.6<br><br>The seventh-generation Toyota Celica has been a head turner since its launch. With its cutting-edge styling, which borrows many Champ-car design elements, including its radically lowered front fascia, the Celica appeals to young, new car buyers looking for sports car excitement. New for 2002 is a standard front bumper mesh grille.<br><br>The new Celica "Action" Package turns that hot look even hotter. Styled at Calty Design Research, Inc., ToyotaÂ¡Â¦s U.S. styling studio in Newport Beach, Calif., the "Action" package adds an aggressive front-bumper, rocker panels and rear aero bumper, which are constructed of durable polyurethane, and an adjustable rear wing. The body kit, which is affordably priced as a $1,590 option, is factory installed to ensure high quality fit, and is available on both the Celica GT and Celica GT-S.<br><br>Celica GT-S is powered by a 1.8-liter, four-cylinder DOHC all-aluminum engine that generates 180 horsepower at 7,600 rpm and 130 lbs./ft. of torque at 6,800 rpm. The GT-S powerplant utilizes variable valve timing and lift, with intelligence control (VVTL-i) to inject an extra dose of performance from 6,000 rpm to the redline at 7,800 rpm. VVTL-i increases the intake/exhaust lift when the engine speed is high to improve output and fuel efficiency. Weighing in at only 2,500 pounds, it has one of the best power-to-weight ratios in its segment.<br><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/11/celica_gts02_01.jpg"><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/11/celica_gts02_02.jpg"></div>

Additionally, a high-capacity clutch, featured in the 6-speed manual transmission, results in exceptionally smooth and quiet shifting.<br><br>The S2000's excellent road manners are the result of an optimum 50/50 weight distribution, racing-inspired in-wheel double wishbone suspension and highly rigid body structure. Marked by the high central tunnel that runs down the center of the cockpit and serves as the backbone of the vehicle, the S2000's "X-bone frame" provides enhanced bending and torsional rigidity.<br><br>The central design theme of the S2000's interior is performance. Designed after a Formula One race car, the interior features a driver-oriented control layout, with a digital instrument panel and engine start button reminiscent of modern racing cars.<br><br>The S2000's exterior features the following colors: Berlina Black, Grand Prix White, New Formula Red, Sebring Silver Metallic, Silverstone Metallic, Spa Yellow and Suzuka Blue Metallic. New for the 2003 is tan added as an interior color for Grand Prix White.<br><br>For 2002, the S2000 earned accolades from both the automotive press and public alike.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2004 Impreza WRX STi</strong></span><br><br>Subaru of America, Inc. introduced the long-awaited 2004 Impreza WRX STi, an ultra high-performance all-wheel drive sedan, at the North American International Auto Show. Based on the critically acclaimed Subaru Impreza WRX, Impreza WRX STi is completely re-engineered to provide world-class sports car levels of acceleration, handling and braking performance. Impreza WRX STi will serve as the performance flagship of the Subaru line when it arrives in dealerships this summer and will earn distinction as the most powerful Subaru ever offered for sale in North America.<br><br>The Impreza WRX STi draws motorsports technology directly from Subaru expertise in World Rally Championship (WRC) competition, and is designed to appeal to the serious driving enthusiast. Impreza WRX STi is powered by a turbocharged and intercooled 2.5-liter DOHC boxer engine producing 300 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm and 300 lb.-ft. of peak torque @ 4,000 rpm, teamed exclusively to a 6-speed manual transmission. Power is transferred to all four wheels via a sophisticated Subaru All-Wheel Drive system designed to optimize performance in all conditions.<br><br>Introducing Subaru Tecnica International (STI)<br><br>STI stands for Subaru Tecnica International, the high-performance and motorsports subsidiary of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. Subaru, which offers the only exclusively All-Wheel Drive line of passenger cars and crossover-type vehicles in the United States, has been proving the performance and durability of its All-Wheel Drive technology in World Rally Championship competition since 1989.<br><br>Until now, STi-badged Subaru vehicles had been available only in select world markets. However, the success of the WRX in the U.S. prompted strong (and vocal) demand from American consumers for an even more extreme-performance version of this car.<br><br>As a result, the U.S.-market Impreza WRX STi gives up nothing compared to models offered in Europe, Japan and other markets and in some ways offers more performance. For example, the 2.5-liter turbocharged powerplant is the largest displacement engine ever installed in a WRX STi model and is exclusive to the North American market. This unique engine also provides strong torque characteristics at both low and high rpm.<br><br>Rally Tested, Road Ready<br><br>The Impreza WRX STi benefits from the redesigned front and rear styling of the 2004 Impreza line. The expressive new design is the result of close consultation with Subaru STi engineers and the Subaru World Rally Team to improve air resistance, optimize lift force balance, maximize engine cooling and provide Impreza models with a bolder, more dynamic appearance. In its exterior design, Impreza WRX STi leaves no doubts about its performance potential -- a look that is equally functional. The enlarged hood scoop in the aluminum hood feeds outside air to the intercooler that is significantly larger than the unit found on Impreza WRX. A completely functional dual element rear spoiler -- which appears to be borrowed directly from the Subaru World Rally Car -- helps reduce lift and improve stability at high speed. Airflow is also managed via front side spoilers on the front bumper and STi side ground effects. The front fascia features four high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps with smoke tinted lenses and distinctive STi fog light insert covers for a no-nonsense look. Large diameter Brembo?brakes are clearly visible between the spokes of the 17-inch lightweight aluminum- alloy BBS?wheels.<br><br>The 2.5-liter horizontally opposed ("boxer") four-cylinder engine is based on a specially reinforced "semi-closed deck" engine block with forged aluminum alloy pistons, forged high-carbon steel connecting rods and sodium-filled exhaust valves. This advanced powerplant incorporates Subaru AVCS (Active Valve Control System) variable valve timing technology to optimize the engineÂ’s volumetric efficiency throughout the rev band. It is the first application of this technology on a Subaru in North America. The large capacity intercooler includes a manually operated water spray feature to provide additional cooling.<br><br>Driver-Adjustable All-Wheel Drive<br><br>WRX STi is equipped with the brandÂ’s most performance-directed All-Wheel Drive system with DCCD (Driver Control Center Differential). In automatic mode, the computer varies the front/rear torque split automatically depending on driving conditions and driver input. In manual mode, the DCCD system allows the driver to vary the front-to-rear torque distribution for different driving conditions.<br><br>Using a small control wheel on the carÂ’s center console, the driver can set the system to transfer as much as 65 percent of available torque to the rear wheels to increase handling agility.<br><br>Standard safety features include front seat head/chest side impact air bags (SRS), dual front airbags and three-point seatbelts. Front seat belts include electrically triggered pre-tensioners and force limiters. All 2004 Impreza models receive collapsible pedal controls that "break away" during a frontal impact to help reduce foot injuries.<br><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/02/imprezawrxsti03_01.jpg"><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/02/imprezawrxsti03_01.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/02/imprezawrc03-wrxsti03_800.jpg"></div>

Indeed, the Z3 has come to the end of its lifecycle this past June and the new Z4 has begun its career with a production start in September.<br><br>But there is more, much more, to the Z4's debut than just "successor replaces predecessor." The new Z4 roadster takes BMW and the roadster segment to another level.<br><br>Built on a longer wheelbase, the new Z4 is slightly wider and longer than the Z3. But so much more substance and stance has been built into a vehicle that has not grown significantly in size. The Z4 delivers everything roadster - two-seater, long and sweeping hood, short front and rear overhangs, low and rearward seating, and soft top - in a modern, athletic and assertive new design.<br><br>The Z4 places BMW squarely in the field of sophisticated, full-featured sport roadsters. It comes exclusively with 6-cylinder power and offers a choice of four transmission types (Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) available as of April 2003 production.) Its chassis engineering is new, encompassing multi-link rear suspension, run-flat tires and wheel/tire diameters up to 18 inches. The Z4 offers amenities and options never before seen in a regular-production BMW roadster. Safety engineering and features have been further developed.<br><br>The Z4 Series is produced at BMW's Spartanburg, South Carolina manufacturing facility, employing the most advanced production equipment and processes. Production at Spartanburg began on September 3, and will serve all BMW markets. Two models will be offered: the Z4 2.5i at $33,795 base price including destination; and the higher-performing, more extensively equipped Z4 3.0i at $40,945. These are modest increases not only in view of the new models' new technology and features: The Full Maintenance included in BMW base prices has been extended from 3 years/36,000 miles to 4 years/50,000 miles.<br><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/02/z403_07_800.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/02/z403_08.jpg"><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/02/z403_10.jpg"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2002 Mercedes-Benz SLK 32</strong></span><br><br>Mercedes-AMG GmbH has introduced a new dimension into the compact roadster sector: the new SLK 32 AMG is not only an exciting car with high-tech equipment, but with its 260 kW/354 hp AMG V6 supercharged engine, it will occupy a leading position among the open two-seaters in this class and will set drivers' hearts racing. No other compact roadster sparkles with quite such supreme performance characteristics. The Mercedes-Benz SLK 32 AMG accelerates from standstill to 100 km/h in just 5.2 seconds and achieves an electronically limited maximum speed of 250 km/h.<br><br>The new high-power engine developed by Mercedes-AMG from the V6 of the SLK 320 is responsible for this outstanding performance. By using a compact supercharger that has an exceptional air flow rate, the engineers from Affalterbach near Stuttgart were able to boost the output of the series-production powerplant by 100 kW/136 hp and the maximum torque by 140 Newton metres. They attached particular importance to dynamic torque generation. Thus the exciting roadster provides all the power it needs and more at very low revolutions, but also glides along effortlessly when cruising in a high gear; 400 of the 450 Newton metres is on tap from an engine speed of only 2300 rpm.<br><br>The engineers at Mercedes-AMG created the conditions for these brilliant figures by using a belt-driven helical supercharger. This innovative technology produces roughly 30 percent more charge pressure than conventional engine-driven charging systems. The charger is controlled on the basis of the pre-stored characteristic engine data as a function of engine speed and load, and activated by an electro-magnetic coupling. This has also enabled the Mercedes-AMG engineers to give the high-performance roadster exemplary environmental credentials. Despite the high performance of its supercharged power unit, the SLK 32 AMG achieves an NEDC combined fuel consumption of a mere 11.2 litres per 100 kilometres using premium unleaded fuel (95 RON). The exhaust emissions of this muscular six-cylinder even meet the strict EU-4 emission standard, which comes into force in 2005.<br><br>Rear axle lift reduced by 50%<br><br>The body styling of the SLK 32 AMG also makes its own exclusive mark. As is the case with all high-performance vehicles in the Mercedes AMG range, top priority was given to a unique character and aerodynamic efficiency. The front and rear aprons, side skirts and an elegantly integrated airflow breakaway edge on the boot lid, which reduces the lift on the rear axle by more than 50 per cent, give the SLK 32 AMG its own dynamic appearance.<br><br>The striking AMG styling elements are continued in the interior. Sports seats with integrated head restraints, designed especially for the high-performance roadster, ensure superb lateral support as well as high levels of comfort on long journeys. Both seats and door panels are trimmed with specially seelected two-tone leather as standard, the same fine material that is to be found on the AMG steering wheel and gear knob. Similarly attractive is the trim on the centre console in high-quality, dark birds-eye maple. The individually designed instrument faces, including a speedometer that shows speeds of up to 300 km/h - in the case of the SLK 32 AMG in silver - are also typical of Mercedes AMG. For the first time the speed is shown in steps of 30 km/h.<br><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/08/m_slk32amg_frontr_800.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/08/m_slk32amg_back.jpg"><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/08/m_slk32amg_front.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The 2003 Acura NSX: The Legacy Continues To Grow</strong></span><br><br>The NSX supercar exemplifies the precision crafted performance that lies at the heart of every Acura vehicle. Developed out of years of racing experience, the NSX sets the benchmark for Acura technology, combining world-class performance and styling with exceptional drivability and refinement.<br><br>"The NSX continues to excite the imagination of driving enthusiasts," said Dick Colliver, executive vice president, auto sales. "The NSX is a true icon in the supercar class."<br><br>NSX engine is equipped with Acura's patented VTECTM (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control), a Variable Volume Induction System, direct ignition and a computerized Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) system pioneered in Formula One racing. The NSX engine also features titanium connecting rods, which are stronger and lighter than comparable steel connecting rods.<br><br>To complement these innovative powertrains, the NSX chassis features an all-aluminum unit body construction that is 40 percent lighter, yet has the rigidity of a steel structure. The 4-wheel independent double-wishbone suspension features aluminum-alloy control arms and hub carriers that minimize unsprung weight and provide optimum handling. The suspension also features aluminum subframes for the front and rear suspension to further reduce weight. Forged-aluminum alloy wheels reduce unsprung weight while super high performance tires - 215/40 R17 in front and 255/40 R17 in the rear - provide maximum traction and handling.<br><br>The NSX's braking system features large-diameter, ventilated four-wheel discs and an advanced 4-channel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) for confident braking. A sophisticated Traction Control System (TCS) helps limit wheel-spin and enhances control.<br><br>The 2003 NSX features a removable roof panel for open-air driving. A sculpted, wedge-shaped body and forward canopy design clearly communicate the car's high performance personality. Additional features include a body integrated rear spoiler and airfoil, power operated sideview mirrors and Xenon High-Intensity Discharge projector-beam headlights. The NSX comes in seven exterior colors, which can be ordered with a matching or complementary interior color.<br><br>Inside, the hand-stitched, leather-trimmed interior of the NSX is designed to evoke the image of a jet fighter cockpit, providing excellent visibility, easy-to-read instrumentation and supportive, power operated seats. As with all Acura models, the NSX comes with a long list of standard equipment and comfort and convenience features including an Automatic Climate Control System, an Acura/Bose" Music System, power windows and door locks, cruise control and a theft deterrent system with electronic immobilizer.<br><br>Advanced safety features include a supplemental airbag restraint system (SRS) and 3-point seat belts with automatic pretensioners. Substantial front and rear crumple zones are designed to distribute impact energy around the passenger compartment in the event of a collision, while large side-sill extensions and sturdy support beams in each door help protect the cabin from side impact forces.<br><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/06/honda_nsx-r_front.jpg"><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/06/honda_nsx-r_back.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.rsportscars.com/foto/06/honda_nsx-r_inter.jpg"></div>
