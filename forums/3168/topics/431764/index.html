              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: In its heyday, the Kallang Theatre was the setting 
              for the Prime Minister's annual National Day Rally speech as well as 
              original local works and world class musicals such as Les Miserables and
               Phantom of the Opera.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>But the curtain came
               down on the 1,800-seat theatre on March 31, 2007, amid dwindling 
              utilisation rates, as new venues such as the Esplanade-Theatres on the 
              Bay moved into the spotlight. </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Come August, the 
              Kallang Theatre will come alive after a four-year hiatus with the 
              ambitions of becoming a regional arts and culture hub. <br><br>For 
              starters, it will stage a 80-minute musical primarily targeted at 
              tourists and foreigners about the Republic's history from Sang Nila 
              Utama days to modern day, titled Singapura - The Lion City Show.<br><br>Its
               operator, Asia Arts &amp; Culture (AAC), which made the announcement 
              yesterday on the sidelines of performing arts trade exhibition LIVE! 
              Singapore, said it will also market its in-house group of performers and
               shows for external events, both locally and elsewhere in Asia.<br><br>The
               Singapore Land Authority offered the Kallang Theatre building for 
              tender in January. After a successful tender to operate and manage the 
              premise, AAC - a Singapore-China joint-venture with the Yunnan 
              Provincial Performing Arts Group - will be working with the Singapore 
              Tourism Board to turn Kallang Theatre into an "Asian Arts and Culture 
              hub", the operator said in a press release. It added that it was also 
              tasked to "strongly promote Kallang Theatre as a preferred venue" for 
              the arts and MICE events.<br><br>The theatre will also have facilities 
              such as dance halls and F&amp;B outlets. Booking slots for the use of 
              Kallang Theatre auditorium and various other facilities will be 
              available from next month. <br><br>Arts groups here welcomed the 
              re-opening. Said The Substation artistic co-director Audrey Wong: "It 
              will be a good alternative venue that fills the gap left by Victoria 
              Theatre while it undergoes renovations."<br><br>But she felt the 
              theatre's reopening would have "no big impact on the local arts scene, 
              in terms of creating original content" otherwise.<br><br>Few local arts groups would be able to hold shows there as well because the capacity was too large, she added.<br><br>The
               Necessary Stage's founder and artistic director Alvin Tan hoped that 
              the iconic theatre would go beyond being just a venue to hold shows.<br><br>"If
               it can have an artistic vision of encouraging intercultural work, such 
              as showcasing the different cultural traditions we have here, then it 
              will be more meaningful," he told Today.<br><br>"We don't have a strong 
              historical culture like Japan because we are a migrant country but we 
              have cultures like Peranakan and the theatre can work towards supporting
               works showcasing a uniquely Singapore identity."<br><br>The Kallang 
              Theatre was built in the 1970s as a cinema but was converted into a 
              performing arts venue in 1986 to replace the National Theatre, which was
               demolished in the same year.<br><br>The theatre's then-operator 
              National Arts Council decided to shut it down after its utilisation rate
               dropped from 80 per cent to only 33 per cent in 2005 - catering mostly 
              to schools and non-arts-related hirers.</span></span></p>
