              <p>When you surf the web into the wee hours of the night or constantly 
              burn the midnight oil to rush your work, you could be putting yourself 
              at a greater risk of developing medical conditions such as heart disease
               or diabetes.</p>
              <p>This is because prolonged <span id="lw_1300361815_3" class="yshortcuts">sleep deprivation</span>,
               which means less than four or five hours of sleep each night for years,
               puts the body in a stressful condition, explained Dr Lim Li Ling, 
              Medical Director of the Singapore Neurology &amp; Sleep and president of
               the Singapore Sleep Society.</p>
              <p>Noting Singapore's fast-paced environment, Dr Lim said, "The biggest 
              problem in sleep in Singapore is one of voluntary sleep deprivation."</p>
              <p>"Most people like to sleep but they don't feel it's as important as 
              working on a project or being on the Internet," she said. "My sense is 
              that over all, awareness (on the importance of good sleep) is not very 
              high."</p>
              <p>The Singapore Sleep Society surveyed nearly 400 junior college students 
              and found that 97 per cent feel drowsy during class and three in 10 
              drink caffeinated beverages to stay awake during the day.</p>
              <p>The recently published <em><em>Philips Index for Health</em></em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>and Well-being </em>report,
               a research conducted across 23 countries including Singapore, found 
              that 35 per cent of people feel they are not getting enough sleep, 
              impacting their physical and mental health.</p>
              <p>For World Sleep Day
               on Friday, the Singapore Sleep Society and Philips, in partnership with
               the World Association of Sleep Medicine, are separately running 
              campaigns to encourage people to sleep more and raise awareness on sleep
               disorders.</p>
              <p>Common sleep disorders in Singapore are insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where a person stops breathing multiple times while asleep 
              because the upper airways are blocked and it is hard for air to enter 
              the lungs.</p>
              <p>Doctors estimate 10 to 30 per cent of the population here have 
              insomnia, while up to 25 per cent of the population here have OSA. 
              Global studies show 4 per cent of middle aged men and 2 per cent of 
              women have OSA.</p>
              <p>The figures vary as there are no recent local studies on sleep disorders because of funding and manpower issues, doctors said.</p>
              <p>But while the numbers differ, doctors do agree that more people could
               be suffering from OSA as obesity rates rise. Weight has a direct effect
               on OSA as the additional fat around the neck could make the airway 
              narrower and obstruct breathing.</p>
              <p>Signs of OSA include snoring, waking up in the middle of the night breathless and feeling tired in the day.</p>
              <p>Dr Lee Yeow Hian, a consultant in respiratory medicine in Tan Tock 
              Seng Hospital said the "vast majority" of people with OSA go undiagnosed
               as they are either not aware of the condition, or they are not aware of
               their symptoms are they are asleep.</p>
              <p>Yet in the long term, people with OSA are at a higher risk of getting
               cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, stroke, heart attack and 
              diabetes.</p>
              <p>Said Dr Ong Thun How, the director of the Singapore General 
              Hospital's sleep disorders unit, people with OSA have a 47 per cent more
               chance of getting and dying from a heart attack.</p>
              <p>She said, OSA can be treated via surgery for some or through the use 
              of a mask that blows air into the throat and lungs to prevent the airway
               from being blocked.</p>
              <p>Patients suffering from insomnia should also be screened for underlying 
              causes such as medical disorders or psychiatric conditions such as 
              depression and anxiety, she said.</p>

              <p><br>My sleeping pattern changes due to my working schedule.</p>
              <p>Even today, I slept around 1am, woke up at 5am, do housechores and surf net.</p>
              <p>Right now, I am free as I am waiting for the washing machine to do the washing while I relax and surf net.</p>
              <p>But then will get sleepy again....cannot sleep! Sigh!</p>
