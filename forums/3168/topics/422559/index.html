              <p>The simple answer is no. For every man, woman or couple it is an intensely personal decision which only you can make.</p>
              <p>In
               Jane Austen's day (that is, around 210 years ago) girls were being 
              married off at the age of 17, and unmarried women as "old" as 21 were 
              considered spinsters.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, at the age <em>of</em> 21, most 
              Western educated girls have not even finished university. Both sexes are
               likely to postpone marriage until their lives have been set up – which 
              for most, means after finishing their education and setting up a career.
               Marriage used to be the first step into adulthood, but now it is often 
              the last.</p>
              <p>Singapore has followed this Western trend, with a steady
               increase in the average female marrying age since the 1960s, from all 
              levels of education and across all the main ethnic groups. Compared with
               the 1990s, singlehood rates among men on the island state have also 
              increased. This delay is logically followed by a postponement in child 
              bearing. There is also a strong correlation between educational level 
              and family size. The averages both worldwide and in Singapore bear this 
              out: University graduates from all age groups have tended to have the 
              fewest children.</p>
              <p>Sara*, 29, is married with a three-year-old 
              daughter. She was the first of all her friends to marry (at the age of 
              22) and is still the only person from her group of friends with 
              children. "Although I wanted to have children young, it has been quite a
               lonely experience, as none of my friends know what I am going through –
               and I can't relate to a lot of their experiences either. My children 
              will also be so much older than my friends' children, which is a pity."</p>
              <p>Because
               she has a child, Sara has also not finished her university degree, and 
              cannot see when she will have the time or the money to do so.</p>
              <p>Lauren
               on the other hand, finished university and focused on her career, and 
              now in her early thirties she is single and worried. "If and when I meet
               someone, we'll need some time to get to know each other, and by the 
              time we get married and are ready to have children, it might be too 
              late."</p>
              <p>Marcus and Becky got married straight after university. 
              Marcus says: "We knew we wanted to be together, so we didn't wait to get
               married, but we are still too young for kids, so we'll wait a few more 
              years before we do that. There is still so much we want to do."</p>
              <p>No
               matter the trend, for now at least, the science remains immutable. 
              Married or not, a woman's chances of having children decrease the older 
              you get, and if you are the traditional type, you may want to be married
               prior to becoming parents.</p>
