              <p>Social media is named aptly so because it's a tool to be social. 
              Unfortunately, there are many amongst us who do the most inane things on
               Facebook and Twitter that makes you roll your eyes, drop your jaw and 
              sometimes is downright pathetic.</p>
              <p><strong>1.People who think their every movement should be announced.</strong><br>We
               know you're bored whilst sitting on the toilet. But maybe, instead of 
              tweeting about your bowel movements today, as you always do, maybe you 
              should read about what's happening in the world on Yahoo! News for a 
              change. Likewise, we don't need to know how much milk your "hardworking 
              breasts" lactated for your newborn. True story!</p>
              <p><strong>2.	People who change their relationship statuses every other week.</strong><br>Make up your mind - are you single? Are you in a relationship? Is it complicated? It's not too hard</p>
              <p><strong>3. People who are in a relationship with their BFF</strong><br>You might think its so <em>kawaii</em> to be in a relationship with your girlfriend, because you are best friend forever- its NOT! Grow up.</p>
              <p><strong>4.	Setup Facebook accounts for your 2-year-old kid, or worse, your dog!</strong><br>We'd like to see the day your dog gets trained to log on to his own Facebook account.</p>
              <p><strong>5.	Woe is me statuses.</strong><br>You
               know those people - ‘my life sucks because my daddy doesn't want to get
               me a yacht for my birthday' or ‘this is the worse day of my life 
              because my husband cancelled on dinner because he had to work to support
               my extravagant lifestyle.' Suck it up and stop.</p>
              <p><strong>6.	Adding People You Don't Know</strong><br>We're
               not sure what it is - to up your ‘friends' numbers or to seem like 
              you're friends with the cool kids. When you add somebody, a pop up 
              screen comes on telling you that you should "only send this request if 
              you know him or her personally." How do people miss this disclaimer?</p>
              <p><strong>7.	Write on a Facebook Wall instead of communicating privately</strong><br>The
               driving force behind the success of Facebook is...vanity. People love 
              the idea that others are watching what they're doing. But seriously! We 
              don't need to know what names you call your boyfriend and what you're 
              planning to do to him tonight.</p>
              <p><strong>8.	Tagging drunken pictures of your friends</strong><br>Yes,
               it's funny. But chances are, his boss and his mother are also on 
              Facebook. You don't want to go out for a big one on a weeknight, have to
               call in sick for work the day after only to have your boss tell you 
              that he's already seen photos of you sh*tfaced crawling in the gutter on
               Facebook. If you don't want that to happen to you, don't do it to your 
              friends.</p>
              <p><strong>9.	Children on Facebook</strong><br>Facebook bans
               20,000 kids from their site everyday, and we're glad this is done. 
              Parents need to be more diligent with policing their children on social 
              media, and they should be educated on social media etiquette in school. 
              Sexual predators are nothing to joke about.</p>
              <p><strong>10.	Animal Farms </strong><strong>and Fish Tanks</strong><br>I have a job, I don't want to feed virtual sheeps. You need to get off your computer and get a life.</p>
              <p> </p>
