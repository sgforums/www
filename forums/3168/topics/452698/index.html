              <p>Children are so unique in so many ways. They have different sleep 
              routines, different obsessions and different food preferences. But 
              there's one thing that you can always rely on: as soon as they learn to 
              speak they'll start asking tricky questions. <br><br>It's like some 
              innate gift passed down through the generations. As sure as the sky is 
              blue, there's a small person out there somewhere asking why the sky is 
              blue. <br><br>So what are the questions that every parent dreads? We 
              asked some parents to share theirs to help us put together our guide to 
              some of the worst offenders. <br><br><strong>1. Personal probes</strong><br><strong>Q:</strong> "Mummy, why do you have a fuzzy bottom?"<br><br>Annie C's five-year-old asked this one day. She then proceeded to "tell everyone at nursery about the phenomenon". <br><br>It's
               bad enough having a pre-schooler point out your wobbly, fuzzy or bald 
              bits, without them broadcasting it to all and sundry. And teenagers 
              wonder why parents always bring out the embarrassing photos when they 
              bring their new partners round. Revenge is a dish best served cold, 
              children.<br><br><strong>A: </strong>"It’s where I store the emergency fuzzy felt." <br><br><strong>2. Anthropomorphic conundrums</strong><br><strong>Q:</strong> "Does the cat ever get bored?" <br><br>Is
               a cat given to ennui? In spite of their considerable freedom, they 
              barely do anything most days, often sleeping for 16 hours at a time. Is 
              that a sign of depression? Given as much freedom, just imagine what a 
              dog would fill its days with!</p>
              <p class="first"><strong>A:</strong> "No, he doesn't get bored. He thinks a spider walking across the floor 
              is the most exciting thing he's ever seen. Yesterday, he watched the 
              rain for over an hour. He's very easily pleased."</p>

              <p><strong>3. Gender brain benders</strong><br><strong>Q:</strong> "Why do boys have willies?" (or "Why don't girls have willies?")<br><br>Such
               a simple question, but how do you answer? Do you go for the straight 
              truth and start drawing biological diagrams? Or do you think of 
              something silly involving cavemen and fire control? <br><br><strong>A:</strong> "Ask your father."<br><br><strong>4. Metaphysical mind-blowers</strong><br><strong>Q:</strong> "What are shadows made of?"<br><br>It's
               probably no surprise to learn that the little boy who asked this grew 
              up to be a writer/illustrator of wacky children's comics about sheep and
               tiny dinosaurs. Gary Northfield's mum couldn't give an answer, which is
               nothing to be ashamed of. <br><br><strong>A:</strong> "The backs of rainbows."<br><br><strong>5. Evolutionary mysteries</strong><br><strong>Q: </strong>"Where did the first horse come from?"<br><br>Questions
               like this are the sort you should probably gen up on before your 
              offspring learn to speak. They're a staple part of any child's 
              questioning: things you can actually give a proper answer to if only 
              you'd bothered to get that zoology degree. <br><br><strong>A:</strong> "Horses evolved about 75 million years ago in Europe and Asia from an 
              animal called Eohippus (Dawn Horse). It was just 60cm (the equivalent of
               two rulers) in length." <br><br><strong>6. Social faux pas</strong><br><strong>Q:</strong> "Is that a man or a woman?" <br><br>It's
               IMPERATIVE that this be asked loudly and within earshot of the person 
              in question in order to cause maximum embarrassment to parents. Popular 
              variants include "Why does that lady have a moustache?" and "Why is that
               man wearing a dress?".<br><br><strong>A:</strong> "Shh, darling!"<br><br><strong>7.Chemical queries<br>Q:</strong> "How do you make the tap water go hot with your hand?" <strong><br></strong><br>This
               one was asked by a child convinced that the water turned warm only 
              because mum was holding her hand under the tap. Apparently, explanations
               about boilers and immersion heaters did not pass muster. <br><br><strong>A:</strong> "I absorb all the cold out of the water. Why do you think my hands are always so cold?"<br><br><strong>8. Morbid fascination</strong><br><strong>Q: </strong>"Grandad, when are you going to die?"<br><br>This
               is always a cheery question to ask an elderly relative. Annie C's 
              daughter asked this last time she visited her grandpa. Looks like 
              someone's getting nothing in the will. <br><br><strong>A: </strong> "When I run out of breaths."<br><br><strong>9. Meteorological interrogations</strong><br><strong>Q:</strong> "Why is the sky blue?"<br><br>This
               is another old faithful, and certainly one you can easily learn to 
              answer. How technical you want to get depends on whether you'd like to 
              spend half an hour explaining how the eye sees light of different 
              frequencies as different colours, or if you'd rather use that time to 
              re-grout the bathroom tiles. <br><br><strong>A: </strong>"The sky appears blue because gas molecules in the atmosphere absorb more blue light and reflect it all around the sky." <br><br><strong>Or:</strong> "Because that's God's favourite colour."<br><strong><br>10. Naked truths<br>Q:</strong> "What's an orgasm?"<strong><br></strong><br>These
               are the questions sent to try us, as Camilla Chafer will attest. Other 
              parents have been asked "What's a prostitute?" "What's a condom?" and 
              "What's a pervert?". They're all words that children might hear as they 
              go out into the world, but wouldn't life be simpler if they didn't?<br><br><strong>A:</strong> "I'll tell you when you're older" (ah, that old cop out). <br><strong><br>Or:</strong> If you're feeling brave, you could try a little bit of truth. Not too 
              much, though -- you don't want the playground full of children playing 
              'prostitutes and peverts'.</p>
