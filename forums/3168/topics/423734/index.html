              <p>In <em>Generation WTF</em>,
               sociology professor and self-help expert Christine Whelan offers up a 
              game plan for overwhelmed 20-somethings who aren't quite sure how to get
               their lives, money, and careers together. Whelan writes that thrift is a
               lost art that recent college grads can use to their advantage, and in 
              fact, it recently helped her start saving $50 a week. Excerpts from our 
              recent conversation:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Why
               do you think thrift is so important? Is it a skill that 20-somethings 
              can learn, even if they haven't been thrifty already? </strong></p>
              <p>When 
              the economy went south a few years ago, we were bombarded with messages 
              about saving money. But penny-pinching is distasteful to this generation
               of young adults because it seems pointless and punitive. They want to 
              live for the moment and have fun while they are young, single and free! 
              Thrift isn't penny-pinching, though: It's about spending and saving so 
              that your financial life is in keeping with your core beliefs and 
              values. And that makes the money conversation a whole lot sexier and 
              more personalized.</p>
              <p><strong>Why do you think so many college students don't even know the meaning of the word thrift? </strong></p>
              <p>In
               part, it's a vocabulary issue. It's not that college students don't 
              know the concepts of good and bad uses of money, but the word thrift is 
              so old-fashioned that it's fallen out of use for this generation. And 
              that's a shame: Thrift is a very personal exercise. In <em>Generation WTF</em>,
               I don't say some purchases are always good or bad. It's up to you, the 
              individual, to figure out how you want to use your money to build your 
              own future, to help others and to have as much fun as possible along the
               way.</p>
              <p><strong>What's the best way for someone to teach themselves to be more thrifty?</strong></p>
              <p>I
               encourage young-adults to think about thrift through some basic 
              exercises of self-discovery. First, what are your core values? Do you 
              value security, friendship and faith? Or perhaps excitement, family and 
              education? Pick five core values and then write them down on a slip of 
              paper that you can clip on to your credit card as a constant reminder.</p>
              <p>Second,
               where does your money go? Track your spending for a week--and be sure 
              to list all the "little" stuff, too. Third, go through your expenses for
               the week and ask yourself whether each purchase fits into your core 
              values. Not all splurges are bad ways to spend your money, and "right" 
              versus "wrong" use of money is a very individual exercise. For example, 
              if you treated three of your buddies to dinner, but strong friendships 
              and relationships are one of your core values, this might be a good way 
              to spend your money. However, daily snacks on the run might not be 
              getting you toward any of your goals.</p>
              <p><strong>As you say in your book, 
              it's easy to think everyone has certain things, like iPods or a new car.
               What's the best way to avoid jealousy? </strong></p>
              <p>Don't let your mind 
              play tricks on you. If you think "everyone" has an iPhone, go on to 
              Facebook and look at the last 20 people who have posted on your wall, or
               the 30 friends who have updated their status recently. What type of 
              phone do they have? Odds are "everyone" doesn't have a better phone than
               you do, even if you own social group.</p>
              <p>Then, get out of your 
              bubble a bit and do some volunteering. Spending time with those who are 
              less fortunate gives you much-needed real-world perspective. Giving of 
              yourself to help others not only helps your community, but also gives 
              you a feel-good boost that rests your "keeping up with the joneses" 
              attitude for a while.</p>
              <p>Finally, think in terms of experiences. 
              Things may go out of style, but memories don't. Going to a concert or on
               vacation with friends is probably a better way to spend your money than
               a gadget that's going to be out of date in a few months anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Are you thrifty? If so, how did you learn to be? </strong></p>
              <p>For
               much of my life, I really wasn't thrifty, but once I started thinking 
              in terms of my values--in terms of what was really important for me to 
              spend money on versus what was just mindless spending--I was able to cut
               back my spending without feeling deprived at all. One of the best parts
               about writing <em>Generation WTF</em> was that I was able to test out all the advice myself!</p>
              <p>Two
               of my core goals are health and a thriving marriage, so the last year, 
              we set goals of spending less money eating out (fewer date-nights out) 
              and  my husband wanted to lose some weight. Now, I make lunches for me 
              and my husband each week--saving $50 or more each week--and do lots of 
              cooking-in-bulk and freezing so that there's always a good dinner 
              waiting at home.</p>
              <p>Yes, we spend a lot on groceries (and while we go
               in with a detailed list and meal-plan, I don't skimp on spending when 
              we do our weekly shops), but we save a lot of money on take-out and 
              consume many fewer calories. More than a year later, we've resurrected 
              the romantic dinner at home and my husband has lost 35 pounds.</p>
