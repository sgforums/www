              <p>SINGAPORE: A five-storey regional library, a 20-court badminton hall, six swimming pools and a 5,000-seater stadium with a FIFA-approved football pitch are some of the facilities residents can enjoy when the new town hub at Tampines opens progressively from the end of 2016.</p>
              <p>More than 2,000 Tampines residents came together on Sunday (Aug 30) for the official unveiling of the town hub's name, Our Tampines Hub, and to receive updates on the features and facilities offered at the hub.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking at the event, Education Minister and Adviser to Tampines Grassroots Organisations Heng Swee Keat said the community and lifestyle hub was the culmination of tens of thousands of residents' suggestions over the past few years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hub was first introduced in 2011 by then-National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan as part of the town's five-year master plan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Phase One of the hub will be completed by the fourth quarter of 2016. Residents will be able to make use of the community centre, retail, food and beverage (F&amp;B) outlets, an 800-seat hawker centre and the badminton hall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>MORE GREENERY, WALKWAYS, BICYCLE RACKS</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Heng, who is also Education Minister, also said they will be planting more greenery and building covered walkways of up to 400 metres from the train station, as part of the town's Neighbourhood Renewal Programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Heng was joined by his Tampines GRC team, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Mr Mah Bow Tan, Ms Irene Ng and Mr Baey Yam Keng. Also present were the People's Action Party's (PAP) new candidates for the GRC for the coming General Election: Ms Cheng Li Hui, who is vice-chairman of the Citizens Consultative Committee in Tampines East, and Mr Desmond Choo, who is second adviser to Changkat grassroots organisation.</p>
              <p>Mr Choo and Ms Cheng will replace current Tampines GRC MPs Mah Bow Tan and Irene Ng, who are stepping down from politics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earlier on Sunday morning, Mr Heng and his team launched a new 1 kilometre cycling route at Tampines Street 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the town's cycling committee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's first model cycling town, now has a bike path which links Tampines Changkat Community Club, Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, as well as the HDB neighbourhood shops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>New dual bicycle racks will also be installed at Block 114 Tampines Street 11 near Tampines Changkat Community Club and Block 138 Tampines Street 11 near 137 Tampines Round Market. There will be a total of 76 bicycle racks.  </p>
