              <p>As the United States inches closer to its current $14.3 trillion <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=129g9r06l/**http%3A//politics.usnews.com/topics/subjects/deficit-and-national-debt">debt</a> ceiling, policymakers are renewing the public debate over government borrowing and spending. Earlier this year, <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=115hu5tsq/**http%3A//www.usnews.com/whitehouse">White House</a> economic adviser Austan Goolsbee warned that, if the ceiling is not 
              raised, "The impact on the economy would be catastrophic.</p>
              <p>I mean, that 
              would be a worse financial economic crisis than anything we saw in 
              2008." Many top <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=1205rt8o0/**http%3A//politics.usnews.com/topics/subjects/republican-party">Republicans</a>, meanwhile, are more cautious about such an increase. South Carolina Republican Sen. <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=11i3oju9l/**http%3A//www.usnews.com/congress/graham-lindsey">Lindsey Graham</a> has expressed cautious support for raising the ceiling, but also has 
              advocated for decreasing government spending to 2010 levels.</p>
              <p>South 
              Carolina's junior Republican senator, <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=11imkl1nb/**http%3A//www.usnews.com/congress/demint-james-w">Jim DeMint</a>, is even more hawkish on the subject, calling for the passage of a balanced budget amendment. <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=12er1puci/**http%3A//www.usnews.com/news/slideshows/the-10-countries-with-the-most-debt">[See a slide show of the 10 countries with the most debt.]</a></p>
              <p>Even
               accounting for inflation, the total U.S. public debt--the amount of 
              treasury securities held outside the government, plus federal 
              obligations for programs like Social Security--has increased more than 
              fourfold since 1990, when it stood at just over $3 trillion. <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=130b47l4s/**http%3A//www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/01/14/10-states-with-the-largest-budget-shortfalls">[See the 10 states with the largest budget shortfalls.]</a></p>
              <p>While
               the United States total public debt is indeed the largest in the world,
               a broader context shows that other countries face even more dire debt 
              situations. One way to put debt in perspective is to compare it to gross
               domestic product, or GDP.</p>
              <p>The debt-to-GDP ratio is one primary 
              indicator of a country's economic health; a lower ratio is generally 
              seen as more favorable, as it shows that a country is producing enough 
              to eventually be able to repay its debts. According to figures from the 
              International Monetary Fund, Japan has the largest debt-to-GDP ratio in 
              the world, with government debt more than twice the size of its GDP.</p>
              <p>Also notable are Greece and Iceland, which have both suffered major 
              recent financial crises and both have government debts that exceed their
               annual GDPs. The U.S. ratio of 92.7 percent is nearly 20 percentage 
              points away from inclusion in the top 10 countries with the worst 
              debt-to-GDP ratios, listed below:</p>
              <p><strong>Country 	Debt as Percent of GDP (2010 est.)</strong></p>
              <p>Japan 	225.9</p>
              <p>St. Kitts and Nevis 	196.3</p>
              <p>Lebanon 	139.0</p>
              <p>Jamaica 	135.7</p>
              <p>Greece 	130.2</p>
              <p>Eritrea 	129.7</p>
              <p>Grenada 	119.1</p>
              <p>Italy	118.4</p>
              <p>Iceland 	115.6</p>
              <p>Barbados 	111.6</p>
              <p>Of
               course, many countries with such high ratios, such as the Caribbean 
              nations of Jamaica, and Barbados, are not among the world's economic 
              powerhouses. A more apples-to-apples comparison is to look at the United
               States debt situation within the context of the other largest world 
              economies.</p>
              <p>Among the 10 countries with the largest GDPs, the U.S. ranks 
              third in terms of debt as a percentage of GDP, behind Japan and Italy. 
              One major outlier on the list is China, whose 2010 GDP is estimated to 
              be the world's second-largest, at roughly $5.7 trillion. The country's 
              debts, however, only equal 19.1 percent of its GDP--well below the rates
               of nearly all other major world economies.</p>
              <p><strong>Country 	    GDP (2010 est., USD) 	    Debt as Percent of GDP (2010 est.)</strong></p>
              <p>United States 	$14.6 trillion 	92.7</p>
              <p>China 	$5.7 trillion 	19.1</p>
              <p>Japan 	$5.4 trillion 	225.9</p>
              <p>Germany 	$3.3 trillion 	75.3</p>
              <p>France 	$2.6 trillion 	84.2</p>
              <p>United Kingdom 	$2.3 trillion 	76.7</p>
              <p>Italy 	$2.0 trillion 	118.4</p>
              <p>Brazil 	$2.0 trillion 	66.8</p>
              <p>Canada 	$1.6 trillion 	81.7</p>
              <p>Russia 	$1.5 trillion 	11.1<br></p>
