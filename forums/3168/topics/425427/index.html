              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: An estimated 15 per cent of the population in 
              Singapore is affected by obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), one of the most
               common sleeping disorders.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Highlighting this 
              ahead of the World Sleep Day on Friday, experts said the number of 
              patients is expected to rise, with increased  awareness of this 
              condition.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>OSA sufferers stop breathing repeatedly during sleep, which is caused by a blocking of the upper airway.<br><br>The collapse of the airway may be due to factors such as a large tongue or extra tissue. <br><br>Each breathing stop can last from 10 seconds to more than a minute and has a drop in oxygen associated with each event.<br><br>This puts a strain on the heart and can lead to a number of serious health conditions.<br><br>One OSA patient, 70-year-old Singaporean Wong Chiang Siang, said a good night's sleep is something he could never enjoy.<br><br>The condition caused him to always feel sleepy and sluggish in the day, and once almost cost him his life. <br><br>"One
               day I was driving my car, I stopped at the traffic light and there were
               at least four or five cars in front of me," Mr Wong said. <br><br>"I 
              was quite sleepy so I thought ok, I'd close my eyes and I should be able
               to get back again. But after I closed my eyes, the next moment, 
              somebody knocked on my window. I was shocked I saw all the cars already 
              gone. So I must have dozed off for quite a while. That was quite scary."<br><br>This prompted Mr Wong to seek professional help where he found out he was suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea.<br><br>About 25 patients suffering from moderate to severe OSA are diagnosed each month at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.<br><br>Experts said the condition needs to be treated early as it has medical and economic consequences.<br><br>OSA
               is not just associated with snoring but it's also associated with 
              medical morbidities such as high blood pressure, heart rhythm 
              abnormalities, heart disease and stroke.<br><br>Experts recommend that 
              patients use Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, a machine that gently 
              blows air into one's throat with the help of a mask.<br><br>The air pressure is adjusted so that it's just enough to stop the airways from becoming narrowed or blocked during sleep.<br><br>The theme of World Sleep Day, 'Sleep Well, Grow Healthy', is aimed at highlighting the importance of sleep.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
