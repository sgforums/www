              <p>With Valentine’s Day round the corner, the last thing you want to do 
              to impress your date (especially if you intend to propose) is to come 
              across as predictable.</p>
              <p>So what can you do to make this special day memorable?</p>
              <p>With Singapore’s urban landscapes witnessing huge transformations 
              over the past few years, there are now many options available to make 
              your declarations.</p>
              <p>Take the offbeat approach this Valentine’s Day with our top five picks.</p>
              <p><strong>Singapore Flyer</strong></p>
              <p>Standing 165 metres in height, the Singapore Flyer
               is the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. Situated on the southeast tip
               of Marina Centre, the Singapore Flyer offers panoramic views of our 
              city skyline and beyond.</p>
              <p>As part of its Valentine’s Day – Cupid Champagne / Cocktail Flight, 
              couples can enjoy views of the Indonesian islands of Batam and Bintan, 
              as well as Johor, Malaysia while dining in the capsule.</p>
              <p>Priced at S$88 nett per pax, the package consists of an Express 
              Boarding Singapore Flight (a rotation of approximately 30 minutes) per 
              pax. You will also be spoilt with a choice of a glass of Moët and 
              Chandon champagne, signature cocktail or its Cupid’s Potion Cocktail, 
              strawberries and chocolates, a rose for the lady plus access to the VIP 
              Lounge.</p>
              <p><strong>Marina Bay Sands SkyPark</strong></p>

               sky. It features landscaped gardens with 250 trees and 650 plant

              project in Singapore, housing 1,848 apartments in seven towering blocks.

              VivoCity Shopping Mall’s waterfront promenade via two-way canopy-covered
               travellators. In addition to shading you from the elements, the entire 
              boardwalk features tropical vegetation that are unique to Singapore.

              greenery, taking a stroll on the Sentosa Boardwalk will leave many 
              romantic memories behind.</p>

              <p>If you have a substantial budget, why not splurge on the Sky Dining option at The Jewel Box?
                This cable car ride will take couples on a breathtaking journey while 
              dining high up in the sky from Mount Faber to Sentosa and back. At
