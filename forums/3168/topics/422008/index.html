              <p>ROME (AFP) - – Italian researchers who specialise in resolving art 
              mysteries said they have discovered the disputed identity of the model 
              for Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa -- and claimed he was a man.</p>
              <p>Silvano Vinceti, chairman of the Italian national committee for 
              cultural heritage, said the Florence-born Renaissance artist's male 
              apprentice and possible lover Salai was the main inspiration for the 
              picture.</p>
              <p>However his claim was immediately disputed by experts at the Louvre in Paris, where the painting is on display.</p>
              <p>Salai, real name Gian Giacomo Caprotti, an effeminate young artist 
              who worked with da Vinci for 25 years, is thought to have served as a 
              model and muse for several of his paintings. The pair had an "ambiguous"
               relationship and were probably lovers, Vinceti said.</p>
              <p>Comparisons between the facial characteristics of figures from 
              several of da Vinci's works -- such as "St. John the Baptist" and the 
              "Angel Incarnate" -- reveal striking similarities with the Mona Lisa's 
              nose and mouth, he said.</p>
              <p>"There are remarkable similarities," Vinceti told reporters.</p>
              <p>What is more, Vinceti said da Vinci had left clues to the model's 
              identity in tiny letters L and S which he and his team found painted 
              into the eyes of the Mona Lisa.</p>
              <p>"Close examination of a high-quality digital copy of the portrait had revealed an L for Leonardo and an S for Salai," he said.</p>
              <p>But Vinceti's claims have been disputed by the Louvre museum.</p>
              <p>The museum said it had carried out "every possible laboratory test 
              possible" on the picture in 2004 and then again in 2009, and insisted 
              that "no inscriptions, letters or numbers, were discovered during the 
              tests."</p>
              <p>"The ageing of the painting on wood has caused a great number of 
              cracks to appear in the paint, which have caused a number of shapes to 
              appear that have often been subject to over-interpretation," the Louvre 
              told AFP.</p>
              <p>The museum also said Vinceti's had made his claims without having had access to the painting itself.</p>
              <p>The Italian aficionado, whose team gained notoriety with their 
              claims surrounding the death of Caravaggio last year, said he felt sorry
               for the embarrassment the museum must feel on having missed the clues 
              all these years.</p>
              <p>"I can understand their incredulity and amazement -- after all this 
              must be the most studied picture on earth," he told AFP, but added 
              "they're really blind."</p>
              <p>"They have to be serious and accept that they didn't see what was right in front of their eyes," he said.</p>
              <p>In order to clear up any lingering doubt over his theory -- worthy 
              of Dan Brown's 2003 bestseller the "Da Vinci Code" -- Vinceti said he 
              would be willing to take his team to France and collaborate on further 
              tests with the Louvre.</p>
              <p>"We're ready to go to Paris and extract a tiny bit of paint from the
               numbers and see whether they match the rest of the painting, to see if 
              they were done at the same time or are marks that have appeared over 
              time," he said.</p>
              <p>Whether the prestigious art museum will take Vinceti up on his offer is yet to be seen.</p>
