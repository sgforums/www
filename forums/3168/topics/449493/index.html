              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's commemoration of World Water Day this 
              year will see a record 25,000 people gathering at 15 locations 
              islandwide in support of water this Saturday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>10,000 of these 
              participants will walk, cycle and paddle across waterways, reservoirs 
              and between ABC Waters (Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters) sites with 
              small blue pails.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Symbolic of how 
              people in developing countries have to walk an average of six kilometres
               every day to fetch water, both the distance and the pails serve as a 
              reminder to conserve water.<br><br>PUB, the national water agency, said 
              that 20,000 people took part in last year's activities and it aims to 
              have a 20 per cent increase in community participation this year.<br><br>Themed
               "Singapore Celebrates World Water Day: Active, Beautiful and Clean 
              Waters for All", activities on the day also include cleaning up of water
               bodies, water monitoring, guided nature walks, and the launch of 
              learning trails.<br><br>National water agency PUB's 3P Network Director 
              George Madhavan says there's a growing awareness that water is a 
              precious resource in the community.<br><br>"Last year we had 100 
              partners, this year it's gone up to 125 partners. We also see more 
              interest groups being formed to keep our water ways clean and also to 
              share the important message that water is scarce," he said.<br><br>One 
              of the things that will be launched at the event is an iPad application 
              that students can use to bring others on learning trails at Lorong Halus
               Wetlands. Six new ABC Waters learning trails that will also be launched
               on Saturday.<br><br>Adding to the festivities will also be some 
              attempts to make it into the Singapore Book of Records. Jurong Lake, for
               example, will host Singapore's biggest-ever Mass Water Filtration 
              Exercise.<br><br>Another attempt at the record books will be at Sengkang
               Floating Wetland, where 300 Anderson Secondary School students will try
               to build the largest floating raft made from recycled drink cans.<br><br>Various other organisations will also be recognising World Water Day.<br><br>Singapore
               Post, for example, has launched a "Reservoirs of Singapore" stamp 
              collection, profiling 10 different reservoirs in Singapore. It features 
              designs by Don Low of Urban Sketchers, a local sketching interest group.<br><br>A
               glossy photo book of 17 ABC Waters sites, "Knowing Your ABCs", will 
              also be launched by the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) and PUB.<br><br>PUB
               will also recognise winners of the Water Conservation Video Competition
               2010/2011, which saw primary school students creating 45-second videos 
              of what water conservation means to them.<br><br>MacRitchie Reservoir 
              will see the launch of the Learning Trail Passport, a collection of 
              learning trails at seven different ABC Waters sites.<br><br>400 scouts 
              from the Singapore Scout Association will also attend the NEWater 
              Scientist Programme at The NEWater Visitor centre on Saturday. The 
              programme will teach them how to install water saving devices in their 
              neighbours' homes to spread the water conservation message to the 
              community.<br><br>On March 24, cub scouts from the association will also
               qualify for the NEWater Scientist Badge, as well as the Coca Cola Live 
              Positively Water Badge by attending the World Water Day Special Water 
              Badges Programme.<br><br>International World Water Day is held annually 
              on March 22 to raise awareness on the importance of caring for water and
               water sustainability.<br><br>World Water Day in Singapore will kick off
               on March 24, with a 2km morning walk for 3,000 participants from
