              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Bay South Garden, a section of the waterfront gardens in the new Downtown @ Marina Bay, will open on June 29.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It is the largest of the three gardens that make up Gardens By The Bay, Singapore's new green oasis in the city.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The sprawling 54 
              hectares Bay South features man-made, tree-like structures known as 
              "supertrees". Visitors with a taste for heights can take to the aerial 
              walkway that links two of the supertrees.<br><br>There is also the 
              Dragonfly Lake, where visitors can stroll along the promenade or rest in
               the four heritage gardens which reflect the history and culture of 
              Singapore's main ethnic groups.<br><br>Bay South also features two cooled conservatories.<br><br>Dr
               Kiat W Tan, CEO of Gardens By The Bay, said: "We have brought (in) two 
              glasshouses that'll give you a touch of perpetual spring. So this is 
              excellent in that here in the tropics, we have a touch of the seasons. 
              It allows us to also look at plants from different continents, brought 
              here from fragile habitats that are disappearing very fast." <br><br>Visitors
               can also look forward to the Cloud Forest where they will be greeted by
               a mountain, covered in a layer of luscious plants and complete with a 
              30-metre waterfall.<br><br>"It has a living skin. Every single plant has
               to be tied on. And there are over 100,000 plants. There's a wonderful 
              array of ferns, orchids, pitcher plants," said Dr Tan.<br><br>Most of Bay South will be free to visitors, except for the two conservatories and the aerial walkway on the supertrees.<br><br>To
               celebrate the opening of Bay South, there will be a series of events 
              organised over two weekends from June 29 to July 8. These include "live"
               concerts by Grammy Award winner Jason Mraz and local songbird Corrine 
              May. Six restaurants will also be opened for a unique dining experience 
              in the garden.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Two new permanent attractions will be added to Gardens by the Bay, which will open on 29 June.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>One is a Supertree 
              aerial walkway, called the OCBC Skyway, offering a panoramic view of the
               Gardens against the backdrop of Marina Bay.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Suspended about seven storeys high -- or 22 metres above ground -- it links the two 42-metre tall 'Supertrees' over 128 metres.<br><br>Eleven of the 18 supertrees are fixed with environmentally sustainable features.<br><br>Another
               unique feature of the Gardens is the dramatic OCBC Light and Sound 
              Show, which will be unveiled on 2 July, as part of the opening programme
               of the Gardens.<br><br>The show, which comes on every night from its launch, will feature extravagant multimedia effects. <br><br>Both attractions are sponsored by OCBC, to the tune of S$8 million.<br><br>The Gardens by the Bay will occupy a total of 101 hectares of land by the water, becoming a part of Marina Bay.<br><br>Gardens
               by the Bay CEO Kiat W. Tan said: "What this garden is all about is to 
              reach out to our young and to our adults, to explain to them the perils 
              of global warming, as a consequence of what we've done to the planet. <br><br>"And how to capture the attention of kids to say, 'Hey! There's more to this world than what you see through your computers'."<br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              Trade and Industry, says the opening of Gardens by the Bay next month is
               expected to enhance Singapore's tourism industry.<br><br>Mr Iswaran 
              said: "It means an emphasis not merely on the number of visitors but 
              perhaps even more importantly, on the quality of the visitor experience 
              and how they remember their experience here. <br><br>"But perhaps most 
              importantly is the partnerships that STB (Singapore Tourism Board) and 
              the government of Singapore seeks to forge, in developing new and 
              differentiated world class attractions, which will attract both business

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>And getting there should be a cinch with free daily shuttles from the Marina Bay train station.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The shuttles operate from 9am to 9pm at 10-minute intervals.<br><br>These shuttles might operate on a permanent basis if there is a demand.<br><br>Visitors can also alight at the Bayfront train station and walk 300 metres to the Gardens.<br><br>For those who drive, there will be 720 parking lots. <br><br>Cyclists will have bicycle stands to park their bikes as cycling is not allowed in the Gardens.<br><br>Most of the attractions will be free. Ticketed areas include the aerial walkway and two cooled conservatories.<br><br>Developers said the design of the billion-dollar-park has taken into account everybody's needs.<br><br>Ng
               Boon Gee, assistant director (Development) Gardens by the Bay, said: 
              "All the ramps here are actually constructed in such a way that they are
               gentle - the wheelchair can be easily pushed up the ramps. So these are
               the things that we are trying to do to make the space as user-friendly 
              as possible."<br><br>On a leisurely stroll, you'll encounter birds, and 
              bears but if you choose not to walk, you can always hop on a garden 
              cruiser to get around, which will cost between S$3 to S$5. <br><br>Managing
               director of Cafe Crema and Verandah at the Gardens by the Bay, Lim 
              Li-Wei, said: "You can come here (to the cafe) and enjoy handcrafted 
              coffee, or sandwich, as well as local favourites such as hokkien mee, 
              bak kut teh and laksa."<br><br>Four more spots for eateries will be up 
              for tender in 2013 which means there'll eventually be more than 10 
              dining establishments to satisfy the hungry after a walk-in-the-park.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p><em>In "The FlipSide", local blogger Belmont Lay lets loose on local 
              politics, culture and society. Take with a pinch of salt and parental

              the Gardens by the Bay.</em></p>
              <p>The newly-minted Gardens by the Bay is attracting visitors aplenty.</p>
              <p>Close to 300,000 people from Singapore and beyond have descended upon it like locusts since its June 29 opening.</p>
              <p>And I can see where this fascination for man-made nature comes from.</p>
              <p><strong>A place for reflection</strong></p>
              <p>First and foremost, the Gardens is sweet payback for many Singaporean
               men who survived outfield jungle training during National Service and 
              completely despised the experience.</p>
              <p>That horrendous week in the midst of endless chlorophyll, grovelling 
              in mud, wearing leaves and getting eaten alive by mosquitoes while 
              squatting over a hole in the ground?</p>
              <p>Eat my shorts now, Mother Nature.</p>
              <p>Look, Man will fashion everything out of steel, concrete and plastic if we have to.</p>
              <p>And everything that can't will be trimmed and pruned or uprooted or poisoned with pesticide.</p>
              <p>This is a redefinition of nature -- and a glimpse as to what our human nature can be like.</p>
              <p>Therefore, going to the Gardens allow us to take a good hard look into ourselves.</p>
              <p><strong>Nostalgia-inducing</strong></p>
              <p>Next, the Chinese Garden, Malay Garden, Indian Garden and Colonial Garden are very good for inducing nostalgia.</p>
              <p>Spending time in these four stereotypical <a href="http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/the-gardens/attractions/heritage-gardens.html">heritage gardens</a> help retrieve fond memories during and up until the 1990s.</p>
              <p>That was a time when Singapore was still governed according to race. But eventually, our elected rulers lost the plot.</p>
              <p>Because as we all know these days, since <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/unacceptable-40-population-made-foreigners-141417393.html">40 per cent</a> of this country is already composed of foreigners, having just four 
              representative gardens is only 60 per cent accurate at most.</p>
              <p>This speaks poorly of history at best as it doesn't warn us in advance of the pitfalls of a liberal immigration policy.</p>
              <p>But as a cruel inside joke, it is wickedly funny. In a sad way.</p>
              <p><strong>Expensive admissions charges</strong></p>
              <p>Since Singapore is filled to the brim, introducing discriminatory 
              admissions pricing is very helpful when sorting them out at the Gardens.</p>
              <p>You see, non-Singaporeans are charged $28 to look at the results of 
              hoarding 225,000 species of leaves and branches from around the world 
              that are perennially held hostage in the opulent glass houses known as <a href="http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/the-gardens/attractions/flower-dome.html">domed conservatories</a>.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, on the other hand, only need to pay $20 to look at 
              these same kind of things that grow slowly and silently out of the soil 
              rather purposelessly.</p>
              <p>Which on normal days, they wouldn't even pay to look at green things 
              if they went to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve or Bukit Brown cemetery where
               the cost is free-of-charge.</p>
              <p>But most importantly, setting a high admission cost will help keep poor people out.</p>
              <p>Certainly, you wouldn't want them around when the entire set piece is
               a tourist attraction and Singapore needs to put its best foot forward.</p>
              <p><strong>Exclusive special edition chicken rice</strong></p>
              <p>And then there's the chow.</p>
              <p>It takes eating chicken rice to a whole new level.</p>
              <p>What's so special about the <a href="http://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/supertree-dining-now-serving-090114680.html">Special Edition Gardens by the Bay Chicken Rice</a> is that it is made from chicken and rice. With cucumber. And sauces.</p>
              <p>At $20 a plate, as you eat you, you can feel your heart surging with pain and it wouldn't even be cholesterol-induced.</p>
              <p>The price certainly justifies the sensation!</p>
              <p>But if you prefer not to give in to your extravagance and pamper 
              yourself this way, simply take a cab to Maxwell Food Centre and gorge 
              yourself to death from the rival chicken rice stalls.</p>
              <p>It will probably set you back $18 max. In total.</p>
              <p><strong>Danger of looking passe</strong></p>
              <p>Happily, the Gardens still manages to attract the bored, lethargic 
              and wide-eyed, besides families, couples and anyone with Instagram.</p>
              <p>And everyone has to go now before it is too late.</p>
              <p>That is because the whole place will look dated by some time end of this year. Even though it was planned to look futuristic.</p>
              <p>And by 2014, it will be officially passe.</p>
              <p>Like how all phones produced last year look passe only six months down the road.</p>
              <p>Overall, I have to admit, it was a pleasant experience.</p>
              <p>But I hated it.</p>
