              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: All of MediaCorp's seven free-to-air channels will go fully digital by December 2013.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Four of the channels
               (Channel 5, Channel 8, Suria and Vasantham) will also be transmitted in
               high definition by then, while the remaining three (Channel NewsAsia, 
              Okto and Channel U) will be in high definition by 2016.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The move marks 
              another milestone in Singapore's roadmap in making the digital 
              switchover, where analogue signals will be completely switched off by 
              2020. This is in line with ASEAN's agreed timeframe.<br><br>Minister for
               Information, Communications and the Arts Yaacob Ibrahim made the 
              announcement at the opening ceremony of the Infocomm Media Business 
              Exchange held at the Marina Bay Sands on Tuesday morning.<br><br>He said
               the move is made possible with the adoption of a new digital 
              broadcasting standard known as DVB-T2 (Digital Video Broadcasting - 
              Second Generation Terrestrial).<br><br>Dr Yaacob said digital TV not 
              only offers better image and sound quality but also frees up scarce 
              spectrum for other services such as wireless broadband.<br><br>To enjoy 
              digital TV, the Media Development Authority said no action is required 
              from those who currently subscribe to pay-TV with StarHub or SingTel, as
               they already receive the channels digitally. <br><br>Those without 
              pay-TV can continue using their current TV sets but they will need to 
              purchase an antenna and a DVB-T2 digital receiver.<br><br>However there 
              is no need to rush for the receivers now, as they are likely to be made 
              available in Singapore only from March or April 2013.<br><br>MDA said 
              even when the free-to-air channels are transmitted digitally at the end 
              of 2013, analogue transmissions will continue. The simulcast period is 
              to give ample time for viewers to make the necessary adjustments to 
              embrace digital TV.<br><br>Currently, about 4 in 10 households in 
              Singapore do not subscribe to pay-TV. Among those who do, many have 
              secondary TV sets that are not linked to a pay-TV service. For these two
               groups, they will need to purchase a DVB-T2 receiver and an antenna, 
              and hook these to each of their current TV sets.<br><br>Without these, 
              viewers will not be able to receive the free-to-air channels on their TV
               sets once analogue signals are switched off.<br><br>It is understood that the DVB-T2 receivers can cost between S$60 and S$100.<br><br>MDA
               said the picture quality and size that viewers receive will differ 
              depending on the type of TV set. To reap the full benefits of digital TV
               and the high definition channels that will be transmitted, viewers may 
              want to opt for a new digital HDTV set.<br> <br>MDA said the adoption of
               the DVB-T2 standards comes after a successful trial conducted last year
               with MediaCorp and pay-TV operator StarHub. The trial, which involved 
              some 500 households in Ang Mo Kio and Bedok, showed that DVB-T2 was 
              suitable for Singapore's urbanised environment.<br><br>MDA said it will 
              be working closely with MediaCorp, major manufacturers and electronics 
              stores on an educational campaign to help consumers prepare for the 
              digital switchover.<br><br>MediaCorp said: "As the planned switchover to
               digital broadcasting is scheduled to complete only by December 2013, we
               will make an announcement when more details become available towards 
              the second half of next year."<br><br>Till then, viewers can attain more information on this </span><a class="path" href="http://www.mda.gov.sg/digitaltv">website</a><span>.<br><br>- CNA/ac/al</span></span></p>
