              <p>If you suffer from food allergies, consider your rank in the family 
              birth order. According to a study out of Japan, firstborn siblings are 
              more likely to  suffer from food allergies than their younger brothers 
              and sisters.</p>
              <p>In a survey of more than 13,000 children ages 7 to 15, food allergies
               were prevalent in four percent of firstborn children, 3.5 percent of 
              second-born children, and 2.6 percent in subsequent siblings.</p>
              <p>Firstborns were also more likely to suffer from symptoms like an 
              itchy, running nose and inflammation of the eyelids than their younger 
              siblings.</p>
              <p>The findings likewise suggest that food allergies may have a prenatal
               origin, as food allergies decreased significantly as birth order 
              increased.</p>
              <p>In a study published last November, researchers found that mothers 
              who consume peanuts during their pregnancy could be putting their babies
               at increased risk of a peanut allergy. The study, published in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</em>,
               evaluated 503 infants across the US, ages three to 15 months, with milk
               or egg allergies or with severe eczema -- all factors associated with 
              an increased peanut allergy.</p>
              <p>A total of 140 infants showed strong sensitivity to peanut-based 
              blood tests, and the consumption of peanuts during pregnancy was a 
              significant predictor.</p>
              <p>While previous studies have found links between general childhood 
              allergies and birth order, the Japanese researchers say theirs is the 
              first to show a link between specific food allergies and sibling birth 
              order. Â </p>
              <p>In an interview with MyHealthNewsDaily,
               study researcher Takashi Kusunoki of the Shiga Medical Center for 
              Children in Shiga, Japan, postulated that younger siblings may be spared
               from food allergies because the mother's immune system in the womb 
              changes with multiple pregnancies.</p>
              <p>Kusunoki also hypothesized that younger children develop stronger 
              immune systems than their older siblings because more children in the 
              house means more germs. That means younger siblings may be exposed to 
              more pathogens at an earlier age.</p>
              <p>The study was presented during the 2011 Annual Meeting of the  
              American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology in San Francisco  
              earlier this week.</p>
              <p>The abstract for the study can be found at http://annualmeeting.aaaai.org/, and is No. 525.</p>
              <p>To prevent younger children from developing the same food allergies 
              as the firstborn, one study recommends eliminating the offending food 
              from the mother's diet from the third trimester on, and continuing the 
              ban until the child is two years old.</p>
              <p>According to researchers from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in 
              Australia, seven out of ten babies born to mothers who took avoidance 
              measures had no food allergies, compared to 45 percent of babies whose 
              mothers took no precautions.</p>
              <p>Pediatricians recommend eliminating the offending food from both the mother's diet and the household environment.</p>
              <p>Breastfeeding has also been shown to protect children against the development of allergies.</p>
