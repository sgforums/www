              <p><em>Websites, auction sites and the latest, blogshops, which are 
              marketed through social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, are 
              changing the face of retail. Here are some considerations when shopping 
              at virtual stores.</em></p>
              <p>Georgette Tan, a journalist based in Sarawak, shops extensively from 
              blogshops. She mainly looks for clothes as she finds the options limited
               in the shops in Kuching. “I'm a plus size gal and it's difficult to 
              find anything that fits in the outlets here,” she says.</p>
              <p>The blogshops are mainly located in Kuala Lumpur or Selangor, and the
               items are sent either via PosExpress or PosLaju. To date, Tan's 
              experience has been largely positive. “I've yet to encounter one [a 
              blogshop] that didn't ship the goods.”</p>
              <p>There are many others like Tan who do their shopping online at 
              websites, auction sites and blogshops, with the last reaching out to 
              their target consumers via social networking sites like Facebook and 
              Twitter.</p>
              <p>Since its inception in 1998, Malaysia's pioneer auction site 
              Lelong.com.my has seen an increase in consumers. Its director Wei Kwok 
              Seing says the rise was particularly apparent following the introduction
               of broadband services in the country. Among the more popular items 
              traded are costume jewellery, accessories for ladies, mobile phones, 
              computers and notebooks and related parts.</p>
              <p>A reason for the popularity of online retail is the convenience — you
               sit at your computer and with a few clicks of the mouse, you've 
              completed your purchase. Then there's the promise of scoring great 
              deals. Public service website and e-mail newsletter Scambusters.org says
               Internet auction houses make it easy for people to find great deals on 
              hard-to-find items from around the world.</p>
              <p>“The excitement also makes them prime hunting grounds for scam 
              artists who are ready to play on the desire many auction bidders have 
              for that ‘unbelievable deal',” says the site. It adds that auction fraud
               accounts for roughly 48% of online fraud reports to the US Federal 
              Trade Commission.</p>
              <p>Some of the scams include misrepresentation, failure to ship the 
              items, and piracy and counterfeiting. So, short of simply staying away 
              from auction sites or never shopping online, what can you do to protect 
              yourself? The most important thing, say online shoppers and consumer 
              advocates, is to learn the ropes. Here are some of the things you should
               consider.</p>
              <p><strong>Paying with credit cards</strong></p>
              <p>Opt for the credit card rather than cheque, money order or bank 
              transfers. Sacmbusters.org says if you use your credit card to make a 
              purchase and you encounter a problem — and the seller won't attend to 
              the problem — you can notify the bank that issues your credit card that 
              you are disputing the charge, and you don't have to pay the amount while
               your dispute is being investigated. And, if the company doesn't deliver
               the item or it is a scam, you're in a much better position to get your 
              money back.</p>
              <p>Lim Eng Seong, HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd's general manager of personal 
              financial services, says while online credit card transactions today can
               be considered relatively safe, consumers should be mindful of ways to 
              keep their credit card details intact while making the transactions. 
              “The five golden rules are: Ensure the security patches are up to date, 
              install reputable anti-virus software with the latest updates, use 
              personal firewalls, read the [respective bank's] password advice, and 
              use an anti-spyware program,” he says.</p>
              <p><strong>Other payment options</strong></p>
              <p>For Tan and many other blogshop customers, bank transfer is the 
              conventional method of payment as many of the virtual stores are usually
               home-based businesses and may not have the volume of business that 
              would make payment via credit card viable. While it doesn't mean that 
              you should stay away from such retailers, it does mean that you need to 
              do more homework and check out the seller before deciding on a purchase.</p>
              <p>Apart from credit cards and bank transfers, you can also consider 
              services like PayPal. By having a PayPal account (sign-up is free, and 
              you provide your credit card details) for instance, you can make online 
              purchases without exposing your credit card number to merchants (for 
              details, visit www.paypal.com/my).</p>
              <p>Or you can also consider an escrow service. Basically, escrow works 
              as a neutral third party in your transaction. Lelong.com.my, for 
              instance, offers an escrow service called Safetrade (fees for this 
              service are as low as RM2) for both buyers and sellers.</p>
              <p>Once the buyer initiates Safetrade, the seller is informed and has 
              three days to agree to the transaction. Once the two parties have agreed
               to the transaction, the buyer makes the payment to the third party (in 
              this case, the operator of Lelong.com.my). Once the payment is received,
               the seller is then instructed to ship the item, and once the buyer 
              receives the goods, the payment is released to the seller's Safetrade 
              account (for details see www.lelong.com.my/safetrade).</p>
              <p><strong>Find out about the seller</strong></p>
              <p>Whether you're shopping online or in a traditional store, buying from
               a reputable merchant ensures that the goods are kosher and you receive 
              the level of service desired (such as returns, exchanges or warranties).
               Most websites and blogshops will have details about the merchant 
              (usually under “About us” or “About me”), so take the time to check out 
              the merchant's profile. Auction sites like Lelong.com.my also provide 
              the seller's profile and history, says Wei.</p>
              <p>Scambusters.org suggests that consumers check the feedback on the 
              seller. While it's a good idea to buy from a seller who has many 
              positive reviews, do use good sense when checking the ratings. After 
              all, a few negatives do not mean that a seller is out to defraud you. 
              Trust your instincts, says Lim.</p>
              <p>“Search for previous and current orders, check for a valid contact 
              number and chat with the seller. See if it has a retail presence. Talk 
              to friends and see if they've bought from the seller. Check reviews of 
              the seller on other sites.”</p>
              <p><strong>Read the description properly</strong></p>
              <p>Whether you're buying from an auction site or a blogshop, read the 
              descriptions of the items carefully. Scambusters.org says if there is 
              anything in an item description that doesn't make sense to you, or that 
              just makes you wonder, don't brush it off. “That's almost always a valid
               warning sign. Ask the seller. And don't buy unless you're sure of the 
              answer.”</p>
              <p>Even if you've read the descriptions carefully, there are occasions 
              when they may not be accurate. Tan recalls buying a dress from a 
              blogshop, which described the armholes as being of a certain size but 
              turned out to be at least 12cm smaller. “I wrote in to complain. The 
              shop owner offered to give me a refund if I sent it back but I ended up 
              trading it with a friend, so it was not such a big deal.” Tan adds that 
              such incidences do occur when you shop online as you don't get to try on
               the clothes.</p>
              <p><strong>If you're unsure, ask</strong></p>
              <p>Another frequent “blogshopper” is Sally, who says consumers should 
              ask many questions to clarify their doubts. She points out that when 
              buying clothes on blogshops, it's important to find out the exact 
              measurements. “Most, if not all, of these blogshops offer measurements 
              of ‘maximum inches' and that's simply not accurate enough. Even though a
               top can be stretched to 40 inches, it does not mean a person with a 
              38-inch waist would fit comfortably in it.”</p>
              <p>She recounts: “I bought two dresses of the same style in two 
              different colours. The items were in good condition but my 
              dissatisfaction was with the sizing. Both dresses were too small for me.
               In fact, I asked a friend of mine, who was two sizes smaller, to try 
              them on and she felt that they were a bit snug. Not only that, when I 
              put both dresses side by side, I realised that they were two completely 
              different dresses. I was made to understand in her (the seller's) 
              description of the dresses that it was the same style and came in 
              different colours.</p>
              <p>“I emailed my dissatisfaction to the seller, whose reply was 
              defensive. She claimed that the dress fit her perfectly and advised me 
              to read the measurements carefully the next time. My response to her was
               ‘Next time? There won't be a next time. You just lost a loyal 
              customer'.”</p>
              <p><strong>Know what you're buying</strong></p>
              <p>This is particularly important when bidding for an item on which you 
              expect to make a profit later. So, be sure that you know something about
               what you're bidding on, or get help from someone who does, says 
              Scambusters.org.</p>
              <p><strong>Keep records of your purchase</strong></p>
              <p>Once you've completed the transaction, be sure to print out a 
              copy of the transaction details (date of purchase, details/descriptions 
              of the goods, price and so on). You might need it in case you need to 
              return or exchange the item, or seek a refund.</p>
              <p>Check the privacy policy</p>
              <p>Scambusters.org
               says it's important to check the privacy policy of any website you plan
               to purchase from. “Make sure it has a policy that says your data stay 
              private, and that it won't sell or rent your information to third 
              parties.”</p>
              <p><strong>Be alert</strong></p>
              <p>Always be on the alert, to avoid being a victim of phishing activities, says Lim.</p>
              <p>“Phishing involves an e-mail message being sent out to as many 
              Internet e-mail addresses that the fraudster can obtain, claiming to 
              come from a legitimate organisation such as a bank, online payment 
              service, online retailer and so on. The e-mail requests the recipient to
               update or verify his personal and financial information, including date
               of birth, login information, account details, credit card numbers, PIN 
              numbers, and so on,” he adds.</p>
              <p>To avoid getting phished, never respond to emails asking you to “confirm” recent transactions.</p>
              <p>“Reputable organisations do not send unsolicited e-mail messages 
              asking their customers to update or verify their personal and security 
              details,” says Lim, adding that when one is in doubt, contact the 
              organisation in question immediately.</p>
