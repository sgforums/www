            <div class='col-md body'>hello!<br><br>When there's a car accident, do you think that it would be helpful to have something to pop up to alert you from a faraway distance? Or, would it aid the ambulance and police in locating your exact location as it is rather difficult to define your precise location?<br><br>The pop up should be around 3m on top of the car, so that it can still be seen when a car is under the flyover, which is around 4.5m on the average. There would be a certain impact for the pop up, actionPOP, to be activated as it would work based on the theory of the airbag. It would be lying flat on top of the car when not in use, and will shoot up immediately when a huge impact is put at the rear of the car, which is where cars usually collide.<br><br>Therefore, with this invention, police and ambulance can locate the vehicle involved in the accident more easily, and from a far distance, even at night. You can also avoid the particular lane where the accident is and prevent a traffic caught up.<br><br>We have consulted other relevant companies like the traffic police, IDAC and Opel and they agree that it is a good idea. However, please do let us know your viewpoints and opinions.   (:<br><br>cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey<br><br>its a decent idea overall, however-<br><br>i feel that<br><br>1) are you sure that it can be seen from far away -.-" it might just be some dot in the horizon<br>2) The flyoverfactor should not be limiting the height thingy. Whats the percentage of crashing under a flyover? i dont think you should care bout the flyover o_0<br>3) 3m isn't much of a help unless the colour is really glaring. so maybe longer lor<br><br>just my 3 cents worth,<br><br>PS: maybe you should do something about the car plates.. like cover em or sth when car crashes.

The bottomline is: an air bag would be produced when there's an impact. similarly, our actionPOP, a lime green glossy "banner", would be produced.. probably held on by a string to control its height.
