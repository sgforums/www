              <p>This goondu must be looking at his uber app or texting his guest. When he looked up, too late, wham bang, its too bad.</p>
              <p>Same with the 16ft lorry running red light and banging into a private mercedes below the PIE flyover at jurong east - bukit batok junction. The mercedes driver should have taken precaution and slowed down. Got right of way also must be careful, especially at 11.30pm.</p>
              <p>I had 2 close shaves myself. Keppel road turning into cantonment link. On two occasions, both times also normal taxi, the cabby just drove on even though its red for him and green right turn light for me. Guess what time? Also around midnight. So be careful. When its midnight, people brains sometimes dont work very well. They can see red light and thought its green. Be very very careful at traffic junctions.</p>

              <p>Although Limbu can breakeven fast, indirectly also slave more for taxi coy, becos the rental is so high.......</p>

              Aiya, in whatever you drive, as long as you work hard, if you dun work hard, then there will be less luck and of course less income and more problem (including bo tai chi go koptiam and create monetaryless problem).
              
              So, I believe all of us are trying to put better foods on the table, be it grab, uber or taxis, we are all struggling day by day in the realm of the driving industrial whereby in actual fact before we really put earned money into out pocket, those rental and taxi coy had already took our slice into their pocket.
              
              By and large, pte transportation is not something new, it had been around since 1950, there are companies who provide car and driver at a premium charges and higher class service. It is the explosion of technology such as smart phone that changed and expanded these pte ride into apps for better outreach to the public, whereby most of them are carrying a hp.
