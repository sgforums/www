If we attack them, and enjoy fighting so much, then limo was the wrong trade liao. If dun do anything, can get angry until crazy. Lan lan suck thumb is all u can do.

              <p>2 weeks ago pick up an indian.. looked and speaking soberly at 520am outside orhard tower... Due to convenience, i agree to take him to pasir ris and then intend to go airport.</p>
              <p>Halfway there, he fell alseep.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching destination, he 'became' drunk. Took out some used recepit thought is Singapore dollar notes. After awhile say pay by nets. Then anyhow press the number. UOB nets but press 7 or 9 numbers, press * or press yellow button then press numbers again.</p>
              <p>I lazy to go find out if he is real drunk or fake. Then he ask me go Downtown east to withdraw money from ATM, Upon reaching downtown east, if you guys know, there is a roundabout. He say the ATM is outside the roundabout, direct to drive out onto the grass, at the chalet there.</p>
              <p>I know this Fuker trying to be funny.. I straight away tell him, "you trying to be funny is it".</p>
              <p>I tell him i bring him to a new location for free, and bring him to the nearest police post. He even direct me to the police post but i dont trust him, OTW there saw a police patrol, they gave me directions as well.</p>
              <p>I regreted tellhim him i sending him to police post because he could jump off the car at traffic junction.</p>
              <p>However, we managed to reach the police post, and i relate the whole issue to the police. He tried to be funny go ATM with police again, then came back with nothing. In the end 2 friends come and pay for him. The police also smiled and say i suay, obviously he has no money. Luckily the policeman brought a witness with him to atm, coz that fuking indian at one time says he passed the money to the policeman. That almost pissed off that dude.</p>
              <p>That indian is a civil servant too. I think thats why he didnt really go to the extreme to do funny things.</p>
              <p>Already have 3 bad experience with single indians. many poeple told me alot taxi drivers dont pick up single indian especially at night spot 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, the whole hu ha ended around 720am, wasted me about 2 hours. Fuked up, but i charge him the way to atm and to police post as i dun fuking care. Due to about $28 fare, bo bian. And i am that kinda people, u wanna play punk, i make sure play with you gao gao.</p>

              My suggestion to LTA and NTA was, 
              
              Due to many cases of violent and run fare against taxi drivers, Passengers who board any taxis from 12pm to 6am in the morning must be prepare to show a sum of money to the taxi driver or a ATM card deduction before TD decide to ferry them to their destination.
              
              The laws therefore will allow TD to call upon the potential pax to pay his fare first, which will be estimated by a distance and route calculation with all surcharges added in, The laws will also give a provision to the TD, in HIRE green mode to have the right to reject the potential pax. And of course, the TD can choose not to use his rights and take a pax base on meters, the option is given to the taxi driver inorder to prevent run fare, lost of income, lost of time and worst, get beaten until OBK
