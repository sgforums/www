              Well, we are a open economy that support free trade and globlisation, MNC are wage killer that look for low cost operation anywhere in the world, they got no identity but rather consider themselve global employees, they only knows how to exploit nation weakness and wealth.
              
              And most industrial driven economy the like of Singapore must submit to them, otherwise, alot will go jobless including taxi drivers, their movement can cause economy crisis, and their gains are never share equally and adequately, but their lost is also blame on people working for them, and finally, they can leave and go anywhere as long as the pasture are greener than present.

              The differences in Singapore in attracting MNC is different from other countries, Other countries emphasis greatly on local talents, foreign bosses, MNC move in due to low cost of operation mainly because of low wages.
              
              However most countries do not have a good infrastructual to support the MNC functioning properly, the like of supply chain, transportation and more important, peace and harmony industrial... like Singapore, no strikes, no boycott, no riot. (until recently smrt bus strike and indian riot)
                  
              Singapore attraction to MNC is...you operate here, you can employ cheap foreign talents instead of getting higher cost local talents, coupled with our good infrastructure, friendly and cheap taxi drivers, peace and harmony, safe and sound..most flock back into Singapore even we are expensive.
                  
              In another words, to hold back MNC, Singapore govt tell them, you can bring in cheap foreign talents instead of moving to those countries, and that is why you got so many S pass and E pass holders here...UNDERSTAND BO

              Aiyo, do u know how many companies hv to remove foreigners due to quotas problem?? 
                  
              And some removed them without a single cent that these foreigners end up in MOM protesting, u still sleeping lah.
                  
              And especially in today context, govt/mom is very strict in this as it is a social political cum economy issue.
                  
              MNC move about in the world, as long as the positioning is good, cost is acceptable, can get talents and workers, profitable,  they will whack in, once used, they will move to the next pasture.
                  
              Most MNC are lure into Singapore by our EDB marketing, which is set up by govt, people like philip yeo, lim SS was once the director, to lure MNC, all the above conditions must be met, and more important the corporate tax in Singapore is low compare to many other countries, EDB will decide what type of MNC to bring in, from there, MOE will do the education and create the talents pool, which is mostly Singaporeans.
              
              Quotas are do not confine grade and position, as long as same companies, you can use it, so many mid level management, MNC put singaporeans in,..and for workers and some staff, they will employ foreigners in relation to the nos of SIngaporean on the mid level to upper mid level staff.
              
              However, there are still local older Singaporeans like me and many others not so educated, unable to fit into the mid level management, and that is where most end up driving taxis not just because unable to get a job, but because the farking paid is low due to the availbility of cheap foreigner workers/staff

              <p>These are the real talent we are lack off, all thanks to the limited resources our government had place on grooming such people.</p>
              <p>It is the FACT these group of Talent are giving us more jobs and is helping the economy</p>

              <p>They uses the real Talent to convince, the greatness of it</p>
              <p>But at the same time, bring in those RUBBISH Talent, like driver lar, waiter lar, clerk lar......etc</p>
              <p>Making these foreign rubbish really think they are The Talent who give us more job.......haiz</p>

              <p>About mr pinky, this is my thought...........</p>
              <p>My father, lead the family gradually,  till  we stay in a bungalow. Yes, my family member are contibution more each upgrade, but we still get to enjoy every upgrade.</p>
              <p>When my elder brother took over, he wanted to do better then my father. He work very hard, make the family member to contribute to the max at the shortest period. He did it, now we are staying in a good class bungalow. He achieve his goal but didn't realise we left with nothing to enjoy this good class bungalow.</p>
              <p>My brother had new goal, that is to built more good class  bungalow,but when knowing our family couldn't afford another good class bungalow at such a short period, he bring foreigner into the family, share our rooms, share our toilet, share our bed........... but didn't share our contribution. We are still contribution the same hefty amount but with foreigner sharing our space.</p>
              <p>Our family member have to go thru this just to satisfy my brother ambition. </p>
              <p>When we think we can have our space back when the second good class bungalow is built, my brother is looking into a bigger challenge.  He want to have a third good class bungalow at a even shorter period.</p>
              <p>He squeeze more foreigner into our home and the new good class bungalow..........</p>
              <p>I wonder, is there an end to it?</p>
              <p>My father is still alive, why didn't he tell my brother.......you never outshine me when you are unable to let your family grow together with your dream.</p>
