              FT is also an income for our govt hor..their taxs can paid offour milionaires ministers liao, as for TD, as we drive along, we become accustomed to FT as Pax, and as such, it become a rely, but to be frank, if all FT are gone, the scenarios will be..
              
              1. Lesser population leading to not so much taxis
              2. More higher paid job for locals leading to more TD going back to working life and less pple joining taxi trade
              3. Less social problem and better social harmony and sense of belonging

              <p>Point 2 - How to have more higher paid job for locals (TD) when companies were to shift out of Singapore due to high operating cost?</p>
              <p>Let's face it, anyone here wanna be a trailer driver (in my industry) where you can earn ard 3k plus (like the PRC driver) who work almost 14 hours everyday???</p>
              <p>Who would want to be in service industry (retail or hospitality) earning 2 k per month and need to work over the weekends?</p>
              <p>Which sector are you referrring to the higher paid job??? Banking, R &amp; D???</p>
              <p>Point 3 - Less social problem, take this sub forum as example, I would say almost 100% locals and yet we have problems w/o the interference of FT....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

                  <p>Point 2 - How to have more higher paid job for locals (TD) when
                  companies were to shift out of Singapore due to high operating
                  cost?</p>
                  <p>Let's face it, anyone here wanna be a trailer driver (in my
                  industry) where you can earn ard 3k plus (like the PRC driver) who
                  work almost 14 hours everyday???</p>
                  <p>Who would want to be in service industry (retail or hospitality)
                  earning 2 k per month and need to work over the weekends?</p>
                  <p>Which sector are you referrring to the higher paid job???
                  Banking, R &amp; D???</p>
                  <p>Point 3 - Less social problem, take this sub forum as example, I
                  would say almost 100% locals and yet we have problems w/o the
                  interference of FT....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              1) For years since the 1998 financial crisis, we hv been depending on cheap  foreign workforce, and this end up companies gaining from it by paying low wages in a 1st world economy, and when come to local, we hv to match or lower our expectation due to foreign availiability. But we are living in Singapore, and spent our money and cost here, foreigner can just go back and enjoy there cheaper cost of living in their homeland

              So, this got to change, but companies, due to having enjoy low wages payout and thereby improved there profit, never wanted to change as long as govt allow that tap of foreign entry open. 
                      
              Once the chief of labour said, foreigners are here to create job for Singaporeans...wow! we felt threatened if foreigner are gone..are we? Singapore are not built by foreigner, it nation building and economy are built by our forefather and us, and hopefully our decendents can carry on. 
                      
              So what if companies decided to move out, but singapore main attraction is not just about cheap labour, our infrastructure including Just in time delivery, good port, transportation, supply chain and financial trust are also the main keys of attraction, 
              
              and our hardworking locals are also being labelled as the best in the world, so we should not be worrying about foreigner gone and companies also gone. 
                      
              If companies want to go, let it be, apple iphone are not manufacture in USA, but that does not mean USA is not the world nos 1 economy.

              If there is no foreigners, what do you think will be trailer driver paid in Singapore..at least 10k. 
              
              As I did a study trip to japan to understand why they do not need foreigner and yet remain the world 3rd best economy, tho not as vibrant as before, but they are happy, because there is no (less) foreigner intervention in their economy, one nation, one people, one japanese. And till today, their culture and values remain intact because of no ah neh, ah bangala, ah pinoy, ah tiong..and so on.
              
              The keys is they rather pursue their cultures and values than economy. 
              
              And you look at their trailer driver paid, their taxi driver income, their waiter...and so on..even the driver who bring me around is paid $6k per month, Singapore??? got lah, 7k taxi driver. 
              
              Let take a look at cleaners alone in comparing first world to first world economy paid
              Sweden $5k (tax 25%)
              Germaing $4.5k (tax 28%)
              Britain $4.5k (tax 26%)
