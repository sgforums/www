              Industry observers estimate 5 to 10 per cent of taxi drivers are habitual gamblers.Checks at carparks of the two integrated resorts reveal a sizeable number of parked cabs - often during peak demand hours for them. On horse-racing days - Fridays and weekends - carparks at satellite betting centres are also filled with taxis.There are 10 such centres here, and the most popular one is in Bukit Merah. 
                  
              A recent check revealed more than 50 parked cabs there between 6pm and 7pm on a Friday.Said Neo Nam Heng, chairman of the Prime group of companies, including Prime Taxi: "This is the worst problem of taxi drivers.
                  
              And there's no rule to stop them."Prime Taxi general manager Eric Ang said: "Gamblers do not only miss rental payments, (but) they are not meeting service requirements too."Their mentality is strange - instead of making money during the peak period, they'd rather gamble. 
                  
              Some of them will say: 'If I win, I will win more than the rental.' "Premier Taxi managing director Lim Chong Boo said: "It is not a new problem, and it has worried us a lot all this while."Trans-Cab general manager Jasmine Tan said gambling is one of the top causes of drivers missing rental payments, "but so are drinking and womanising"."We try to help them by giving them a repayment scheme. 
                  
              But if they don't follow it, we terminate (their services)."A ComfortDelGro spokesman said gambling is not a major problem, but that it is keeping a close watch on the situation.
                  
              The phenomenon is no comfort to commuters, who complain that it is often hard to find a cab even though Singapore has the highest taxi population per head among developed cities.
                  
              There are 5.2 cabs per 1,000 residents here, compared with 3.3 in London, 2.6 in Hong Kong and 1.5 in New York.The situation is such that commuters are now choosing parallel taxi services on apps such as Uber and GrabTaxi - even when the cost of a ride is often much higher than that of a conventional cab.Human resource consultant Alex Yew, 43, once saw close to 100 cabs in a carpark where a Singapore Turf Club betting centre is located. 
                  
              He said: "That was just one carpark - there are three carparks in the vicinity. If you multiply that by the number of betting centres around the island, it is a significant number of cabs."So I can understand why people feel that's it's difficult to get a taxi during peak hours."
                  
              The Straits Times talked to a couple of cabbies at the Resorts World Sentosa carpark earlier this month on the condition of anonymity.
                  
              Said one of them, a 40-something SilverCab driver: "It's my first time here. I've been to Las Vegas, Macau and Perth, but I've not been here."Asked why he was visiting a casino when it was peak period for fares, he replied confidently: "I'm only driving part-time. I work in a logistics firm, I work 15 days, I get 15 days off."So I thought I'd drive a cab when I'm off. When I'm not driving, I'm with my family. We've a three-year-old, so I can't come here when I'm with them."
                  
              Another cabby, with leading operator Comfort, denied that he was there to gamble."I am here to meet friends for dinner," the 50-something said as he was getting back into his taxi in the VIP section of the carpark just before 6pm."I was in the area, so I thought I'd call them to meet up for dinner"

              <p>I wanted to post this comment on one of the websites but it got deleted off immediately.  So I am posting it here:</p>
              <p>You cannot expect 100% of taxis to be operating every single day 24 hours.  Taxi drivers need to take turns to rest too.  There are more than 28000 taxis in Singapore.  Some drivers would be resting on Friday nights but very likely these who rest on Friday nights would be operating on Saturday and Sunday when other taxi drivers are resting.  Like most other Singaporeans, many taxi drivers prefer to rest on weekends when demand for taxis would be the lowest.  Most taxi drivers already work longer hours than most other Singaporeans driving 12 or more hours at least 6 days a week.  During peak hours, public transportation like buses and MRTs are also fully packed; it cannot be helped.  It is also not feasible to add more taxis as the demand for taxis would not be there during off-peak hours. By 6pm to 7pm, many single shited taxi drivers would have already driven at least 12 hours since they started off as early as 5am in the morning to cater to the needs of people that need to go to work.  300 taxis resting on a certain night is only just slightly more than 1% of the fleet. I seriously doubt there would be so many taxi drivers betting at other betting stations as many are very profit oriented and would choose to earn if they could.  And let us not forget, taxi drivers work long hours, do not receive CPF, do not receive bonuses and do not have holidays and medical benefits.  But back to the main issue, the main reason why people find it difficult to get taxis during peak hours in because the demand during that period of time is much greater than the supply of taxis and we cannot just increase the number of taxis to meet the demands during peak-hours because the demand during off-peak hours would not be there.  Also we cannot force self-employed single-shifted taxi-drivers to drive between 12-16 hours a day especially with the understanding that most Singaporeans only work on the average 8.8 hours per day.  So be patient and wait a little longer during peak hours. Many single-shifted taxi-drivers would rest in the afternoon just to take care of evening-peak hours customers. Also double-shifted taxi-drivers would be there too.</p>

              <p>Women in Singapore do not like guys to call prostitutes especially those who are married.  However, they forgot they also make love with their husbands at least a few times a month.  So for those without wives, what do they do?   I bet these ladies make more love with their husbands on the average than singles would call prostitutes.</p>
              <p>Drinking is socializing with friends; hardly anyone would drink frequently alone.</p>
