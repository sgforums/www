            <div class='col-md body'>In wake of the recent flurry of letters to local newspaper forums, many commuters and cabbies alike are complaining about one thing:<br><br>Commuters who are staying in the East such as Bedok, Changi, Simei, Pasir Ris often get black faces from complaining cabbies, who has been waiting for up to 2 hours in the Airport Queue.<br><br>A fare to these locations, usually does not cross the $10 mark, even after adding the Airport surcharge of $3-$5.<br><br>Commuters feel bad, and the cabbies who has customers going to the places mentioned also dosne tfel happy as he had wasted his time queuing for such a short fare.<br><br>There are replies to the newspaper, from most commuters saying in the East, and from some cabbies, to build a Airport Taxi Queue, dedicated for the Eastern part of Singapore's commuters. In this way, it may be a win-win situation for cabby and customer.<br><br>LTA disagreed and says the one-queue-for-all scheme presently has worked for many years, successfully. It also says that cabbies are not allowed to choose and reject customers for any reason. (such as destination, etc).<br><br><strong>So should the Airport have 2 seperate Taxi Queues? one for the East, another for the rest of the island?</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>usually, there is a pattern to what time is the "peak" periods at airports. Another way is that when there are not enough taxis, usually at night, Airport staff will ask the taxi companies to despatch more taxis to the airport via radio.<br><br>However, when its Chinese New Year, Airport Q may be worse. only extra $1 PH surcharge on new year!</div>
