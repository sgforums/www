              <p>there are two ways the taxi firms compete with each other for right?</p>
              <ol>
              <li>hirers</li>
              <li>passengers</li>
              </ol>
              <p>but how exactly do they do it? which company is better in terms of benifits? rents? etc. as in how they attract you-as a taxi driver? why do u want to join them??</p>
              <p>and for the passengers, which taxi company has the lowest taxi fare ar? does the price attract them or does the service or maybe the car attracts you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!</p>

              <p><br>There is no regulation that first customer must take the first cab on the Q .</p>
              <p>In the event first cab is Mercedes ( flag down $3.20 ) , 2nd cab is a Toyota Crown ( flag down $2.80 ) ..... commuters can chose to take any taxi they want .</p>
              <p>Vice versa , if the first is a Crown , 2nd is a Merc ... commuers also got the right to chose .</p>
              <p>It's a question whether that 2nd taxi driver courteous enough to tell u to take to take the 1st taxi , or if u insist , he also must take you .</p>
              <p>Also a question of are u courteous enough to take the 2nd ?</p>
              <p>But most commuters don't care one la , just open door , and : " Uncle , XXXX road ."</p>

              <p>Taxi companies does compete with each other , but they also have a set of rules and regulation to follow , like one company can raise the flag down fare , but cannot reduce the flag down fare .</p>
              <p>But i was curiousthat time , when Comfort raise the flag down , why must all follow ?</p>
              <p>If one don't follow , indirectly he is lowering down the flag down , right ?</p>
              <p>And that dun actually refringe any regulations , right ?</p>

              <p>So the outcome they compete , is to give drivers benefits .... lots of it . It's a war out there !</p>
              <p>It's a slap to LTA actually .</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>
              <p>LTA's objective of giving licenses to new taxi companies is to increase competitiveness with the commuters benefits most of it ...</p>
              <p>But it turned out that inorder to survive , taxi companies has to give benefits to drivers ( to drive thier taxis ), and commuters don't actually benefits from those newer taxi companies at all , other than long taxi Q . Value wise , commuters gets nothing actually .</p>

              <p>But then again , LTA kept controlling the taxi industries .... said to be "liberalised market" , as in which taxi company also can be allowed to increase their fleet as they want , LTA will keep issuing them new COEs .</p>
              <p>But it's not really the case .</p>
              <p>From the front door , we see like LTA wash hands off the market , but thru the back door , they are the fools that disrupting the taxi rhythm .</p>

              <p>So now all taxi company is so hand tied , they can't go on giving benefits to drivers , and in the end , drivers still cannot manage the low demand .  So what they did ?</p>
              <p>Like SMRT , gave Lucky Draws for commuters taking their cab .</p>
              <p>Like Comfort &amp; CityCab , invested a large sums of money for the NETS transaction inside a cab .</p>
              <p>And recently Comfort gave 2 Fairprice Link points for every booking the commuters made !</p>
              <p>Still lower down the killing peak hour surcharge will revive the taxi market .</p>
              <p>They will succumb to this due to pressure , let me tell u this .</p>

              <p>Taxi companies ( most of them from ComfortDelgro and SMRT ) , government's link compnaies ..stuck with taxi , in thousands , at their back yard ...... taxi drivers struggled with low demand during peak hours .....</p>

              <p>Still they chose to sit back , and do nothing to the industry .</p>
              <p>Maybe they account currently that NE Lines ( ComfortDelgro ), EW Lines ( SMRT ) and their buses , with the money they earn , is good enough to cover the lost income from these two giants .</p>

              <p>Long story ...</p>
              <p>Comfort was an independant taxi operator , said to be World Most Profitable taxi company . Just Comfort alone .</p>
              <p>Delgro Engineering is the mother of SBS Transit and Citycab .</p>
              <p>So when the government announce that another public transport operator, not SMRT , to operate the North East Line , SBS Transit got the tender .</p>
              <p>But Delgro needs funding ... lots of it .</p>
              <p>They , SBS Transit , was in red since . Constructions of NEL took away lots of their resources , and apparently , they have massive problems replacing their aging fleet of buses and buses , they were desperate . Until today , they yet to break even the cost of infrastructure and resources for NEL .</p>
              <p>That time , whatever it is , The Government intervene , and Comfort pump in some majortity of the shares , to " save" Delgro .</p>
              <p>They will go bust if Comfort don't save them .</p>
              <p>It will be a devastating term to use "takeover" for Delgro , cos their share prices will plunge .</p>
              <p>They use the word " merge " , sounds like they really merge , not that la ....</p>
              <p>Now u know why Comfort-Delgro .... Comfort is infront , not DelgroComfort ?</p>
              <p>Because Comfort has the majority of the shares ....</p>
              <p>So Singaporeans , actually must thank the 3 generations of taxi drivers , that make Comfort possible , from a small taxi company , to a giant , that tookover a bus company , World First !!! </p>

              <p>Seriously, any monopoly would have super normal profits. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the major taxi companies owned by "yours truly", what kind of competition do you expect?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From recession to recession, the rental rates for taxis has gone up and not down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently heard from taxi drivers that all the taxis are rented out, taxi uncle was saying, due to recession alot of folks lose their jobs and are taking on taxi driving.</p>

              <p><br>Benefits ? They need a reputation , as a Public Transport Company , not a taxi company , that go Global .</p>
              <p>Comfort always has an ambition to go into Bus Services , they have the $$$ , but no expertise , like Delgro .</p>
              <p>So for the government and the 2 company , it's a win-win propsect .</p>
              <p>Comfort's money , Delgro expertise in the bus operation , from there , they set-up , and bought over bus companies , provider of Bus Services in all parts of the world , u be surprise how strong ComfortDelgro is .</p>

              <p>TS talking about competition between hirers and drivers is not the same as taxi companies competing against each other, it's taxi drivers competing against each other.</p>
