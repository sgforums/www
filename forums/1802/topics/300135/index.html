            <div class='col-md body'>More international brands of cab models hit the road in 2008.<br>By Christopher Tan, Senior Correspondent<br>Published: December 27 2007,<br>The Straits Times<br><br>WHEN news broke in May 1996 that taxi operator CityCab had ordered a fleet of Mercedes-Benz E-class cars, Mercedes agent Cycle &amp; Carriage's phones rang off the hook.<br><br>Scores of customers who had booked that car wanted to cancel their orders. Others wanted to switch to a different model.<br><br>Nobody wanted their new car to be white - the colour of Singapore's maiden fleet of Mercedes taxis.<br><br>But times have changed. Today, nobody seems to mind buying a car that is the same model as a taxi. 'White is even coming back,' says Cycle &amp; Carriage chief executive of motor operations Cheah Kim Teck.<br><br>Part of the reason why attitudes have changed, he thinks, is that these days 'all manner of cars are taxis'.<br><br>He is right - there are now about two dozen different cab models on the road, up from just six as recently as three years ago. Many of these include such popular cars as the Toyota Wish, Honda Stream, Honda Airwave, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Magentis.<br><br>The change followed Singapore's adoption of the Euro IV emission standard in October last year for new diesel vehicles in a bid to reduce the amount of particulate matter in the air.<br><br>The pollutant - described as ultra-fine soot - is identified as a health hazard as it can be lodged in the deep recesses of the lungs. Diesel vehicles are believed to be a major contributor.<br><br>But vehicles meeting the Euro IV standard produce far less particulate matter and other pollutants than the Euro II models previously allowed here.<br><br>The standard, however, meant the Toyota Crown and Nissan Cedric - models that once made up nine out of 10 taxis here - could no longer be imported. Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor do not have Euro IV substitutes yet.<br><br>Toyota distributor Borneo Motors says an Indonesian-assembled minivan called the Innova might be ready in 2009 to meet the Euro IV ruling.<br><br>The new standard also wiped out the London cab, operated by SMRT Corp.<br><br>'London cabs do not meet Euro IV standards,' says SMRT spokesman Goh Chee Kong, adding that no Euro IV replacement is in sight.<br><br>From as early as 2004, cab operators started looking for suitable replacements for their taxis and some of their choices have proven unconventional, to say the least.<br><br>For instance, the Toyota Hilux, a popular pick-up truck, is now a yellow-top cab. Borneo Motors has sold seven so far.<br><br>There is also a solitary Toyota Liteace panel van, which The Straits Times understands has proven unpopular with commuters. Taxi giant ComfortDelGro Corp, owner of the Liteace cab, is exploring another van which meets Euro IV standards: the huge Hyundai Starex.<br><br>SMRT has gone for another huge Korean: the Ssangyong Rodius, one of the biggest MPVs around.<br><br>Two preceding Hyundai models are now a common sight at taxi queues: the Sonata and the Azera. The former has a clone from Kia (a Hyundai-affiliated company) called Magentis, which is used by Premier Taxis. The latter is a Korean sedan bigger than the Mercedes-Benz E-class, and is a limo cab.<br><br>From an initial cool reception, taxi drivers have warmed up to the Hyundais.<br><br>Cabby Tony Pang, 58, who recently took delivery of a Sonata, says: 'It is very good. Quiet and smooth. And it consumes less diesel than the old Toyota Crown.'<br><br>Other new cab models on the road today include unlikely candidates such as Skodas, Volkswagens, Peugeots and Fiats.<br><br>This is the first time operators are trying out European brands besides Mercedes-Benz since CityCab ran a small fleet of Opels in the 1990s. There were no repeat orders because the cars were found to be not as hardy as Japanese ones.<br><br>But it was the arrival of the newest taxi operator - parallel importer Prime Leasing - in September that brought the biggest slew of new cab models. These include popular passenger cars such as the Toyota Wish, Honda Stream, Honda Airwave, Honda Stepwagon, Toyota Corolla Fielder and Toyota Corolla Axio. The Toyota Estima, a big premium MPV, will be added to the list soon.<br><br>This marks the first time Hondas are being used as cabs here.<br><br>Prime Leasing's cars are petrol-driven models converted to run also on compressed natural gas (CNG). As such, they are accorded a green rebate equivalent to about 40 per cent of the vehicles' open market value, as CNG is deemed a cleaner alternative to diesel.<br><br>These new taxis look a tad out of place because of their smaller dimensions, compared with most other cabs.<br><br>Prime managing director Neo Nam Heng says these cabs - numbering about 60 now - are a hit with taxi drivers because they are 'quiet and good for their health'.<br><br>But he admits that commuters may not always recognise them as taxis.<br><br>Asked if the myriad of cab models might be confusing to taxi users, especially tourists, ComfortDelGro spokesman Tammy Tan thinks not.<br><br>'We make sure that all our models, save for the premium range, are painted in either Comfort blue or CityCab yellow,' she said. 'This is how commuters can distinguish our cabs.'<br><br>Meanwhile, the proliferation of new cabs has begun to affect some Japanese car sales the way Mercedes sales were initially hit.<br><br>Mr Eddie Lo, sales manager of Toyota parallel importer Richburg Motors, complains: 'No one wants a car that is the same as a taxi. The demand for the Toyota Wish has decreased by more than 50 per cent.'<br><br>Prime Leasing's Mr Neo, however, believes the impact will prove only temporary - just like the Mercedes experience.<br><br><a href="http://cars.st701.com/articles/view/358" rel="nofollow">http://cars.st701.com/articles/view/358</a></div>
