            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>'Cabby breaches SMRT Taxis' Golden Rule, passenger gets free fare'</strong> (ST Article 12/12/2005)</span><br><br>(Extracted from ST Article)<br><br>He wanted to travel from Tanjong Pagar train station to Aljunied and had a route in mind, but his cabby drove off without consulting him.<br><br>The passenger paid his fare of $8.20, then made a call to SMRT Taxis' hotline Â— 6555-8888 Â— becoming the first disgruntled passenger to get a free ride from the company under its new money-back guarantee scheme.<br><br>Under this scheme, launched last Thursday, SMRT has five golden rules for its cabbies, and passengers who feel their cabbies have failed in any of the areas can get their fare back in taxi vouchers. They can be used on their next journey with SMRT taxis.<br><br>On the flip side, SMRT is encouraging satisfied passengers to tip their drivers.<br><br>By Friday afternoon, SMRT said it had received two feedback calls and tips had not increased significantly.<br><br>While the four other taxi companies Â—ComfortDelGro, Transcab, Premier Taxis and Smart Automobile Â— do not offer such a scheme, all but Trans-cab have their own ways of dealing with customer compliants.<br><br>With all three companies, complaints are dealt with on a case-by-case basis and drivers are interviewed to give their side of the story.<br><br>The largest taxi operator ComfortDelgro, which operates under three brands Â— Comfort, CityCab and Yellow-Top Â— said it has for some time been giving out taxi vouchers to customers who encounter service lapses.<br><br>On average, the operator, which has about 17,000 cabs, gives out $300 worth of vouchers a month for about 60 cases.<br><br>ComfortDelgro's group corporate communications officer Tammy Tan said that in many cases, commuters complain about a cabby but are unable to provide key information like the licence plate number of the driver's name.<br><br>"In such instances, we are unable to conduct a proper investigation to verify the complaint. It is important for commuters to insist on receipts, which are available in all our taxis," she said.<br><br>The company encourages tipping but added that, while drivers are often told to keep the change, Singaporeans tend not to be generous tippers.<br><br>At Premier Taxis, where cases are investigated within a week, senior managers are called in to decide on the action to be taken.<br><br>Said the company's managing director, Mr Lim Chong Boo: "We give anything from taxi vouchers to flowers. And in the case of vouchers, we give a token sum which may exceed the fare paid by the passenger."<br><br>He hopes that customers tip cabbies, but does not want drivers to feel they are entitled to tips.<br><br>The general manager for Smart Automobile's rental cars and taxi services, Mr Niki Ong, agreed.<br><br>"We do not want to give the impression that if you don't tip you won't get good service," he said.<br><br>As for complaints, marketing staff from Smart arrange a meeting with customers to get their side of the story and go armed with company souvenirs, hampers and even champagne.<br><br>Mr Ong recalled the most severe case, in which a passenger called to complain after she and her grandchildren were left on the expressway by a cab driver. The cabby was unsure of the route.<br><br>"We found it was the cabby's fault and after giving her a few days to calm down, we presented her with a hamper of gifts to show we were sincere in providing her with good service," said Mr Ong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah. about thr preferred route, needless to say, the shortest and fastest.<br><br>Also better le. Faster complete the fare, cabby can do more fares. if longer route by say 50cents and some more time, customer not happy.<br><br>if cabby complete fare faster, say maybe "sacrificed" 50cents for shorter route, then found another fare, ah! $2.40 already. 50c or $2.40 better?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>if cabby as said, take more time on purpose, he may be slower and may lose to another taxi for a fare at say flagged down on the streets, not to mention, if on MRT stns for fares, this cabby may had arrived longer due to giving the previous customer a longer route, he may had gotten a fare which is gong near by, so again may lose out.<br><br>still, short and fast is better, dont go greedy over a few more cents and risk a complain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
