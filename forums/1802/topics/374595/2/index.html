            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi all bros, was reading all your posts here and just have to write something to give support to Ty. What struck me was Azera37 Ty's case. I was in the same situation he is right now. Was declared a bankrupt in 2004 was 44  then, and driven as relief with comfort for 2 years plus. It was tough going as relief driver for the nite shift, everynite thinking whether can make enough to cover cost and what was left to bring home. I think you bros are very correct to say "Be Happy and take it easy". Most frustrating is everynite you can hear your frens saying by 12am they already make 150++ some time even more and why i cannot? It's the inner self that is giving us problem to achieve that goal. I was troubled, disturbed, disappointed with myself for being in this situation. Could not take it as before business owner now a bankrupt. Lucky after two years plus driving cab, managed to get a job and was sent oversea. Frankly couldn't find any job SG with my age now. We're considered "expired". Ty believe in yourself do not give up, like what our bros' say be happy don't put pressure on yourself, you will only frustrate yourself and things will go wrong. I was involved in 2 accidents during my time in this cab line and my mind would wonder off to some where thinking of history. It really will affect your nite's mood and believe it or not i think our bros agree. Once you start off with a grouchy, grumble look and day it will become a bad day. All cab driver says there is this "Taxi Chye Sin" in your cab when you're happy and luck will always be with you. BTW i am and still am a bankrupt now, it's 5 years since.    </p></div>
