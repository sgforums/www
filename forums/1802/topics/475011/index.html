              <p>[Stomp]  Cyclist toys with danger by riding closely behind big lorry</p>
              <p><img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/sites/default/files/public/styles/sgseen_featured_image/public/article/images/featured/2013/10/cyclistmain.jpg?itok=j-SVlVl-" alt="" width="462" height="280"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">STOMPer Michael sent in a video of a cyclist who toyed with danger by riding closely behind a big lorry with a full load on its back.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The 28-second video, originally uploaded on facebook, shows the male cyclist following closely behind the right-rear side of the lorry, and potentially putting himself in danger if the lorry driver were to jam on the brakes suddenly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">According to comments left by the netizen who uploaded the video, he came across this cyclist along Nicoll Highway and was concerned for his well-being, asking in a description accompanying the clip: "What will happen if there is an accident?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is unknown when the netizen came across this cyclist though the video was uploaded onto the social networking site on Saturday morning (Oct 12).</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In his report, the STOMPer wrote:<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"It will be good to feature this video of a guy cycling on the highway.</span></p>
              <p>"I hope this video can spread the message also that cycling on major roads like expressways is not allowed as well."</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This is the second incident related to the conduct of cyclists on the road this week, after another rider was caught on video beating a red light, and attempting to provoke a driver into a confrontation.</span></p>

              <p>The developing countries like mynamar, indian, bangadeshi and so on bring about their bicycle riding cutlure and style into our country</p>
              <p>The china chinese also bring about their way of cycling into our country</p>
              <p>Then the ang mo bring about their tour de france style of cycling into our country</p>

              <p>I see ah neh, ah tiong cycling across pedestrian crossings instead of pushing their bikes, making us look like bloody third world country. I see them cycling on pedestrian walkways, expressways and against traffic on the roads. From first world to third as far as our traffic situation is concerned with all these ppl flooding here.</p>
              <p>LTA better do something about these third world ppl bringing their bad habits into Singapore.  I suspect they will revert to licensing cyclists soon.</p>

              <p><br>Not fark and ride meh? You see, our govt is playing hippocracy here, telling us to save the world, go green, enviromental friendly, end up use diesel, petrol and so on, even at power plant. Why? because these generate more money for them, if you go solar, they can go bankrupt hor.</p>
              <p>Same apply here, ask pple to go green, ride bicycle if can...then end up not providing track for bicycle because of space constrain, why not just ban bicycle on certain road, if you can put ERP on road, why not control bicycle riding, no bicycle at CBD area, expressway and certain highway like west coast highway...and so on.</p>
              <p>So, i ask you, can bicycle ride on red bus lane in town?</p>

              <p>But for bicycle, cycling in holland and french need licence in some of it prime area, especially holland, all cyclist must attend high way code and cycling lessons, and holland today is the world most cycle friendly country.
