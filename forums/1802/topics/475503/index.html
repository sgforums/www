              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">If that is not enough to make commuters dizzy, there are close to 10 different flagdown fares, three different metered fare structures, more than 10 different types of surcharges, and eight types of phone booking charges.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Mix and match each of these types of charges to the various types of taxis and you will get combinations that rival the Rubik's Cube in complexity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><img style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; float: left;" src="http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/straitstimes.com/files/20131028/2610(1).jpg" alt="" width="275" height="456"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Marketing professional and regular taxi customer Lau Sau Kuen probably echoed the sentiment of other commuters when she said: "It's terrible we have so many types of cabs and so many different rates. I don't know the rates any more. Just as I don't know the different surcharges any more. I'm resigned to paying whatever the cabby tells me to at the end of a ride."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">And if locals like Ms Lau find it confusing, what chance do visitors have?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">It does not help one bit that operators are now allowed to adjust fares at will. So, even if you managed to memorise the dizzying permutations of fares, you would need to be eagle-eyed to spot the perpetual changes.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">How did Singapore come to this state?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Well, it started in 1998, when taxi fares were deregulated. The Land Transport Authority said then that the move was to allow taxi companies "to set fare structures based on their assessments of prevailing market conditions".</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">If that argument is sound, why don't we allow bus and train operators to do likewise?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Why are there two fundamentally different policies for taxis and other forms of public transport? This approach does not stand up to scrutiny - unless taxis are not viewed as public transport in the first place.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Here, the authorities are rather inconsistent. Taxis are considered public transport when it comes to the tallying of public transport ridership numbers. Operators are given special dispensation when it comes to Certificate of Entitlement bidding, and granted bigger tax rebates than private car buyers are if they choose environmentally friendlier models.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">But elsewhere, they are deemed private transport. Operators enjoy a laissez-faire environment no different from that of car rental companies (in fact, they operate like car rental companies), free to set whatever rates they choose.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">This became more apparent when the Government liberalised the industry in 2002, a move that saw several new players entering the fray. The move resulted in a more competitive market that proved beneficial to cabbies in terms of more employment choices and attractive terms, but left a question mark over service standards - despite an almost 50 per cent surge in cab population from 2002 to last year.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">With about 28,000 taxis on the road, Singapore has a higher cab-to-resident ratio than most developed cities.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Despite that, frequent complaints of "can't get a cab when you need one" recur. To be fair, it would be tough to get a cab anywhere in the world sometimes, such as on Saturday nights and rainy days.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">But macro figures suggest that taxi usage here is less than optimal. Hong Kong's 18,000 taxis make about one million trips per day. Singapore's 28,000 cabs do slightly under a million trips.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">On fares, Hong Kong also seems to have a more efficient system. Its cab fares are government-regulated. The market is tightly controlled too, with no new taxi licence issued since 1994. Taxis are instantly recognisable, with three basic colour schemes (red being the most prevalent).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The fare structure is a lot less complex. The flagdown rate is a uniform HK$20 (S$3.20), with every 200m or one minute of waiting time charged at HK$1.50. Surcharges are few and low. For instance, phone booking is HK$5 (S$0.80), but many taxi operators will waive this.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">A 10km cab ride in Hong Kong costs slightly more than a ride in a normal taxi in Singapore without surcharges and booking. But with surcharges or booking, the ride here costs more - with one in a newer or fancier cab being even more expensive.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Costs aside, commuters in Hong Kong seem better served than those in Singapore, as many visitors will attest.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">In Singapore, the Government recently put in place new measures to force taxi operators to improve service levels, especially in taxi availability, for example by imposing a minimum mileage a day.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Whether that will work remains to be seen, but at least one taxi company - Premier - is reacting in a somewhat perverse way to regulations. It has jacked up its peak-hour booking charge to $4.50, compared with $3.30 charged by most others.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">It did so ostensibly to manage demand. With fewer people dialling for its cabs because of the revised charges, observers said Premier will be better able to meet the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) requirement for taxi operators to dispatch cabs to at least 92per cent of the people who call in.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">As for the mind-boggling fare structure that vexes commuters, the LTA says that companies are required to publish fare changes.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Publishing fares is of no help when there are so many rates to remember. And because of the exigent nature of transport, consumers are less in a position to pick and choose taxis even if they recall rates - unlike the situation they face when shopping for groceries or going for a haircut.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Is it then time for the Government to re-regulate fares and the industry?</span></p>

              To Mr Chris Tan, Senior Transport Minister oops Correspondent,
              
              It's good that you highlighted the confusing fare structure on behalf of the commuters as well as for us (TDs, we also kena till blur blur). 
              
              However, when you bought up this matter, please don't pull TDs into the picture by comparing S'pore Tds with HK Tds in the service level. Be fair to us, why don't you compare us with Malaysia counterparts. I hope you do that in your papers.. (you no balls to do that one lah)
              
              Secondly, while you speak up for the minority, please don't pull down the majority by suggesting Bus and MRT operators are allowed to set their own pricing as what the Taxi operators are allowed to do. 
              
              A Senior Transport Correspondent like you should behave professionally, and not behave like ordinary public members. You have to understand that the cost of living is already killing a lot of low income S'porean and yet you want to push up the public transport fares. Are you OK or not?
              
              The complex fare structure is not the main issue, it's just a tool for you to kpkb on the papers to gain more readership. 
              
              I urged you to suggest the following in order to tackle the main issue; which is the availability of cabs when they need it...
              
              1. Standard the flagdown rates @ S$20 (since you compare the price with HK)
              2. S$1.50 for every 200m traveled (again same with HK rate)
              
              And if the above is approved, you can be assured of even higher than HK service level.
              And scrap all surcharges.
              
              This will solve all current problems that you had written in your papers.

              <p>I was in Hong Kong recently for the Lions v Barbarians rugby game. I travel regularly to Hong Kong on business but this was my first time to spend a weekend there for a major sporting event.<br><br>I have never had problems with Hong Kong taxis until the abominable behaviour I experienced two weeks ago.<br><br>A group of 10 of us were going to the game and had been enjoying pre-match drinks at Delaney's Irish pub in Wan Chai. We went to get taxis to the Hong Kong stadium, which is about 3km distance from Wan Chai. While it took some time for my group to find a taxi, we got there in time and settled in to enjoy the match, having paid the HK$40 taxi fare.<br><br>The second group of friends were forced to pay double the fare shown on the meter, which in itself is disgraceful but the third and final group had to pay HK$500 – that’s GBP50, for a three kilometer ride. The taxi driver just refused to take them unless they paid that amount, which is scandalous….a total rip off of the very tourists upon whom the economy depends, and a very sad reflection of an element of the local population’s attitude towards foreigners.<br><br>The game finished and my friends and I decided to leave early as the Lions were well ahead and the game was over as a contest. We did not want to be stuck in long lines for a taxi on the way back.<br><br>We found a taxi pretty quickly and here is where the drama began. The “for hire” red light was on and we got into the taxi before telling him where we were going. When we told him we were going to Lockhart Road, he said he wanted HK$200……once <a id="_GPLITA_2" style="outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; text-decoration: underline; border: 0px;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy" href="/forums/1802/topics/"><span style="color: #003399;">again<img style="min-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px; outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; width: auto; display: inline; float: none; height: 10px; vertical-align: super; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" src="http://discountbu-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt="" width="10" height="10"></span></a> these scam merchants were going into action. We offered to pay double the meter fare but he said no, so we said we were going to call the Police…..he said “go ahead…I don’t care, they will not come to help you….” And at that point a policeman and policewoman rounded the corner just up ahead of us.<br><br>I told my friend to go and get the Police while my other friend and I stayed in the taxi…I saw the taxi driver reach forward to the dashboard, and flick the “for hire” sign over to “out of service”…..a really nice example of friendly Hong Kong public transport here……he started shouting at us to “get out my car”, but we were having none of it. He tried to scam the Police into believing that we had boarded the cab while the out of service sign was <a id="_GPLITA_5" style="outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; text-decoration: underline; border: 0px;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy" href="/forums/1802/topics/"><span style="color: #003399;">displayed<img style="min-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px; outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; width: auto; display: inline; float: none; height: 10px; vertical-align: super; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" src="http://discountbu-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt="" width="10" height="10"></span></a>, ranting on in Cantonese, and by now a crowd was starting to gather as the game had ended and the stadium was emptying out.<br><br>The Police believed us, the woman police officer spoke good English (guess we were lucky with that) and crowds of people were by now regaling these officers with their own tales of Hong Kong taxi rip offs……an unbelievable number of people had been scammed in the same way that evening.<br><br>In the end, the taxi driver was charged with an offence and we filed a formal complaint against him. The Police said that, if this is the first complaint against him he will be fined about HK$5,000 and if he has done it before he could lose his taxi licence….I sincerely hope he does!!! <br><br>The whole weekend taxi experience left a very bitter taste in our mouths and changed my opinion of Hong Kong taxi drivers for ever…try to avoid them at all costs!</p>

              <p>Hong Kong taxi drivers, love them or hate them (actually, mostly just dislike them). They’re not <em>ALL</em> bad, perhaps 50% are adequate. Here are a few of the reasons why they’re not popular. Feel free to add your own reasons in the comments!</p>
              <p>10. They curse non-stop, and complain about where you want to go</p>
              <p>9. They don’t help you with your suitcase, or even offer to</p>
              <p>8. They drop you off at the wrong place, and then insist that it is correct</p>
              <p>7. They always try to keep the change, despite giving you poor service</p>
              <p>6. They smell bad, or the <a id="_GPLITA_2" style="outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; text-decoration: underline; border: 0px;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1802/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;">interior<img style="min-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px; outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; width: auto; display: inline; float: none; height: 10px; vertical-align: super; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" src="http://discountbu-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt="" width="10" height="10"></span></a> of the taxi does</p>
              <p>5. They take the long way to get to your destination</p>
              <p>4. They ransom, or simply just keep your <a id="_GPLITA_0" style="outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; text-decoration: underline; border: 0px;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1802/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;">mobile phone<img style="min-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px; outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; width: auto; display: inline; float: none; height: 10px; vertical-align: super; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" src="http://discountbu-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt="" width="10" height="10"></span></a> if it falls out of your pocket</p>
              <p>3. They (illegally) want <a id="_GPLITA_3" style="outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; text-decoration: underline; border: 0px;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1802/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;">to know<img style="min-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px; outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; width: auto; display: inline; float: none; height: 10px; vertical-align: super; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" src="http://discountbu-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt="" width="10" height="10"></span></a> where you’re going before they’ll open the door (Which is why one person recently tried to Gangnam Style dance their way into a taxi… it didn’t work!)</p>
              <p>2. They price-gouge, asking you to pay an exorbitant flat fee to get you <a id="_GPLITA_1" style="outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; text-decoration: underline; border: 0px;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1802/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;">someplace<img style="min-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px; outline-style: none; outline-color: invert; outline-width: 0px; width: auto; display: inline; float: none; height: 10px; vertical-align: super; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" src="http://discountbu-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt="" width="10" height="10"></span></a>. It’s illegal, but commonplace in the Lan Kwai Fong nightlife area</p>
              <p>1. They keep. Stepping. On. The Accelerator. And Then. Stepping. On. The Brake. Which is. SUPER Annoying!</p>
              <p>Bonus reason: they try to adjust their mirror so that they can look up girls skirts! Ewww!</p>
              <p>H.K. taxi drivers bad reputation was once the subject of a Hong Kong movie titled “<strong>Taxi Hunter</strong>“, starring Anthony Wong Chau-Sang!</p>
