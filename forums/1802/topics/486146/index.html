              <p>uaskforit. You ask a qtn i believe only mr bowah can answer you.</p>
              <p>But from technicial perspective, you can actually go use a test set to check the quality of the taximeter, for example, if you know cars have to go for LTA inspection right? They have a test set to check whether the car is modified ( maybe im wrong ) from there, you can setup your test set to check whether the taxi coys have good quality standards? Well you are challenging them though. haha.</p>

              <p>of course u can if you wan to mah. Currently, the whole taximeter is in the stone age, if can, cut short the takt time, bring productivity up by simplfiying the whole f up system, sure can earn money one. Me only can talk, talk is cheap....up till now, i havent see any kind souls from NTU or NUS grads think of their final year project to improve it. i wonder when will this day comes...</p>

              The market most common rim sizes are 15 to 18 inches, 15 inches is mostly for those honda fit and airwave which are mostly 1.6cc.
              
              For sonata and other like renault and i40 are 17inches type., 18 or even 19 inches can be for cry si lang or mercs.
              
              Inches of rims mostly come in stock, meaning come as it is, if you are to mod it, you may have a problem with insurance when they found out. 
              
              As we all know that perimater of a circle is calculated as Pi r sq, the rim play an important role, bigger rim in one round travel longer than smaller rim, tio bo? however, tyre also play a part, eg a 205 55 R16 is different from 205 45 R16
              
              205 mean the tyre face length, which abt 8 inches
              55 mean the side wall from the rim start is 55% of 205 
              R16, mean Rim 16 inches.
              
              Taxi companies is not going to fault your modification as long as your rims and tyres are geninue type, and not those replica type. Meaning, it got LTA approval, which is of course, more expensive.
              
              Bigger rim, bigger tyres of cos travel faster in one turn of the tyre than smaller ones, but it is heavier and therefore take more fuel to turn it,...understand bo

              <p>Wah trick questions. 1kg iron and 1kg feather has the same weight. But you need hell lot of feathers.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">5inch rim and 17rim travel 1km. Both travel the same distance. So if your meter is tune correctly to the correct size wheel. Meter will be the same.</span></p>
              <p>But if your car is originally 17rim but you change to 15rim and you didn't tune the car. Then smaller wheel makes more rotation. You move 1km but your odo will think you move 1.1km. So your meter will jump faster.</p>
              <p>That's why cannot anyhow change to non geninue wheel. The odo, fc will be incorrect.</p>

              Rims is not the final deciding factor of your wheel outer diameter, the tyre height do play a critical role in detemining the exact OD of your wheel, in the market, there are 35 45, 55, 65, and so on. Some car can hv a big rim, but a thin side wall height, some have small rim but thick side wall height.
              
              Odometer cannot be change unless in present of inspector at test centre or at LTA. one turn is one turn, how far it goes in term of it perimeter, be it small or big tyres, is not going to be a big issue in the odometer, its just represent the nos of turn as per stock tyre

              All vehicle come with the stock rim and tyre that is properly designed for the vehicle, if you change it, it divert is design, capability and safety.
              
              Many car owners will tell you that some insurance company like aviva do not insure you if you change yr rims to a size not with the original stock size. And that happen when the owner get into an accident, claimed insurance, insurance took photo, then tell owner that according to clause this and that which owner had signed....rim modification out of original size specification without authorisation will void this insurance.
              
              The shaft, pinon and ball and bearings in yr taxis are designed and mend of a particular size of rim and tyre, if you alter it to bigger, it will not only add weight = more fuel consumption, it also stress the undercarriage shaft, studs, ball joint, bearing and also the suspension

              from my level 3 korean mechanics...lols
              
              Yes, transmission is read the odometer, that is provided, there is a timming belt, today korea and most jap use steptronic transmission, no more timming belt hor...so the force is transferred to the wheel base shaft...unlike my crown, still hv to go change timming belts...nabey.
              
              Such changes give you the more accurate on the road distance odometer reading, whereas by tranmission, the pulleys and gear ratios hampered the real value to the distance travelled.
              
              Bigger wheel and smaller wheel do provide the same fare value, one turn is one turn, bigger wheel might travelled longer, but that one turn will be slower to compensate the distance travelled.

              It is a step up and down electronic control gear just located beside yr top left engine, known as steptronic, some vehicle use techronic and so on or like conti car VW and so on they use DSC, dual steptronic control..which have so much problem especially on their cars.
                  
              So, in conclusion
                  
              Stock wheel and tyre size are calculated/designed for the optimal output for a particular taxi/car
              If hirer wish to upgrade/modified to lower or upper wheel and tyre size, it is up to you all, odometer will remain the same.

              <p>same odometer , so is the reading the same with big n small wheel on the same distance travelled?</p>

              Same, cos it is also one turn,
                  
              However, big wheel with a larger perimeter will in one turn move further than smaller wheel, but time and power are also affecting the rotation, 
                  becos if given the same power,  it takes longer time for big wheel to rotate one round than smaller, but if you put more power on big wheel than smaller so that both rotate at the same time, bigger wheel will consume more fuel.
                  
              Eg a tipper truck with 45inch big wheel and a taxi with 17 inch wheel, given the same power on the pedal, the taxi would had completed one round in X timming, truck would still be turning as it takes longer time to turn resulted in  X+x time. After both completed one turn, truck will be further from taxi, as bigger wheel perimeter is longer
              
              So, for the truck to cope up with the same timming as taxi, the truck will then have to depress the fuel pedal more to create more power
                  
              As for the taxi, to compensate for the distance lost to big wheel truck, the taxi must rotate more than one round, therefore we can said that
                  
              Distance= perimeter of wheel/power x time

            <div class='col-md body'>At the end of the day, in layman term, we have to be logic here,  if big wheel can travel faster, than F1 will be using 45inch wheel or bigger, but the weight would had slowered the car.</div>

              As I said, both big and small given one turn, big wheel will travel faster...ok.
              
              So let said from Point A to Point B is 5km, given the same revolution per minute (RPM), big wheel will reach there first...tio bo? smaller will also reach there..tio bo, but the reading on the odometer will be +5km, same same..so the fare is the same, just that big wheel timming are faster.
              
              Fare are distance measured, not time.
