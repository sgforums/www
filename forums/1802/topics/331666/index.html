              <p>The best service I've experienced is in Japan, a "4.5".  Very clean and comfortable inside, cabby is extremely courteous even with language barrier, automatic help in loading your big belongings, know their way around and last but not least, safety-first driving without being obviously slow.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Japanese taxi dont play FM radios for you but they also dont talk cock like sing song to your destination</p>
              <p>also dont give Japanese drivers extra points for wearing white gloves cuz they charge you just the same.On the whole I would rate both taxis 3.5pts</p>

              <p>This one very hard to say lah. You have to have a much bigger sample size. Each country has their share of good and bad taxi drivers. You can't make generalisations without getting a big enough sample size and getting the average rating.</p>
              <p>Personally though, I'll rate a 3. Not bad, but not fantastic either.</p>

              <p>they are driving people around.. it is a service to their customers..</p>
              <p>they should learn how to drive a car smoothly without stepping on and letting the accelerator like it was a footpump.. and also they should learn that they need not stamp on the brakes.</p>
              <p>also, they should not smoke in the taxi when there are no passengers because most of the taxis i've been in, reek of stale cigarette smoke...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. the radio and all that should also be turned off.. and if they are tired, they should not be picking up passengers.. there were a few who almost fell asleep when driving.. that's scary and irresponsible of them</p>

              Typically, singapore cabbies will not greet you. They just ask destination and confirm route. No chatting unless pax start first. They play their favourite radio. Thank you when alighting. Drive off. 
              
              Very normal service for local pax and asian tourist. But rude for ang moh tourist.

              and please compare apple to apple lah... 
              
              Jap taxi is one of the most expensive in the world... they authority keep it that way... expensive not by one stanards... taxi only used for corporate use... not any japanese aunty go market also can take... and each cabby cannot drive more than 8 hrs per day... 
              
              if singapore taxi also go that way (much higher fare), then you talk about service lah... imagine 4 big paxs squeeze into my taxi for a short trip, want me to make illegal short turns... pay me $5... and still want good service?
              
              Hong Kong taxi. i take before... no chatting, no greeting. generally a bit more expensive than singapore... drive fast...still use stupid looking crown...about the same as singapore lah...
              
              Malaysia taxi.. no need to say more...
              
              Thailand taxi... ok... but cabby also pick and choose destination
              
              Beijing taxi... i dont think you want to know...
              
              USA taxi... many states... i tried one in a ulu state... old vehicle... will greet... but will talk back... once i told the driver it is green light liao... he said he is turning, and to leave the driving to him... they are the professionals... please dont forget to tip...

              <p>they are driving people around.. it is a service to their customers..</p>
              <p>they should learn how to drive a car smoothly without stepping on and letting the accelerator like it was a footpump.. and also they should learn that they need not stamp on the brakes.</p>
              <p>also, they should not smoke in the taxi when there are no passengers because most of the taxis i've been in, reek of stale cigarette smoke...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. the radio and all that should also be turned off.. and if they are tired, they should not be picking up passengers.. there were a few who almost fell asleep when driving.. that's scary and irresponsible of them</p>

              <p>yo bear, take my taxi sure no complain one.</p>
              <p>1) driving = safety + comfort is most important. (ex. curve road slow down so tat pax won't be thrown around behind)</p>
              <p>2) smoke = non smoker, got greenland air freshener somemore</p>
              <p>3) radio = no for my enjoyment, but to update on road conditions so tat can inform customers if they chose a route where there's traffic jam</p>
              <p>4) sleepy = hmmz non comment, ask the omo drivers.</p>
              <p>fyi, there are many cab drivers who practise 1) to 3), juz tat u suay, met more of the others kinds.</p>

              <p>gd4U,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just been back from Taiwan recently too. Anyway, that wasn't my first trip to taiwan so I know what you meant between SIN and TPE taxi. I could also give a general comparison with Philippines, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore</p>
              <p>Generally SIN taxi drivers drive like they own the road. They think that they own the road, so they can stop anywhere they like, drive faster than the rest of the cars on the road. Usually they don't give way to passenger cars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I may get greeted by some, some don't. Maybe I am not carrying a luggage out from the airport perhaps ? They will help you with your luggage at the airport, but not when you reach home. Something that I think they are doing it for show for the foreigners at the airport taxi stands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bad point when they don't know how to get to my destination. They don't ask for help, they don't call their colleagues or "helplines" or look at their maps etc. They will usually ask you how to get there... I mean, if I know how to get there, let me drive the taxi instead, right ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taiwan</p>
              <p>TPE taxi drivers are among the best experience. Very clean seats and interior ( And I mean VERY VERY clean ! In fact very well maintained than my 4 year old car ! ) I feel like a boss sitting in a limousine most of the time. I get greeted most of the time and some would chat with me about their Ah Bian, or recommend me to visit places, advise me of places of interest to visit. They do take pride in their job, help you place or remove luggage.. ( they actually run out of their car and pull out your luggage before you can step into or out of your seats .. really amazing ). There are no cheating cabbies so far and overall I give them a good rating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their driving habits are as good as regular passenger car drivers too, they will give way to people, smaller cars, buses etc. Signal properly, drive carefully but still quick enough so as not to piss off my patience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One good thing about them is they have a very good radio system. When they are taking me to places they are unfamiliar with, they usually will call their "helplines" to find out the nearest,shortest direction to get to my destination. Usually they can take me to the industrial areas right up to the door step of the factory without problem. Good !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Phillipines.</p>
              <p>In PHP, their cabbies tend to speak less, maybe due to language accents. They can speak english, but I am the one having the difficulties sometimes. But overall communication is easy and there are no problem most of the time. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They drive as well as TPE cabbies, knows how to get to places. Overall they drive very safely too. As safe as other passenger car drivers. They don't squeeze or bully other drivers. But they sure know how to sneak into empty spaces during traffic jams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China and Vietnam</p>
              <p>I place both countries together because they know how to cheat you of money and honk excessively at others. Very irritating ride in their taxi and alot of jam-braking, hard acceleration. You need to know your route well so as not to get cheated by some who will take you on a scenic route ! In VIE, I even get nasty with a young cabby because he had tweaked his mileage meter and charge me double ! Sometimes you just need to bark really loud at them so that you get a free ride back to hotel when they want to cheat you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Interior is usually similar. Both CHN and VIE will place a white linen cloth over their entire back seats. You are suppose to imagine that white linen being white, bleeched, clean and hygenic. Most of the time you are better off wearing your unwashed jeans so that your jeans are cleaner after the ride. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Malaysia</p>
              <p>Overall, its a state-price-take-ride. I had never took a MAL taxi and get charged with their meter ! So it is a cheated once, get smart experience.. Know your price before you go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxi are dirty and smelly. Old and noisy. Comfort is really bad. Try to wear sweaty dirty jeans. They don't mind. The smell don't irritate the cabbies. Just don't bring poku and start eating them inside the taxi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thailand</p>
              <p>Full of cheats. They'll start to cheat you even before you sit in their taxi. You need lotsa bargaining power to get the price right. Toutings are common. Just pick the taxis one after another, parked at roadside, ask for price beginning from the first in queue and start saying NO No NO .. until you get to the middle of the queue ..you probably get a discount.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Drivers are relatively good, except you will have problem if they are older drivers who don't understand english. Nice smell in most taxis of fresh pineapple fragrance in their interior. You feel safe with their religion-inspired interior decoration, at least looking at them ease your tensed up ride in the city.</p>

              Generally SIN taxi drivers drive like they own the road. They think that they own the road, so they can stop anywhere they like, drive faster than the rest of the cars on the road. Usually they don't give way to passenger cars.
              
              (What about those commuters stand anywhere you like, flag any moment you like, oready set by LTA some special location those Taxi Stand, but still commuters said very laychey, never obey the rule. All road are not own only by taxis comeon, talking about speed and fast and furious..on paper, see for yourself how many Subaru WRX and some even smaller race cars of passenger saloon make... hitting tree trunks, lamp posts and even road dividers fencing and etc.)
              
              I may get greeted by some, some don't. Maybe I am not carrying a luggage out from the airport perhaps ? They will help you with your luggage at the airport, but not when you reach home. Something that I think they are doing it for show for the foreigners at the airport taxi stands.
              (No comment on this, each and individual)
               
              Bad point when they don't know how to get to my destination. They don't ask for help, they don't call their colleagues or "helplines" or look at their maps etc. They will usually ask you how to get there... I mean, if I know how to get there, let me drive the taxi instead, right ?
              (This issue a big scope. What about this example i encounted few day ago. Four ah neh pessengers on board...Henderson Walk. So where the hell... they are going. Let me know how and where to get there, you think all taxi drivers must know everything.)( I mean i really do not know this destination. Than you drive the taxi and let me know where the hell is this place)perhap this will help.

              <p> </p>
              <p><br>This weekend I went to Taipei to visit some friends and get some fresh air and a taste of modern life! I arrived late, taking the bus with my friend. Taking the bus is an affair that takes twice as much time, but it’s also half the price and it has movies on demand, massage chairs that are big enough for two and a blanket in the arm of the seat. Mmmm luxury. Anyway we arrived late and spent some time just walking randomly around the city at night and exploring the night areas while we waited for a friend to get home.</p>
              <p>Finally our friend called us, and we had her speak to the cabbie in Chinese to tell him where to go. My friend also knows Cantonese and several phrases in Chinese, therefore she was also able to communicate and help explain what was going on. Our stop was on the MRT line and our friend said it should take about 15 minutes to get there and cost maybe $280NT at the most. Well we got in, and at first he was really nice. Chatting to us in Chinese, making conversations. But then, it became clear he had NO idea where he was going, or he was trying to take us on a joy ride. Usually I try to give people the benefit of the doubt - especially since things in Chinese can be easily misunderstood. But when my friend recognized a landmark and told him to stop, he kept right on going down the street! Convinced he knew best! We asked again, still no stopping. So anyway he drove us up and down the road twice, thinking he knew the street number when he really didn’t. So as he’s driving, his foot goes on the pedal, off the pedal so that we were start-stopping the whole way up the street and everything was taking more time. I’ve been taken on a ’roundabout’ way before but this was pretty special. After going up and down the street about four times and him not stopping or ‘misunderstanding’ us, he finally went back to where we told him to. He also told us he would do us a favour and spare us the $75NT surcharge for rides that cost over $300NT, and also give us a $15NT discount. Ummm yeah, because there has never been a $75NT surcharge on any of the rides I’ve been on. Geez. And $15NT discount on a ride that SHOULD have been $280NT but now cost almost $400NT? Give me a break! He might as well just steal our money. haha. Anyway as usual, it is best to not make a fuss because really it’s the difference of a few dollars. But still…not cool.</p>
              <p>Turning back to Kaohsiung, on the way home. I’m pretty darn good at saying my street name and I also know how to say numbers very well. Always, if you say “85″ big tower, they know where to take me so usually I don’t have a problem. But my driver from the train station started taking me in the direction of monkey mountain! Well, I kept on saying “bah-she-ouo, zi-na-li” (85, over there) and he wasn’t getting it. On top of everything else the traffic was bad. I was convinced it was happening all over again…but really there is no point getting mad here because people will just be even more mad and frustrated at you because you are foreign and they don’t want to lose face but anyway…so frustrating. Finally, double the amount of what it would usually cost me to get home later, I decided I should have just taken the MRT and it honestly would have been faster, if not as convenient as a taxi. But the taxi driver either really didn’t understand or he had some sort of change of heart, because he lowered the price to half - exactly what it should have been. Anyway I’m glad I didn’t get mad at him because we would have both been frustrated and anyway I think it’s better to try and trust people here without jumping to conclusions since both Mike and I have had a lot of misunderstandings. It’s a mystery to me that he didn’t understand my saying “Tower 85″ when every other taxi driver did…but what can you honestly do? Just thankful I didn’t have to pay another $400NT for a cab! Yes, this is my life with Taxi Drivers in Taiwan</p>

              <p>In PHP, their cabbies tend to speak less, maybe due to language accents. They can speak english, but I am the one having the difficulties sometimes. But overall communication is easy and there are no problem most of the time. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They drive as well as TPE cabbies, knows how to get to places. Overall they drive very safely too. As safe as other passenger car drivers. They don't squeeze or bully other drivers. But they sure know how to sneak into empty spaces during traffic jams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China and Vietnam</p>
              <p>I place both countries together because they know how to cheat you of money and honk excessively at others. Very irritating ride in their taxi and alot of jam-braking, hard acceleration. You need to know your route well so as not to get cheated by some who will take you on a scenic route ! In VIE, I even get nasty with a young cabby because he had tweaked his mileage meter and charge me double ! Sometimes you just need to bark really loud at them so that you get a free ride back to hotel when they want to cheat you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Interior is usually similar. Both CHN and VIE will place a white linen cloth over their entire back seats. You are suppose to imagine that white linen being white, bleeched, clean and hygenic. Most of the time you are better off wearing your unwashed jeans so that your jeans are cleaner after the ride. </p>

              <p>Overall, its a state-price-take-ride. I had never took a MAL taxi and get charged with their meter ! So it is a cheated once, get smart experience.. Know your price before you go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxi are dirty and smelly. Old and noisy. Comfort is really bad. Try to wear sweaty dirty jeans. They don't mind. The smell don't irritate the cabbies. Just don't bring poku and start eating them inside the taxi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thailand</p>
              <p>Full of cheats. They'll start to cheat you even before you sit in their taxi. You need lotsa bargaining power to get the price right. Toutings are common. Just pick the taxis one after another, parked at roadside, ask for price beginning from the first in queue and start saying NO No NO .. until you get to the middle of the queue ..you probably get a discount.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Drivers are relatively good, except you will have problem if they are older drivers who don't understand english. Nice smell in most taxis of fresh pineapple fragrance in their interior. You feel safe with their religion-inspired interior decoration, at least looking at them ease your tensed up ride in the city.</p>

              <p>I don't normally take taxi, but I am so disgusted by the driver of Comfort taxi, car number SHA4354C. Please refuse taking his taxi if you see that taxi.</p>
              <p>Was at Tiong Bahru with my fren, and boarded his taxi on New Year's Eve. Really spoilt my mood.</p>
              <p>When we boarded his taxi, we specifically said we will be going to 2 places, AMK and Yew Tee. There he drove his taxi on. However, after 20-30metres, he started saying he will not be able to drive us to 2 places as he wanted to go to golden landmark by 1130 to ferry passengers. He should have told us before he started his cab.</p>
              <p>Then, he stopped his taxi suddenly and ask us to get down. Demanded i should say. And ask us to pay for the cab fare. This is ridiculous! I am taken for a ride without reaching my destination?!!! Payment for a unwarrented service?! Comfort cab can do much better than this!</p>
              <p>Rating for taxi driver... less than 1.  It is New Year's Eve! Come On...!</p>
