              <p>They have the kia caren cng rental $90plus with some bonus.contract 4years I think.Another reason I chose Prime is that you pay only the nett rental everyday.No bonus no free rental all these nonsense,pay $90plus first then end of the mth rebate few hundreds.end of the day lppl take back your own $$$ you put in the first place</p>
              <p>For prime,everyday deduct $76 that's all</p>
              <p>the $5k bonus is attractive but also they pay you using your own $$$,just treat as forced saving as i mentioned</p>

              <p>i agree with u but I can't wait anymore,my contract with smrt just ended &amp; i really can't see myself con't with the crown,they offered me the epica saying will be launched very soon,but rental $107 with gst:( very siong leh</p>
              <p>then i consider joining comfort sonata but rental also $100 plus sigh,unless i decided go only 12hrs become relief but that's not what i intent to do.</p>
              <p>so the next best option for me is Prime,at $76 i'm comfortable,auto &amp; new car which is exactly what i want,cos I need to use the car for my other biz as well</p>
              <p>I've learned a lesson with smrt,queue for almost 30mins at their 1 &amp; only geylang lor 1 kiosk &amp; glad that next time all esso/mobil will be my kiosk</p>
              <p>if some other better deals pop out next time(very likely it will) I guess it can't be help,as long as i'm ok &amp; comfortable with the present deal then i'm fine...grass always greener at the other side</p>
              <p>if petrol shoot up to say $3/l, i guess i just need to drive longer hrs to compensate.but if this really do happen,LTA will surely implement the fuel surcharge again</p>
              <p>I may also consider the Toyota wish petrol version,with option to convert to cng in the future if east side open a cng station,I got 2 wks to revert back to prime</p>

              <p>Good to hear that you still have time to change it.....</p>
              <p>More to inject in my opinion:</p>
              <p>1) smaller engine cc doesn't mean you will save.. engine work harder, if you run it as taxi and it is not design for it, then too bad... especially the suspension system, and also don't forget the engine is driving the aircon compressor...i think in the 2nd year, it is totally worn off as a taxi...</p>
