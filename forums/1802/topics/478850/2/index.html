              Complexity leads to job creation, you want LTA scholars and staffs to loose their job ar?
              
              Some people, especially our govt, like to make thing complex, being complex, it makes people look blur and stupid, and at the same time, able to sell their koyo that end up making peoples think they are smart and clever so as to hold on to their high paid job?

              In any govt policies, it is alway a dual process, one creates a need for full understanding, the other creates a way to earn more taxes or income.
              
              To understand, you need to gather information, you need to TCSS&lt; you need to explain, you need to argue, and you need to prove your point and you might even need to attend courses or visit taxi office to listen to those lau ka po teaching, that create a vibrant economy, a churning one that moves, you got that picture?

              to stagnation of life and movement of economy. In any govt
              policies, it is alway a dual process, one creates a need for full
              understanding, the other creates a way to earn more taxes or
              income. To understand, you need to gather information, you need to
              TCSS&lt; you need to explain, you need to argue, and you need to
              prove your point and you might even need to attend courses or visit
              taxi office to listen to those lau ka po teaching, that create a
              vibrant economy, a churning one that moves, you got that

LTA should reduce ERP price during peak hours for taxi driver to get in to the CBD area people waiting there should able to get taxi for them. and it is the greedy of LTA to has coe on taxi and do not view it as a public transport. also why people complain so much? because some older taxi drivers has no brain operarting the taxi or think too much. </p>

              <p><br>Taxi vehicle reduce ERP and no coe. Taxi vehicle rental become a good replacment to own private car or rental vehicle. It makes the situation even worst. What is taxi service? It is  a on demand short time rental of private car with chauffeur service. Such service need to price accordingly.</p>

              <p>Fare hikes is caused by the companies increasing the rental. So TDs will only help to collect money from pax to pay to  companies. End of thee day TD earn nothing.</p>

              <p><br>What u refer is the flag down rate increase due to new taxi model. It is not consider fair hike as it only affected those TDs with the new taxi model. The flag down rate increase is target to cover the increase in taxi rental not TDs income.</p>
              <p>New model taxi also come with higher COE. This is translated into higher taxi rental.</p>
              <p>In short, the flag down rates increase on new taxi model is not consider as taxi fares hike as it does not impart the all TDs. it is more target to recover the increase in taxi rental cost.</p>

              Your understand on inflation makes my under cannot stand leh.
              
              Consumer price index or CPI is noted as parallel as inflation index.
              
              Today the 2 main cost of inflation is housing and vehicles, which is human make, not by natural causes. Natural causes usually are natural diseaster that affect a certain group of price hiking leading to inflation, like flood, earthquake, virus...may lead to cost of rice and other food to rise. 
              
              However, all these figures and nos are just plain board  statistics, to a TD, we must get real, and that is getting the real figures. Inflation thru vehicle and houses had caused a domino effect on all other cost of goods to shoot up, yet with a low increment in profit or wages for working class, there is actually no real profit or wage increases, what increased is washed off by the increase of cost of living.

              Inflation is a nos, let say 5% for the year of 2014, meaning given all people in singapore earn equally, to face the cost of living, we will be short of 5%.
              
              If a company increase their employees wages by 5%, and inflation is 5%, there is no real wage increase, meaning lan pa pa lan. employees will still suffer. earn earn only to give back to the society. But if the company increase 8%, then there will be a 3% real wage increase.
