               If wages dun go up, people cannot spend, people will take less taxi, taxi driver become poorer, their family will also hv to become thrifty in their spending, and when all start to spend less, the economy goes into a spiral downward recession.
                      Therefore, it is critical that wages must go up to offset the inflation, govt know all these in their finger tips, the only issue is that they do not want to make you very rich, and yet not very poor so that you can spend and help to churn the economy.

              That is also why keep saying and insisting that in Taxi driving, there is no profit increase, what you earn 10 years ago and now, can be higher, but these are offset by inflation, higher rental and higher cost of living and money shrinkage.
              
              Our money had become in a way become useful in those 3rd world countries whereby their pace of progression are slow.
              
              Now, our govt had come out of a PWM, progressive wage models for workers (workers here meaning all wage earner). But for TD, is there a progressive earning model??

              In the 90s and 80s or early 2000, inflation is only 0.3 to 0.5%, today we are seeing 3 to 4 or even 5%, could be more than that, but govt dare not put the figure. 
              
              Then they, the govt blame it on the housing and car prices, the 2 main cause of high inflation, but knnccb, housing and car prices are control by govt mah...kong lan jiao way
              
              Take for example, for Taxis, due to high COE and higher OMV cost, the rental went up, and to lure hirers, they increased the flag down, TD suck thumb, but to the pax, cost of travelling went up, and paxs include our relatives and our family members taking taxis, so if you are the sole bread winner of the family, your expenditure went up, profit remain same, end up with larger deficit on a already deficit earning

              NWC and employment Act is meant for employers, not employees. Many do not understand it, because when EDB go out and attract investors, investors will ask them, how much is yr increment per year,..EDB will said, cheap cheap lah, 3% average only, then they will brief these investor on our employment act that flavored them.
              
              NWC is just a platform whereby EDB, employers representatives and Unions representative will sit down and discuss on how to cheat employees further so that company can flourish and stay, and at the same time, the Union can carry on to be there to shake legs and hv good times, (because no company equal no union). 
              
              Then they put an University Professor, who is controlled by the govt to be the chairman and said that NWC is neutral and an all parties decision...but knnccb, how can u recommend a wage increase below inflation rate or same with inflation rate, so end up many locals get caught in no real wage increase or hv to spend more to survive.
              
              And funny how, when this professor retired from NWC, he said that actually wages should go up by 50%, this show that he was controlled and as such, betrayed his professionalism as a professor of economy

              As I said, if they can increase the transport like bus and mrt, then taxis like cdg will increase fare, but do they dare to accept my proposal, the problem is they even dare not to increase mrt and bus fare now...so there is no logic in accepting my TCSS proposal.
              
              They paid me to put up a proposal, accept or not, I still get paid, that tell u a lots of TCSS stories

              Public transport got increase liao meh?? bo lah.
              
              The strategy of companies is to increase rental, that will increase their revenue, because year by year, cost of office rentat/tax, maintainence, staff paid, bonuses and all parts increases, just by acting on the same old sonata is going to end up tar tar, lost of profit margin, therefore, they hv to bring in newer cab, the like of i40, LTA agreed to fare increase if the taxi pay high COE, all in all, its is a brother and sister relationship, taxi drivers will hv to slog further, more and more pax will evade cabs due to high fare, govt will continue to put in more buses, more express one way buses, more MRT is going to open.

              Hello, the first day you drive a taxi and become a taxi driver, you are already consider stagnated, not to mention saturation.
              
              Dun worry, as I said before, govt will not like TDs end up very hard to past life, then throw key, there will be no gain for them, in fact, a lost. When too many throw keys, govt will create a balance atmosphere thru their transport or fiscal policies to get people to take taxi again, let NS mrt breakdown..earning opportunity for all...lols
