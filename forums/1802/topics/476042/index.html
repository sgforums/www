              <p>they are real life GPS. If dare to make noise if they give wrong directions, I welcome them to lodge complain.</p>
              <p>Pax that allow kids to be monkey, u brake a little harder at times, they'll know what to do. Else tell them to buckle or get their kids seated down, unless they want to pay traffic police. Most with kids know what to do. Not their first time taking cabs</p>

              <p>That's one of my complains. Talk so much, so loudly. Ask u off the radio, carry on with their loud conversation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes need to signal them where they want to alight or turn, then can break their conversation</p>
              <p>another similar is those plug in earphones. U ask them to realised no response, then u look at rear mirror, either closed eyes with earphones plugged in or earphones too good, sound proof, can't hear us.</p>

              Please lah, these are the hazards of Taxi driving, and as hazards, you hv to take it, like me going up ship, hv to wear safety helmet, goggle, ear plug, safety belt, safety underwear, +++ knn, from 65 kg become 90kg, then hv to climb up 10 storeys to reach the bridge of the ship, then go down 10 storeys to reach the engine room. Noises, foreigner workers spitting, sweat, knocking, tripping...and so on, like a war zone..so how?? Taxi driving better right? 
              
              Take it as a pinch of salt lah, at the end of the day, it is part of the trade you choose to be, and fyi, after 20 over years of driving, such pattern never change much, it is either you take it or leave the trade and join other, and others also have their own hazards..then how? change again?

              <p>Please lah, these are the hazards of Taxi driving, and as
              hazards, you hv to take it, like me going up ship, hv to wear
              safety helmet, goggle, ear plug, safety belt, safety underwear,
              <ins>+</ins> knn, from 65 kg become 90kg, then hv to climb up 10
              storeys to reach the bridge of the ship, then go down 10 storeys to
              reach the engine room. Noises, foreigner workers spitting, sweat,
              knocking, tripping…and so on, like a war zone..so how?? Taxi
              driving better right?</p>
              <p>Take it as a pinch of salt lah, at the end of the day, it is
              part of the trade you choose to be, and fyi, after 20 over years of
              driving, such pattern never change much, it is either you take it
              or leave the trade and join other, and others also have their own
              hazards..then how? change again?</p>
