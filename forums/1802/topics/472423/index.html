              <p>Max income...go maxi pawn shop lor.</p>
              <p>For TD, the business is same like a prostitute, except that prositute use maxi bra to maximise their asset to attract client, we got nothing much to maxi about beside driving for Maxi cab. But in principle both are the same, plying on the street looking of paxs, taking calls, booking ...and so on</p>
              <p>Taxi first pax out of carpark or chinatown (lols) is same as prostitue first customer, if that customer is shitty type, the rest of the day can be a sad with bad mood, so is taxi driver, if first pax send you to ulu places like ulu pandan or maybe give you many problem, it can signal a bad day ahead.</p>
              <p>Good or bad, it is all luck, and that is also why like prostitue, taxi drivers like to pray to this, put this and that on their cab, this one pantang and that one can sway kind of goodos mindset. Well, it still call for respect in a way one make his living.</p>
              <p>And lastly, the environment, your body, the condition, weather, the type of taxis, the target and also most important, the mood play a critical role in your earning power, if you like some prostitue, get moody easily, end up request this cannot, request that also cannot.. then, you can hardly earn much.</p>
              <p>Therefore, go with a open mindset, a happy and relax mood, a happy driver most likely can earn better and ending the day with a happier mood. Nobody like a bad sour face driver, same like nobody like a sour face prositute</p>

              <p>Bro Bowah, the more I read your posts or reply, the more I think you are
              "bu jian dan".. Even your preference of woman also.....</p>
              <p>Even though I'm still relatively new as TD, I felt that hard work
              (discipline) is still the most important factor for TD. </p>
              <p>By working hard, I think the rest will come to you .. ie.. tactics,
              techniques and of course Luck.. which will definitely help in maximizing your
              income.</p>
              <p>But don't work too hard, have to take care of your health and spend some
              time with family..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Like all management, a TD is a management of himself, he therefore must set his objectives and purpose of driving taxis, what is your objectives and what is your purpose? Once you had determined yr objectives and purposes, you can then move in that direction and be a happy driver.</p>
              <p>However, many will said, drive taxi smlj purpose and objectives, just drive lor, it can be true, and also why people drive until fed up and keep changing here and there, like my former chief, from a hyperactive man to a hypertension man.</p>
              <p>Take for example, my objectives is to make a living out of taxi driving, and to do that, I must satisfy my paxs, as long as paxs is satisfy and fine with my driving, that is it, because when pax is satisfy, surely your driving is ok on the road, follow rules and regulation, ok with TP, ok with LTA, and finally Ok with yr company. The key word here is OK, you do not hv to do overboard and overly satisfy your paxs, just ok will do.</p>
              <p>And your purpose is therefore to serve as a public transport, help peoples to move from point A to B to C, and at the same time, to help those oldies and handicapped on the road as much as you can, and of course, to bring foods, joys and love to your family.</p>
              <p>With that in mind, you set yr journey as a TD, and everytime you met some problem, go back to the objective and purpose, and you will be more calm and cool in taking the real hardship of a TD.</p>

              <p>Take for example, my objectives is to make a living out of taxi driving, and to do that, I must satisfy my paxs, as long as paxs is satisfy and fine with my driving, that is it, because when pax is satisfy, surely your driving is ok on the road, follow rules and regulation, ok with TP, ok with LTA, and finally Ok with yr company. The key word here is OK, you do not hv to do overboard and overly satisfy your paxs, just ok will do.</p>
              <p>And your purpose is therefore to serve as a public transport, help peoples to move from point A to B to C, and at the same time, to help those oldies and handicapped on the road as much as you can, and of course, to bring foods, joys and love to your family.</p>
              <p>With that in mind, you set yr journey as a TD, and everytime you met some problem, go back to the objective and purpose, and you will be more calm and cool in taking the real hardship of a TD.</p>

              <p>I agree.  You must like to serve, then you will enjoy being a TD.  Last weekend, I took 2 maids who finished marketing with groceries in hand.  I came out to help them load the bags and unload when they reached their destination.  They don't expect TDs to do that.  Most will just press the boot open button and wait in the driver's seat.</p>
              <p>You could see the pleasant surprise on their faces and I am happy that I was able to delight them.  Even though they are maids, they are still my customers. So, everybody happy at the end.  But, that's just me.</p>
