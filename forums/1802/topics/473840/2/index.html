              <p>i think its better go by normal route, unless at times, pax knows better, wanting to save time (fare), will direct u to some shorter route.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Those pax that knows the route better, and have preferred route, will give u specific instructions or direct u as that route is proven better, in terms of traffic lights or fare savings to them.</span></strong></p>
              <p>otherwise some popular short cut route which u are familiar with like cutting thru NUS into Science Park 2, coming from Clementi Road(Bt Timah), instead of going down into the narrow P.Panjang route, best is ask pax for preference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes a 'short cut can be a wrong cut'. Try to work to your advantage.</p>

              <p>Thanks for pointer, left turn right after over head bridge right? But again like 'bowah' mention, smart will do, don't be overly smart. Try these shortcut if u need when empty or going for booking. Else if with pax, and the so called short cut is cut off by management or becomes a paid route, u will get the shit from pax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>common issue we faced with another kind of pax when asked preferred route, they say FASTEST or SHORTEST route possible.</p>
              <p>so it becomes your responsibility to decide for them. But some, along the way, will question your choice of route, u end up <strong>dumb struck, </strong>but again u can defend your choice of route by saying pax themselves didn't specify specific route, and therefore u chose based on your best knowledge...</p>
              <p>eg using NUS as example ... Pick up from Shaw Foundation ( near to Heng Mui Keng, aka P. Panjang side) heading to say Tanglin Mall.. </p>
              <p>Route preference, fastest route... (Sometimes shortest route can mean more traffic lights too), less possible road conditions beyond our control</p>
              <p>u swing to (main road) Clementi rd ASAP, then Ulu Pandan....</p>
              <p>pax will suddenly question u when u at Clementi ulu Pandan junction, when never go by buona vista to holland rd route.. Meaning pax wanted to go through the small winding route in the campus to get onto buona vista and then proceed on with the journey...</p>

              <p>Actually you do not even need to loon, just take it as a pinch of salt, and peace shall alway be with you, learn to go drive happily with a smile and come home with a smile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I alway believe most of the agony TD face day in and out is all out of anger for nothing, more or less self created.</p>
              <p>If pax pay, careless what he think he is, just like you buy nasi bryani, today become $7, you can also ask the seller, wha, so expensive ar?</p>
              <p>how much is the chicken, rice...you think the seller will get angry, no...as long as you paid that $7, he careless about you, and for TD, you can hardly meet a pax twice.</p>
              <p>And you as a pioneer shake legs former TD, you should praise bro TU0610 for his good posture and steadyness in dealing with such pax, not go and &amp;*&amp;%$$%#&amp;^%&amp;* fcuk pax, end of the day, the pax can just said, you mean I have no right to say anything about the price?? rip off can be refering taxi companies and LTA.</p>
              <p>Everyone of us want peace in TD and in fact our life, I encourage people to seek peace than war, because it is alway beautiful to be in a peace of mind, therefore, put our effort more in seeking peace, because the other side will be war and no peace. The more we pursue peace, the less we face war.</p>

              <p>You can educate a pariah class ah neh from northern india?? save the breath lah</p>
              <p>Education is not about people not educated, it is about whether they choose to apply the education learned or abuse it. And most choose the later, for eg, an education indian, much higher educated then me, should be polite and well manner due to his education background, but his education in another way had make him become a arrogant and look down on other in a way that he is alway on top.</p>
              <p>And when he abused his education on a TD, what is the end result? I dun even bother to answer him nor talk to him, just paid me the money stated on the meter, being less educated, at least, I will say thank you.</p>
              <p>If you treat me like a robot, I shall treat you like one, no feeling nor emotion involve, if you get emotionally upset or angry, you just fell into their educational abusing trap</p>
