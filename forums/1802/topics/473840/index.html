              <p>To be fair,</p>

              <p>And since it lies in our hand, including the steering wheels, it is up to us to make it a nice trip or a lousy one. The way we approach a question by pax must be in the respect of a service provider and a consumer relation.</p>
              <p>A question is not wrong, but due to self guilty conscious, TD tends to feel offended, especially so for those driving for years, to them, it is a degrading of self ego and pride. But then, take a closer look, it is just a question.</p>

              <p>Believe it or not, we TD are also doing what pax is doing, as customer to  restaurants, to clothing shop, to market shop to coffeeshop, we at time will also ask the seller,</p>
              <p>howcome this fish so salty,</p>
              <p>how come your rice no well cooked,</p>
              <p>why I ask for kopi cau, you give me kopi poh,</p>
              <p> why your shop got no XL size shirt meh?</p>
              <p>How do you think the seller will think and react, he or she will be like us, being prompted and asked on the 4Ws and 1 H questions. And all these voice down to control and calm, with control and calmness, you will be able to hold fort your position to answer.</p>

              <p>Thanks. I used this same route so as to avoid additional ERP charges using Stamford Rd. The fare was $9+. But upon reaching destination, the PRC tourist fucked me why so expensive when his other group using another taxi was much cheaper. I'm driving a Sonota. After collecting the fare, I say fuck off Ah Tiong</p>
