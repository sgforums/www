              Will Taxis be busy than usual. What kind of contribution will benefit us. Any comment about this.

              <p>If the tourist is staying around city hall, the taxi business may be hard hit.</p>

              more events mean more taxi business... whether it is PC fair, natas fair, youth olympics, F1, Aeroshow.... except those super VIP types like world bank meeting... that one retailers dont like, taxi also dont like... only government like
              
              ..... events mean more airport trips, more night safari trips, more hotel trips... 
              
              jams is unavoidable but unlikely to be very bad lah

              <p>It's night race .... so what u think the night race will affect the night drivers ?</p>
              <p>Expected closure of nicholl highway , fullerton , marina centre area ..... some park of High Court and Connaught Drive ...... it will of course affect us night drivers a bit , but again , i expect a slight increase of taxi demand during this period ..... with a bit of enthusiatic people going down to catch a glimpse of action .</p>
              <p>I expect a busy airport during this time . During the one week , people from some part of the world would want to see what's like is a night race .</p>
              <p>The media , those correspondences around the world , would want to make a comparison with us and Monaco i guess .</p>

              <p><strong>Payoff for cabbies who braved blocked roads</strong></p>

              track and more than 40,000 visitors in town, some cabbies had a bumper

              Comfort taxi driver Chia Aik
              Meng said his earnings in the last three days had increased, despite
              the extra hours spent caught in congestion caused by the roadblocks.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “The surcharge did help to
              offset my costs in fuel and jams. I mainly picked up passengers from
              Raffles City and the Pan Pacific (hotel). There were a lot more
              tourists in town, so I just went around to these hotels and picked up
              passengers,” he told Today.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              CityCab taxi driver Yeo Teng
              Teck said his earnings rose a little, but not as much as he had hoped,
              no thanks to the road closures along Beach Road. He had better luck
              picking up passengers on Orchard Road.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But others, likeCityCab taxi driver Mimi Miskiah Solihin, 59, complained that her takings had dropped 20 per cent.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “I was stuck in a jam on Nicoll
              Highway on the first day for one hour. I thought it would be better the
              next few days, but there were a lot of roadblocks. So I would only go
              in if there was a booking,” she said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Other taxi drivers, too, prefered to cruise in the suburbs and avoid downtown altogether.

              SMRT cabbie Leow Lian Chong,
              however, said the traffic situation was not that bad; he had driven to
              Suntec City a few times. He said: “This is Singapore’s first Grand
              Prix, it is worth the little inconvenience.” - TODAYonline<br><p></p>

              hope that next F1, there will be better traffic mgmt.
              
              i think suntec 'taxi only' system is best for commuters and of course taxi...
              
              and i think given the massive taxi demand at dismissal time, taxi surcharge should be $10... and from 1 hour b4 dismissal to 3 hours after dismissal. 
              
              Why? cos i saw many pax q before dismissal and no taxi...
              
              and after dismissal, the crowd cant be cleared within 1.5 hours... without the $5 surcharge, no incentive at all to go back F1 area given the jam...
              
              even those tourists at non F1 taxi stand willing to pay the $5 surcharge... what $5? give you $10 and take me first lah...haha... 
              
              even local hijacked my taxi b4 i reach the taxi stand... helo pick up here also charge u $5 u know?... ok no problem... sick of q with the other 200 pax liao.... just go... haha

              the many pax only good to see only... must gain experience and then avoid the jam next time... also depend on destination... if go fort road, huat liao... if go say houg and dont take KPE... wau lan eh...jam all the way from suntec until serangoon

              <p>On Sun nite, we managed to hope into a free shuttle bus at Nicol H'way and it took us to Bugis, saving us a bit of walking distance to our cars which were parked at Sungei Road. We did not even know about the free bus until we were ushered up the bus by volunteers.</p>
