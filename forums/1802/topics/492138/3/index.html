              Aiyo yantao, not everything is base on karma and suay Chee one, most of the time, is base on your thinking, and all men got 2 heads and 2 brains, if you use the wrong one to think, it still can work, but mostly end up in Holland Drive.
              
              Now you know why women are problematic, cost they only got one head and one brain..most of their energy goes into their boobs, that is why people use to say, big boobs no brain...same like men, tua ki, bo brain.
              
              As for karma or ah ma, that one very complicated lah, so people like to take it simply by saying..karma karma karma...but actually many do not understand or perfectly understand it, so..by and large, as time goes by, it become a layman term to curse others and to warn others

              <p>Updates. After 1 over month of being on private apps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now earning more than previously driving taxi with lesser hours clocked on the road. Which I meant serious and really driving on the road. More time to relax and do other things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Uber I bring back more than 1K a week with incentives. Very relax kind of driving. Just need to understand their system, study the map and analyze the timetable given for guaranteed hours. Total hours clocked for real driving only about 25 a week. Aim short unlike taxi you aim long unless in CBD. Many ways to play. The rest is spent time waiting to clock in time or relaxing, drinking coffee, reading a book, surfing net in the car etc. Uber is about driving smart and not long. Make full use of the system in place. Just drive minimum to clock the trips and disappear somewhere isolated to clock in the time online for incentive payout. Very good. Better than driving taxi around like a headless chicken as if no pax = no fare. Apps you wait also get money and many private relax jobs for aka limo service whom book you on personal basis. Best.</p>

              <p>Drive pirates can earn lah. But dunno how long it will last. As long as one side toh the other side incentives will cut. So in the long run taxi stills more stable. I dun understand why TD kpkb there is a drop in income? I dun face this problem be it weekdays or weekends. Anyway I think what kind of drivers uber and LCR are those part timers. Those who needs a car and have a full time job. Imagine by driving just 2 hours after work you can easier cover most of the rental. Says you lose $30 a day in rental, one month $900. You get a brand new car with all the taxes and insurances and maintainence taken care of. Consider this amount of money can't get you a car nowadays so why not? And those into properties and insurance sales it suits them well.</p>
              <p>But seriously to earn a living it is rather difficult. Although cost is low for the rental. But the levies and fuel cost are high. So the more you drive the lesser you will get because the high levies and fuel cost already negate your takings but for taxis the more you drive the collections you get which you dun have to pay levies and diesel cost is cheap. So very easy to cover the rentals for pirates but can't earn big money.</p>

              those part timers. Those who needs a car and have a full time job.
              Imagine by driving just 2 hours after work you can easier cover
              most of the rental. Says you lose $30 a day in rental, one month
              $900. </p>

              <p>Updates. After 1 over month of being on private apps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now earning more than previously driving taxi with lesser hours
              clocked on the road. Which I meant serious and really driving on
              the road. More time to relax and do other things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Uber I bring back more than 1K a week with incentives. Very
              relax kind of driving. Just need to understand their system, study
              the map and analyze the timetable given for guaranteed hours. Total
              hours clocked for real driving only about 25 a week. Aim short
              unlike taxi you aim long unless in CBD. Many ways to play. The rest
              is spent time waiting to clock in time or relaxing, drinking
              coffee, reading a book, surfing net in the car etc. Uber is about
              driving smart and not long. Make full use of the system in place.
              Just drive minimum to clock the trips and disappear somewhere
              isolated to clock in the time online for incentive payout. Very
              good. Better than driving taxi around like a headless chicken as if
              no pax = no fare. Apps you wait also get money and many private
              relax jobs for aka limo service whom book you on personal basis.
              Best.</p>

              Big cannon fairy train from his days of driving taxi....haha
              Uber driver when driving for incentives means guaranteed hourly rate. Uber will pay the shortfall in earnings if you meet the requirements stated by uber in the peak (incentived) hours. 
              
              The peak incentived hours are definitely more than 25 hours. 
              
              Experienced uber driver driving only the uber guaranteed hours can expect to take back $600 to $650 nett a week. Guaranteed hourly rate from uber could be $30 to $35 per hour. Therefore monthly nett income could be $2400. Aldo long hours. Fri sat n sun burned one hor..those uber drivers whom claim to take back nett 4 to 5k is true. They work non peak hours as well as guaranteed rates hours. Probably driving 16 to 18 hours a day just like omo td.
