              <p>Feels great. Today went to throw key. Before me got 10+ wanna throw also. Okay, lets throw together. Many relief dont wanna drive already. Many people including me OMO till wanna jump down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After throwing, went to Uber and got a brand new Honda Vezel at $74 a day. No brainer. Rental rebate $40 a week for 3 months to let you get custom to it. Deposit $500 only. Contract 5 weeks. Anytime you want to return just a week notice. Free $450 cash upon taking first job. Brand new car 2016 COE registered at $74 a day vs $134 for street hailing really no brainer. Yes at 20% fare commission but the car no roof and all the taxi crap is enough for me. Just hit incentive. Never gonna touch a bloody taxi again.</p>

              <p>Hammer bro. Its very simple. I choose LCR because they have brand new cars. They bought over 2000 COE over 1 session. Secondly, contract only 5 weeks. Not happy or dont wanna do just return or change car to Veilfire to Sienta for different segment market. No lock down. Thirdly, they give me free $450 cash for signing up and $40 rental rebate per week till September for on job learning. No loss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only thing is that excess quite alot. 2K+. But at least no need rush like crazy and got cancellation fee. If you want you can do Grab also but Grab dont give incentives to cars from LCR.</p>
              <p>Bloody taxi coy are bloodsuckers.</p>

              hope after 3 months u come n tell us wat is the outcome.
              
              u may expect lot of calls but the fares are dirt cheap.
                  
                  be prepared to spend yr time to beg for incentives.

              <p>I already tasted driving taxi OMO for a year. Conclusion. I didn't make much money during that 1 year. Total 2 accidents due to rushing. Paid up over 5k access. My rental was $134  per day and now $131 before i return. Petrol for 1 shift i pump $40 as mine was a hybrid. I was hitting $400-$500 fares daily for the first 3 months, full of energy and hope then i lose steam. The next 5 months around $350 in fares daily i stop. The last 4 months just weekdays $250 i stop, weekends do $400. Totally burned out. The taxi business during this 1 year really changed alot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take note i am not married, no children, know the roads well and staying in town. I drive at least 15 hours a day and no off days no relief but still, i decided to give up taxi driving. Can you do so better then me? Good luck to you. I tasted the worst. Nothing would be more bitter than this.</p>

              <p>If you decided on transportation for a living, there are only a few good choices. First i would rather use a real taxi and be a relief. Madcab made an emotional decision out of anger. I can only wish him joy and happiness with uber.</p>
              <p>The next step if u want to earn more is to switch to a toyota hiace commuter (low roof version so u can go inside hdb mscp). Dont go casino. Save up for that minibus downpayment.</p>
              <p>Alternatively u can become a professional chauffeur for a wealthy CEO. Depends on luck but at least u get around $3k and only need to serve him and his family. Popular bookstore CEO, billionaire Peter Lim, and a chinese filmmaker based in st regis are all served by local malays and a local chinese chauffeur.</p>
              <p>The third and last step is to secure 4 corporate accounts delivering 'bread'. Each account to send 8 pax to work and then home. With the first 4 account jobs, u can then hire a driver for $1.2k and get him to deliver your bread slices. Then u start looking for one more used toyota or nissan van and secure more corporate jobs.</p>
              <p>This is the correct way to progress your driving career, if u aspire to earn more doing less.</p>
              <p>Uber and Grab is a step in the wrong direction. The faster you u-turn, the better.</p>
              <p>The above progression does not suit everyone. So some of you will simply have to drive until a heart attack sends u to a better place.</p>

              Cdg sonata still gives the best value. 
              After midnight still can queue taxi stand, street pickup.
              Rental 50 to 55...no 20% comm.
              Going for uber or grab car might not be a wise decision.
              74 per day rental plus petrol could be 110.
              Imagine fare 200 per day, 20% comm is 40.
              Net profit per day 200-110-40=50.
              Taxi net profit 200-54-20=126.
              You still need to slog hard and hoped every press can get a job.
              Pte car rental I believe is for those who wants to own a car and cannot afford. They use uber and grab car to supplement car ownership. 
              A lot of Malays aspire to own car to fetch family around and I see a lot of malays driving for uber n grab.

              <p>Cannot like that count 1 la. First, it is a bloody taxi. With a bloody roof. Secondly, i need a car to use.</p>
              <p>Rather then pay half shift for that bloody taxi, i rather take a private hire whole for myself to use. You forgot to include the incentives. If you drive morning and evening peak and super Saturday, you would get the incentives. Anyway, all taxi companies are blood suckers. Firstly, i get a brand new private car to use, i already win. The mood driving a private car without the roof and brand new totally beats driving a taxi for half the shift or even worse, whole shift. You think now easy to find a hirer to suit you? All taxi drivers are nuts. Hence that time i went to be hirer instead. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway when i was driving taxi, i seldom pick up street hailers also during morning and evening peak. All on call. Or maybe after after 11pm no choice already.</p>
              <p>Talk is cheap la. My mood is more important than money. Everytime i sit inside a taxi my mood all gone. Simple.</p>

At first my bro in law interested to do part time driving cab on Sunday. Now he change his mind, going to try GU, haha.....Seems like everyone is jumping on the bandwagon to become GU drivers n also more n more riders also. Yesterday Saturday n today was especially quiet on the road for us cab drivers.</p></div>

              <p>Initially about 6% of taxi drivers switched over to Uber.   Heard a lot came back to drive taxi after they reduced the incentives.</p>
