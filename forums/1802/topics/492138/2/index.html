              <p>Money making my foot. For the taxi companies, yes. Tell yourself la, how much money can you make from driving taxi? The pay is stagnant. 7K 8K a month? Ya. You drive for 18 hours a day, 7 days a week okay? You can take it anot. For how long? Nonsense man. Most taxi drivers are well known cock talkers. I drive for 1 year because i wanna know when the cock will stop. It seriously stopped because really no mood for anything else. And BTW i have degree and masters. These taxi drivers if they dont drive taxi or Uber the very most they can go be toilet cleaners or dishwashers.</p>

              <p>There is a comfort cabby with more than 60 land title deeds and properties, including GCBs (good class bungalow). He also got degree and was retrenched years ago. He is doing well as a cabby, making around $10K or more no joke. He can dont work one. But choose to be cabby and refused to support GU or PH car.</p>
              <p>Uncle me can clock $2K after costs in 4 straight days and then relax one corner. Dont ask what i do for a living. I was also a cabby.</p>
              <p>What we have in common is self control. Dont anyhow emo. Stay low profile and anonymous. Dress normal. Wear normal. Dont provoke people and restrain yourself when pissed off.</p>

              <p>Dont be too quick to write off taxis. GU and PH fulfill a segment of the market with different needs, such as yourself. There are people who will swear by uber, and those who only want a taxi. I have witnessed a family who booked a grabcar, later a nissan sunny showed up and the angry mother asked WTF did her son book a private car. I was not a cabby but saw it while inside a condo. The driver was asked to leave empty.</p>
              <p>Transportation needs are very diverse. Some can only afford to walk or ebike or cycle. Some use cabs, some bus around. Some prefer to own a car. For this crowd, some are willing to become GU driver for various reasons - its not always about money although its common. Some of the more well to do wont even think about GU - the income is just too little. Others are too busy to even bother with GU. Then there are those who are chauffeured around. So the way i see it, taxi polulation may decrease, but it wont go away. I mean look at the trishaw. Until today still have.</p>
              <p>Life is characterized by diversity. There is no such thing as one size fits all. What is beautiful to you can be either plain looking or scary to others. Everyone got different brains and there is not a single type of job or hobby or career that will suit all.</p>

              <p>Even a "low educated and manual labourer" taxi driver can tell that the 7K a month is unrealistic, what more, you a highly educated person.</p>
              <p>If you had chosen to believe that $7K story and jumped into the trade when everyone else was dismissing it in the social media, then you have only yourself to blame for being gullible, naive and not doing your homework well.  Why blame taxi drivers?</p>
              <p>It was your own decision then. Now you have switched to Uber and there are many stories about Uber and Grab.  So, next time you fail to make it as Uber/Grab driver, are you going to label and condemn all Uber/Grab drivers as well?</p>
