              <p>I wonder if some have heard this song, 'Never Gonna Give You Up' by Rick Astley</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</p>
              <p>This was a popular song in the late 80s. Lately it's been used in 'rick-rolling' to troll and tease people on youtube. And I do think this song is just perfect for the forum 3426 and its' owner.</p>
              <p>Remember when their chief left in a huff and puff after locking every thread because he wanted to abandon the site and let it rot? And his declaration never to return and also similar promises by his 'loyal followers'? In fact according to my sources X &amp; Y, he even declared that all he wanted is to be left alone, he will never bother with sgforums and we should not bother him in return. Fair deal right?</p>
              <p>Hahaha but it seems all that is just a mere smokescreen, to make himself look good. In fact he's been coming here very regularly under his 'clone account' (yes we know which 1). And under his old owner account, he's been deleting threads in 3426 especially those that make him look bad. Those that praise him are of course maintained at the top!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Case in point? It seems 1 donkey posted a gay message in both here and 3426 last night. The one here remains while the one there has 'magically disappeared'. Only the owner (or of course the forum admin) can delete a thread, a mod like his 'fake RSM' can only lock and edit. Fireice definitely did not delete that thread, and that leaves only 1 other person - yes, the one and only chief, the Rear Admiral. The 1 who mati mati says he'll never return or bother, yet he's still so in love with his 3426! Like the song says - Never gonna give you up! </p>
              <p>I thought he got his own forum, was making money because here all his effort he gets nothing. Own forum got own sponsor, plus got own rules and full power, so why must still come back here after declaring it's over? Pitiful la.</p>
              <p>I dont know why some people make the forums such a big issue in their lives. I dont even think kids take it so seriously. Thats why its called virtual world - got a big difference from real world! But this strange ppl take it so real life like. Forum only what, come post, have fun, tcss a bit, share a bit and then FO la. Grown up already, online arguments are just that online, take and go or ignore, No need to become super sensitive and go on an ego trip. Tsk tsk tsk.</p>

              <p>Aiyah if really wanna return, return lor. Nobody said cannot, only you self declare. Now that you have definitely been busy here still, if wanna restart, nothing wrong. No need to say anything also, no need to apologise and hurt your ego. Post normally, edit normally use your powers sparingly, nobody will begrudge you. I promise not to attack again, if you can keep to that. If want me to apologise also no big deal for me.</p>
              <p>But dont say 1 thing and do another, and then cry foul. I also never bother with your forum. Your private club is yours to run, nothing public about it and even if so, I doubt I would ever be keen to join.</p>
              <p>Anyway whatever la, if it rocks your boat to come here and exercise your mod powers, go right ahead. If it's fun to continue using your clone account to post in 1802, by all means.</p>
              <p>Ok back to work. See you around here eh?</p>
