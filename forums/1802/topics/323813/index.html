              <p>hi all..</p>
              <p>are there any cabbies staying near to hill view that are interested in doin some regular morning business?</p>
              <p>My friend is interested in 'engaging' a taxi to fetch her to work every morning.. Basically she stays at Hill View and she needs to be at CBD between 8 to 8.30am from Monday to Friday.</p>
              <p>So she was thinking if there are any taxis that are interested in this offer. As she will be taking the cab on a daily basis, she is thinking of being charged on a fixed rate (she can't claim her cabfare) but she is willing to pay something that is a win win situation between the driver and her.</p>
              <p>Please pm me if you are interested in the offer.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: The reason why I am doing this is cause she is not too familiar with the internet forum and she is a very close friend of mine.</p>

              just my opinion... i will not take it up cos in the morning peak, taxi demand is high... in fact i lose out on call booking plus need to adhere to the timing restriction... 
              
              i will only consider private arrangement if it satisfies any one below:
              - 2 ways
              - not going to town
              - not 6am to 930am
              - extra $3
              
              maybe kin can comment since he drive day shift
              
              anyway, good luck to your search...

At least for 30-45 mins prior to picking your friend up, don't dare to pickup any other pax. if kena one go changi or even town area, no way can make the round trip in 45 mins unless you fly, especially during 8+ am. On a good day can make $40+ per hour during morning peak if the connections are good. Hillview area lots of bookings &amp; street hire in the mornings after 8. Unless the cabbie lives in Bkt Batok AND starts driving around 8am. This type of uncle don't really need the $$ then, cos morning peak earnings can cover rental + diesel + small amount of profit.</p></div>

                  Yes Guru... Kin is on Early Bird shift, wait up at 4.30am in the morning ready to take over from my night shift buddy at 5am cause our taxi no season parking.
                  
                  From 5am to 6am there is midnight charge the first slot with 50% surchrage.
                  From 7.00am to 9.30am the second slot 35% surcharge.
                  
                  The above two slots is the most important, that is the golden time income. Rental and diesel all can cover from this three an the half hours if the run is good.
                  
                  From 8am to 8.30am this slot your taxi at any place at any location paxs are plenty on road or you may bombarded by plenty jobs offer on you MDT.  
                  
                  So my opinion to this kind of offer like a private contact fixed rate 8am to 8.30am to CBD one way, it a bit difficult but you may try the chances is slim i should say.
                  
                  If my taxi is at Bukit Timah road along this road before reaching Hillview. I can tell you sure kenna hijack along this route, cause many condos and private estates along this journey my experience.

              <p>i see, didnt noe that this is consider as not a win-win situation, cos i tot it's at least a fixed income for alot of drivers.</p>
              <p>i guess it's a total different situation then what i initially perceived.. </p>
              <p>cos i tot i always see alot of empty cabs driving ard my hse area and so i presume business is bad and with the rantings on papers about cab drivers finding it tough to get business..</p>
              <p>well, shall let my fren noe about the actual scenario and see if she has other alternatives bah.</p>
              <p>thanks all for responding though..</p>
