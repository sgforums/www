              <p>A FORMER taxi driver whose vehicle was sandwiched in a six-car
              collision along the Central Expressway over two years ago has sued the
              drivers of the three cars behind him for compensation.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang Kim Seng, now 51, injured his neck in the November 2006
              crash which left him a tetraplegic - his four limbs are paralysed -
              with no hope of recovery.</p>
              <p>A trial to decide whether the three drivers are liable to pay him damages started in the High Court yesterday.</p>
              <p>It is understood he is seeking compensation of about $800,000
              to $900,000, although the present hearing does not deal with quantum.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang's taxi was the third in the six-car collision along the CTE near the Moulmein exit on Nov 17, 2006.</p>
              <p>In his lawsuit, Mr Ang has alleged negligence, claiming that
              the three drivers were responsible for his injuries as they caused rear
              collisions to his taxi.</p>
              <p>But the defendants, each represented by a different lawyer,
              deny they were negligent. They allege that Mr Ang was hurt when he
              crashed into the car in front of him even before he was rear-ended.</p>
              <p>A gaunt-looking Mr Ang attended court yesterday strapped to a
              stretcher trolley, accompanied by two family members and a maid.</p>

              <p>paralysed ? Then must sue ...... must sue if even 50-50 chance .</p>
              <p>By Singapore's law , the vehicle that hit his cab directly , will bear all cost , nothing to fight on !</p>
              <p>No matter how many cars behind .</p>
              <p>Then it's another law suit if sued vehicle want to sue that vehicle behind again ...</p>
              <p>Lost of income accordingly to his tax report . Until 55 years old i think ....</p>
              <p>$600,000 should not be a problem for the insurance company .</p>
