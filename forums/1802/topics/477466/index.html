              Victoria Barker | MyPaper | Tuesday, Dec 3, 2013
              
              Fed up of not being able to get a taxi, even by calling the various booking hotlines?
              
              A feature launched by taxi-booking app GrabTaxi yesterday aims to give the passenger more control - by giving him the option of offering an extra sum of money, or reward, to the taxi driver he books.
              
              This will give drivers more incentive to pick him up, creating a "free market" for taxi bookings, "determined by the urgency of the passenger to get a taxi and the driver's availability", the start-up said in a statement.
              
              The passenger decides whether to give a reward and, if so, how much. GrabTaxi does not collect booking fees from passengers and its spokesman said it is still "working out" its revenue model.
              
              For now, it is paying taxi drivers an undisclosed sum for every passenger picked up via the app, so as to entice more cabbies to join its network.
              
              GrabTaxi was first launched in October as a regular taxi-booking app. Founder Anthony Tan declined to reveal the number of drivers registered with the company.
              
              Mr Tan told MyPaper he introduced the reward feature because he realised that "passengers are required to pay a booking fee when booking a taxi using other means, taking the decision to pay this amount out of their hands".
              
              "What we want is to allow a passenger to dictate when he wants to pay more for a cab...or save on his booking fee if there's a willing driver who wants to take the job."
              
              Public-relations manager Vernia Lim, 27, welcomed the idea of a reward system. She often has trouble getting a cab in the Central Business District, especially during peak hours and on rainy days.
              
              "If it will give me a better chance of getting a cab or even guarantee it...I don't think money is an issue," she said.

            <div class='col-md body'>
              SINGAPORE â€” Third-party taxi booking apps, which have become hugely popular among commuters and cabbies in neighbouring countries including Malaysia, are making their way to the Republic.
              
              And at least one major taxi operator here is feeling uneasy about it, and has instructed its drivers not to use an app that could potentially allow cabbies to bypass their companiesâ€™ dispatch system and pocket the full booking fee.
              
              For now, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has no issues with third-party booking apps â€” recognising the widespread use of smartphones â€” but it made clear that taxi drivers using these apps cannot collect fares which exceed what their companies have set.
              
              While it is too early to say whether such apps will take off here â€” and even help alleviate the perennial taxi crunch by better matching demand and supply â€” transport experts pointed out that unlike other countries, where taxi licences can be issued to individuals and not to corporations, taxi drivers here are beholden to their companies.
              
              Last month, Malaysia company MyTeksi launched a beta of the Singapore version of its taxi booking app called GrabTaxi, following the firmâ€™s successful forays into Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.
              
              Mr Aaron Gill, GrabTaxiâ€™s Regional Head of Product, said the MyTeksi app in Malaysia â€” which charges a flat RM2 (S$0.80) booking fee for each trip that goes directly to taxi drivers â€” receives one booking every five seconds. He declined to reveal the number of drivers across the Causeway who have signed up to use the app, which was launched about 17 months ago.
              
              Nevertheless, a report in June by United States technology news website TechCrunch put the figure at about 2,500. MyTeksiâ€™s success has since led to rival apps entering the market in Malaysia.
              
              Mr Gill said drivers can sign up for GrabTaxi as part of a free trial, and consumers do not have to pay a booking fee, although this may be introduced in the future. On the take-up so far, he said there was â€œvery limited data to share at this momentâ€�.
              
              TransCab General Manager Jasmine Tan said that as soon as the company got wind of the app, it notified all its drivers not to use it. She said TransCab â€” the second-largest cab operator here â€” was concerned that passengers might complain to the LTA about booking fees set by its taxi drivers. The operator could also be penalised by the LTA under the Quality of Service (QoS) framework if its drivers are not responsive to its dispatch system, she said. Ms Tan added that TransCab will work with GrabTaxi if the app is integrated with its dispatch system.
              
              The LTA said it will continue to monitor the situation and will make adjustments to its QoS framework where necessary
              
              Major taxi operators here charge a booking fee of S$3.30 during peak periods and S$2.30 for the rest of the day. About 30 cents to 50 cents of each booking fee goes to the operators.
              
              Out of seven taxi drivers TODAY spoke to, two said they are using GrabTaxi, while the others have not heard of it. One of the users, Mr Tan Chun Seng, 58, said he wanted to expand his booking base. The other drivers said they were not keen to use the app as they were not tech savvy.
              
              Transport experts noted that, in time to come, third-party booking apps could be hard to regulate. The LTA must exercise some control over the pricing, â€œotherwise market forces will dictateâ€� and lead to overcharging, said National University of Singapore transport economist Anthony Chin.
              
              GrabTaxi said it is in discussions with taxi operators to work out an arrangement that the latter will be happy with. ComfortDelGro, which owns the largest fleet of taxis here, said it will â€œdefinitely considerâ€� working with third-party booking apps, which will bring in more jobs for its drivers.
              
              The beta launch of GrabTaxi came a month after the MoobiTaxi app was made available for download. Unlike GrabTaxi, MoobiTaxi â€” which became one of the top five apps on iTunes within a week of its launch â€” integrates its booking system with those of taxi operatorsâ€™.
              
              It is understood that another third-party booking app, Easy Taxi â€” launched earlier this year in Malaysia â€” will also enter the market here by the end of the month.
