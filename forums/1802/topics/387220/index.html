              <p>what about this  the same taxi driver, he is telling us, the next few day. he forgotten what he had said to us before, the above.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yeah , many cabbies believe in luck , not many . I am one of those peope who never believe in luck .</p>
              <p>Like what my the other taxi friend said to me a few years back , an experience one , only some good drivers don't need luck .</p>
              <p>We are on night shifts .... maybe night shifts don't require much luck , it's your " shi-li " ( strength ) that counts .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so never believe what taxi driver talks, sometime this sometime that, contradict comments.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This  night taxi driver again,  the frustration on word, see very upset...right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> that why? ...he said before.. his teaching....Strength as in mental strength , to fight the war upfront , or to give up and go home sleep ? Taxi drivers are all fighters .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> So where is the strengh.. "shi" "li". round here round there whole island ... that is night shift...no mean no...it's Luck..lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are on night shifts , again he said.... maybe night shifts don't require much luck , it's your " shi-li " ( strength ) that counts .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So which is which?  confused???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the reason why? i am highlighting all this points. cause this are all the good points what actually this experience night shift taxi drive is facing every night. So don't believe what the market is telling us, night shift collection is more and very easy as abc.</p>

              <p>Hardwork &gt; Experience &gt; Luck ...</p>
              <p>in % ...70% hardwork , 20% experience , 10 luck . according to one very experience taxi driver said that in my previous thread. So basically this  is  what all about night shift drivers during the night. This three in one a must...than that is power. Some are going back as mentioned as early as 12.am home sweet home, some are heading back cause no luck, some are fighters as say taxi fighter and also heading back cause no enemies plying around ther streets (pax) so what to do...empty cab back home. So night taxi is not easy at all...right.</p>

              <p>Hardwork 50%<br><br>Discipline 25% <br><br>Strategy 20% <br><br>Luck 5% <br><br>I am not a lucky cabby . <br><br>I am a consistent cabby , no choice , must work hard .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saw this again, now this  night cabby is talking another different percentage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually very uncertain with his talks. so night shift really so hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just a general discussion. why? is that so... sometime luck, sometime hardwork, sometime stategy, sometime discipline, sometime experience. than why? somedays going empty as early as 12am without trying all those above ...that can enhanced your night taxi driving with good result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i think night shift, really not easy at all.</p>

              <p>Now something about dayshift.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most taxi drivers can say in the coffeeshop and anywhere like the washingbay or where places which they gather 2 to 3... 4 to 5. Most of the subjects that brought up... especiall collection and the good result on their outing,     all  are blowing as they like...... like trumpet and saxophone, are this not blowing instruments. only the bastanders their ears...probelm on listening whether that is the right note they are blowing according to the tempo.</p>
              <p>If like as today peak hours raining, everywhere traffic jam accidents, most major highways are in trouble... cars cars everywhere, so for those two and the half hours, how many long and short journeys can you do. So even a super driver as mention, show me for this two and the half hours, what will be your collection. We are dayshift drivers, what the condition and how super you are (got dragon got tiger in hokkien)...all are arranged but your luck's of the day, like last tuesday... me picked one pax  in the morining as started at 7.00am at buangkok green one lady pax, heading to tuas ave 8, long super long peak hours, can this say that i am experience, she is just waiting there only my luck and coincident at the right time on this way toward her, i picked her.Just in Time should say, if my luck not favour me another cab infront of me may picked her and go...right. So from here to KPE&gt;ECP&gt;AYE...total trip $41.20  comfort cabcharge customer. but you know this trip take me nearly an hours to do...traffic jam near Normanton accident.</p>
              <p>Than after completed at Tuas Ave 8 what will you do...our friend said strategy, experience, knowledge, hardwork , persistent , and consistency. Aiya bullshit, just simply wait for your luck is you are with comfort n city, Calls..if not the nearest to old jurong road than to Jurong West housing estates, or Jurong point , Pioneer MRT, Joo Koon MRT, so this are basic dayshift driver are doing if you are in that area. What super Taxi driver... me also can hit that kind of target but not everyday are like today. I think he also do as like me...if he is at that destination after completed his job at tuas...8am ...  ya. this are potential hotspot, or may he may like Boon Lay...further i don't think so only one and the half hour left on peak hours slot.</p>
              <p>Seeing is Believeing...but that can never be the only one example, for those 26 days if evreyday $200. there will be plenty for peoples queing the taxi office everyday, this is SG ....if that is so good  peoples will   sleep at in the Q at night, chop chop for a space.... as peoples are doing, like those peoples queing for property, warehouse sales, and even hello kitty those incident. hehe. More than $5000 a month why? are you still waiting for.</p>
