              <p>I also had the phobia of taking calls,adv booking,ang mo paxs,cbd areas,scared until I only play around my area when I started,can u believe? lol</p>
              <p>Sometimes kena fxxk for taking wrong route or turn also gd bcoz after tat u won't forget the place liao,easy for u next time lol</p>
              <p>Adv booking got advantage bcoz u get to know the destination n can plan ahead,check here there then ready liao,same direction standard one so shouldn't be a prob,like airport trip.</p>
              <p>Adv booking best is start as 1st or last trip if not pain in the ass bcoz u cannot sweep anyhow scared held up at wrong place or stuck in jam.</p>
              <p>For calls play slowly la if no confident but better to learn fast,sometimes a call at a ulu place or on a obk day might help abit.i never use GPS until today just ckeck street maps on hp if not sure.</p>

              <p>Why general public perceive TD is a job for uncles and older people.</p>
              <p>TD in their early 30s seems surprised to many... and feel people at this age should be doing something better</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Because general for past decades since taxi driving restructured to rental rather than ownership, and also due to enconomy booming, many opts to work rather than rent, slave and drive for company with pathetic return, and more importantly,</p>
              <p>Formely, the retirement age was 50yo to 55yo, so many after retired, still can stand and drive taxis, and that makes many retirees drive taxis and peoples on the street will deem it is for retirees of 50 and above, and that is also how the Term "Uncle" come about, even you are 30yo and drive taxi, people at 70yo will call you Uncle, but do not think that you look older, more of a term used.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, people concept on TD is alway a tiring and least progression job, tho with cold hard cash, but no other benefit or any 16% contribution of CPF, bonuses and medisave from company, therefore, in a long run, you will find yourself stagnated or unable to buy certain houses, good bonds and shares, and may age faster than some good job. These are their assumption and you cannot blame them. Take it as a good will, you can take it or leave it.</p>
              <p>But ultimatum the decision still lies in you, for me and most like my bro CT or foolsh, we are in our twilight years, meaning near 60yo, we drive because the society is no more favourable to us, and also not much chance to see chio bu beside driving taxi,  who can seat beside you with half ball..lols.</p>
              <p>What you, at a tender age where taxi driving is concern, must do some soul searching and truly ask yourself, are you happy with what you are doing? are you saving enough for the future? are you able to take the stress of seeing your friends/buddies/relatives in other trades get promoted higher and higher and you are still a TD after 10 to 20 years? If these few question is a Yes, then drive on.</p>

              <p>Well no taxi driving for me for the present time. It's good to sit behind desk again and pour through reports. Plus got transport claim and bonus. Next month already got 1/4 month bonus, so I guess it's not bad.Not to mention medical benefit and cpf contribution.</p>
              <p>Anyway while taxi driving may not be a respected job it's a vital job just like bus driving. Why you think the Govt has so many rules for tds? Why the phasing out of yellow top? Why then the crackdown those days on pirate taxis? Why got such things like NTA, CTOA etc etc? Just look at other countries where taxis are not regulates, take Malaysia for an example or Thailand?</p>
              <p>You see once you dont regulate, you will get a lot of 'funny activities' amd who loses out? Tourists get fleeced, pax get cheated even robbed and then worse still tds come under control of crminal elements. Taxi drivers form their own cartel, charge their own rates and decide whom they wanna to pick at what price.</p>
              <p>That's why the Govt keeps a close tab on tds here. Once you start forming groups on your own especially with strangers by advertsing on the net and running your 'own academy' you are posing a direct challenge to the rules laid down. In other words you are showing a middle finger to the Govt and saying ' Fark your rules, we'll do what we think is best'. It's 1 thing to form a small grouping with friends in order to get more business and serve the public better. But once you start asking strangers whom you do not know to meet and join your group or circle, you're simply asking for trouble.</p>
              <p>It's 1 thing to join licensed groupings like TJ, LV etc or even semi-official ones like Limo groups, which is well known and follow the industry standard, but if you want to form something extra and under the radar, then when the shit hits you or your members, you only got yourselves to blame.</p>
              <p>Right or wrong, fair or unfair, like it or hate it, curse and swear don't need to ask me or tell me.The rules are clear, you choose to ignore or defy at your own peril.</p>

              <p>Yalor, it is all a matter of control, as said, be understanding, man are not born civilise, we are born nake with animal instinct, until education, rules and regulations start to civilise us, therefore, as certain occasion, like animal, we all got herding mentality, it just take a self proclaim chief and a few follower, they will start to think that the world is under them..lols.</p>
              <p>And that is also why secret society had been diminishing, due to education, rules and laws, it had taken us to a different kind of barbaric act like sex for grades, sex for business, sex for contract, these are all modern developed human crimes. So those who think about grouping and doing the gangsterism kind of stuff, please forget it.</p>
              <p>It is not use wasting yr effort in cursing, argueing or swearing in forum, the basic is that most of us understand what they are trying to achieve, which is naive + out of fashion, that will do.</p>
              <p>As you in yr ripe age begin another working journey in life, we wish you all the best and enjoy working under the boss, but if you are to return to taxis driving, you are alway welcome, except for me, see one time, whack you one time..lols</p>
