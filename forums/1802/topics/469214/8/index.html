              <p>No, to me forum is just like a place you say before, a notice board or in Army we call it RO(Routine Order).......</p>
              <p>Never in my right mind will want to run a taxi forum, many of course will have that ridicular thinking that, by creating all this saga, will benefit to me in future, I can only say LJ la......</p>
              <p>Recently with all the dramatic performance by chief Poolie, many question been hanging around many days, why like that?.......</p>
              <p>I receive a pm that tell the whole story, a confess by chief Poolie.....</p>

              <p>As for pool, I can only said one thing that happen to all of us once in a lifetime, no matter you are rich, poor, thin or fat.</p>
              <p>He is going thru a mid life crisis, where life had arrived into a few cross roads for him to choose, and when he looks back on his past life, he felt very let down and take it as a failure, for he cannot even hold his forum, so to speak.</p>
              <p>As bravery and as a fighter he alway is, he is drained and can be in desperation for help but yet, those atas egos and prides cannot be compromised, therefore, in a state of depression and mid life, he find it very difficult to carry on. Well, he can alway contact me if needed.</p>
              <p>As for pressure and stress, he is still very juvenile to it, and that is why he will throw all thing out of the picture once he cannot handle it. Out of cdg, out of his forum and out of Singapore, but that is not the solution in life, in life, you have to face it hard on, but because of his mentality and again ego, he cannot accept failure or a step back in life.</p>
              <p>For me, he needs to change, and we should help and support him, as I said earlier, friends is easy to make, but to make enemy to become friends again, that will be our best friends.</p>

              <p>Bowah you wasting your time lah. You think he will listen to you? He don't even respect you. Basically he ignore you or delete your posts that highlight his faults.</p>
              <p>You think he will change because you say so?</p>
              <p>I use to think he was just a cyber warrior like so many i've seen, but after being contacted, I'm not so sure anymore.</p>
              <p>I cannot fully say he is a bad or crooked person, or a wolf in sheep's clothing as my dealings all all online. But others who know him better have said some things, that cause me to think also.</p>
              <p>Still I have no real care abt him, I just listen advise and move on with my life. If he really did what I've been told then he surely will get it back in some form. People here like to say karma. I don't really believe in karma, but I do believe in justice. Even if justice in Singapore is not perfect, there is still some form of justice here.</p>

              <p>In fact if you ban me, you must also ban him, because of the so many wrong advice he given to break the law! Your forum rules got say mah, no posting of law breaking!</p>

              <p>Bro JR, pardon me, I alway have a heart for other, maybe due to my compassionate heart, altho he has had ulterior motives in his doing, it could be he did not realise it.</p>
              <p>I  met him at a BBQ gathering, he knows that he cannot mess with me, and he greeted me like a great guest..and you can see his kakis kept a distance from me, but I raise to cheer with them , hehehe,</p>
              <p>He knows that  I am not simply just a normal TD, that is why he never talk to me about LV or all those sian stuff. But as friend he is alway is, i hope he can change for the better.</p>
              <p>My opinon here is just to chill it and let us live with open arms, but that is just my opinon hor</p>
