              <p>To respect, you need to earn it, pax and TD is a 2 ways relationship, you can expect TD to respect a pax and a pax do not need to respect a TD. Out of 13 paxs I pick at CBD, I will alway greet them, good afternoon or good evening, but only 4 to 5 reciprocate back, it could that they are busy or they choose not to greet back because they feel TD are people who CMI in their life.</p>

              <p>I cannot help it if others do not respect me as a TD.  But, if I have any self respect, I should dress, behave and act appropriately.</p>

              <p>Aiya, if you keep looking down on yourself, then who will look up on you. Even yr little brother below also look down..hehehe</p>
              <p>First is self, if self lack self esteem, ego and pride, you do not expect people to respect you, because you dun even respect yourself.</p>
              <p>But too much ego and pride can end up tio pok hor...lols</p>
              <p>so, just moderate will do, ego and pride is a must, if not, you will lack integrity and dignity in your life, but to show your ego and pride, it very much depend on the occasion and condition. And that is a skill that many failed to master, including my former chief...lols</p>
              <p>Second, once self is well discipline and never bother much about other way of looking at you, the next one, will be your family, if self is good, family will mostly be good, if not better.</p>
              <p>Third, once self and family are good, next will be the town follow by the country.</p>
              <p>So you see, if self is not respecting self, not good, not discipline enough, everything go bad. And that is also why people including most TDs alway said about this problem and that problem with fingers pointing mostly to external factors, from Taxi companies to pax to LTA to family...but never self. Therefore, relook on self is important, most people tends to complain about this and that, blame this and that, perceived this and that, but forget about themselve.</p>
              <p>Thouands years agao, Confucian (not confused hor) once said, knowledge is important, with knowledge, self will be better in understanding issues and how thing works</p>
              <p>Then just last century,  Albert Einsten said, no, knowledge is not enuf, we need creativity and innovation, knowledge alone and do nothing is still end up zero, with knowledge, we must innovative and be creative.</p>
              <p>And today, Bowah said, if you have knowledge, you have creativity and innovative mind, but if you do not apply, is it also a zero sum game.</p>
              <p>So, therefore brothers and sisters, respect onself as other shall respect you, apply what you have learnt in taxi driving, whatever mistakes during your past years driving, take it as lessons to add to your creativity and innovative, and then apply accordingly</p>

              <p>i find the taxi drivers in singapore quite alright,they may not be the best in the world but certainly not rock bottom and deserves alittle bit more respect.<br>I went to korea the last time ,and remebered taking the normal taxi,i could not speak korean,immidately the driver does not want to take me,and i resorted to taking the limo taxi,which is not bad imo,but drivers have to clock a certain years of service to drive that.<br><br>Anw i think taxi drivers in sg are trying their best to give their passengers the route they would like to take and stuff,when i take a taxi most of the time the driver would ask which route i wanna take,i think thats pretty good.When i say i have no preference,they told me,gave me examples of situation when they got complained left right centre after taking the "long" route.</p>
              <p>Then there times where taxi drivers dun really know the place,but i feel sometimes with the ever changing landscape of singapore ,its hard to keep pace,more so when its just the condo name,so...most of the time i try to give the name of the road.Anw the gps then we see in those taxi,sometimes i feel that gps is not really that accurate,the human brain is a better decision maker.</p>
              <p>All in all,give and take ,all of us are trying to make a living at the end of day.I remebered  this time whereby when i reach home its 35 , i only have $31 at that time, the uncle waived it for me,i really appreciate it, $4 is 12% of the fare?, could get a meal with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Surely there are bad apples in the entrie batch of drivers but, if you board the taxi with the intention of defending yourself coupled with the assumption that taxi drivers are out to take your money or watever,it creates a bad vibe.</p>
