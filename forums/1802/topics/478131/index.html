              Cycling is not a viable sport in Singapore, other countries like france got a whole mountain of route for them to cycle, but to bring it here is totally insane, just like army training, there is a limitation of training ground in Singapore, you need to go overseas to get better exposure and space.
              
              Those who ride motor cycle should know that a trailer or tipper truck past by you only, your handle can shake, not to mention bicycle, which is light and small, it is like placing 30% bet of your if on those industrial roads
