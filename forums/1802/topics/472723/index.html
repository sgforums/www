            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I open this up is mainly because some "fall behind chief" had been using this to lure people. I'm not against people want to worship him, it is such strategies is no Big Deal, does it worth a worship? (i achieve this level in less than a month of Taxi Driving)</p>
              <p>Morning Shift</p>
              <p>6am to 930am</p>
              <p>It's all about interview and remain at residential area............. do not end up in hard to recover area. like jurong island, tuas, Changi air cargo and CBD.</p>
              <p>We can't denied the fact that at this hour, majority are all going to work, hence landed in such area are common, but there are also another group of "quality" customer at difference timing,</p>
              <p>6am to 730am, this timing there are customer going to "good" place. Hawker, student, teacher. Do your interview if your can't read pax by their dressing.</p>
              <p>Student is easy to read, if you cant read a student................... please do not continue reading</p>
              <p>Teacher, are identical with those CBD, office people....... so please interview</p>
              <p>Hawker, are best to identify them as below casual dressing, like bermuda, tee shirt and slipper.</p>
              <p>So, if you see 2 or more groups of people waving at you, you should know who to stop. If not......... interview.</p>
              <p>Yet, at this timing, there are people going to work at near residential area, these are also consider as "quality" customer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sweeping is always my first priority, when time it doesn't work out ( i give it 20 mins laps), we got to cut the robe, time is money in Taxi Driving, dont die die stick to one when it doesnt work on that day or time (it do happen at times). Go and grab a "call" or go to queue at "taxi stand".</p>
              <p>(coming to this, is another level...... let cover this in a later stage)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7am to 7-8am</p>
              <p>this timing, there are alot of late, wake up late teacher and student. focus your trip on these group of people (help them, they are late). </p>
              <p>and also, there are "discipline" people during these timing, those who discipline themselves, to save money, avoid traffic jam.....etc, to go to work early. We can put them in second piority. ( that "fall behind chief" will tell you, let them rot )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also dont forget those who serve the country......... army camp. Camp are usually at those area that make us cramp, so.............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8am to 930am</p>
              <p>Who are those quality customer at these timing, those who are old and sick. Need to go polyclinic, hospital, please help them............ its still rewarding than going to CBD......etc.</p>
              <p>but at a last resort, or unintentionally taken one to CBD.....etc, fly back to the residential area asap. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conducting Of Interview</p>
              <p>It is against the rules, so do it "tactfully". TransCab MDT used to be able to switch on the "on call" sign manually (this is what the "fall behind chief used to teach), but now........</p>
              <p>Put up a plastic sign, "on-call" to conduct interview, not 100% but will reduce the risk of getting complaint.</p>
              <p>Instead of using "go where"? as your pick up line.......... why not using " nearby ?", or name the area like, "yishun", "Choa Chu Kang" as your pick up line. Doing this will allow yourselves to choose and reasonablely reject customer.</p>
              <p>(again, this is also another higher level from what the "fall behind chief" can teach, he will only teach you the method of ah beng, "go where"............"no, me on call" In chinese, i name this as "èµ–" strategies.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i shall contiue to expose more of the "fall behind chief" (aka chow ah gua) strategies, if time permit (i have money making business to do), meanwhile............ i welcome challenge from the "chow ah gua group".</p>

              <p>"joint lake view, we have quality customer, we ply within 5km from CBD"</p>
              <p>this is the line that best describe what's lake view got to offer for morning shift driver.</p>
              <p>In the morning, lakeview got strong call volume from Shangri la Appartment, at Anderson Road and Orchard Parksuites at Orchard Turn.</p>
              <p>Yes, he.....or she.......hmmm......heshe did not lie, these call are only travel within 5km, and dont ever think they are able to bring you to a good location like woodlands, they bring you to......knn location.</p>
              <p>Lakeview do have calls from hotel to airport, is going to airport a good trip in the morning?</p>
              <p>Lakeview do have calls from residential area too, with destination, good destination somemore........ but who is going to park one corner to wait for this durian? for that extra $3.30</p>
              <p>And, not every calls got destination, lakeview do accept "open" destination. "open" to me is equal to "knn location"</p>
              <p>There isn't much happening in lakeview for morning shift driver. So, should morning shift driver join lakeview for better business..............hehe.</p>
              <p>There's a "best" answer i got from a morning shift lakeview member, also a member in the ex forum, aka RSM............"i join not for the calls, i join for creating jobs for the needy."</p>
              <p>Give your love, 100% is what i see as best. Full amount $60 ($30 from member fees, $30 from walkie), is what i see as caring for the needy.</p>
              <p>$30 to a telco, $30 to LV and less expenses and less boss profit (and less chief comms).......... that is properly how much is your love.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The last survey conduct by the chow ah gua in the ex forum, no member agreed to better business for joining Lakeview, most agreed to Joining lakeview to make friends, nice friends, only one "special" saying he join for the care for the needy.</p>
