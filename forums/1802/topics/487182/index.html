              <p>CDG is a sinking ship . Instead of taking grabtaxi's challenge head on , they resort to such smelly tactics.</p>
              <p>Their 738 and i pilot MDTs are of dinosaur age. Always no signal and the calls are slow to come if not super far away. The call volumes are dropping and dropping and losing share to grabtaxi faster than you can count till three.</p>
              <p>And they have the cheek to say their call increased? hahaha , i rather see with my own eyes than believing them. For every CDG call now , there are 5 to 6 grabtaxi calls or more up for bidding.</p>
              <p>By the time they revamp their system which is slated to start in Mid 2015 , the ship would have sunk.</p>
              <p>Grabtaxi changed the whole taxi booking landscape, i salute them for breaking the smelly blue company's stronghold and give the drivers a choice without having to stick to them and their bloody management and their shitty way of treating drivers.</p>

              James, whether you Screw CDG or hail grabtaxi, the truth is, we are all in the same boat, a Singapore taxi driver. 
              
              Why go care about them, for the more apps the merrier, as long as it benefit the commuters and taxi drivers, who cares how many apps are there in the market.
              
              And to be frank, who are the shareholders of Grabtaxi in singapore? They are the same as CDG major shareholders. You got to be realistic about that, this is business at it very best.
              
              When Cdg drivers waive calls, and paxs cannot get a taxi, the choice is a new apps, and grab being tested in other countries, was invited in by cdg to enhance the market and make to compete. 
              
              In simpley layman terms, we are not going to do much on cdg call system, but instead, we invite and corhort a new system to attract all drivers, including other taxis companies drivers whereby cdg cannot intervent, nor enter it call system but now with a private apps, it can infuse into other company drivers
              
              So, no matter you grab or take cdg calls, the greedy shareholders of the same, still earn. And we the taxi drivers of all color, are the goats to be slaughter. 
              
              And here, we are laughing at each other...gong bo?

              <p>Why i applaud grabtaxi and fully support them? No one before grabtaxi even came close to challenging CDG in terms of call volume. And the best part is it took a malaysian outfit to penetrate singapore , this is indeed a foreign talent.</p>
              <p>Instead of posting half truths and a load of bull here mr bowah , why didnt you think of such an idea in the first place?</p>
              <p>Whether we are lambs to be slaughtered is another issue. Nobody forced you to be a taxi driver isnt it?</p>
              <p>So who are the we u are referring to? you from CDG? wheres your authorization?</p>
              <p>Last time i know , CDG doesnt pay someone to waste time posting online .</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>CDG is a sinking ship , by the time they get their act together , its too late.</p>
              <p>Grabtaxi have made too much inroads into the market.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile
               , enjoy all the free levy , the stupid performance points to redeem 
              useless uniforms and miserable packets of rice and cooking oil while it
