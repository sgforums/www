              <p>Even if CDG loses all its calls to Grabtaxi, Uber, Easy etc (which is of course unlikely), they will lose $9M a year in call levy revenue only. $9M is sub sub water for CDG lah. It represents only 0.75% of the total 2013 Comfort Taxi revenue of $1.198 billion.</p>
              <p>They have the operator licence and taxis to rent out whereas Grabtaxi does not. CDG still controls the main market lah.  The other players are not even close and you think it is so easy to increase the fleet by 10,000 overnight?  Fleet increase is controlled by LTA lah based on KPIs.  You think banks will easy easy loan money to the other smaller players? One tried to go public, but the plans fell flat at the last minute.</p>
              <p>So, how is CDG a sinking ship?  Their queue for taxi is still very loooong leh.  And I am not a crony or spokesman for CDG hor.<br><br>Stating facts and some analysis only hor.</p>

              <p> Aiyoh bro, we dun know for sure if LTA new rules is because CDG under threat.  CDG want to kill grab is very easy one.  But I cannot say here else sabo all my grab kakis.</p>
              <p>Higher up say must encourage competition lah to have improvement. But need clear and fair rules for all to follow. </p>
              <p>Interesting to see what KPIs in store for these 3rd party apps.  LTA cannot use fleet increase as carrot/penalty.  So, impose fines lor...then what you think of all the incentives these 3rd party apps are giving out now? How to control the drivers etc...</p>

              <p>The thread started with CDG removing the private booking option so mud slinging aside , let us all get to the point.</p>
              <p>Do they care for your interest? without the private booking function , how is the customer going to officially claim from their co if they need to?</p>
              <p>Primarily , they want you to stop taking 3rd party app calls which in other words they want to curtail any income opportunity that may arise outside of their MDT.</p>
              <p>Is this in the interest of you the taxi driver? or is it for their interests? So if they want to stop you , what does that mean ? It means 3rd party apps are indeed a real threat but instead  of bravely taking on the competition , they resort to petty stunts like this. Does a big brother need to do all this to preserve market share?</p>
              <p>There must be a reason for it , for so many donkey years they had this function , why remove it ?</p>
              <p>There are ways to get round this booking thingy but in the first place , do we need to be subjected to this?</p>
              <p>Slam me if you must but if you are still up in arms defending CDG , you have been driving too long with them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Read my post properly lah...The other taxi companies got not enough taxis to absorb so many drivers lah..Also cannot suka suka increase fleet overnight. So, nobody will/can quit Comfort or join other companies so easily just because of call volumes. It is not the sole determinant of a hirer's decision.  </p>

              Anyway, it is a great honour for you to flip thru my posts, really appreciated, a joker like me really do not deserve such an honour.
                      
              To perfectly understand me, you need to have a good sense of humor, otherwise, one can easily get agitated.
                      
              Talk big or talk small is not a matter, for layman like us, most importantly is that $50 is still in the pocket.
                      
              Call or no call is not important, as Taxi drivers, we are suppose to put the cart that sat those call apps, taxi companies and LTA bosses, pull and pull, then once a while give us some good grass to eat, other than that, we pull and pull..and as we pull, we start to argue with each others and these bosses will start to laugh at us, and when we do not listen, the whipping start.
                      
              I think we take it from here, we are all taxi brothers. Even if you give me 5 meals, it just fish soups, bak kut teh or chap chai pun...nothing beat those bosses 2 meals with abalone, boston crabs and sashimi well served

              <p>Today i reveal all the true colours of the cronies in here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>To be welcomed with open arms , one needs to blend in , act stupid , act noob , ask dumb questions so that the gurus wont have too much of a headache answering.</p>
              <p>One needs to pepper up their posts with some KNN , talk big , back off to make the post more outstanding.</p>
              <p>One also needs to angkat the bola of those whose posts exceeds by the thousands then can one be accepted.</p>
              <p>Go against the flow and there you have it... discourteous tones and big talk <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Anyway, it is a great honour for you to flip thru my posts,
              really appreciated, a joker like me really do not deserve such an
              honour.</p>
              <p>To perfectly understand me, you need to have a good sense of
              humor, otherwise, one can easily get agitated.</p>
              <p>Talk big or talk small is not a matter, for layman like us, most
              importantly is that $50 is still in the pocket.</p>
              <p>Call or no call is not important, as Taxi drivers, we are
              suppose to put the cart that sat those call apps, taxi companies
              and <span>LTA</span> bosses, pull and pull, then once a
              while give us some good grass to eat, other than that, we pull and
              pull..and as we pull, we start to argue with each others and these
              bosses will start to laugh at us, and when we do not listen, the
              whipping start.</p>
              <p>I think we take it from here, we are all taxi brothers. Even if
              you give me 5 meals, it just fish soups, bak kut teh or chap chai
              pun…nothing beat those bosses 2 meals with abalone, boston crabs
              and sashimi well served</p>

              <p>Thats a nice way of putting it .. a more civil approach. Perhaps Mr KeepTheChange needs to learn a lesson or two from you <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
