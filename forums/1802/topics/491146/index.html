              Relief and hirer issues can never be a straight forward settled issue, even if you hv black and white to sign, you think what?? Relief must like SAF first day army, must soon pah this and that..lanjiao lah, if he just put the key there and tell you off, you also cannot do anything, same goes to hirer, he can said, this week yr last day, please return the key and patch up the dent you make..

              Super relief rental must cut off 30% or some even 40%, if not, not much of them will take it, unless you manage to get one newbie super relief. 
              
              The key to super relief earning is lower rental, if normal rental per day is $114, super relief will take it at $70 or 75,..you ask cdg to recommend you one, also at that price or even lower....ai lai...mai sua.

              <p>That relief who is let go or left on his own is in the best situation as he could choose to become a hirer or find another hirer.   If he is ready (to OMO), he could even find any hirer from the internet and negiotiate with him/her for 50/50 split of a $1000 recommendation fee and could earn $500 extra plus other benefits from Comfort (like free rental days, accident-free incentives and so on) after leaving the ex-hirer to become a new hirer.  However you must stick with Comfort for at least a few months if you are recommended in (otherwise you could just leave by giving 7 days notice).</p>
              <p>Normally if a hirer finds a relief who would most of the time return back on time, most of the time clean the car and most of the time would pump the fuel before returning back, he would continue with him.  Likewise, the relief would stick with the hirer if he is not to fussy and knows how to sometimes close one eye and not pick on any small things or pushes hirers responsibilities to him (like servicing and oil/water top-ups) or often goes on holidays (resulting in having to OMO or totally not work when super-relief takes over) or charges a higher rate based on per-KM travelled that is higher than what you would pay if you top-up yourself at Comfort fuel stations.</p>
              <p>Hirer always has job security unless he has too many accidents or does not know the routes well enough.   The only thing is once his relief leaves, he has to work harder as OMO until he could find another relief.</p>
              <p>Originally I did not want to become a hirer but was forced into doing it due to suspension of license for 1 week (for accumulation of too many points) and being unable to find a correct timing day shift slot.   I saw in my district too many hirers looking for night shift reliefs and did not attempt to find a relief after I became a hirer.   Right now after OMOing for many months, I got used to OMO "pattern" and totally do not want to find a relief anymore as there are also benefits tied to being an OMO.</p>
