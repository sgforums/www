              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">TRANSPORT touts are taking advantage of Singapore's bustling tourism industry.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">And these illegal touts are usually found at popular tourist spots, making taxi drivers unhappy over the competition.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">Cabbies said that the touts have been around for at least five years, but have been more active in recent months.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">This is especially after the opening of new attractions, such as the integrated resorts, Marina Bay Cruise Centre and River Safari, reported Lianhe Zaobao on Monday.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">When Zaobao reporters visited the zoo recently, they saw four men soliciting passengers at the entrance.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">The men worked in teams of two - one would look for passengers, while the other would wait in his vehicle.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">Once a price is negotiated, they would drive to the taxi stand to pick up the passengers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">The touts usually charged a fixed price or by the number of passengers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">For instance, a ride could cost $30, compared to less than $60 for a Maxicab, or $55 for a limousine.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;"><br>In less than an hour, at least three groups of passengers were seen leaving in a private mini-van. Each group had more than four adults and would have had to take two taxis. A mini-van can take more than 10 people.Or the touts would charge $10 per person.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #404040; font-family: montserratregular; line-height: 16px;">A tourist from Kuwait, Mr Nawaf, 35, and his family of four were waiting for a taxi when he was approached by a tout, who asked: "Do you want a faster mode of transport?"</p>

              <p>Yes, like prositution is legal in singapore, but soliciting is illegal, if people ask them to take them is ok, but if they go and ask peoples, that is wrong.</p>
              <p>Wonder what the authority is going to do to all this touting that is violating our regulations in singapore.  I guess it will be like MBS casinos case, saying taxis drop off at Convention and casino is only for pick up, but knncccb, many also never follow, then I gong gong go and follow, kenna pax fcuk, telling me "Uncle, other cabs can go casinos and drop, why you die die must drop me at convention centre side"</p>
              <p>If singapore wants to improve in it taxis industrial, mode of transport and world class roads, it needs to address this problem fast.</p>

              <p>Yes, like prositution is legal in singapore, but soliciting is
                      illegal, if people ask them to take them is ok, but if they go and
                      ask peoples, that is wrong.</p>
              <p>Wonder what the authority is going to do to all this touting
                      that is violating our regulations in singapore.  I guess it
                      will be like MBS casinos case, saying taxis drop off at Convention
                      and casino is only for pick up, but knncccb, many also never
                      follow, then I gong gong go and follow, kenna pax fcuk, telling me
                      "Uncle, other cabs can go casinos and drop, why you die die must
                      drop me at convention centre side"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If singapore wants to improve in it taxis industrial, mode of
                      transport and world class roads, it needs to address this problem
                      fast.</p>

              <p>The MBS revised drop-off and pick-up points was supposed to effect from 15 July 2013. In short, Drop-off only at MBS Convention Centre, Pick-up only at MBS Casino.</p>

              <p>Busy is those event that need car, at one shot call 20-30 cars for shuttle service. If no do these shuttle, u think busy? All the hotels already booked, all come for F1, one night minimum$500-$650++ minimum must pay 3 nights stay.</p>
              <p>Those come for F1 never go zoo, bird park or Sentosa, they only at Marina Bay Area, after watch F1 go Clarke quay, disco drinking clubbing.</p>
