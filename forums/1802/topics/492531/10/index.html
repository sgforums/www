              There are 2 types of learning people, one is proactive type, learned before the actual happening, one is pre active, learned only when one get the pain, lost and burnt.
              
              But as long as you learn from your mistake, be it pro or pre, does not matter much. The worrying part is some die people can never learn even you burnt them alive, like gambling, womanizer, drinker, and so on.

              As I said, after a few times no start, you will feel the pain, because like my mentor cum brother ah fool said, you will be shortchanged by pax on the fare if you do not on the meter, with no meter, pax can even said, zero, that is how the laws apply.
              
              Same like you go supermarket, if cashier receipt come out zero, you also do not need to pay anything. But most pax are reasonable, they will pay a certain amount, and you cannot further argue because...it is your fault. So, as you go along and forget pressing meter, the pain of losing will creep into you, end up, die die also you learn to press..understand bo..that is how my mentor ah fool learned

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I'm new to SGForum, and I can't find a recent thread on Traffic offences/summon.</p>
              <p>Anyway I am a seasoned driver I passed 10 years ago when I was 18, and I have a fairly clean record.</p>
              <p>Recently, my parents (who also have clean records themselves) and I have been recieving summons, for quite ridiculous things.</p>
              <p>For one, I have been driving along the Holland Village Flyover for many years without a problem, and suddenly I received a speeding ticket for crossing 10km/h which is 4 demerits.</p>
              <p>Now, out of the blue, I received another summon for Failing to conform to red light signal - $200 fine and 12 demerit points </p>
              <p>Its at the Holland Ave x Taman Warna --&gt; Commonwealth road (the traffic light opposite Holland Village Shopping Centre where you turn right at Pedestrian crossing)</p>
              <p>Funny thing is that I dont have ANY recollection of any camera flashes, or even turning when it was ember. </p>
              <p>It was literally a quiet peaceful day, I was getting a coffee at baker &amp; cook and driving home I wasn't in a rush or anything! </p>
              <p>I don't know if I should appeal?</p>

              There is no such thing as Luck in appealing, it is only yes or no.
