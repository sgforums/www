            <div class='col-md body'>Appreciate your advices! Most ppl discourged being a OMO. I haven't try alrdy can imagine the shackness. But everyone has their own preference. I personally feel that If a person is not hardworking enough, better avoid being OMO. It would be better for me to start part time and try to learn this trade asap.However, i am also preparing myself to be a full time.

              <p>Again got pros and cons.  Relief will be at the mercy of hirer.  Hirer beh song can kick you out anytime. Some hirers are good, others sibeh ngeow.  This cannot, that cannot. Then got hirers throw key, give up due to health reasons etc..you need to start all over again.</p>
              <p>Being hirer need not be OMO.  You can find your own relief. Then you are in control.  But of course, the tables are now turned and whether you can work with your relief for long term depends on both of you.  Some work 20 years already, one small thing quarrel and then break off.  lol..</p>
              <p>Some hirers Mon to Fri OMO, then weekends find part time relief whole day.  They get weekends off.  Many methods. Depends on you.</p>

              Human relationship is always one think he or she understand, but in actual right, no body understand.

              <p>Either way ....think about rental...he will start to stress out.. Dont think about it also cannot.</p>
              <p>I feel that best is during this couple of months, i hope his wife can self-sustain the family expenses, else you will start to see him up lorry soon.</p>
              <p>If can, lagi best die die want to drive taxi, best to do drive day part time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One word of advice is, when time to stop to go toilet break, go...dont endure for driving 6 hours non-stop. Cfm your didi will give way.</p>

              <p>Either way ....think about rental...he will start to stress
              out.. Dont think about it also cannot.</p>
              <p>I feel that best is during this couple of months, i hope his
              wife can self-sustain the family expenses, else you will start to
              see him up lorry soon.</p>
              <p>If can, lagi best die die want to drive taxi, best to do drive
              day part time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One word of advice is, when time to stop to go toilet break,
              go...dont endure for driving 6 hours non-stop. Cfm your didi will
              give way.</p>

              From a 30 years experience driver, I think for the first 3 hrs of driving, dun think of anything, just drive, pick, call, Q and make the most, because this period is yr most awaken period, thereafter, you can think of rental and other cost of operation, which will be mostly covered by then. So for the next 7 to 9 hrs, you think of profit, which can motivate you.

            <div class='col-md body'>So, in a nutshell, or cab cabin shell, you can actually think rental, but on different timing, like it or not, taxi driver are also business men, you need to think of the cost of operation, whereas as a sales man, workers or salary paid job, you dun think of that so much, you just wait for end of the month $$.</div>

              <p>maybe sad to say that :) either you are resigned to the fact that you only have this option to be in this driving industry, which seems to be a better way out in earning your income to the max. I have no complains on that. My own conviction is that i help my hirer on his rental tt's all :) That's why i am still a relief. Is true fact that i drive only max 3 hours just to cover rental, fuel and maybe a meal's cost. I understand that what i am sharing i may piss someone off. But it's the truth.</p>
              <p>Ppl nowadays wont be so stupid just to stick to one source of income in singapore. Matter of fact, it is a blue collar economy nowadays.</p>
              <p><br>What i am telling jason is to give oneself to alternatives, rather suddenly quit his job to become a full time td. Who will want to quit a job if one is in a comfort zone, unless there's no prospect. Or do you prefer to do a stable and same old routine? Or do u seek career advancement which may or maybe not due to not meeting certain education requirement, therefore has to study part time diploma / degree course so as to upgrade and move on.</p>

              <p>If can settle on the spot, settle on the spot for minor accidents without any injury. Get some signed written agreement if you can for private settlement.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, for CDG, excess is $2K if it is your fault.  Take pictures, exchange particulars and call CDG if your taxi cannot move. Dun admit anything.</p>
