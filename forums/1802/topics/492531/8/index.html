              Well, there is always a first time, first kiss, first sex, first fight, first time ferrying pax, first time posting here,  but as long as you are willing to take it up, it will not end up to be your last time. Any job that is easy to enter and more easier to exit is always not a glamorous or well paid job. And taxi driving is one of them.
              
              There are people who learn one skill and master it, there are people who learned many, but master none, both got it pro and cons, and for TD, the later apply, most of us learned many practical stuff, but we mastered none, accept maybe masturbation.
              
              Nonetheless, like a toolbox as long as your got the spanner, screwdriver, allen keys, plier, hammer and all other necessities inside, you can bring it anywhere to repair most of the basic things, therefore, taking yourself as a toolbox, the more thing you learn, the more tool you hv in you, making you valuable, flexible and able to change and adapt faster and easier.
              
              So, let take it as you are putting taxi trade into your box, no harm learning it, once you know, it will be with you in your tool box.

              <p>Hello chua I am also a night driver. 8 cents per km and $50
              rental is resonable for sonatas. Cannot complain liao. My shift 6pm
              to 6am. Most of the time I started late sometimes 6.30pm or 7pm.
              Starting at 6pm sharp does not guarantee that you will earn more
              than if you start at 6.30pm . Taxi driving is mostly about planning
              your journey and luck factor.</p>
              <p>As for charging phone , is definitely a silly restriction from
              hirer . I use grab so how not to charge my phone with <span>GPS</span> turning on. 3 hours my phone will be dead. Try
              explaining to him . If you dun use ph apps then it should be OK not
              to use the charging point unless you also play pokemon</p>

              <p>Some lau unker taxi drivers are like that.  Every opportunity to stop their vehicle, they will take out their cloth to wipe and wipe.  Some do it at the airport queue, some at taxi stands. To the older generation, they see the need to take care of their taxis to earn a living.  They come from a generation where life was hard without much possessions, so having a taxi to drive is very personal to them.</p>
              <p>To younger drivers, they see time as money.  To each his own lah.</p>
              <p>Hirer and relief relationship is gum, very good.  If beh gum, then just move on lor..not like both are married to each other with kids and cannot separate nicely.</p>
              <p>Luckily my hirer is very chin chai.  No need to wash vehicle oso. He said taxi is meant to earn money, not to look nice. Pay rental can already.  Sometimes we don't even see or talk to each other for months...lol.</p>
