              In taxi driving, Hirer are also called as Higherer, higher than relief, but on the other hands, these Higherer also need to relieve themselves, therefore they will lower their higherer status abit low, but still higherer.
              
              So, it is not so called rules set by hirer, a relief can set certain rules that is relevant in today market condition and prices, and within this mutual respect of understanding each other difficulties and needs, the relationship will last long.
              
              And of course, we need to take into account of the so called "self interest", which is normal in any human being, everyone have their right to self interest, but many fail to see that by giving or sharing, the self interest can be achieve, so most will not give in, end up, too much focus on self interest or worry that one interest is at stake, most ended the relationship prematurely.
              
              Then, there is another human behavior that is causing alots of problem for oneself and others, it is call ego, higherer got ego, relief also got ego, can end up fighting in the carpark one hor....

              From cdg perspectives, I welcome you as a new TD with lots of perk, better to ask someone to recommend you and both can share the recommendation $$.
              
              I welcome you is also because Cdg top level carparks are full, and to park below is a shame to them.
              
              But then from an economist point of view, I wish you reconsider as this is not a good time and moment to make a decent living as a taxi driver or even as a PHV driver.
              
              If you are currently holding a job, hold on to it, as there will be 13th month AWS, and by next year, when PHV come out with regulation, maybe we can get a better view of the driving market that allow you to make a better decision.
              
              Within we remain, my honest recommendation

                  Dun, not even PHV, driving whatever is not good for the future, it is better for him to bite the bullet at his current job, at the same time, go for certain courses to upgrade himself thru skilfuture programme either using own skilfuture fund or tap from WDA or whatsoever social claim, Singapore govt had pumped Billions into upgrading locals skill and knowledge, but till now, as citizens, not many are taking advantage of it, a real shame, end up all driving taxi and apps...wee

              <p>This one very strange.  Initially may forget once or twice.  But once seasoned, it is like automatic.  Sometimes, I don't even remember pressing and when I look at the meter, it is already on.</p>
