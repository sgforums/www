              <p>Assuming a normal work week.</p>
              <p>Weekdays</p>
              <p>early am as early as from 0500hrs till 1030hrs, busy timing almost everywhere.</p>
              <p>u can see many advance booking for weekdays mornings </p>
              <p>1100-1200, lull period. 1300-1400 also lull period generally.</p>
              <p>1400 - 195900hours, especially late pm from 1600hrs, busy time.</p>
              <p>early week nights generally slower after 2300hrs, that's why got surcharges to make up.</p>
              <p>Only Friday night, everywhere is good all the way. Advance jobs also pick up from late pm onwards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>weekends</p>
              <p>no surcharge for day, demand starts from 0900hrs, thereafter usually non stop crowd.</p>
              <p>less advance jobs as well.</p>
              <p>2000 - 2130hrs usually lull period, thereafter pick up till early am..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The cycle repeats again..</p>
              <p>Personally depends on where and when u are to, but generally it's like that... AM - people leave from home to work, reverse in the evening. Weekend, people move around everywhere, but as there's no rush like weekday, most more relax, less advance booking.</p>
              <p>airport slow period are early am and around noon till early pm, can see many TD go ther sun tan in the pm.. Which I believe things are really slowing down outside </p>

              <p>Been thinking how to max out the driving hours..</p>
              <p>more long haul trips or more short trips better (change shift Chinatown) or every hour take an advance job?</p>
              <p>long haul trip must go to extreme ends of the island, less town..likely get long trips</p>

              Aiyo, bro bro, drive Taxi plan smlj, shift start, just drive lor, for those omo, morning start, just drive lor, dun needs go worry about this and that timming lah (except midnite driving), since already a taxi driver, just drive, be happy, got pax, take lor, long or short is not up to you to decide mah. 
              
              Driving taxi is not about planing or choose which road to make more profits, it is all about connection, and for that connection to work, you need to have luck, and to have luck, you need to stay jovious and happy, why? because happy go lucky, everyday drive with a worrying face, worry this and that, plan this and that, for what, taxi driver is suppose to be free, happy and see thing thru kind, if you are those cannot see thru type, better change vocation

              You see my Uncle tosai, lucky is above coincidence, let say, one day you want to eat either prata or tosai, and coincidentally, there is prata shop nearby, but you dunno good taste or not, because your favorite is the one near jalan kayu one.
              
              And luckily, the prata taste was what you like and expected, and more luckily, it was very cheap, much cheaper than those in jalan kayu one, so from then on, you decided to eat here for yr prata.
              
              Coincident is more of tangible, an abstract, can see, can touch and it is alway a pre planned and wanted by you. 
              
              Lucky is more like an add on, you do not really expect it to happen but it does happen out of your plan and wanting.
              
              Like 4D, you want to buy 4D this morning (pre planned in yr mind), coincidentally, there is shop nearby, you bought it, never really bother about it, just keep inside your wallet and wait for the outcome.
              
              Then on that day of draw, someone called you and told you that nos you bought came out first prize, so lucky of you...for this, you hv to ask keepthechange, I got no experience in it, cos I am a more down to earth person
