            <div class='col-md body'>Last week it was a 17 year old who punched a bus DRIVER, now its supposedly the reverse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2007-05-19/NP_IMAGES_ACTAXINEW-TFD.jpg"><br><br>THEY claimed the taxi driver attacked and punched one of them when they couldn't pay up.<br><br>They said he shouted vulgarities at them, challenged them to a fight, and demanded they pay double the fare.<br><br>He had even snatched two of their handphones away.<br><br>The four teens made a police report against the Comfort driver.<br><br>But the taxi driver has a very different version of what happened.<br><br>According to Mr Tay Kwee Chee, 47, the four boys had refused to pay for the ride, which cost $23.90.<br><br>The boys had boarded his taxi at Downtown East resort in Pasir Ris around 3.30pm last Saturday.<br><br>But once they got to their destination at Jurong West, they got out and ran off without paying.<br><br>And no, he didn't snatch the boys' handphones. According to him, he had only one, and it was offered to him by one of the boys as collateral, while they supposedly went to get money to pay him. (See page 8 for cabby's full account.)<br><br>But the teens are disputing this.<br><br>They said Mr Tay refused to wait for them to raise money after they found they had only $20 with them, a little short of the $23.90 fare on the meter.<br><br>And yes, he punched one of them in the stomach, they insisted.<br><br>According to the teens, they had made calls and managed to find friends nearby who agreed to meet them with the money.<br><br>But instead of waiting, the taxi driver accused the boys of cheating him, and started scolding them, using abusive language in Hokkien.<br><br>The teens said they had decided to go to the home of one of them after an outing at Downtown East's Wild Wild Wet water theme park.<br><br>We are not revealing their real names because the police are now investigating the case.<br><br>One of the four, David, 14, said: 'We asked the taxi uncle how much we needed to pay to go to Jurong West. He said the fare would be not more than $20. So we thought we'd have enough money for the ride.'<br><br>RAISE MONEY<br><br>(From far left) John, Charles, David and Paul. -- Picture: MOHD ISHAK<br><br>They got to Jurong West Street 24 at 4.24pm, only to realise they needed $3.90 more for the fare.<br><br>John, 13, recalled: 'David and I got out of the taxi to call our friends who live in Jurong to raise money.<br><br>'We told the taxi driver our friends have agreed to meet us at Block 272B to give us the money.<br><br>'He only had to wait about 10minutes before they arrived because they live very close to where we were.' Paul and Charles stayed in the cab.<br><br>A few minutes later, the taxi driver turned nasty although he had said earlier he didn't mind waiting.<br><br>Paul, 13, claimed he even fell asleep in the front passenger seat and woke up when he felt someone pulling at his shirt.<br><br>He said: 'I didn't know what was going on. The taxi driver pulled my shirt and he started shouting Hokkien vulgarities.'<br><br>Scared, Paul got out of the taxi and ran. David said: 'The taxi driver shouted at us, saying we shouldn't try to play the fool if we don't have enough money.'<br><br>Paul and David said the taxi driver then ran after them, to the void deck of Block 272B and into one of the lifts.<br><br>John ran after the cabby, trying to explain that his friends would arrive soon with the money.<br><br>'The taxi driver challenged us to a fight. He said he was a boxer and could take on all of us,' David said.<br><br>Paul claimed the taxi driver punched him in the stomach while they were in the lift.<br><br>He said: 'I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. I was afraid he would continue to beat us up.'<br><br>David and John claimed the driver then snatched their handphones.<br><br>David said: 'He wanted us to pay $50 instead of $24. Of course he knew we didn't have the money.'<br><br>His Samsung phone cost over $100 while John's Sony Ericsson cost $280.<br><br>After that, John said he was told by the driver to borrow money from residents. But while John was on the second floor, Paul saw from the stairwell that the taxi driver walked back to the taxi and drove away.<br><br>Charles, 14, who was not in the lift, then called 999 on his handphone.<br><br>Police spokesman Liu Xiangling said they received a report of a man taking away two handphones from the boys.<br><br>Paul didn't have any visible injuries when he spoke to The New Paper.<br><br>He said: 'It felt painful then. But I was okay the next day and so I didn't see a doctor.'<br><br><img src="http://www.phototravels.net/tokyo/tokyo-p/tokyo-4-festival-p-075.3.jpg"><br><br>Taken from the official newpaper website.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the SMS, I also have the opinion that the boys may be somewhat lying. Granted, both sides may be lying, but I think the boys shall bear more blame than the taxi driver.<br><br>The SMS in TNP:<br><br><blockquote>SMS Dated: May 12 2007 1725 hours<br><br><span style="color: red;">Uncle i got money and i make police report i and my friends all sue u and make report u dun wan go jail call me and return</span><br><br>- An SMS sent to the handphone that "the driver" said one of the boys had given to him. The message was sent after the incident.</blockquote></div>
