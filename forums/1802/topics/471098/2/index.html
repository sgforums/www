              <p>Of cos succeed lah, the moral here is to say that when we are in trouble, remain calm and act in a sorry state role, not one that go in and keep speaking louding, bang table and demand that he or she is right and that the TP wrongly accused him or her. And also never blame others for your wrong, these alway tends to anger people more, especially those holding power or those who can use laws against you.</p>
              <p>These are all human psychology at works, as I said before, we are all in a movie, we are all actors and actresses in this messy world, like my mod here act as lau char bo, I act as TD and so on</p>
              <p>it is about how you deal with people of different position and condition, split personalities it might be, but you have to get use to it, if not, staying within one kind of characters is very hard for you to live on, just like some TD die die must stay on in a wining character that actually harbour nothing in return for wining, what for?</p>
              <p>be flexible and know who is your opposition, know his or her strength, weakness and power, and you can deal with them in a more understanding and friendly terms.</p>
              <p>Real or false is not important, life is an illusion, for if I said real, you will think it is false, and vice versa could be true.</p>
              <p>Three keys word that egostic people tends to find it difficult to use is PLEASE, SORRY and Thank you.</p>

              KPE entrance.</p>
              <p>TP: Good morning sir, may I see your license please?</p>
              <p>BS: (handing the license). What's the matter sir?</p>
              <p>TP: Do you know the speed limit here?</p>
              <p>BS: Off course, I pass by here every day (otw to Geyland lah,
              but never say).  It is 70km right?</p>
              <p>TP: Did you know you were speeding at 96 just now? (showing me
              the speed gun)</p>
              <p>BS: It was near dawn that I got a call at pan pacific, outside
              lots of zombies, I went in, the bellboys quickly wave for me, I
              stopped and a lady board my cab, the destination was tampines st
              41, so I thot use KPE lor, then drive into niko highway to hit KPE,
              suddenly that lady start talking and pulling my hand, touching my
              body, early morning, uncle get molested, then I think I need to get
              this pax off quickly, so, when enter KPE, I wasn't know I was
              speeding due to my concentration on the Pax who is feeling dizzy
              and sound like wanting something. Then suddenly a flash and I know,
              cham liao. We TD only earning a living, no intention to speed, it
              is all out of a sudden panic.</p>
              <p>(Something like that lah, but you all understand anyway
              right?)</p>
              <p>TP go check the pax. TP: But she is half dead. You see?</p>
              <p>BS: Just now she was aggressively doing that, maybe seeing the
              face of you two she sian half and go to sleep now.</p>
              <p>TP: &amp;%$#@#Q&amp;#</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No need to say, I got summon for this one.</p>

                  feel it is easier than typing an email. if you have the time to see MP, i
                  rather you go down to TP directly. dun think MP can advise you any better.</p>
