              <p><strong>Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS)</strong> is the name of a
              feedback/redress system developed in Singapore for citizens to meet
              their member of parliament. The MPS are usually held once a week.
              Many citizens see the MPS as an opportunity to resolve problems
              that they are having with the bureaucracy.The MP will write a
              petition letter to the relevant ministry, statutory board or any
              concerned parties to appeal on behalf of the resident. The letters
              are accorded a higher priority by the Civil Service as they come
              from elected representatives.<br> <br> Cases deal with a wide range of problems. These include, but are
              not limited to, family financial problems (e.g. health-cost issues,
              jobs, financial assistance), CPF matters, various licenses, HDB
              related problems (e.g. subsidized rental housing, obtaining a
              subsidized HDB flat), immigration issues, and appeals for school
              admissions and school fee subsidy.<br> <br> Most sessions last past midnight to help residents effectively due
              to waiting time.</p>

              <p>The process of meeting the MP or Ministers varies from
              constituency to constituency, but they follow a general
              pattern:</p>
              <p>1) Registration and take queue number</p>
              <p>2) Constituent meets the petition writer who pens the letter
              (either hand-written or via PC) on behalf of the MP</p>
              <p>3) Wait and queue to meet the MP</p>
              <p>4) Meet the MP in a separate room, constituent informs the MP of
              his/her problems one-to-one.</p>
              <p>5) MP assures the constituent that they will look into the case
              and send the letter. For urgent cases, the letter will be typed
              out, sign by the MP and hands it to the constituent immediately.
              For normal cases, the letter will be vetted through by the MP’s or
              Minister’s Personal Secretary and sent out within three working
              days.</p>
