              Hello, there are many locals having a fast life, all thanks to our govt, even executives are working day and nites, and TDs, although long hours, but not much stress, unlike me on board ship for days wondering how to make the damn engine works, you wife and family should be glad you are a TD, at least can find and locate you in Singapore, last time, I seaman, 9months oversea. 
              
              Agree that family life is important, but knn, many TDs during their free time all go kopitiam, buy nos, play game lah..gamble lah..drinking..find pros..massage. Such type of lifestyle no matter what you work also no family life mah.
              
              In balancing a lifestyle, there must be a will, a will to do it, then come and talk about it, there must be something to trade off, can be the hours, the income, the time spend on bak bak and so on. You go weight the needs and the happiness you seek, if you think like me, finding bak bak is shiok and happy, then by all means, if you think family life is important, then make provision for it so as to make you and your family happy, not drive 12 hrs everyday like mad dog and expect better family life??

              <p><br>Hello, there are many locals having a fast life, all thanks to our govt, even executives are working day and nites, and TDs, although long hours, but not much stress, unlike me on board ship for days wondering how to make the damn engine works, you wife and family should be glad you are a TD, at least can find and locate you in Singapore, last time, I seaman, 9months oversea. Agree that family life is important, but knn, many TDs during their free time all go kopitiam, buy nos, play game lah..gamble lah..drinking..find pros..massage. Such type of lifestyle no matter what you work also no family life mah. In balancing a lifestyle, there must be a will, a will to do it, then come and talk about it, there must be something to trade off, can be the hours, the income, the time spend on bak bak and so on. You go weight the needs and the happiness you seek, if you think like me, finding bak bak is shiok and happy, then by all means, if you think family life is important, then make provision for it so as to make you and your family happy, not drive 12 hrs everyday like mad dog and expect better family life??</p>

              <p>well, to balance lifestyle is always asking oneself what's your earning limit or how much you intend to bring the dough back home? If you are earning 2 - 3K, definitely is having some free time but ...if drive for that kind of amount, must well you better find a permanent job with cpf?</p>
              <p>earning 3-4k is what OMO td is targetting... is achieveable but need to be highly disciplined.</p>

              Peng taxi, not bad lah, the only thing is cannot eat snake, other jobs can eat many snake, taxis driving, you eat snake is at your own lost, other job eat from snake to alligator also got money coming in per minute. 
              
              At mid age, we all should had settled down on our job, whether you are a GM, MD, casket driver, taxis driver etc etc, we should be more or less contended with what we end up as, be it high or low income, no use blaming the past, one of the key to happiness is contention, but hardly can a man feel contented, give u $30, you ask for $50, kenna 4D few hundred thousands, you want millions..
