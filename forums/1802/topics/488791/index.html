              To the Prime Minister of Singapore,
              
              In recent months, Singapore govt have unrelentlessly calling it citizens and PRs to upgrade and get certified in order to stay relevant to the ever changing economy. They also encouraged companies to upgrade their workforce and seek relief in payroll from the govt, there are many initiatives created from WDA, e2i to learning hub and so on. Such insitutions are well structured and provide relief for companies who wish to train their workforce, improve or create producitivity.
              
              The recent skillfuture funds/credits govt announced have also help individual who wish to train or upgrade themselves by tapping on the credit created and less depend on companies' initiative. So, in near future, a person who wish to upgrade to take a Taxi licence or going for a refresher course, is able to tap on it, a person who wish to switch career from waiter to a chef can also tap on it.
              
              Given such help and push by govt to make its citizens staying employable and employability, I believe that as private chauffer, there is absolutely more to gain than lost to get certified by relevant Driving insitution, the gain will include certication, it merits that is portable no matter where the individual go, and that if he or she wish, he can also ply the road as Taxi Driver, he or she can become a personal Driver, or that he or she can be call up to drive in high level meeting the like of Asia to world Summit.
              
              So, in a nutshell, I find that there is nothing to loose to get private chauffer certified, it will create a more adequate system to help companies who are engaging them, LTA holding a record of them and hold responsibility for their discipline that will ease the concern of the public in term of safety and service quality. And as for individual, as mention above, there is more to gain, from the able to switch, to constant skill upgrade and get recognised thru certification at the national level, what is there to loose, it will be a win win and win situation for all party.
              
              For that matter, I wonder why the above deputy manager is not in flavor of it.
              
              Your honorable citizen
