              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Uber submits 800 COE bids, changes the game for cars.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Just over three years ago, the Transport Ministry removed taxis from the certificate of entitlement (COE) bidding process to take some heat off car bidders.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Now, three years after third-party taxi app provider Uber arrived, the heat is back on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">During last week's COE tender, Uber-owned Lion City Rental submitted more than 800 bids, which accounted for 11 per cent of the total bids made for car COEs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">According to market talk, Lion City is looking to put 1,800 new cars on the road in anticipation of growing demand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Rival company Grab is also expected to do the same.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The two already have between them some 10,000 cars - mostly old vehicles.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But in recent months, both have started sourcing for new vehicles, and are jostling with private car owners for fresh COEs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Now, with the Government announcing "light touch" regulations governing third-party taxi apps, the proliferation of private-hire vehicles will accelerate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Most of the taxi companies are also starting up private-hire subsidiaries to compete with Uber, Grab and other small players like Smove and Tribecar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This will only intensify the competition for COEs, which explains why car premiums have not fallen in tandem with the growth in supply.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If the demand for private-hire services continues to grow, taxi operators are likely to shrink their cab fleets and switch. Again, this will fuel demand for COEs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Most private-hire cars are smaller vehicles, so the pressure will be greater on COE Category A bidders (cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp).</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But some are gunning for Open Category too, such as Lion City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At the last tender, more than 200 of the company's Open bids were disqualified because they had identical values, which sources said was a move to manipulate the market.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The Land Transport Authority said: "As there were more than 237 bids with the same next lower bid amount, awarding the COE to all these bids would exceed the quota. The 237 unallocated COEs will be carried over to the first open bidding exercise in May 2016."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Uber was not reachable for comment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Car-Sharing Association (Singapore) president Lai Meng said: "The fast growth in the private-hire car services like Uber and Grab is a validation of the sharing economy."</span></p>

              The time has arrived, in the next few years, taxis in Singapore might be wipe off from the scene and Singapore shall place itself as the 1st world to forgo taxis and replace with IT savvy apps ride, with a population of nearly 90% holding a smart phone and well knowledge in IT, the time is ripe for implementation.
              
              We will be hearing news like SMRT with Grab, Uber going for the kill, and TC will be the next in line to announce in the coming months, thereafter, big brother cdg will give you the ultimate result of them ceasing Taxi in near future and replace by apps ride joining hand either with grab or Uber or S....

              <p>To survive is to be able to adapt to changes as they are forced upon you.</p>
              <p>The job of ferrying people around has an ancient history. Before cars and even bicycles were even invented, we had the Ã¨â¹Â¦Ã¥Å âº from china using rickshaws to ferry passengers. Those days they had no bicycles, the 'cabby' only got his muscular legs to earn a living.</p>
              <p>Then bicycles were invented and imported into 'Temasek' (singapore's old name). When those coolies saw that, I am sure many would have worried that with bicycles coming in, their earning will be affected. I am sure many coolies also may not know how to ride a bike or cannot afford a 'trishaw'.</p>
              <p>Now we are in the modern era. The issues are the same. Many humans hate changes. Hate getting out of their regular routine. Just look at history and examine why some ancient civilisations disappeared. Ancient Egyptian pharoahs are no more. The Mayans from Amazon are long gone. We are all decendants of ancestors who were able to adapt to a changing environment.</p>
              <p>Please do them a favor - fight on, swallow whatever life throws at you and keep marching forward until our bodies expire.</p>
