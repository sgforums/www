              <p>It seems that taxi drivers in Singapore are fearful of Uber, which threatens their livelihood by using private drivers to pick up passengers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While they didn’t riot in the streets or overturn cars (Singapore clamps down hard on unruly behavior), they’ve privately complained to Khaw Boon Wan, the newly minted minister of transport, as he campaigned during the just-concluded general elections.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All this was revealed in a blog post written by the minister. Khaw says his ministry is taking another look at rules governing such transportation apps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Apparently, UberX signs on drivers to drive private hire cars to provide a booking type of transport service, and these drivers do not need a vocational licence unlike taxi drivers,” he says. “While taxi drivers welcome competition, they demand that the playing field be level. I think our taxi drivers have a point.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>UberX is just one of Uber’s many services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seems Khaw is taking a cautious and consultative approach, and that’s a good sign. He acknowledges that young people enjoy using services like Uber and Airbnb, and that the government must not resist innovation. He urges that “we must always be fair to players, whether incumbent or insurgents, and strike a balanced approach.”</p>

              Ask sg Taxi drivers go and riot? most TD in Singapore are above 40s liao, got strength to riot and protest meh? most pui pui, high blood, high chlosterol and sexuality, later die on the street..how? So, since ah Kau wants to spearhead for TDs as he promised, so be it lah.
              
              I think what they are looking at is a fair playing field, uberX is not about innovation in term of driving, but more of a different way of transport business away from the industrial norm. You still hv to take call, wait, fetch and drive.
              
              It is also not disruptive whereby some innovation kills old and present job, it is just another way of transporting people. In fact, such business has been around for many years, just that Uber structured it more nicely thru IT and systemised it.
              
              If you will to ask me, for the govt, it cut both way, first, UberX kind of business model is decent and it helps in way to wake up those cabbies on the road, otherwise, it could end up with Cabby is the king. 
              
              On the other hand, if govt is allow too much gain for UberX or grabcar and TDs losing, natually, the birds will fly to where the food are, so in a nutshell, govt also do not wish to see TDs switching to UBER ending up with no cab or less cab on the road.
              
              Therefore, govt is playing a neutral role here, it main objective is to strike a balance within the competitors

              Why is all these grab and uber stuff is happening, we must revisit a few year backs whereby Cdg calls was king, TDs was Queen with a famous phrase whenever there was a huge Q "let them rot"
                  
              So as the populaton increased slowly, COE went damn high and more foreigners, both rich and middle class, taxi become a demand. That time, my ex chief can even play with his time and can rest here and there to play with 13 CDB paxs and with quality somemore.
                  
              Then every now and then, you see news of people unable to get cab, call also no cab, more difficult than buying a french cap.
                  
              So the govt invested in Grab, temasek poured money into it, and with Grab, they also need to allow Uber in, because of open economy competition mah as our govt believe competition enhance economy and work.
                  
              So, now, TDs start complaining lor, kpkb lor..somemore got calls dun want to take, let them rot, smlj these pax also dun entertain, that kind of pax also dun entertain...now retribution lor

              Coconut trees now bear very good coconut, thanks to all those former LV young drivers help and sponsorship on the trees, those white and red ants also flourished since those guys had left, now the trees and plant there are more greener and healthier.
