              Attracting talents should follow countries like germany and japan, these countries do not anyhow bring in talents until proven that he or she is economically good and productive for the nation, for their concept is simple, 1 talents (real talent and not thrash) must create 3 jobs for locals, meaning you bring in a businessman, he can create job for locals, you bring in a scientist, he or she can create job with laboratory, you bring in doctors, he or she can create job in clinic work.
              
              But in Singapore, ironically, it is in the reverse, you bring in 1 talents (thrash and not screened), 2 to 3 locals loose their jobs or paid get lowered.

              <p>yes! in Spore, G brings in FTs to depress the wages and give competition to locals.<br>that is one way to keep locals on their toes, not slack and keep working until both feet in coffin.</p>
              <p>2nd way is to keep wages low, so that locals will need to work as hard and as long as needed.</p>
              <p>3rd, make necessity as "affordable" as possible....again, we need to work as long as possible to afford those things.</p>

              In comparing our salary range between the min and max, the grade ration with developed country like ours, we are the lowest and most depressed. Local looking for jobs will find it hard to expect a pay that is in line with our inflational cost of living, imagine employing you and pay you a salary that is comparing it with india bangala philippines and even rural china cost of living, you can hardly take it.
              
              And those local who had been in the company for many years, till all their youth blood had been suck dry, are now outcasted, the Boss will alway say, Mr Bowah, the company door is open, please...
              
              Depressive income also affect self properietors such as stall holders, taxi drivers, small and medium enterprise, rental increment will pull down your income, and once you are making money, they will increase and pull you down and gain for themselves. These bastard directors or top managements only hv 2 thinking to churn in profit, first they will do sales, and if sales do not make the target, they will depress their employees or drivers.

              Just think and be see the logic, for the past 2 to 3 years, a normal cab rental had gone up from $90++ to 130++ on the pretext of newer cab and high COE in purchasing, which indirectly also go to the govt left pocket.
              
              Then they increase the flag down fares from $3 to $3.60, let take an omo with max 35 paxs per day, 60cents X 35 is only $21, but the rental had in a way gone up by $40 per day, so I am right to say that in 2009 or 2010, you could be earning more than now. 
              
              Coupled with fuel cost increases, summon and fines increases, TD are depressed further, no wonder, many start to get premature balding heads, depressed the head until hair drop.
              
              As such, I expect NTA to argue over such ridiculous rental prices that does not make TD viable in improving their earning on a backdrop of a high cost of living, but instead they go and concentrate on relief and hirer issue..knn. 
              
              On the contrary, what more can we say when flag down fare increase by 20cts, and TD proclaim Huat....so maybe that simple smrt guy I met at airport is right, huat ki lan

              Hello, u got it wrong, NTA bosses are the taxi companies, not the govt, the govt only facililates it existence so that whenever any issue settle, they can come out in the news and said..Taxi companies agreed, govt agreed, and taxi drivers (NTA) also agreed, so like it or not, even you are not a member of NTA, you are group as part of the agreement in whatever issue settled. 
              
              Their main sponsor are the Taxi companies, not PAP (NTUC)

              Their children can become taxi drivers after NS though they maintain being a PR after NS. To the eyes of the government it make no difference because SPR status is one step away of becoming a Singaporean...and a taxi driver.

              This thing will not happen so soon, PR taking over taxi driving will never be a case for a few years to come unless, unless govt won a majority at 2016, then we all can suck thumb liao.
              
              What would end up PR driving taxis is just a matter of time, not that the govt allow or the laws change, but the environment shift in a way of natural process whereby we got no youngs ones taking over. And certainly taxi driving is not going to be a sunset trade just because of no young singaporean taking over. 
              
              How many of us inspired our sons to be a banker, teacher, doctor and so on, even a supervisor is also good, not many will ask his son to be a taxi driver given that today youngs are better educated. Father drive taxis until hei hei chuan still want son to drive?? and suffer under the regime govt and taxi companies??
              
              So, the diminishing of our youngs due to lower birthrates and marriages, coupled with better educated and better jobs, we will ultimately see foreigner taking over when the supply of young singaporeans were reduced. But not to worry, but then, you guys might had rendered my service for your last journey to heaven or hell.

              <p>Bro Bowah , I agreed with you. Only time will tell. Only for future generations to know that . For us it's a time to retire when our age hit 73. Then we can drive no more.</p>
