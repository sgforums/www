              <p>Dun worry lah, in Taxis,  radio is a luxury, not an entitement. So you do not have to give in, however, base on customer satisfaction, you might be obliged to on for them, provided you are very much customer orientated.</p>
              <p>If your fren is unable to concentrate with radio on, then remove the radio lah, or unplug it and tell paxs, radio not working lor..so simple.</p>
              <p>And to most people, although it is not an entitlement, rejection is alway deem impolite and not giving way to request.</p>
              <p>Careless if paxs wish to complain, because alots of FTs on the street are also not happy with their Singaporeans bosses, landlords, sellers, and so on, and the only people that they can put their frustration on a true breed singaporean is none other than a TD, if given a chance.</p>

              <p>I agree on the <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">customer orientated part but the driver clearly mention tat he can't concentrate which falls under safety,furthermore the attitude of the FT pax making a complain to co makes things lagi worst.</span></p>
              <p>And I don't think there's a need to lie or dismantle the radio,ofcoz wen ppl see got radio they will ask wether can on bo but it's up to the driver rite? He didn't do anything wrong ma like take long/wrong route,reckless driving,interview etc etc</p>

              <p>Later once you turn into the slip road to highway/ any other roads, join the jam queue.</p>
              <p><em><strong>93.8 </strong>and <strong>95.8 </strong>are the essential taxi driver's radio stations for regular traffic updates.</em></p>

              <p>Let put yurself as the pax lah, the reason why the pax make a scene is simple, you got a radio on your cab, and I just request you to on for a 15 minute trip and you kpkb said cannot concentrate on driving, I mean out of 100 drivers in Singapore, most will just drive on with radio on, including lorries and pte cars (some with amplifer woofer that can blow you off).</p>
              <p>Then on the other hand, as pax I will also feel funny that if you cannot concentrate with radio on, then install radio for fark? pax is not going to care if you are a hirer or relief right? remove that farking radio lah.</p>

              <p>Radio rules are quite clear cut, if you have it on, you must play the station the pax wants or off it as the case may be.</p>
              <p>You dont have to on it. So many ways to get around this - simplest - you havent paid radio license, you cannot on - case closed - next please.</p>
              <p>The authorities will not summon you for not 'on-ing' your radio. Taxi companies? Well it's up to their invidual policies.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>i always on radio while driving,for relaxation as well as listen to traffic news.sometimes inside tunnel,the info at gantry entry also ask u on local radio for safety reasons eg traffic accidents,terrorist threats.so just oblige,and i don't think it will affect ur concentration on driving!</div>

              <p>I'm not surprised some drivers can be distracted by conversation or radio.</p>
              <p>in TS case, driver should just say radio is spoilt. Not important to elaborate whether its hirer or relief radio.</p>
              <p>i don't think we need to tune the radio to pax preference or according to its ethnic. It's either on or off, loud or soft, period.</p>
              <p>if one can try to accommodate pax requests, u are basically a one of "going the extra mile"</p>
              <p>theres no case in writing to coy or even LTA. I.C.E. is never a standard item that comes with the vehicle</p>

              <p>Like bowah says, it's customer service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are 2 ways to say something,</p>
              <p>I am not talking about Yes or No.</p>
              <p>I am refering to.. say in nice, or say it bold.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this case, TS do not want to turn on Radio,</p>
              <p>as mentioned by some of the forumers here</p>
              <p>he can give a reason, "not working", or "no license", etc.</p>
              <p>and end it with, "i am sorry for your inconvenience".</p>
              <p>That's GOOD customer service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OR, he can say boldly,</p>
              <p>"This Radio not by Taxi Company", or</p>
              <p>"I got headache if radio on", etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The difference is that, in the first case,</p>
              <p>you want to but unable to fulfil the customer request.</p>
              <p>Whereas in the second case, you can but refuse to do so.</p>
              <p>By the way, customers are not interested in your personal issues,.. like headache.</p>
              <p>Sometimes customer knows you bullshit, but accepts it because you said it nice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As an example, if someone wants to borrow $50 from me,</p>
              <p>I can tell him, "No lah, everytime I lend you, you no return".</p>
              <p>Or "Alamak, this month I got to pay my daughter's school fees, not enough leh"</p>
              <p>How will the person react to the first one, compared to the second case.</p>

              <p>The fact that there all kinds of paxs as there are all kinds of cabbies and forum moderaters, we all face different issues everyday, you said pax ask you to  on the radio, we also met pax asking to off the radio, and some ask for special Song from CD if any.</p>
              <p>So, it all voice down to paxs and cabbies relationship, if a cabby takes pax as a hatre or someone who order him here and there with more work, then I think that relationship need to readjust and review, if not, since pax is a curse to him or her, best is not drive taxi lah.</p>

              <p>The fact that there all kinds of paxs as there are all kinds of
              cabbies and forum moderaters, we all face different issues
              everyday, you said pax ask you to  on the radio, we also met
              pax asking to off the radio, and some ask for special Song from CD
              if any.</p>
              <p>So, it all voice down to paxs and cabbies relationship, if a
              cabby takes pax as a hatre or someone who order him here and there
              with more work, then I think that relationship need to readjust and
              review, if not, since pax is a curse to him or her, best is
              not drive taxi lah.</p>
