              <p>weifuge, if i am not wrong....your 1st sentence means... "they send me a giro form for 12 months
              instalment and also a payment form for the $1636.92 which they
              stated must be paid within 30days from the date of notice."</p>
              <p>a payment form meaning you owe MIW $1636.92 on the existing basis NOW.</p>
              <p>giro form means for future payment, spread into per month payment for 12 months.</p>
              <p>When comes to $, if you owe MIWs, dont play play. But if vice versa, they will take their own sweet time.</p>

              <p>8 is huat mah..look, at changi resort, there are few resort
              classified under <span>A B C D E</span> and F, like our
              alpha, bravo, charlie..so when you come out, to identify you, the
              alphabet will identify you and the crime you committed, mostly for
              police spot check.</p>
              <p>There will never be a F and G, cos F is for those waiting for
              death sentencing, and G is the complex that I go and pick up the
              death after they are hang till death.</p>
              <p>8 is the new batch, previously was 9. like hp nos mah.</p>
              <p>So example, a ex convict IC will hv another nos below bearing
              8xxxxxxxxxD, and when police check, they will know he was an ex
              prison convicted of such crimes and place under D</p>

              If no jail term, nos remain same, that is why govt now put jail here and there, underage sex jail, drink driving jail...corruption jail..that makes all scare.
              
              In the 70s and 80s, minor crimes, go to queentown chalet, major only go to changi resort, at queentown, it is divided into 3 groups, the petty crimes group, the hwite collar corruption group and the higher white collar corruption group like CEO or Minister corruption will be put there, I was in the petty crime group, small issue, jailed less than a month..IC change smlj. 
              
              However, today, all are at changi resort, so even white collar crimes may mix with murderers, gangsters and rapist during their open compound break.
              
              I went to jail in the earlier 80s due to cheating, I was young, worked for KDK as delivery clerk, KDK was use to make cassette and video tapes, now collapse liao,,smlj cassette and tapes..phuixxx. Collection of good delivery was cash on delivery, so me and my driver decided to cheat lor, see cold hard cash cannot tarhan...that time (not last time hor), we were milliondollar club member, sin po po lapsup bar VVIP, young mah.
              
              So get caught up because account was fishy, boss already marked us, we still dunno, so get caught red handed at tanjong katong pubs cum lj bar.
              
              After release, I went to army, IC nos still normal as usual. Only those more than a month will consider ex convict, now you know why judges like to sentence peoples 1 to 3 months, like those sex with underage,...lols

              Those who went to jail before 2000, and have no more record for since 2000, no problem lah, back to normal,
              
              this what we fight for during the yellow ribbon seminar, a man must be given a chance to turn a new leaf, everyone of us make mistakes, either big or small, there must be room for repentance..unless you go in twice or more, like drug addicts...then no choice.
                  
              Since then, the urge for employers to engage yellow ribbons was reduced, because most ex yellow ribbons guy like me are new born with new IC nos as normal as anyone.
