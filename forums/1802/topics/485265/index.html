              <p>So members do take note that you need to write in to CPF to seek permission before you can make the payments. Can you believe that ? </p>
              <p>The email address is self-employed@cpf.gov.sg.  If you dun write in to them , your liability is still 50% of the balance money you still owed to your Medisave. I got caught with my pants down.</p>
              <p>Thinking I have cleared that 50% liability,  I went to Bishan CPF to get the clearance form. So they told me I still need to clear another 50% of the balance money. Reason coz I did not seek permission.  So I have made the appeal and have to wait 8 days later.</p>
              <p>Also I got a record with CPF. 6 times defaulter in Giro payments. Damn I thought  this apply to bank terms. Hehehe. Life as a TD is indeed interesting. </p>

              CPF was created for retirement pension, end up getting abuse into smlj medisave, special account, buy house lah,..bonds lah..mini sum lah..so in a nutshell, they just want your money on the pretext of medical insurance, $400 per month can anytime get you a better insurance coverage with good return.
              
              If you said tax like income, property, Gst and so on, I have nothing to say, but to buy a medical insurance (medisave with no return) by force leaving no option doesn't sound right.

              <p>I heard now our medisave is used to pay premium for medishield.  Like dat confirm not enough to pay for hospitalization. Now I am very confused. Some more we cannot use our medisave to pay 100% payment. Only partial payment. If money not enough can use siblings or relatives. Phui x 10.</p>
              <p>Anyone can explain why so medisave sibei luan. I already got $0 in my ordinary account. How to retired unless I sold my house and then put minimum sum of how much and rot till I buried 6 feet under. But where am I going to live when all the HDB flats are so ex. Thanks to Pappy Ministers. Dunno how to live my life when my health is at risk. Hopefully I got sickness and then quickly die. Dun wan to die in a slowly agony death. </p>

              As I said before, medishield life is coming soon, the premium will be higher with higher coverage including existing illnesses. In simple term, just think it this way...
              
              Medisave is for medical expense once you admit to hospital, medishield is a insurance to shield for medisave from over spending especially on those expensive operation.
              
              Everyone who enter hospital will have to paid a 100 plus admin charges, this is call deductible, which is not cover under medisave or it insurance the Shield.
              
              So, many drivers come and ask me,..why I still need to pay 100 plus when I got medisave and shield...because that 100 + is admission..admin charges, not under medical cost, if you want to cover that, then go buy a private insurance, many on the street..from HSBC

However, the limits are generally adequate to cover most of the charges incurred in the Class B2 and C wards. However, for expenses incurred in the private hospitals and Class A and B1 wards of government and restructured hospitals, the patient usually has to pay cash out-of-pocket for part of the bill which exceeds the withdrawal possible from Medisave</span></p>

I think top up money and then sign the Giro for installment plan. The plan is very simple. To get 100% money what is owed to yourselve within 36 months. How good can that be. But you cannot pay 100% for your hospitalisation or medical bills. </p></div>

              ensure that members' Medisave savings are conserved for future
              medical needs, especially during old age. However, the limits are
              generally adequate to cover most of the charges incurred in the
              Class B2 and C wards. However, for expenses incurred in the private
              hospitals and Class A and B1 wards of government and restructured
              hospitals, the patient usually has to pay cash out-of-pocket for
              part of the bill which exceeds the withdrawal possible from
              Medisave</span></p>
              <p>Future? WTF!......</p>
              
              Singaporeans wu future meh??? maybe for the top 20%, the rest 80% can kiss goodbye to their medisave...the future they are saying is leave it for your son, why they want to hold your medisave??? because they need the money to invest and operate their smlj govt sovereign funds mah

              Still got ST meh? the State Times is no more relevant, only can bluff those older generation then us, today, many get education, limpek chao chao also sex 2, where got go read ST. Watch porn and take paxs already no time liao...still go read smlj state times.
                  
              In my Sex 2 knowledge..every financial men on the street will know that putting money under a coconut trees is going to make one poorer by the day, and our govt is no different, they know what is depreciation and inflation offsetting, and that the basic of money grow money is never a topic to be miss in any business education.
                  
              The annual return of CPF is 2 to 4% interest to the holder who can only see, but cannot take..how you get that 2 to 4% without investing CPF? you would had gain 10% and above on our CPF but return us 2 to 4%, and moreover that 2 to 4% is can see but cannot touch.
