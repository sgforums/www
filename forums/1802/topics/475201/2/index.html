              <p>Encountered a group of Ang Mo cyclists this morning. My taxi
              stopped at a minor road side as I was replying to an urgent text
              message. I heard a few bangs coming from my taxi boot. One Ang Mo
              cyclist, behaving like a thug, said I was parking illegally and
              blocked his way. He asked me to move my taxi so that he can push
              his bicycle to the grass patch. I buay song, and refused to move.
              He quai quai find his way to the grass patch. KNNBCCB chow Ang Mo.
              He must be suffering from inferiority complex illness</p>

              <p>Now, all attention of road danger shifts to cyclists.</p>
              <p>My personal take on cyclists:</p>
              <p>1. We dunno if they are turning or gg straight.</p>
              <p>2. Very hard to gauge their speed. Some very fast, some slow.</p>
              <p>3. Many just abruptly join the road from the pavement, esp crossing the zebra crossing.</p>
              <p>4. Some have no lights on them when cycling at night.</p>
              <p>5. Those cyclists who need to turn right on those many lanes road, need to filter right to turn....very dangerous. Esp on empty roads. Some cars speed. And i personally (on motorcycle) collided with a electric bike cyclist who filters right 3 lanes to turn right at junction. I was gg straight. I went down worse off because of my higher speed.</p>

              <p>Having the rights to cycle on the road doesn't mean that they can cycle in manners that not only endanger themselves but to other road users. Drivers may killed themselves in order to avoid those idiots who sway in and out on the roads.</p>

              <p>Mai say riding motorbikes not safe leh, just ride safely and be alert at all times for unsafe drivers (which most of the cyclists are not aware) .. I believed there are some bikers (touch wood hor) didn't had accidents while riding motor on the road..</p>

              <p>Actually from what i see on the road, most of them have standard even using hands to signal to let you know they wanna turn. I can see many cyclists doing nonsense near geylang and little india area mainly.</p>
              <p>But actually still better than many drivers and motorcyclists just swerving in and out without signal. At least these cyclists cannot kill people easily, just causing alot of inconveniences.</p>
              <p>Basically, there are always black sheeps around. Bus driver, truck drivers, motorcyclists, normal cars, taxis, cyclists all have their fair share of black sheeps. I cannot stand it and will snap if given the right scenario. Our transport culture is not up to standard maybe due to the stress everyone faces.
