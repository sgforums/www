              So what ? Rejection means nothing to me . I can always call my control hotline , and get a release of suspension . Big deal ?
              
              Sometime call jobs are really nuisance like as last Wednesday already heading into Victoria Street, Job offer Hill Street MITA Building Main entrance, enter by River Valley Road.  Fme press button $3.00 that it, what suspension. Street Hail job no penalty at all. Just for the extra $2.50 you need to go back, where you came from that route. But Bugis Parco there are many over here, which is better. Control Centre.

              hey pool,
              
              Zone A, yah centrepoint best... actually PS more crowd except that always jam when turing into handy road 
              
              Zone B, funan is better than say city hall/suntec? my usual spot is city hall or suntec leh. got chance for same zone call. funan no chance liao...
              
              Zone C, Maria temple better than robinson road? more tourist? must try... and if kena call can also quickly zoom to robinson...
              
              After 8pm, i like suntec/marina area most... big taxi stands, less jam, good access to ECP/AYE and can easily cruise around to look for 'good' pax. Best is take call and go to tanjong rhu... solid...

              hey kin,
              
              agree that sometimes call are a nuisance... e.g. scott road area... very hard to u turn... u may earn less if you detour...
              
              i appreciate calls more outside CBD esp in ulu areas or in weird hours... that one is very solid... and of course my favourite advance booking before 545am...

              <p>6th avenue to king albert park stretch also problem cos all the condos are on the inside stretch of bukit timah rd. most times if i get calls that require me to make a long u turn..forget it.</p>
              <p>came across very "keng" pax, current booking to airport 5.55am. last time no experience, take only. obviously, the guy boarded after 6am. the cheapskate. gave up street hire somemore.</p>

              <p>Why Funan It Mall ( Hill St ) is my choice ?</p>
              <p>Cos most customers get on board , usually head west or within CBD , head west means i'll see less congestion ( AYE )</p>
              <p>Those using ECP usually use the t/s at Nth bridge side . ECP peak hr damn jiak lat .</p>
              <p>I dun like Suntec cos Suntec area many kind of customers . Especially many heading to Hougang / Serangoon North / AMK and those CTE route places .</p>
              <p>KNN if one pax go Punggol , i die liao , Suntec to go Punggol , they surely used Upp Serangoon Road , surely jam . They used the road behind Suntec &gt; Lavender &gt; Up Serangoon .</p>
              <p>Unlike Funan , if punggol customers going home , clear cut CTE . It's a big round to go by Up Serangoon . Pax got no choice .</p>

              <p>I am so sure they will not chose to go by  Bt Timah , why ?</p>
              <p>Imagine , to go by Bt Timah from Funan .</p>
              <p>Pax has to go thru Nth Bridge Road .... back into Hill St .... Stamford Road ... Selegie Road .... Rochor Road ... Bt Timah , meter how much liao ?</p>

              Evening shift is different .... ours pricing is different , understood ?
              
              Btw Day shift and Night. Day shift every hour is alive with pax, Morning rush paxs to work, Morning marketing paxs, Lunch outing  paxs, Corporate appointment paxs, Leisure aunties shopping paxs, Tourist paxs, Hospital medical paxs,going to Government agencies paxs etc.
              
              Guru can share with us what is the pattern for night shift. What kind of paxs ia around during night. But according to some comrades some of your hours are consider dead hours. Is it true.

              kin, yeah i believe day shift connection better... save fuel for sure... knn my fuel these 2 days (Fri and Sat) is $61 each day!
              
              night shift after 2am weekday is ghost town...so business hours is effectively 5pm to 2am - 9 hours. 
              
              Compared to day shift say 6am to 5pm - 11 hours. So the night surcharge helps to balance it although it was never introduced for that purpose...
              
              anyway nite shift is all about CBD, industrial (e.g. tuas, expo, IBP) and nite spots...

              <p>cos day shift their connections is slightly better , so no extra surcharge is needed .</p>
              <p>Cos night is all about CBD and town area , so in order to encourage drivers to chiong down into CBD , to support the needs , extra surcharges must be implement .</p>
              <p>If nothing about surcharges , why should i head into CBD to pick passengers ?</p>
              <p>Outside CBD i already very busy liao .</p>
              <p>If say i in AMK eg , if in town no extra , i would rather crusie slowly around AMK ,before heading to town to look for pax ....</p>
              <p>But with the $3 extra , i no need think so much , head straight down CTE into CBD , 100% sure got pax , i dun even bother to pick anyone at AMK .</p>
              <p>Tactically , our tactic is alway like tat , 5pm to 8pm , i pick whatever , whichever , whenever , wherever whoever needs a cab .</p>
              <p>8pm , the best is near town , Q for extra $3 City charge . Dun bother anywhere just outside CBD .</p>
              <p>Outside CBD people , transparent for me , cannot see them .</p>
              <p>Why should i pick one outside CBD , without $3 , and inside CBd got $3 anytime ?</p>
              <p>Then anytime around 10pm , i would say 110% sure got booking for me ....  inside cbd .</p>
              <p>The most , 1 only .</p>
              <p>After 10.30pm , booking got less , so my solution ? Pick anyone that is white ? Yellow if dun have then pick , black colour one has to wait .</p>
              <p>Caucasians is all about not further than $10 trip .</p>
              <p>Chinese is okay , anywhere i do . Except more than 3 paxes , i worry go more than 2 places .</p>
              <p>Black one , no comments . If dun have white and yellow , then bo pian , picked and hope for the best .</p>
              <p>I pick &amp; chose ? No la , cos after 10pm , LTA regulation states that i can picked anyone on the street , not mandatorily must take from a taxi stand , so i can chose colours .</p>
              <p>That's another loophole in the legistrations or taxi law and order .</p>

              Pool Mentor, what about those leftover last night you guys took them into CBD those white collars working night shift. But during day we took them back home, also inside CBD why there is no extra $3.00 surcharge during day inside CBD, but night you guys have. But day we took them in night you  all got the benefits. What wrong with all this in btw. Something is wrong over here..Policy.

              Also i am scratching my head, everytime during day once hit Tuas or Jurong, the next move sure headon for Jurong West or Boon Lay, Just wish  paxs pickup hope to go back to city by chance, but till today all paxs pickup there all are going back to the same areas where is Jurong or Tuas. this show that west there are more blue collar worker over here than east.

              <p>no need scratch head, it doesn't mean more blue collar workers stay in jurong, just that many of them take mrt to boon lay station and then catch a cab to tuas/jurong.</p>
              <p>if morning kena tuas or jurong, i will straight away take AYE and head to jurong east or teban/pandan/westcoast or even holland. pax there more likely to go to town. my morning peak hour strategy same as poolman after 10.30pm strategy...take as many bookings as possible, esp angmoh, this means hanging around orchard/newton/holland area and short trips. most angmohs will call for cab in the mornings and high percentage of going to suntec/shenton/robinson area. going back to orchard/newton area also quick bcos everybody heading into CBD. if u remain in jurong, jurong point sure got pax, but 100% go to tuas/pioneer cos they took mrt to boon lay station and then take taxi to work so as to minimise taxi fare. if cruise in j.west, chances of getting a pax very slim cos many taxis also cruising after dropping pax off in tuas. (similar situation in the east..airport) my strategy is to maximise bookings during morning peak hours. jurong where got booking? so have to operate in condo belts near town.</p>

              Why can't reject. So even offer job also cancelled as you like... why not!!!... before reaching. Many times this happen when there is the next available taxi near them, so this kind of KING penguins body  is big but brain is small, they just doesn't understand we still need to burned fuel to reach them just only for the extra on - call fee. This kind of games...   So who set the Law, so Law sometime olso can overturn it WHAT.
