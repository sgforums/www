              It is not about relief think too high, you need a relief to do a decent taxi trade, that apply across all countries, even malaysia cabbies, to get ownership,  all have show they have relief, it is only Singapore typically speaking, go into OMO because taxi companies want to earn profit.
              
              Let think wisely, if all OMO is to partner each other, share all the benefits, cdg will see 13,000++ cabbies thrown key at them, u see that picture?

              <p>i find some OMO really damm relax, cover cost make a little
              close shop.</p>
              <p>don't like other people to partner, the car is like their
              own.</p>
              <p>so what if cost is higher than nett profit, they don't bother.
              hit $250 gross, close shop... about $150 cost, $100 profit</p>

              If you meet up with our ex chief, you must act gong gong, then only you can eat him.
              
              High egosim and pride people need to know how to tackle them, never go against them, use their egoism and pride to your advantage, nothing to lose to be a gong kia for a while.
