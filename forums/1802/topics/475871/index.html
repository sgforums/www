              <p>recently know of a new friend going to OTR and asked for my opinion to start with day or night shift.</p>
              <p>seems there's a never ending pros and cons for each. however <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my stand was to advised him to build his confidence with day shift</span>, as everything is more visible than driving at night, but of course with less extras and surcharges..</p>
              <p>in summary this is what i feel...</p>
              <p><strong>DAY SHIFT</strong></p>
              <p>Pros</p>
              <p>- more consistent demand for taxis on normal work weekdays, less the low key period between 10-11am.</p>
              <p>Cons</p>
              <p>- more traffic jams, road works and hot weather</p>
              <p>- weekend crowds start later, u make less on weekends</p>
              <p>- if its a weekday public holiday or long weekend, there can be less demand</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>NIGHT SHIFT</strong></p>
              <p>Pros - more surcharges and extras to make</p>
              <p> - cooler weather, lesser traffic as it gets later</p>
              <p>Cons - need to make more empty trips to town to get pax, more fuel used (justified by the extras u received)</p>
              <p>- usually means more queueing at taxi stands for pax, unless u know where to find pax</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- night drivers are more agressive, more reckless and pax snatching situation</span></p>

              <p><br>OMO frankly speaking is not for taxi driving, even casket also got 3 reliefs playing around, TD are really long hrs working people, go out no sun, go back no sun, a sunless career with limited return.</p>
              <p>Life is not long, get a good relief, share the perks, both be responsible on the cab, you can go on for life and yet enjoy a good life. Learn to pamper yourself and also learn to exercise and give yourself a break.</p>
              <p>But of course if you want to go OMO, by all means, no laws said cannot, but it will takes alot of your time off. Bearing in mind, sleep, given a person who sleep less, had taken away nearly 1/3 of our life, still drive until night..aiyo, mai lah</p>

              <p>As a night shift driver my points are:</p>
              <p>(1) night less speed cam/tp</p>
              <p>(2) most pax heading hm type so location/route wise easy unlike day ppl go everywhere,imagine they goin to wrk n u go wrong route! sure kena fark untill hell lol</p>
              <p>(3) night neither pax or td cannot see each other face while on board,all dark dark lol &lt;pick-send-collect $$-F off liao&gt;</p>
              <p>(4) weather v cool n can save on fuel bcoz aircon no need put high high plus after midnight travel less n queue more,traffic better after certain hrs</p>
              <p> but those with eye sight problem pls drive day,especially older ones</p>

              just drive honestly and sure can make it one lah...but must be comfortable with whatever shift he chose lor.. Need to try before he know..
              
              But as for OMO, i'm still contemplating on whether to resign from my job and be full time TD... But with the new pattern coming and still don't know what pattern will come out.. i think i have to shelve this idea for the time being..

But hor,,, fri and sat nights driving not tired....won't feel tired until change shift..;-)
              
              Lol, I don't want to take your van at my age...still young leh..

              Depend on what you work as, like me shake legs type of job, then weekends just give 2 nites can liao, somemore can hv accuses to go par bao...lols
              
              Sometime you ask me stay at home, more tiring, knn, HDB like jail leh.
              
              But joke aside, is all depend on your health, your family and most important, your mental condition and attitude towards work and driving.
              
              Family,
              Old one like me, old wife also heckcare what I am doing, she ever said..care you for what, better take care myself, how to care you,..as long as you know what you are doing, can liao, just dun end up bringing dirty laundry home.
              
              
              Jobs wise, as long as it is not a tedious and physical demanding job, fine with me, most people by my age would had learnt their core job by the finger tips liao, close eyes also can go around block 9 at SGH.
              
              Health, do some light exercise 3 times and enjoy it, watch yr diet, hv some good sex to remove ego and stress, once a while pamper yourself at spa..make yourself healthy and happy at the same time.
              
              Driving taxis, to be frank, in any trades you enter, the key to stay long is enjoying what you are doing, of course, unless you are super yao, can be due to young family, or bad habit like gambling, then the whole concept of driving or working is totally different. So, to me, I can tell you that driving taxis is a hobby to me, even if OBK, I also happy.

              Conflict of course have lah, but as long as there is no interest, it is fine. By the way, what interest do one need in a forum, nothing mah. There is never a common goal in all, and that what make this world interesting. 
              
              Do you think those full timers can post like you and me everyday in and out, very unlikely, most will be plying the road dutifully earning their honest living and when go home, tired, eat and sleep liao.
