Started from Diesel Kiosk , 2 has closed down , Kaki Bukit and Pandan Road's diesel kiosk .<br><br>Then they moved into Call Centre , when basic fare increase , bookings got less ..... more customer-service will lose their job . Their main motives to the call-centre is to be 100% Fully Automated .<br><br>Then they will moved into Maintenance , when more quits comfort , maintenance got less , Mechanic loses their jobs . Workshop to be shared , spart parts purchase less ....<br><br>Then they will moved into Operations , less operations , meaning less personnel to run the show ....<br><br>So in one year time , more will get more Golden Handshakes .<br><br>CityCab at Marymount will be sold , to be share into Comfort's @ SinMing .<br><br>Service centre at Portsdown will be closed , Braddell outlet will be for buses only .<br><br>All will be slim-line , simply everything .</div>

By the way , Circle very soon will be competed .<br><br>Do u know how much the Circle Line cost LTA and SMRT ??? They can't afford to flop !!!

The real solution should come from the taxi companies and govt to step up regulations and nab the cheats of the roads!!<br><br>What use is there to keep increasing fares and passing on the cost to the consumer when its the taxi drivers' fault?!<br><br>Am gonna round up my friends and boycott taxis together...</div></blockquote>u sure boycott will work? why not you organise boycott again utility increase also?<br>as i said, if taxi fare too high, no need to boycott, taxi also close shop. But if priced correctly, waiting time will be optimal.<br><br>U think taxi drivers at fault? blame it on lta. If they set the fare, rather than let comfort set the fare, waiting time will be more optimal. But comfort already gives in liao... now they have eroded their advantage in call booking because with higher city surcharge, less taxi will wait for call. I am sure waiting time in city will improve alot<br></div>
