              <div class="clearall"> </div>
              <p>THERE has been much talk about the complicated taxi fares and 
              surcharges ("Complex cab fares enough to drive you crazy"; Oct 26), but 
              taxi drivers also face pressures.</p>
              <p>Every customer we pick up is income to us. While we do our best to 
              serve commuters, the business environment is really getting tough.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Taxi rental has gone up over the years. Diesel and fuel prices have also escalated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">To appease drivers, taxi operators increase flagdown rates to offer options for drivers to earn enough to cover the rental.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">To us, it seldom results in higher take-home pay as the increase in flagdown fares usually means we have less business.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Many drivers are putting in an extra hour or two of driving a day just to cover the higher costs.</span></p>
              <p>This is in addition to the 10 to 12 hours we are already putting in a day.</p>
              <p>New taxi availability standards put in place early this year are an added burden.</p>
              <p>While the increased costs and new service requirements are imposed on
               the taxi operators, the reality is that these obligations are passed to
               us in the form of higher rental and new hiring agreements demanding 
              that we abide by these new requirements.</p>
              <p>We believe that a review of the fare structure by the Land Transport 
              Authority (LTA) is incomplete without a corresponding review of the 
              rental issue.</p>
              <p>Appeals by the National Taxi Association to the taxi operators to 
              review rental thus far have only led to the shrugging of shoulders.</p>
              <p>Yes, we can switch taxi operators to get what we deem as a better deal in terms of taxi rental cost.</p>
              <p>However, these agreements are ultimately drafted by the operators and we can only be the price takers.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As long as the system stays this way, the conditions are unlikely to improve for us.</span></p>
              <p>Nonetheless, we will press on and we are confident that we will 
              display the same resilience we did during the recent haze and previous 
              Sars crises.</p>
              <p>A little help will go a long way though, and we hope the LTA will 
              help enhance the operating environment to ensure a fairer level playing 
              field for all parties involved.</p>

              Brother, in my study into working pyshology, we are merely part of the taxi being exploited and getting further exploited if that profit margin of company need to shift up, there is no 2 ways, only one way, exploit the taxi drivers, the more exploitation, the more profit generated for their shareholders, who are govt related.
              
              Govt put COE high, taxi companies buy high, govt earn one big chunk
              Then taxi companies (GLC) increase rental lead to increase of fares, they earn another big chunk.
              
              Reward and incentive tends to peg with performance, but performance must be realistic and safe.
              
              If you remember last time in production line, companies (especially those Jap companies) like to reward people with no MC for a year, or full attendent for a month, these are all exploitation tools, and it will end up people damaging their health or trade their health to get the reward, so even he is very sick at the last day, he still come and still work on.
              
              Same goes to incentive given to mileage clocked or nos of booking completed, for me and you, this are the carrots, the stick will be you might hv to struggle to get it, and in the struggling to get it, you might get into accident, health problem such as prolong stress and getting yourself too demanding on calls and so on.

              <p>Brother, in my study into working pyshology, we are merely part
              of the taxi being exploited and getting further exploited if that
              profit margin of company need to shift up, there is no 2 ways, only
              one way, exploit the taxi drivers, the more exploitation, the more
              profit generated for their shareholders, who are govt related.</p>
              <p>Govt put <span>COE</span> high, taxi companies buy
              high, govt earn one big chunk<br> Then taxi companies (GLC) increase rental lead to increase of
              fares, they earn another big chunk.</p>

              <p>arya told you liao. Say so much, so much displeased. Recently LHL already say those who not happy voice out / should step forward and identify oneself. If really not happy with the mangement, do something in GE2016. No point complaining over here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like what the PAP / management thinks...they only talk but they dont do the ground work. They think they are the elite class. Ask LHL to go drive taxi for 1 year see whether he can tahan anot.</p>

He only know how to spend singaporean's money (taxpayer's money) dont even know how to claim fares from passenger when he sent the pax to their destination.
