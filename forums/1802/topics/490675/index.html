              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">So earlier this month, National Taxi Association (NTA) adviser Ang Hin Kee said something about a “level playing field” for cab drivers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Which got people riled up because why regulate something that brings unbridled joy to consumers?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Except he didn’t.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">His comments are instead targeted at, believe it or not, the current rules governing the taxi industry. Describing the rules as “a narrow and straight path” and “a stark contrast” to what the private car hire drivers have to follow, the Ang Mo Kio Member of Parliament explained to Mothership.sg why cabbies feel a little angsty with the whole situation.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The bane of “the narrow and straight path”</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Taxi drivers are told to maintain a professional image, understand English, pass a tough Taxi Driver Vocational Licence course (ok, <a style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #eb1c23;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/61-year-old-man-finally-passes-taxi-licence-test-after-failing-it-for-79-times">tough for this 61-year-old</a>) and go for a refresher course every six years, said Ang.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">“In the regime of all the rules and regulations, it was conveyed to them that this has been designed so that commuters can feel assured,” he added.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">And with the current “stick” approach of demerit points and revocation of licence, the cabbies follow “the narrow and straight path”, said Ang.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Thus the fact that their competition doesn’t need to follow these rules has got the cabbies scratching their heads.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Voicing cabbies’ displeasure, Ang said: “You mean consumer’s peace of mind is not important any more? Safety and security not important any more? No, no, now there’s user reviews and can get rid of undesirable drivers. In that case, why did that rule not apply to me? Why do I have to follow all these other things that apply to me? If the users don’t want to stick to this set of rules and are happy with the other set but taxi drivers still have to follow the old rules, you can see where the sentiment is coming from.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The current rules are “costly, not quite reflective and a bit onerous”</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">While Uber, Grabcar drivers cannot do street pickups, they also do not have to meet the Land Transport Authority’s taxi availability (TA) standards implemented in 2013.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Taxi companies have to meet two standards: Ensuring that 85 per cent and 75 per cent of their fleet clock a daily mileage of 250km on weekdays and weekends respectively and ensuring that the bulk of their fleet ply the roads during peak hours.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">According to <em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><a style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #eb1c23;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/cab-operators-smrt-premier-and-prime-fined-for-falling-short-of-taxi">The Straits Times</a></em>, only Comfort consistently met all the taxi availability standards so far in 2015.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Ang continued, citing feedback from taxi drivers: “So they are thinking: ‘I still need to comply with TA, drive 250km a day. Why do I need to meet 250km a day? Since you want me to hit 250km, I drive lor, empty cruising.’ But the most efficient way is not to drive around but rather on a demand basis.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">A taxi driver’s analogy</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Being a story on taxis, there has got to be one story from a taxi driver.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Ang recounted this hawker centre story told to him by a cabby, which parallels the predicament faced by most taxi drivers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">“There’s a very rigorous way of checking hygiene level for hawkers. But if a push cart appears at the hawker centre with no licence. It can be cheaper because there’s no compliance cost and no rental. Say the push cart’s food is cheaper and better and it only comes during peak hour. Then why would the hawkers want to follow these rules? There’s a reason for the rules and they were told that rules are important. So if the rules are not relevant anymore or if there’s a new set of rules, then make them applicable to all.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">So I ask them: ‘In that case, do you mean that all these rules you’d like to see removed so that there’s a fairer competition?’ No, it’s not the rules, they say. It’s the fact that over the years, yes there are some black sheep, but the image and professionalism have gone up. The safety and assurance from the comfortable point of view have gone up. Please don’t reduce us from dressing and operating properly to a free for all operation. Because you are literally throwing away years of investment into making consumers a bit more familiar with what is the right way and professionally good way of driving a taxi. Don’t throw away the baby out with the bathwater you know?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">There’s a minimum standard called “every morning must change underwear”. Don’t throw away that good hygiene.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">That said, private car hire drivers deserve more protection</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Competition aside, Ang also acknowledged that more must be done to protect private car hire drivers, citing the rental rates of private cars as example.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Drivers are more likely to sign on a longer car lease, as compared to a daily or weekly term, for better value. However, if you score enough bad reviews, drivers will be out of the game with a car lease in tow, Ang added.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">“That way of penalising or disciplining their business partners is a very cruel approach. You don’t give the person a chance to make restitution and you immediately get rid of them.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">Taxi companies, on the other hand, offer a clear and calibrated system to penalise errant drivers and even if licences are revoked, drivers just need to return the car, he explained.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px; color: #111111;">“The driver must be given a chance to correct themselves and amend their ways. It’s rare in the commercial setting where the burden is passed to the lowest denominator called the single driver and the biggest player with the financial strength and profit margin doesn’t co-own the problem. That vulnerability of the driver is not an ideal one when you don’t have a co-ownership of the responsibility.”</p>

              â€œThat way of penalising or disciplining their business partners is a very cruel approach. You donâ€™t give the person a chance to make restitution and you immediately get rid of them.â€�
               
              Taxi companies, on the other hand, offer a clear and calibrated system to penalise errant drivers and even if licences are revoked, drivers just need to return the car, he explained

              <p>MP Ang from neighbourhood schools not from elite schools, so he is closer to taxi drivers than other MPs.  You would never find a taxi driver background MP in Singapore as he or she definitely would not get the votes of the white collar workers in Singapore as they need someone more respectable as their MPs.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">And "taxi availability standards" too hard to meet.  250 km per day is easy task for any taxi driver but to have 75% to 85% of operating fleets prying the road during peak hours is a super tough job.  What this means is OMO drivers definitely have to be up from 6-930 am and 6pm-12am.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">I drive mostly around15 hours per day (up to 18 hours on Fridays and Saturdays ) for 6 days per week and cannot meet this requirement as I also drive during off-peak hours when there are real (no-surcharge) demands too.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">When you have to rest, you have to rest otherwise there would be accidents.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">If you stop at 12am, after washing car and pumping fuel, you would reach home at 1am and only have 4.5 hours of sleep before waking up to prepare to drive again.    </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">A person needs minimum 6-7 hours of sleep to operate normally.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #111111; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">If you are a father of kids who have to go to school and have to sleep between 930am and 6pm, you would never get to see you kids during weekdays and you would have problems sleeping between 1am and 530am.</span></p>
              <p>Also other than Friday nights and Saturday nights, there are more taxis than customers after 10pm so many taxi drivers would be empty crusing on the road when some could go back home and rest adequately to prepare for the next day's peak hours.</p>
              <p>So LTA should change the requirements to 75-85% of the fleet must pry the road for minimum 12 hours per day.   Taxi drivers would know how to adjust to meet the peak hours demands as there are surcharges as incentives.</p>
              <p>It is very evident that LTA's new requirements did not consider the health and family needs of taxi drivers which causes 4 other taxi companies to pay extra fines but not Uber and Grabtaxi.  Comfort is able to meet the requirements because there are more 2-shift drivers driving there.   Forcing more to go 2-shift is also not the solution since there are a lot less customers at night after 12 other than on Friday and Saturday nights.  It is also the OMO drivers that are covering the crucial change-shift periods of 4-6pm when the demand for (long trip and not short or same direction trips) taxis exceed supply.</p>
              <p>So for OMO drivers to meet LTA's new requirements and real market requirements, one would have to sleep between 930am and 330pm (more like 1030am and 330pm because need to drive home and eat lunch) and 1am to 530am.  Who could take 2 stretches of 5 hours and 4.5 hours as well as forgoing family lives?   So  nice bosses of the other 4 taxi companies rather pay the fines and treat their "money gods' and supporters well than otherwise.</p>
              <p>LTA forgot to take care of requirements of taxi drivers who are contributing additional GST revenues on top of normal purchases due to taxi rentals alone of approximately 28000*$7*365=close to $72 million per year.  Each taxi (hirer and relief/s) contributes additional on the average $7*365=$2555 GSTs per year (just on rental alone not including taxi COEs, higher road tax, fuel GSTs, ERPs, income taxes, other GSTs and indirect taxi rental companies' profit tax) and these drivers do not get 3 months bonuses per year unlike civil servants.   When you consider GSTs paid when purchasing ordinary items like clothes, food and books, taxi drivers contribution to GST is like someone making more than $100,000 per year.</p>
              <p>This GST from taxi drivers rental alone not including taxi rental companies profit tax is equivalent to what a company that generates 423 million Singapore dollars of profit consistently without fail per year and pays 17% profit tax pays (think about it, how many companies in Singapore makes more than $400 million per year and contributes this kind of tax money? You could find your answers from the Stock Market guidebooks ).</p>
              <p>This amount also greatly surpass what Uber and Grabtaxi invested in Singapore (Grabtaxi invested $136 in R&amp;D in Singapore which is less than what taxi drivers pay in rental GST in 2 years [$72millionx2=$144 million]<span style="line-height: 1.231;">).</span></p>

              Many MP are also from normal school, it is not a matter of school, more of a matter of characters, some MP from elite school are very down to earth, sociable and listen to you but from the way I talk to Ah Ang, he seems abit arrogant, he dun entertain anyone that got have no value nor interest to him.
              
              As far as I am concern, NTUC, which NTA is affiliated, is concern on  industrial or trade unrest, from strike to riot, and that is why they are trying to group TD together to listen to them and at the same time, guide them and report any forseeable disruption before it erupt. Same goes to SMRT bus, the strike by PRC drivers had in a way, wipe off the Union chief there, and today, they ensure that these drivers join the Transport Union so that they can have a control over it.
              
              Therefore, the agenda of Ang is simple, to keep the ground calm and steady, and at the same time, report and solve issues before it erupt, so, all these kopi talk by him is just a wayang to calm the round, nothing about apps drivers...he can only influence the drivers, but go no power over taxi companies and LTA. And at the end of the day, who sponsored $$ and created NTA?
