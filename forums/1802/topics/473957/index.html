              <p>Now do you still believe the bullshit that the Law only sides with Ang Mohs against TD?</p>

              <p>I thought this was already reported in the news in May 2013?  The law is just and fair, provided you have sufficient evidence.  Never doubted that.</p>
              <p>In this case, the PP was able to produce credible witnesses who all gave independent and consistent accounts of what took place.  The accused on the other hand, had no witness, was dodgy and gave inconsistent statements.</p>
              <p>Given the straight forward nature of the case and the willing witnesses who were easily contactable via their calls to the police, what puzzles me is why it took more than 2 years after the incident to convict this guy? He could have jumped bail and returned to his home country.</p>
              <p>And all this while after the incident, he was here, fully employed as a PR and enjoying all the comforts and benefits our country has to offer. He is now appealing against the conviction and would be here, god knows, for how long more?  If the conviction is upheld by the high court, the sentence should be increased.</p>
              <p>The TD apparently is now a property agent and pursuing civil actions against the ang mo...</p>

              <p>I think you are wrong.  Let's review the learned judge's considerations in sentencing the accused:</p>
              <p><em>1. I did not believe the Accused’s account of Leow’s conduct in the taxi. It is public knowledge that service quality is an essential aspect of public transport providers’ duties. As Leow said, taxi companies investigate every complaint made against taxi drivers. It is difficult to believe that Leow would respond to the Accused’s very polite request in such a shockingly rude and crass manner and drive as dangerously as described by the Accused. Also, it did not make sense that Leow would work (driving taxi) from late at the night to the next morning, drive the Accused almost to his destination, then tell the Accused to get off his taxi and forego his fare.</em></p>
              <p><em>2. Leow was a taxi driver and his taxi was parked at the road junction, it would be sheer foolishness for him to rob the Accused when Leow could be easily traced. And this incident took place at the brightly lit road junction with Leow screaming loudly. It was unimaginable that Leow would commit a crime at a brightly lit road junction and at the same time, screamed to attract attention.</em></p>
              <p><em>3. When a person takes a ride in a taxi and gets off without paying his fare, and the taxi driver chases after him and stops him from walking away, that person must know or at the very least, sense, that the taxi driver wants his fare.</em></p>
              <p><em>4. The Accused did not intend to pay the taxi fare and in the process of trying to get away, assaulted Leow.</em></p>
              <p><em>5. </em> <em>Leow was a public transport worker. As he said, he was merely trying to earn a living, he did not deserve to be beaten. I fully agree with this. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Violence against public transport workers cannot be condoned. They should be able to work in a safe environment and be protected from devious and violent passengers.</span></em></p>
              <p><em>6. The need to take a serious view of assaults on public transport providers was highlighted in Wong Hoi Len v PP [2009] 1 SLR(R) 115 where Justice VK Rajah set the sentencing benchmark of around 4 weeks’ jail for a simple assault against a public transport worker where the offender had no antecedents and pleaded guilty.</em></p>
              <p><em>7. I had no doubt at all in deciding that a custodial sentence was warranted.</em></p>
              <p>In fact, it had everything to do with TD, being a public service/transport provider and must be protected from unprovoked assaults under the law.</p>
              <p><em></em></p>

              <p>Everyday, TDs face run fares, however the likelihood is about 1%, altho small, I hope the authority, taxis companies and NTA or whatever taxis association can sit down and give TDs a procedure in handling run fare issue.</p>
              <p>Thing like, how are we going to react, who should we call and how we can retrieve the hard earn fares?</p>
              <p>On the other hands, we TD must be united and we can also do our part, there must be a collection of these cheapo run fare peoples in Singapore, put it into sticky or a common taxi website or even a apps called run fare paxs...lols.. so that all TDs in Singapore are wary of it, even if you do not know the names, just indicate the place of pick up and drop off, the race, shape and gender ...so on.</p>
              <p>This can help in a way for all our brothers and sisters on the road to be wary of the location and the paxs.</p>
              <p>Last week, early morning, my LJ itchy go pick up a young local ah neh at 7am CQ to tampines, this ah neh pretend to be abit drunk, but you smell no alcohol, age about late 20s, very fat, will sit infront seat, act sleeping and also cross his leg, drop off at tampines st 23 block 4XX (cannot remember), in jean and polo. Reach location, act drunk, but come to the exact place to drop him off, he was very clear, I sense something fishy, he asked me to stop in the middle of a car park, ask me to go up with him to collect money, he drop off, I go park my taxis, come out, he no more. PhuiXXX</p>
              <p>Such are the incident that we should report and tell each other so as to evade all these pax, pax like my former boss pui chee also a case to remember.</p>

              <p>This is quite true. Run fare difficult to pursue unless u can catch the culprit. LTA is powerless against pax who scold u and verbally abuse you. My point is that assaults against TDs who are just doing their jobs will most likely carry a minimum 4 week jail sentence if the TD is injured as a result. Other types of assaults maybe one or two weeks jail or fine only. </p>

              <p>I can safely say that most cases do not have enough evidence to prove any abuse.</p>
              <p>This case is just a one off situation whereby there are multiple witnesses to help the taxi driver.</p>
              <p>There are so many new drivers, so many abuse assault and failure to pay fare cases on a daily basis. Even if it is 1%, it is alot because there are so many trips on a daily basis.</p>
              <p>25000 taxis x 20 trips = 500000 trips a day.</p>
              <p>1% of 500k  = 5k</p>
              <p>5k x 365 days = 1.8million</p>
              <p>Yet, we only see a few cases on the newspaper whereby there is something done for the drivers.</p>
              <p>What is the % of the cases that have been resolved?</p>
              <p>1 out of 1 million cases whereby authorities have helped drivers? Almost negligible?</p>
              <p>Has anyone helped you solve your problem? Is there any actual law to protect TDs?</p>

              <p>TD being the one spending most of the time on the road to earn a living, the liabilities of getting whack and run fares is alway there, unlike some hotel booking and so on, we hv to serve first then collect our fares, there is no way of collecting first or swipe card first, than later reached, deduct accordingly. Therefore we are at risk at all times.</p>
              <p>But having said that, this is part and parcel of our hazards, a chemist can get poisoned, a chrome operator can get blood chromated, a butcher can get his hand injured, a cook can get burnt and so on..perhaps TD is one of those occupation that faces more hazards than others.</p>
              <p>I believe that beside giving warning and thru media, a TD plying on the road must know that he is facing many kind of hazards, from road rage, to run fares, to accident (touch wood), to tyre blown and so on, all these are the hazards we knew before becoming a TD, and when each happened, it is treated on case by case basis, never a one case solved and a solution for all.</p>
              <p>So, whether the laws protect us or going to protect us or not protecting us, since we choosed to be a TD, first and foremost, we need to take care of ourselves, because at the end of the day, such incident like pax whack TD and run fares is not going to go away, maybe less only.</p>
