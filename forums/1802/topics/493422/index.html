              Taxi driving like Phv, is not an employment, it is a contract OF service, not a contract FOR service. Therefore, you are actually a contractor that can take in as many projects as you like, and of cos, within your limited ability.

              There are pro and con in which ever way you drive, you drive for Phv, prepare to get 20% off and drive like mad dog killing each other to earn the incentives, you drive OMO&lt; you get tired out and maybe end up at block 9 of SGH.
              
              You drive as relief, hirer kpkb, you also buay song, change here and there, you drive as super relief, lumsup taxi or anything also must take, cannot afford to choose this taxi or that taxi. Then 5 days do super relief, 3 day rest and wait for another relief, LPPL.
              
              Unless you are from my time of driving taxis....today, in current market condition, if you are young and parent do not leave a house for you, driving Phv or taxis is never going to make you a rich man, not even an average man, not to mention your future.

              The key here is not about service line or whatever line can make it or not, all are earning a decent living, the niche in one finding happiness and progression in his work is mostly out of passion and liking.
              
              If one like his job and is very passionate about it, one will excel, but for taxi driving, that passionate and liking subside overtime, and there is nothing to excel about after you know the routes and driving within 3 to 6 months.

              Drive taxis or Phv must hv a fierce face, not so ah beng and yet not so Richard, just enuf to scare off those average paxs, especially the ABNN.
              
              Typically speaking, in Singapore, people see face to bully one, if you are like my ah fool this type of face, 10 paxs, 9 will bully him and later ask for discount, but if you are like my brother Hammer,..never comb hair type...10 paxs, 11 see liao also tiam tiam scare scare, why 11, because the crock coach see him, also dun dare to come out.

              <p>Depends on how you suggest lah.. You ask pax which way he wants to go, of course tio kan lah.  I usually ask, you prefer to go by CTE or AYE? CTE may have traffic jam at this time etc etc..Or can I go by AYE?.liddat lor. Most of the time, pax will let me decide ..Some will say anything oso can. Some will say go by fastest way.  But, NOBODY had said go by shortest way..lol</p>
