              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>GrabCar, Uber drivers may need vocational licence soon.</strong></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/grabcar-uber-drivers-may-need-vocational-licence-soon"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong></strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000; line-height: 1.231;">www..com/singapore/grabcar-uber-drivers-may-need-vocational-licence-soon</span></a></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Private-car hire drivers operating under Uber and GrabCar may soon be required to have a vocational licence, under regulations expected to be announced next month.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">A proposed training programme lasting at least 10 hours - shorter than the 60-hour taxi driver vocational licence (TDVL) course - is being considered by the authorities for these private chauffeurs, sources told The Straits Times.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The licensing requirement, which follows a review that started last October, is expected to be announced by the Ministry of Transport next month during the Budget debate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">There will be a "phase-in" period to allow drivers time to go for the vocational course, said industry sources who requested anonymity. It is estimated that there are tens of thousands of private-car hire drivers here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Course credits attained during the proposed vocational training could also be used for the TDVL, should the drivers want to become cabbies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Besides vocational licensing, sources said, the authorities are mulling over clearer markings on cars being used to pick up passengers. This could be through decals pasted on these vehicles to identify them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Asked about the upcoming regulations, the Land Transport Authority said only that it was finalising the review. "More details will be made known in the coming weeks," a spokesman said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">With a regulatory framework, Singapore will join other countries, such as the Philippines and Australia, which are moving towards regulating an industry that has come under heat worldwide for allegedly competing unfairly with taxis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan had said in October that, where justified, the Government would "level the playing field" between taxis and private-car hire services.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The head of Grab Singapore, Mr Lim Kell Jay, said vocational licensing can serve as an "added assurance" to commuters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">He said the company does its own screening in the form of "background checks, in-person registration, induction training as well as vehicle inspections".</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Uber's general manager in Singapore, Mr Warren Tseng, said he was "hopeful of a positive outcome" to the review - one that will ensure drivers can continue to have flexible work opportunities, and commuters, reliable transportation options.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Private-car hire driver James Koh, 53, said if vocational licences become a requirement, part-timers may find it a hassle and stop driving. "We have been operating for so long without problems, I find it strange that we need to have a licence," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, National University of Singapore transport researcher Lee Der Horng said regulations actually benefit private-car hire services by legitimising them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">He said services like Uber and GrabCar should also disclose data on their platforms with the Government, as taxi operators do.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"The Government can have full visibility of how many vehicles are on the roads on a day-to-day basis, and how much mileage is clocked.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"By being better informed, policies can be adjusted to help solve transportation issues in Singapore, for example, by putting more taxis or private cars for hire on the roads."</span></p>

              The way I look at it is that Govt is confirming apps ride to stay and operate here, by putting a structured legal framework, we might think there will be less drivers taking up apps ride, but it can turn out to be worst for taxi drivers.
              
              1st, now I can operate legally, 
              2nd, now I can go full steam ahead and create more rangers and elites
              3rd, taxi drivers dun come and complain this and that anymore.

              Hope COE stay high.
              Once COE drops, TAXI can die very fast.
              Imagine car owners all come out to drive at night.
              Night legal TD die.
              Can only queue and sweep.
              Day TD should be able to survive.
              These few days I cover for my hirer whom has gone for vacation. 8.30am drove past Chinatown OG. I am quite surprised to see 7 to 8 taxi queuing at taxi stand.
              Peak hour in the past no such queue at OG.

              Actually TD kill themselves.
              When grab just started,  the rangers and elites very supportive because bonus payout very good.
              Got free TV etc.
              Once they build up their client Base,  they started grab car n also start promoting grab car.
              Then payout for grab taxi starts to shrink.
              So TD pawned themselves.
              My once elites GT cdg cabby friend used to drive with busy sign always on. Only cheong GT calls. Now....hahaha cdg mdt on with for hire.

              <p>See how the taxi companies react lor. If my taxi rental go down on par with car rental, problem solve by staying with taxi.</p>
              <p>If my taxi rental still higher than car rental, also can solve problem by going to car. If car with decal can do street pickups somemore, lagi problem solve ah.</p>

              <p>There will always be people like me who will not pay for a ride in a private car. I either bus, train, walk or taxi, but since I own a car - I simply drive. Nothing else, not even paid ride-sharing.</p>
              <p>Personal preferences aside, my conviction is that the biggest issue holding up taxi apps is something they have not done, or could not possibly do - and that is to make their apps TRANSBOUNDARY.</p>
              <p>That means the same app can be used by people on the same continent, and both drivers and passengers can book a private car in singapore and send them to lets say Hat Yai Thailand. Then the same driver who went there, can use the same app and receive bookings in Hat Yai, and get priority bookings (a feature that is completely absent currently) back to Singapore, since the car was registered in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This is the next challenge for them, and you heard this original idea from me first in sgforums.</p>
