              <p>With government support, Uber and Grab are here to stay liao. Haizz...taxi companies keep increasing rentals to meet demands that are also cannibalized by uber and grab. To help taxi drivers to cover higher rentals and also meet demands, there are locations and peak-hour surcharges that are in-turn capitalized by uber and grab as bowah pointed above.</p>
              <p>On the other fence, there are always uber and grab drivers capitalizing on the demands but since they cannot pickup from streets, those renting cars are feeling the strain of long hours and earnings macham flipping fast food burgers (fyi I tried uber driving for a month too). This ride sharing economy should be beneficial to those with their own cars and a full-time job who doesn't mind an extra 4-5 hours a day to earn a free or subsidized car.</p>
              <p>As usual the winners are the taxi companies collecting daily rentals with incentives and 4 rent-free days a year subjected to terms and conditions; and the ride-sharing companies collecting 20% for each fare cannibalized and capitalized from taxi drivers with their apps only, and incentives subjected to terms and conditions.</p>
              <p>So if there is a hybrid car that can transform into a taxi or a private car to cater to different demands will be good, with terms and conditions probably. At the end of the day we are also striving to meet the demand or terms and conditions of consumers.</p>
              <p>I was thinking if ride sharing economy is so popular, why not extending to food and retail to make it more affordable? We have so many carpark lots so park the vans and sell cheap. Promote home catering, home bakery services, home childcares and rooms-sharing too. We could earn as well as provide affordable services in such a sharing economy. I am sure when there are such alternatives, there will be no shortage of workers and entrepreneurs waiting to transform.</p>

              No Lah, tia kong, Uber and Grab also not doing very well, actual fact, they are losing and plan in long term, but after few years, still not making in Singapore. With drivers like my Bro CT, ex chief, hammer, all sapo the incentives only, no incentives, no Grab. So, many taxi driver left Grab because they felt betrayed, as for Uber, smlj 20% they take, look sad for drivers in Singapore.
              
              Uber and Grab did not understudy the transportation market in Singapore well enough, therefore they met up with many teething problem and need to promote further, and to promote, it is a cost to them. 
              
              First, they forget that Singapore pples are mostly rich, well educated or able to survive without a smlj apps ride job, only left are the youngs or those kenna taxi companies banned drivers will participate, so unlike 3rd world city or even USA whereby there are plenty of unemployed immigrants that they can take, Singapore is different.
              
              2nd, being competitors, it had make us of Singapore taxi drivers as a start up, but many felt betrayed, and alienated themselves from joining even where there are less business.
              
              3rd, the youngs who joined are temporary, most are playful type, wanted a car to drive around but cannot afford it, so they play around with these apps ride, and when get into trouble or cannot make it or finally enlightened themselves that taxis driving is much better, they jumped shipped, so in way, apps ride had become a training ground for potential taxi driver.
              
              So, in a smlj nutshell, together with more buses and train, apps ride may suffer more than taxi driver, altho someone, as a TD, had waited at Asia sq for calls, you can also see line of apps ride cars there getting lesser, and to me, why wait for that calls? just Q and pick.
              
              Bearing all circumstances or cumming, Cdg had in a way fight back on the apps, and I would say that apps ride had in a way wake up a giant, so, we also need to thanks apps ride for waking up those con and blood sucking taxis companies. So, let think it out of the box, for without apps, we taxi driver could be worst, maybe rental for a normal cab could be $150 now.

              <p>These social media companies are just trying to make use of cabbies to earn a living. All I can say is, those karhoo, uber and grab executives should come and be a cabby first, then start opening their mouths.</p>
              <p>Life as a cabby is already bad, so they think cabbies only deserve the wages of a burger flipper?</p>

              Apps is just an apps, a server, they got no asset like building, vehicle, service centre, fuel stations...they are tapping on taxi and car rental companies as their value chain, if that ceased, they are just an apps.
              
              The youngs like to use IT to tap on traditional industrial who refuse or simply lazy to look into it.

              Yalor, but since bukit panjang to city MRT opened, still got paxs lah, I got call at hillcrest, destination, Tan Kah Kee Mrt Station..phuixxx, then only I Q at Tan Kah Kee MRT station ($30net income apply), all other taxi drivers passed by stared at me, must be wondering why one stupid ugly cabby Q here?
                  
              After 5minutes another pax board to go to Swiss Club, play at bukit Timah enuf for me liao. They want me to be ranger, cdg DRO called me, asked, Uncle, why you no take call one...cannot leh. I told them, prostitute can street pick or take booking, why taxi driver cannot?
                  
              No doubt more MRT stations will affect business, both taxis and apps.
