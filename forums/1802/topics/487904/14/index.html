              Malaysian seibei garung one lah, you think all like Singaporean meh, kia see, kia su and kia cheng hu. For them is about sing dollars leh, and how many time you likely to get into an (touch wood), if they can drive in fark up road conditions in malaysia, what is Singapore nice road?  They work on a 80-20 rule, once there is an 80% gain and only abt 20% risk, they will go for it. We should also work on such rule to make decision.

              <p>To the taxi driver:<br> <br> 1. You get less fare from UberX for the same distance travel. UberX advertise cheaper fare for the passenger, didn't they?<br> <br> 2. UberX get 20% of the fare you collected. $20 from pax is actually $16 for you.<br> <br> 3. Private cars use petrol only. Now taxi company diesel only 82 cents/Litre.<br> <br> 4. No street pickup. Waiting for booking. If you drive a cab before, you
               should know how long a booking came. UberX booking is not much better 
              than comfort.<br> <br> 5. You get nothing if pax cancel the booking within 5 mins they booked. 5 mins you can travel how many km?<br> <br> 6. The lower rating you get, the lesser paxs you got. So everytime new 
              drivers feel good business first week driving UberX with full rating. 
              And you need to treat paxs like God to maintain your high rating.<br> <br> 7. The more booking you rejected, the less booking you got. Why you 
              reject? Because the distance for the current booking pickup is 5 km 
              away. Ask again, why 5km away? Where are the nearer UberX drivers?<br> <br> 8. Most of the time, the booking come from ulu place where season taxi 
              drivers find not profitable+risky to pickup if they can go for street 
              pickup. So paxs try UberX for no choice or newbie drivers.<br> <br> 9. No booking fee as advertised.<br> <br> 10 . No tips no matter how much you help your paxs because these are cashless paxs.<br> <br> 11. Insurance coverage lousier than Cab companies. Good luck.<br> <br> 12. You lost or spoiled the Free dunno-used-by-how-many-drivers Iphone, you pay.<br> <br> 13. Expect old car because you are not buyer. Or choose to believe they are giving you a newer car.<br> <br> 14. No relief driver for you.<br> <br> 15. Cannot join Limo group because it is not Limo.<br> <br> 16. You rejected a booking for various reason, the same booking can come
               back to you again and again and again and again and again, because you are the nearest 
              driver and no other drivers nearby.</p>
              <p>17. Uber will also inform driver which areas got surge. When all the drivers Chiong there, they turn it off</p>
              <p>18. There is no future with Uber if Airbnb is illgeal in Singapore.</p>
              <p>19. Don't think that you are upgrading to a private car. It is actually 
              downgrading to rank with the drivers whose just got their driving 
              licence.</p>

              But here some good news,
              
              1. You will not be fine by LTA if you do pickup using other people UberX account. The most is the person kenna sacked by UberX.
              
              2. Ex-rapist can drive UberX. Their management don't have your criminal records.
              
              3. An immediate driving job for those who just pass class 3 driving licence.

              <p>Uber plan is very simple. Supply followed where there is demand.</p>
              <p>So 
              they reduce the fare solely focus to get their paxs(demand).</p>
              <p>Since they 
              are a third party matching app, they required no operation costs.</p>
              <p>In 
              general, they suck 20% fare money from people greed.</p>
              <p>However, in 
              Singapore, they can't survive because taxi fare now is extremely cheap 
              for the high GDP, first world country. If Uber make it the fare cheaper, no 
              drivers can survive for that money.</p>
              <p>Still, everlasting new drivers and 
              new passengers are still fuelling Uber at the expense of the locals. Not
               much to the extent that LTA must take action, but people are not happy 
              because they feel short-changed over time.</p>
              <p>Singapore is one of 
              the highest mobile app community in the world, it's just that their 
              general plan don't fix into our general market.</p>
