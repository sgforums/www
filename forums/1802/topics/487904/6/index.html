              <p>it's ok if u already own a car, need it and wants to keep it.</p>
              <p>then doing UberX is worth looking BUT you must be prepared to spend some time on it lor. If $10-20/h is the cost of your time, then its worth.</p>
              <p>you wont see rich ppl do it. becos their time is worth $100-200/h.</p>
              <p>everyone different needs and perspective</p>
              <p>at least its an alternative route for ppl to survive.</p>
              <p>Full time uberX seems abit tough now.</p>

              Look gentlemen,
              
              Long ago, I already mentioned that our aging population is going to hit us sooner or later, and in every corner of our industries, we are facing shortage of young talents and power, and as for Taxi industry, we one of the worst of them, with average 60% above 50yo, in another 10 years, we will be facing a very diminishing of local TDs.
              
              And that is going to effect the taxi companies income, altho we have youngers one on board, but the replacing is fall short of those like me... flowing off.
              
              Yet, in the last few years, we also see many TDs getting smarter, they chute pattern to drive, where and when to drive, like somone put it, below meter not running, no mood to drive, or like my ex chief style, only quality pax at CBD then he entertain, or some only grab and grab to be ranger and elite, can even airborne with +rocket.
              
              So, base on the above, do you think taxi companies are going to remain and sit still on the present profit and perhap foreseen a diminishing of rental in near future??? Of course it is NO. Therefore pte car/taxi is the way to go, and if you see if properly, pte stuff is also created by taxi companies who rent out car to drivers...from the back door, this allow foreigner and mass market drivers into the business.

              <p>Not yet lah, thinking only. If incentives stay, can tan chiak. But if no incentives, how??</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/transport/story/uber-guarantees-minimum-hourly-earnings-private-drivers-under-new-sch"><strong>Uber guarantees minimum hourly earnings for private drivers-...</strong>.</a></p>
              <p>Before jumping in, I need to know whether a driver can survive or not doing UberX + Grabcar (and hopefully SMRTcar and ComfortCar later) - without all the incentives thrown in.</p>
              <p>I think when LTA requires all drivers to have a TDVL, then it will be good to jump because :</p>
              <p>1. Pax will be more assured that drivers are licensed and demand for cars should increase</p>
              <p>2. Fewer drivers since many of the current drivers don't have TDVL and surely many will fall out. Supply of cars decrease.</p>
              <p>More demand + less supply = good earnings for drivers.</p>
              <p>So maybe wait out a few months to see how. Meanwhile sweeping the streets still quite good...</p>

              Driving TDs switch job is never a lose lose case, because at any one time, you can come back to TDs, lot of hirers looking for relief lor. 
              
              It is not those who hold supervisionary job like executives and line managers or supervisors that once left it is very hard to get back unless you got some nice toilet papers or mill certs, Taxi driving is anytime and anywhere have as long as you hv a valid TVDL.
              
              So, it is good to venture out, test and see, if not good, can come back to TD, no harm done. But if Good, please dun forget all your brothers here hor, good lobang must share share hor....including me
