              That's why it is better not to bother other people, some of us like me also cannot take care of ourselve liao, still go bother other for fark? 
              
              Take care of your health, your family and yourself is more important, at least it make you happy and cheerful, got time, go tour, go walk walk with wife, or come here and fark or tease Bowah also happy and shiok mah, tio bo.
              
              You help or bother others, if other is ok type, response well and can talk one like me, then no problem, can make friend and brother, but many pples in this world are not like that, you help or show concern on them, they will turnaround and fark you or cheat your or blame you for their life failure. Now you know why some good friend end up fighting and quarrelling..

              <p>According to the Chinese newspaper, many waited for a long time for taxis but could not get one.</p>
              <p>After some decided to utilise the Uber app, they were taken aback by their high fares.</p>
              <p>A screenshot of a fare summary shows that one passenger was charged a

              <p>An Uber spokesperson told the Shin Min Daily News that the higher

              <p>Uber had announced a waiver of extra charges as of 9.30pm on Tuesday, but some commuters have already been charged before that. </p>
              <p>They were charged at a rate of three to five times the usual fare.</p>
              <p>Many have asked for a refund. Many others also got a free ride by using the $20 voucher applicable for first time Uber users.</p>
