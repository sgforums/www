              <p>Ah Gong not around anymore to protect TDs like last time. Pinky is more pro efficiency, money minded, as long as no public danger, this will be allowed, IMHO.</p>
              <p>It may take some time, but sooner rather than later, TDs' earnings will be affected.</p>
              <p>Some drivers will switch over but won't do them any good because UberX will eat most of their profits. Some will stay &amp; do more sweeping, competing for the smaller and smaller pool of taxi pax who don't like or don't know how to do booking.</p>
              <p>It is the wave of the future. TDs can stll survive lah but will take back lesser and lesser amounts as the wave hits them.....</p>

              For once I disagree, Uber is only paying corporate tax, not churning profit for the govt, unlike cdg and Grab taxi or even Transcab, where they hold shares, and are the former 2 major shareholder.
              
              However, as we build our economy on a liberalised manner, meaning an open economy, we cannot simply said no to investor who wish to invest in Singapore and agree to work on regulations and policies set by this country. It is a free market, and if you are to stop Uber, the world may laugh at you. 
              
              Uber is no different from private limos, as someone put it correctly, pte limos got their customer base built over the years of networking and connection. Uber driver is for people who have no connection or a network of pax to use Uber as an agent or so called middle man to connect them with pax. 
              
              So, like it or not, there are already thousand of pte limos/transportation in Singapore, Uber just took some of them out of the equation.

              Lj lah, u go sin ming there, not far from cdg office, there is lots of those funneral house, they use talkie instead of hp so that you die die also cannot say forget to bring hp or hp no battery or funny excuses. 
              
              As said, you need to be correct n punctual, smlj Jack Neo, some worst than Jack Neo, most are lao fu zi and ta fun shun type. In taxi, go wrong road the most kenna fark, in casket driving, you send wrong place or burnt the wrong corpse is a crime.

              Well, as long as you or Amos is happy in what you or he is doing, that is the most important, and for that matter, Amos is now more famous than any other actors in Singapore, he can command a high fees if Reuter or CNN wanted to interview him, if that is what he wants, so be it.
              
              The worst is got legs, but prefer to sit at kopitiam and wait for durian to drop, got hands but prefer to stir kopi, got brain, but prefer to bet on cat and dogs and horse
