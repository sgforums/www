              <p>Not yet lah, thinking only. If incentives stay, can tan chiak.
              But if no incentives, how??</p>

              private drivers-...</strong>.</a></p>
              <p>Before jumping in, I need to know whether a driver can survive
              or not doing UberX + Grabcar (and hopefully SMRTcar and ComfortCar
              later) - without all the incentives thrown in.</p>
              <p>I think when LTA requires all drivers to have a TDVL, then it
              will be good to jump because :</p>
              <p>1. Pax will be more assured that drivers are licensed and demand
              for cars should increase</p>
              <p>2. Fewer drivers since many of the current drivers don't have
              TDVL and surely many will fall out. Supply of cars decrease.</p>
              <p>More demand + less supply = good earnings for drivers.</p>
              <p>So maybe wait out a few months to see how. Meanwhile sweeping
              the streets still quite good...</p>

              <p>It is not those who hold supervisionary job like executives and

                  back unless you got some nice toilet papers or mill certs, Taxi
                  driving is anytime and anywhere have as long as you hv a valid
                  <span>TVDL</span>.</p>
              <p>So, it is good to venture out, test and see, if not good, can
                  come back to TD, no harm done. But if Good, please dun forget all

              I think from a business sense of view, UberX and grabCar also do not want to end up having a situation of got car, got pax, but no drivers. 
              
              This private car stuff is a recently entities, and could be still in it infant stage, therefore, the key now is to get drivers and improve paxs confident and availability, once they are able to secure a good market share of paxs at the lost of TDs on the road, the tide would change, incentives will drop as demand improve.
              
              And today, entry to be a UberX and grabcar driver is much easier than taking up as a taxi companies' hirer, there is no age limitation and TVDL/refresher needed. Therefore, it is a much easier entry job. As such, you will see higher competition for paxs.

              <p>The argument that chauffeured services have always been in existence is no comfort. With technology, the dynamics of the business have changed drastically. These services are in fact on-call taxis. Hence they should be regulated as such.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>technology change is on the booking system but the regulation for taxi service still need to apply.</p>
              <p>Now chauffeured services become on-call taxis. No need to pay taxi licence, no need to follow taxi licence rules and no need TDVL for drivers.</p>
              <p>Why we need the traditional taxi company and taxi service for wat?  Just a matter of time, they will close shop if the authority allow chauffeured services become on-call taxis.</p>
              <p>Like using street directory on TDVL test. LTA is ready out of touch with the current technology and what people needs and doing.</p>

              <p>Last night past 1am at SG Flyer where the Beerfest Asia was held, lots of suspicious pte car parked nearby waiting... probably uber &amp; grabcar waiting for calls. Luckily I got a ubertaxi call so went in to take pax.</p>
              <p>Later went back again, still got people and pte cars waiting there. But they can't take street pax, so I just went and take one more...lol</p>

              <p>For night drivers, very hard to get pax after 1am so this is a lobang not to be missed. Unfortunately for me, tonight off early.</p>

              <div class="entry-meta"><a class="author" rel="author" href="http://statestimesreview.com/author/zhixiang-alextanoutlook-com/">admin</a> / <a class="entry-date" href="http://statestimesreview.com/2015/06/26/judge-nus-law-professor-who-beat-up-taxi-driver-is-not-remorseful/">9 hours ago </a></div>
              <p></p>
              <p>A NUS Law Professor has been criticized by the judge for lacking 
              remorse in his attacks against a 70 year old taxi driver, which left the
               victim with serious injuries needing 17 days of medical leave (you may 
              view <a href="http://statestimesreview.com/2015/05/30/nus-ft-professor-convicted-of-drunk-assault-on-70-year-old-over-s20-cab-fare/">the original article here</a>).
               Judge Victor Yeo said that the foreigner NUS Law Professor, Sundram 
              Peter Soosay, had ample time since judgment to make compensations to the
               victim, but nothing has been offered.</p>
              <div id="attachment_623" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 166px;"><a rel="lightbox-0" href="http://statestimesreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sundram2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-623" src="http://statestimesreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sundram2.jpg" alt="Photo from NUS Law School" width="160" height="218"></a>
              <p class="wp-caption-text">Photo from NUS Law School</p>
              </div>
              <p>Judge Victor also criticized the defence’s arguments as fanciful and 
              contrived, and the NUS Law Professor’s testimony to be “riddled with 
              hindsight reasoning, convenient conjecture and hypothesis.” The judge 
              then concluded:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“The accused has shown no sign of remorse.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The judge gave the NUS Law Professor a jail term of four months and a
               court order for him to compensate the taxi driver S$1,500. The defence 
              lawyer said that his client intends to lodge an appeal against the 
              sentence.</p>
