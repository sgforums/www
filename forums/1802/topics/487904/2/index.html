              <p>Be Uber X driver better run a car rental busines.</p>
              <p>Be a TD, better run a taxi rental business.</p>
              <p>Easy talk. Who want to be Uber X or TD if they are capable to run a successful business or successful career?</p>

              <p>Looks like this Uber car thing could make bigger waves. Right now Uberx alone simply does not have the volume. But if their model works &amp; more coys like GT jump in with their own version like Grabcar, then maybe TDs like us can jump in. The reason is by then we wont be depending solely on Uber n the booking vol might be enough to make a good living.</p>

              <p>Car ownership in Singapore belong to the rich. for many avg income people, how to has a car for personal use that they are afford.</p>
              <p>Uber X could be the answer. it allow u to make some money that help u to finance yr car.</p>
              <p>Also, many TD in Singapore belong to the retiree, their daily target income is very minimum. these group of TD dont really need a lot of vol per day. Lower rental cost will also mean shorter hour to cover cost. Importantly, they have a car for their personal use without the need to fork out a lot of money to own car.</p>

              UberX maybe the next kind of transport taking over taxi in the world, but that will take a certain period of time, most of those who took UberX are mostly exposed to oversea experiences with them, like in New york or the west, it is gaining traction even tho taxi drivers in those countries are protesting.
                  
              But for asian, which is more traditional in a way, will take a much longer time to adapt to the changes, and for most of us here, by the time UberX kind of business come into a full blown way of transporting peoples in Singapore, we are history, including this forum and its  moderators
                  
              So, not to worry too much, just drive on whatever you deem fit

              I reckon street hail beats uber app call.
              all things being equal such as the petrol.
              and prime taxi got peak hour charges.

              <p>I think Uberx is not as good as taxi (with all the various apps combined) because you only get calls from Uber &amp; not the other apps &amp; cannot take street pax.</p>
              <p>Only good thing is the surge pricing which can be more than $100 per trip duirng hot periods like CNY, Christmas, etc</p>
              <p>But you need to consider that Uber takes 20% off your gross earnings and you have to get a decent car which is less than 5 years old and most likely use petrol, not diesel. Although rent can be quite cheap (like $50 per day), this may not be enough.</p>
              <p>Heard that on average, a Uberx driver can expect to get 7-10 calls. Also rides tend to be cheaper compared to taxi except during hot periods where there are surge pricing.</p>
              <p>One more thing - went down to their office and saw one driver pleading to the staff to reinstate him because he got suspended. Yes, they have a rating system and if you fall below a certain threshold like say 4.6 out of 5, they will monitor and may suspend you.</p>
              <p>So overall, not the worth the risk if you are already a TD. If you are not a TD, maybe can give a try to earn some extra cash lah.</p>

              This has peeved several taxi drivers, who told TNP that their livelihood is at stake.
               
              "This is very unfair," said 50-year-old taxi driver A. L. Tan in Mandarin when told of Uber's airport surcharge.
               
              "Uber is stealing our rice bowl. They don't have to follow LTA pricing, yet they are providing the same service. Not only that, they don't even need to wait in line under the hot sun."
               
              Another taxi driver, who spoke to TNP on condition of anonymity, said he is "outraged" at the current situation.
               
              The cabby, who is in his 60s, said the airport route is getting unprofitable because of the queues and the fact that the airport is usually far from their last drop-off point.
               
              Said the cabby: "The $5 surcharge makes it profitable and I don't want it reduced. But now it may not be competitive."
               
              The National Taxi Association (NTA), which represents cabbies here, wants LTA to look into the matter.
               
              "Based on feedback from taxi drivers, many of them hope LTA can ensure that competing services comply with existing regulations on private hire vehicle," said NTA president Gerald Chan.
               
              He also hopes that Uber drivers receive vocational training and abide by LTA's "strict set of service rules", similar to what taxi drivers have to go through.
               
              Added Mr Chan: "Perhaps, LTA can consider imposing similar requirements for drivers in these competing services that cater to the public."
               
              But Mr Tang, who has nearly four years' experience as a personal chauffeur, disagrees that Uber services are encroaching into taxi drivers' territories.
               
              Rather than price, he believes that customers prefer Uber because of convenience and service quality.
               
              All UberX and UberExec drivers have to be employed by a company that already offers limousine services and have to be covered by commercial insurance to be an Uber partner, said its spokesman.
               
              "Because of our limousine background, we know how to be safe drivers, how to provide good service and most of us can speak English," said Mr Tang, who drives a Toyota Wish.
               
              He argued that taxi drivers have several ways to get passengers, while UberX and UberExec drivers are not allowed to pick up passengers who hail them and can only do so via the Uber app.
               
              "Their concerns are unjustified. If taxi drivers are afraid of losing business to us, they should look at their own qualities," said Mr Tang.

              Some countries already ban Uber, Singapore Uber can consider themselve lucky to still be able to operate. The final pinch on the govt aka LTA to seriously look into this issue was due to the fake Uber driver $93 fare, otherwise, Singapore, driven by a free economy market concept, LTA may not want to intervene.
                  
              So, like it or not, if really Uber end up, as the proposed bill stated, only taxis and TDVL holders then can drive for them, we have to seriously thanks this fake Uber driver, I may paid him a visit at Changi chalet.
              
              And also as I said, not only TD are not happy, the taxi companies are also against it, because both rice bowl are at stake.
              
              In the business enviroment of Singapore, level playing field is only a TCSS phrase, there can never be a level playing field when it come into profit making, so instead of I pat your back you pat my back, it will be I eat you, you eat me and see who dare to eat more. So, end up the policy makers would have to intervene.

              Another issue that Govt Aka LTA look into it is national security. Apps like hailo or grabtaxi uses TDs as partner, and as TDs are all registered, the framework is in line with the regulations. Of cos, grab and many other also hv pte booking using another name.
              
              Uber on the other hands, have a pools of non registered drivers, it could be ex TD with no TDVL or any tom and dick on the road. That post a security issue in term of terrorism act and many others offences.
