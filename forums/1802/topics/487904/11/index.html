              Hello, Singapore is facing an aging population, more death paxs are coming, and coupled with lack of casket driver (experience ones), there is alot of booking..cemetery or colarbarium like it or not, one of these day, everyone have to visit one, even LKY also hv to visit, so to visit earlier and get to know the place also good mah.
              
              No lah, sending the death to their resting place is a good deed, moreover death pax dun complain one, I was thinking of recommending my ah fool to drive casket, because he tends to get lots of complain from living pax.
              
              And for yr info, due to business pick up in funneral, cdg is thinking of opening up a transportation service for funneral, including casket and buses

              <p>I think you can switch full-time to casket driving since there are so many bookings.</p>
              <p>Are you saying more and more Singaporeans are dying?</p>
              <p>I think unlikely for Comfort to enter that small market.  The casket businessmen sure provide "Bao Ka Liao" service since got money to make and sure expand if got more money to make.  Comfort people totally ignorant about Yin funeral procedures.</p>

              Singaporean no doubt are living longer, unlike in the 60s or 70s whereby most Singaporean have pre mature death by the age of 60+, now 60+ olso cannot retire, still working, so on average the age of male dying is at 76yo and female 78yo.
              
              So, base on this figure, the parents of those baby blooming period are now typically going to die soon, just a matter of a peaceful death or suffering till no bones death.
              
              Therefore, there is a lucrative business in it, and no casket driver are permanent staff, most like taxi drivers, are on contractual basis, freelance, the different is how many sai kong, priest, imans, nuns and monks you know, because they will contact the agent like Singapore casket to engage you.

              As long as you are still earning a decent living/earning as a taxi driver, why go care abt Uber, to me, Uber is under a very very rich sponsorship, richer than temasek put together, and they are global in nature, and they do spying work too.

              Overwork is common for newbies, most of us when first start driving cabs, it was like driving non stop, man against machine (car) and see who can last longer kind of situation.
              
              Therefore, for grab and uber, there are many newbies, although some are ex TDs, but the nature of driving are different in newer environment. And many a time, newbie will like to make $$ more than their previous experiences, and that can be fatal both physically and mentally.
              
              Like any thing we undertook, we must learn abt Safety, which is not really taught to drivers, and that is sad. Like we save our money, we also make sure it is safe and can hv good return, we also teach our kids or fellow friends on being safe on this and that, and all paying jobs hv a set of safe act to follow, but as freelance, you are on yr own, therefore the safety really hv to built from yourself. Motto: Go out alive, come back alive

              Let them be lah, Singapore introducing Uber and Grab is in a way also eroding our youngs progression, due to no age limitation, young will choose the easy way out of life in making a living, these will in fact lead to younger ones failing to upgrade themselves and in turn, lose out it competitiveness in a knowledge base economy.
              
              In the 90s, when LTA rule that only 30 yo and above can apply for TVDL and drive taxi, it got a reason behind it, being more mature, or married and unable to seek a job within, a man in 30++ can better hold fort, and altho it is set at 30s, it is more for the 40s and above.

              <p>What are the requirements as a casket driver?  Do we need to carry the body or coffin?  Do we see badly smashed up bodies due to accidents?</p>

              If just merely driving casket, the paid is not high, you need to join funneral parlour company, preferably those well established one like Singapore casket and fairprice casket, from there you will be sent for courses in handling bodies and casket driving rules and regulations including de registration, handling of toxication, fumigation, preservation, some police procedure in handling the dead.
              
              By knowning all these, get tested and pass like TVDL, you can do multi tasking instead of just driving casket. So it is up to you to decide which levels you want to go, you can study all or you can also study casket drivng alone, then slowly take those other courses at night. 
              
              When you are able to handle all the procedure, you get paid more. But handling of body is no joke, some one day doing it only, give up liao.

              <p>To be honest, I believe that casket is a lucrative business.  Let me sum up:</p>
              <p>1)  Doctors can do it (post-mortem, certification, perform operation, etc), its not a small feat.  They (doctors) are smart and <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">gung ho and i</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">t is good money for them and downstream (priests, sai gong, musicians, rental of rooms or tentage, catering biz, drivers, private columbarium, etc.).</span></p>
              <p>2)  Everyone has to go through it (birth at hospital, eat at food centres, sick see doctor, die return to dust).  It is a necessity, not an elastic demand.</p>
              <p>3)  Barriers to entry are there because not everyone can stand to see dead bodies everyday, it is hot (not in air con office) and 24 hours on standby.</p>
              <p>4)  It is lucrative because if you see the obituary page, there is a daugher-father team and the daugher is very pretty.  Why?  Because it is a lucrative and honorable job.</p>
              <p>Bowen, are the courses in handling bodies and casket driving rules and regulations including de registration, handling of toxication, fumigation, preservation, some police procedure in handling the dead conducted in-house by Singapore Casket or by external training provider?</p>
              <p>I want to start part time first, to test myself (endurance, ease of handling it, etc.).  I want to try on weekends and I wonder if they need part time staff.</p>
              <p>To do embalming, must be licensed by MOH &amp; NEA.  I don't think I just want to do embalming cos only 1 function i.e. boring.  Casketing is more multi-faceted and fulfilling.</p>

              Yalor, that is why you need to hv a vocational licence too, because you are handling bodies, it can be recall for criminal investigation,
              
              I personally saw CID people arresting relatives at hospital mortuary due to foul play and you as the collector, have to act and get the clearance from CID clarify the issue, so, as I said, at times, it is not so easy.
              
              There are also cases of 2 parlours called upon by different relatives, because the deceased had 2 wives or who are so rich that the siblings are trying to snatch the body so as to get a stronger foothold on his fortune.
              
              So, you need to learn on how the procedure work with police, learn the skill of speaking in public so as not to offend relatives, and so on, which in turn become experiences like TDs on the road should know that most of the thing you experienced are not taught in the classroom.
              
              And then, unlike TDs, you got a boss up there shouting at you......where the FARK are you, why haven't take the body.......the next body waiting for YOU...what the FARK are you DOing!!!

              <p>Impressive.  I can feel for them.  All these are real-life happenings and TV drama also always show such storyline.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------</p>
              <p>I just got a reply from the casket company "Sorry, we do not take in part-timers. However, we thank you for your interest.  You can send me your resume with photo attached, for future openings."</p>
              <p>I already got very nice photo taken.  But why give them my resume with photo?  They want me to submit for wat?</p>
