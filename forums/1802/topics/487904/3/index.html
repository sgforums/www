              <p>Don't think TDVL given to citizens is all about national security or terrorism. Rather it is a political move by our late great leader who thinks TDs can influence the ground with their chatter &amp; reach with the common people and foreigners. He thinks only, rightly or wrongly. Or maybe Ah Gong really cares about TDs which I highly doubt so.</p>
              <p>But now with social media, TDs' influence not that great anymore.</p>
              <p>Uber will stay here lah. It is a very good, innovative idea, why kick it out? Just because TDs complain? No way. As long as they make it safe for public, it should be alowed to stay here.</p>

              Nobody is kicking Uber out, as said, we are a liberalised economy with a liberal mindset, and we are not collective, but very individualistic and have our own rights on different opinons just like having differences, with all due respect, in our asshole shape.
              
              Terrorism is just part of the factor, not the major one, however, it cannot be compromise, the key here is trace ability and take responsibility, govt want business to be social responsible, safe and yet properous so as to create more jobs and opportunity for people living here. 
              
              By enforcing rules and regulations at Uber and all other 3rd apps is for the betterment of this country, you and me and our family.

              <p>Taxi drivers can Complain all they like but they are the ones who started zooming pass passengers with available signs while waiting for calls during peak hours pissing off passengers in the first place. Let's just say Uber has its own niche market. Majority of the peak period, uberx is cheaper than taxi as long as there's no surge charge as fare starts off at 3.50 and zero booking fees. </p>

              Agree waiting is a strategy at CBD, now you know the famous 13 CBD paxs legacy. 
                  
              Limpek also wait for call, but sometime reach there with good destination shown, 2 paxs board, one go the good destination, selegie, still within CBD, the other going to sembawang...since took the call already.,..hard to reject...siao liao, go Sembawang park PCC lor

              Nowaday, it is not about earning how much, it is about spending how much, some like me earning $1k-$100 per mth also can pass life easily, some 10k per mth also not enuf, somemore want to borrow money from me.
              
              And to be frank, what is 7k today? normal, the last time, my ex chief once told me, if someone pay him 4k per month, he will give up taxi driving, and that was about 4 to 5 years ago when he said it.
              
              Today, if I will to ask him again, he may tell me, at least 7k and above then, maybe, he will give up taxi driving.
              
              The cost of living and high inflation are getting higher and faster by the years, u can hardly find $3 fish soup and 70cts kopi. Let be frank about it, 7k is only an average income. As I said before, today, if you apply for bursary for yr kids or any kind of govt subsidies, the houshold income must be below $3k. That is the benchmark for the lower income group, so, if you are earning $2,999 per mth, you are consider the lower income group.
              
              And just last decade, earning 3k is a manager paid, today, it is consider a low paid

              Uber is just the consignor, sending a goods (which in this case: a job to pick up pax) to a driver, who act as a consignee, who accepted the job in the name of the consignor, that is Uber.
              
              Retailers like Courts, best denki, gain city, challenger and so on are all on consigment business, they do not own anything in their store, everything belong to the consignees, be it Sony, Samsung, LG or philip...they send their goods to these consignor to sell for them. 
              
              Can sell or cannot sell, is not Courst or Best problem, but as long as they sell, they get  get profit, that encourage them to sell, so when you buy a philip shaver from Best denki, you will said, I bought a philip shaver from Best denki and not from philip direct. 
              
              Same goes to a lady pax who took Uber, she will said, I took a cab from Uber service, very nice, good service and driver very handsome...his name...sound like bow...wah

              This are modern business model where the need of asset is not necessary or minimum. You either need set up a good IT software or a warehouse or a shopping space to commence, but of course there are risk involved, but minimum as most do not have backlog asset to take care, and when thing do not work out, they can just pack and go. That create mobility for Uber who can hope from country to country without a need of goods transfer.
              
              Same goes those online shopping from groupon to tabao (my bro CT favorite), they dun own anything, just have a warehouse, packet and some admin staff. And that alone, destroyed many retailers on the street that hv to pay for rental, show room, and so on.

              with GrabCar, offering premium 4-seaters, as well as 6- and 13-seaters 
              for passengers. As of April, there has also been a new and more 
              affordable addition to its private car services — GrabCar (Economy). To 
              celebrate the launch of the new service, GrabTaxi is also giving out

              private car to pick you up. And much like you would with taxi-booking,
