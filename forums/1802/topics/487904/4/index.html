              <p>keepthechange666 is correct. This kind of budget car taxi service, Singapore actually have for ages. The pirate taxi market is very niche. GT (economy) could have been done in Malaysia long long time ago. Why now then start a legal pirate taxi? Obviously they made more from using luxury cars and genuine taxis.</p>
              <p>The poor driver got biz only during peak hrs. Off peak who want to sit in an old car? Especially those KTV hostesses and beautiful girls, you think they are even bothered to download GT app? So you end up with taiko pax. The worse customers.</p>
              <p>Stick with your current taxi and dont get itchy lah.</p>

              <h1>GrabTaxi’s GrabCar (Economy) Is The Affordable Private
              Car Service That Could Take Over Singapore</h1>
              <p>Back in July 2014, popular taxi-booking service GrabTaxi
              expanded its pool of available drivers with GrabCar, offering
              premium 4-seaters, as well as 6- and 13-seaters for passengers. As
              of April, there has also been a new and more affordable
              addition to its private car services — GrabCar (Economy). To
              celebrate the launch of the new service, GrabTaxi is also giving
              out GrabCar coupons to passengers.</p>
              <p>If you are one of the 3.8 million people who have downloaded the
              GrabTaxi app on their phones, you will be able to book an
              affordable private car to pick you up. And much like you would with
              taxi-booking, the app will pair you up with an available driver.
              According to GrabTaxi, the number of users who have tried GrabCar
              since its launch earlier......</p>

              <p>No idea at all. UberX seems a bad deal. Don't know anything about Grabcar. Whatever it is, even with Grabcar coming in, don't think earnings can match taxi. If want to do, must have some a good sideline biz then join Uberx/Grabcar to help cover car costs lah.</p>

              <p>Those agents, whether doing roadshows, real estate or insurance should have many things on their mind and many places to run. If they even need to depend on UberX or GrabCar to cover costs, then their main biz is really not doing very well. Cover here and there, with each trip, inclusive of waiting for call and the journey itself, taking around an hour in total for a miserable below-$20 fare net. Not worth the time at all.</p>

              <p>Those agents, whether doing roadshows, real estate or insurance
              should have many things on their mind and many places to run. If

              their main biz is really not doing very well. Cover here and there,
              with each trip, inclusive of waiting for call and the journey

              <p>i think some trades like property and insurance not doing so well, otherwise they will get their own car. so instead of the heavy cost, get a sideline to supplement some income as well as the vehicle. least it looks more presentable vs the cost of a hirer of a taxi.</p>

              Grab car will be a direct competition to Uber, UberX only said their driver get 10 jobs per day, that is a marketing statement,
              
              In actual, tia kong only average 4 to 6 jobs, if you join Grab Car, you may tap on the economy of scale, however, you will be more busy and stressful in keeping up with the booking and timming aka punctuality, if one Uber pax suddenly call you to wait for 15 minutes, and you get a grab car pax to take in the nex 1/2 an hr.

              And please be aware that those using UberX or grab car paxs, they alway like to put themselve at the upper class than those taxi paxs, their demands are more and expect good service. 
              
              I personally had seen UberX driver having to load heavy bagages whereby the pax do not help, and once saw on driver having to take care of kids for the pax while she go to buy something...so it is a not like Taxi driving.
              
              Many TDs, psychologically speaking, like to try different things, that is good, because of after driving taxi for quite sometime, it become sedentary for them, so anything on the other shore sound and look good to them.
              
              But to be frank, IMHO, (In My Honest Opinon), be it TD, UberX or grab smlj, you are still a driver, only different is you work differently.

              Learn to crawl first??? but now I am crawling on my house floor, sit too long, cannot stand up liao..old liao...go back to crawling again.
              
              My take is....
              
              Please please, if those who are still in their 30s or early 40s, please go take a course with skil fund provided by govt, there are nearly 1,700 kind of trade available in e2i, learn something that is free and you got nothing to loose but more to gain, forget about all this smlj UberX or grabcar or even my bro KTC ill advices.
              
              For those in their late forties to early 50s, please please, drive with care and continue to upgrade if possible to UberX or grabCar or whatever you think you can gain experiences at a relaxing pace, you still got time to try, and even not successful, experiences and skills gained and thereby can better advice others who wish to venture into it rather than listen to someone who never drive for Uber or grab, so to speak.
              
              And for those in late 50s to 60s and above like me, if you are still aiming for high target, high expectation and high pressure environment, please please, stop it,. As Nike put it, Just do it, it is for the younger ones, for this group, you better use the Reebok one, Life is Short, play hard

              <p>Wah I see this topic I itchy Liao...</p>
              <p>actually, these limo driver and limo company who join uber are killing themselves. Nowadays where got pax pay limo rate?? No more Liao as now all these pax are being pampered by these 3rd party apps. You want limo? Pay flat rate of $50 and above then got standard. U limo driver? Then you take standard limo rate of $50 and above. Why go spoil pax let them use Uber meter? You buy one car at $200 plus K or rent a car at $3500 per month to do Uber job?? U come out to do business but you let Uber decide how much your services are worth???</p>
              <p>talking about this, CDG started this nonsense with $10/$18 plus meter for limo. Why do until like that?</p>
              <p>that being said, my business now slow down. Why? A number of reasons, maybe</p>
              <p>1)my car old Liao (8 yrs old)</p>
              <p>2)too easy to grab taxi nowadays, no need our limo, moreover nowadays taxi all atas, Hyundai i40, Renault, Kia all shook shiok good enough</p>
              <p>3)uber and grab car sharing the slice of our pie</p>
              <p>4)global economy uncertainty.</p>
              <p>anyway, I also thinking if 1 day I cannot survive, I will also join uber and do their meter job..</p>

              <p>Your van new or old does not make much difference. Most of the pax going for the lowest bidder.</p>
              <p>Uber and Grab sure made things worse. Somemore their GST too high lah. At least CDG provide a car. They got nothing to worry about and still want to collect $7 ?</p>
