              <p>Wonder if anyone from this forum has tried or is currently an UberX driver. Not Ubertaxi.</p>
              <p>Just want to know if this is a viable biz for SG market. Are there enough calls to make a living?</p>
              <p>I am currently doing Ubertaxi and can get 4-5 calls during evening peak. Morning peak not sure but think about the same. Also doing other apps and street hails so maybe this is not an accurate indication of demand from Ubertaxi.</p>
              <p>Would appreciate any info on UberX if you know anyone doing it. Thanks.</p>

              <p>UberX can only take bookings. Taxi can pick n go anywhere. UberX requires either u get a rental car with commercial insurance, or u transfer yr car to a business and change to commercial insurance from private.</p>
              <p>Take note some rental companies have cars on private insurance, which is not legal. I know because I saw before.</p>
              <p>Yr costs is not cheap and is on par with a normal taxi. This route is for people who lost their taxi license. Stick with the taxi and forget about uber.</p>
              <p>Lastly yr taxi comes with free nets and credit card machine. Uber pax can only pay by credit card through uber. No more 'keep the change', and collecting $100 instead of $10 from drunk paxes. Also no more collecting $1000 instead of $50 from foreigners who are colour blind....</p>

              <p>Yesterday saw an aunty just came out from uber office, she went to enquire abt uberX</p>
              <p>She said many of her colleagues do uberX, reason being : its better to get stuck in the jam and get paid for it when she go home then getting nothing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> . She's a working aunty with a car.</p>
              <p>She mention many of her insurance and property agent friends doing uberX too, and get many postiive feedback. They do it when they are free and , since they already have a car, better generate some income with it then let it depreciate away.</p>

              <p>Uber company was originally formed with the reasons i stated above,</p>
              <p>Ubertaxi was implemented to appease the wrath of taxi drivers, cos many car owners are taking away a big part of income from real taxi drivers</p>
              <p>If you havn't notice , ubertaxi's cash incentives are getting lesser and lessor by the week, one day, when there are no more incentives, many taxi drivers may quit ubertaxi (some of my freinds have quit using ubertaxi now) and that time those ubertaxi passenger will switch to uberX as they are used to uber platform , and then uberX drivers will huat big time</p>

              Ubernisation is here to stay, that it the trend, UberX..X meaning executive, most car rental companies hv commerical insurance, so they rent to people to do UberX and at the same time, these people can use it for themselves to go to work and also for their family, with UberX, they will be able to cover the cost of the rental and earn some profit.
              
              And especially in a high cost of Car ownership in Singapore, many peoples opts for this route, no need to buy road tax, insurance or paid high COE, even servicing and maintenence is done by the rental company, why not.
              
              There is another group of driver who drive company's Car, mostly are marketing and sales people, as company's car, it buy commerical insurance and an open market COE, ie Cat E category. These people will do for UberX due to their flexibility of time and mostly on weekend.
              
              And to add more salt, as these people are from marketing and sales, their skills of serving customers (paxs) and communciation is good, so many paxs will go back to book them.
              
              In my view, what hit most from UberX in near future is not we, the normal taxis driver, it will be more on limo drivers, both pte and companies, might get less booking due to UberX.

              <p>Yes, but also no fare cheats. And it is very fast, no need to waste time counting money and waiting for the nets and credit card trans to go through.</p>
              <p>I am doing ubertaxi and it is also like that. Only thing is payment is delayed for 3 business days, sometimes longer due to cockups. As long as they pay on time most of the time, I will continue to use Ubertaxi. Sometimes can save you from ulu places like CCK, Yishun, etc,</p>
              <p>UberX is a big risk if you don't already own car. If you rent, your earnings go to the rental company (you are supposed to be an employee, another risk factor, if found out by LTA). The rental company will then pay you after Uber pays them!</p>

              Renting a Car for own usage and at the same time do UberX is good. He might be working that need a car, today company provide an allowance for car only, so by using that allowances, he rent a car instead of buying for his works, his family outing and shopping, then on weekends or some nights, he can bids for UberX job.

              <p>if rent a car, pay in advance to earn money is crazy. Rent a car also can for private use. If you can't afford or dont need to anymore, then stop renting. If you want to change type of car also car.</p>
              <p>Then, own a car, which need to pay much more money in advance and dont know whether can earn back the money is even more crazy. Own a car, if you cannot afford or dont need to anymore, sell and lose money. Want to change car also can, lose money again.</p>

              <p>Agree with most of what you say. While UberX is a money spinner for Uber, the drivers aren't earning much. So they will end up with lots of part time drivers rather than full time taxi driver types.</p>
              <p>If LTA does not tighthen more, UberX may eventually kill off the traditional taxi biz model. May or may not because UberX also comes with the scary "surge pricing" which many pax are not willing to risk.</p>
              <p>So there could be a camp of loyal taxi pax who will stick to the taxi service - either street hail or booking - because they trust the meter (implicitly LTA &amp; traffic police who govern this).</p>
              <p>Maybe a segmented market will emerge but cannot discount the negative effect from UberX for the taxi industry.</p>

              Aiya, whatever it is, all are out to make profits, apps, taxis companies, Uber or any other form of public transport are there to make profits, and we are the labourer of it, passenger aka consumer are the paid master.
              
              So, like it or not, be it Uber X or Z, they are all here to stay, to churn whatever business and profit they can take, all at the expense of Singapore drivers and cars, be it you are the TD or pte drivers. 
              
              To know more, best is to join and understand it, but make sure you sign with your eyes open. There are pros and cons in every ways, no one will startup a business that put partnership in difficulties, otherwise, their business would had closed shop.

              <p>Looks like this Uber car thing could make bigger waves. Right now Uberx alone simply does not have the volume. But if their model works &amp; more coys like GT jump in with their own version like Grabcar, then maybe TDs like us can jump in. The reason is by then we wont be depending solely on Uber n the booking vol might be enough to make a good living.</p>
              <p>Wait &amp; see first....</p>

              <p>Depend on how much u want to pay and the way u plan to use the vehice, there is another option for u to rental a car and make some income to help u to pay for the car.</p>
              <p>Paying deposit/cash avdance and minimum term is common , it apply to all rent items/services not only for car rental.</p>

              <p>this apply to the rich that can own car without any financial difficult.</p>
              <p>Many people on the ground do not belong to the rich but still wish to have a car his personal use.</p>
              <p>Your statement sound like, PMET be TD, must be crazy......</p>
              <p>When you understand the real situation happen to the PMET/people want to own a car; then you will not say crazy.</p>
