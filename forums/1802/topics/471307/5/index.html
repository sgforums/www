              <p>I never report but I got 2 accidents before..one is lorry bang
              my backside and another is carpark I reverse and back another

              <p>They also say my performance unsatisfactory..I dun have any
              complaints from pax..I suspect is I never take enough calls..they
              called me and reminded me that I need to take 30calls a mths..</p>
              <p>I know is not mileages because I average 320km per day.</p>

              <p>Definitely because of accidents. The reverse one which is your fault and this one which you settled privately but in sufficiently because you or CDG cannot claim from the woman anymore because of the settlement, hence it's conisdered another fault. 2 accidents CDG = red card.</p>
              <p>It's just the way it is with them - but i think their premium is the lowest $1k, other coys charge more I believe, hence they draw the line at 2.</p>
              <p>For calls it should not be an issue - you are new they cannot force you to do something without offering something in return. If me, I surely will write and fire them and declare my intention to bring this to attention of NTUC MPs.</p>
              <p>CDG if you know how to tackle them officially they can back down from certain things, which is not so proper. But accidents this one their policy which is not wrong so bo pian.</p>
              <p>I suggest you go drive red.</p>

              <p>Very good advise from mentor.</p>
              <p>Amd the answer should be obvious to the question.....</p>
              <p>Of course the call, extra $3 (or $2.85 after cut levy). If sweep, make it and get pax at 9.25am, can you recover back the $2.80 in 5 mins? And what if you cannot find the a pax in the last 5 mins, or get one at 9.29? You only get 80cts extra, $1 max.</p>
              <p>Of course the call can be no show too, but 9.25 should be genuine, because once hit 9.30 becomes much tougher to get cab.</p>

              <p>Strange as this seems, it's actually quite true and correct. I also have a friend driving Freed for Prime. I asked him why take this car, like cramped what plus petrol some more?</p>
              <p>He said driving it was very comfortable for him and his petrol cost is actually cheaper than his diesel cost when he drove for CDG before.</p>
              <p>Of course petrol you must drive calmly, not aggressively. Burned more fuel burn more hole in pocket.</p>

              <p>Amd the answer should be obvious to the question.....</p>
              <p>Of course the call, extra $3 (or $2.85 after cut levy). If
              sweep, make it and get pax at 9.25am, can you recover back the
              $2.80 in 5 mins? And what if you cannot find the a pax in the last
              5 mins, or get one at 9.29? You only get 80cts extra, $1 max.</p>
              <p>Of course the call can be no show too, but 9.25 should be
              genuine, because once hit 9.30 becomes much tougher to get cab.</p>
