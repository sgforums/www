              <p>I've tried taking call...I find the good thing abt their calls is ulu place also no scare. This is really the strength of the system. I did try and take more calls during off peak hr but still not enough to hit target......I am more incline toward sweeping..I keep a little book where to find pax at which hr and which location in every neighbourhood I am in...which area pax are likely to go to which area.</p>
              <p>Is not stressful..I just don't like to rush just to meet the ETA time. Sometime, traffic is unpredictable and newer driver like me don't really know how to avoid traffic and know the short cut. Some paxs also demand a lot more when they have to pay $2 or $3 more for their ride. I was ever screamed at by a pax when I took a toilet break before going for the job (I was on time too!)</p>
              <p>Anyway, before I got the letter..I target 5 calls a days which I hit but well..too late lah.</p>
              <p>I guess is my lack of confident that really do me in..I have to admit that the REAL reason I avoid call is that I am afraid that I might not know the location the pax is going and the pax get pissed.</p>

              <p>u need to be selective with bookings. when u are seasoned enough, u know some bookings are waste of time when u are confident u can get a street job anytime. those at taxi stand or road side are high chance of aeroplane as some will just grab any empty cab that comes along.such pick up places are also a lure to bring cabs there and then cancel the booking</p>
              <p>with the extra u can get from (current)bookings, u need to backtrack the risk of aeroplane pax upon arrival, cancellation when u detour to the pick up point.(advance)booking, u need to make ample time to go pick up location. so least 30mins before job, u have to go empty to pick up point if u can coordinate your journey..so all in all the extras is a make up for your empty vehicle to the pick up</p>
              <p>i think being a TD is most profitable when u are always on the move, one drop one get on, is better than bookings.</p>

              <p>I've tried taking call...I find the good thing abt their calls
                  is ulu place also no scare. This is really the strength of the
                  system. I did try and take more calls during off peak hr but still
                  not enough to hit target......I am more incline toward sweeping..I
                  keep a little book where to find pax at which hr and which location
                  in every neighbourhood I am in...which area pax are likely to go to
                  which area. <span style="color: #0000ff;">there's no gurantee to pax travel pattern</span></p>
              <p>Is not stressful..I just don't like to rush just to meet the ETA
                  time. Sometime, traffic is unpredictable and newer driver like me
                  don't really know how to avoid traffic and know the short cut. Some
                  paxs also demand a lot more when they have to pay $2 or $3 more for
                  their ride. I was ever screamed at by a pax when I took a toilet
                  break before going for the job (I was on time too!)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">yes, those paying adv booking fee will expect more. expect u to be on time or even earlier. if u are late, u expect to get just normal fares or a bloody discounted fare. traffic issues while on your way to pick up point, u could try to manage with pax by calling them, if they can't wait, they may just cancel their booking and u can forget about the job, some will be willing to wait, least they are informed by u as traffic condition is something u have no control of. whats important is when they are informed, they are more calm</span></p>
              <p>Anyway, before I got the letter..I target 5 calls a days which I
                  hit but well..too late lah.</p>
              <p>I guess is my lack of confident that really do me in..I have to
                  admit that the REAL reason I avoid call is that I am afraid that I
                  might not know the location the pax is going and the pax get
                  pissed.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">as u are using GPS, it should be good enough, don't know location can always ask for road name or nearest landmark. or call buddies for help. least u try than to being pax to wrong place. a smartphone street directory app should also help. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">street job u may also end up with a unknown location. though u feel u can just get pax to get off vehicle or u may interview them before they get on vehicle. but there are times some pax can show u the way, if u don't know the route and give excuse and say u are new. but as said earlier, any unknown location is a chance for u to discover and add on to your knowledge. only when pax and driver is equally blur, then use gps or call a colleague</span></p>
              <p>And it is also the above that I tried to maxi my sweeping
                  skill.</p>

              <p>late for 10mins. start meter about after 5 mins into journey as i was in panic mode.</p>
              <p>rush pax to destination within their sipulated time. upon arrival, they told me not paying my adv fee, just normal meterred fare WITH DEDUCTIONS,  as the fare was like 15.50, they just give me $14.</p>
              <p>i was pissed, but they show hand only upon arrival and i was late, i lan lan suck thumb. called coy not to deduct the booking levy as pax didn't want to pay. but sallow it as it was me that was late due to peak hr traffic and deep inside me, i curse him that karma will take its own course.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">tell myself IF i were to know better, rather hit NO SHOW around the area and go off as such pax already called COY to show their impatience. high chance sure kenna the flame from them..</span></p>

              <p>once i was late to a adv due to peak hr traffic jams.</p>
              <p>pax called operator, operator called me, and i explained
              myself.</p>
              <p>late for 10mins. start meter about after 5 mins into journey as
              i was in panic mode.</p>
              <p>rush pax to destination within their sipulated time. upon
              arrival, they told me not paying my adv fee, just normal meterred
              fare WITH DEDUCTIONS,  as the fare was like 15.50, they just
              give me $14.</p>
              <p>i was pissed, but they show hand only upon arrival and i was
              late, i lan lan suck thumb. called coy not to deduct the booking
              levy as pax didn't want to pay. but sallow it as it was me that was
              late due to peak hr traffic and deep inside me, i curse him that
              karma will take its own course.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">tell myself IF i were to know
              better, rather hit NO SHOW around the area and go off as such pax
              already called COY to show their impatience. high chance sure kenna
              the flame from them..</span></p>
              <p>so in summary, adv booking fee has its cost and
              responsibilities. </p>
