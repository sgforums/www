              <p>Let him be la Uncle 310.</p>
              <p>So hard for him to get such a change and support. Let him enjoy and unleashed himself. Dun think he can get further than giving me mosquito bites. His most "lethal" tool he already passed to someone liao.</p>
              <p>Cloning me? want to clone also must have the style and the standard la. One look or rather "one read" only u want tell who wrote all those stuff, no need check IP address. Only retarded people like him can think of nick like JunxiangBJ and Bangjames and he think all people here are as retarded as him to believe his antics.</p>
              <p>Haha, a person who cannot even expressed himself in words in real life, write also got similar traits.</p>
              <p>Looking at all their anti gay post, like "exposing" people gay a big breakthough. Making people think that gay people are more inferior than they - straight people.</p>
              <p>You people see and judge yourself. Bingjames or Blow job or junxiang whom they accused to be gay? He got the guts to take on the whole forum and even when he is "exposed" still stand up and fight.</p>
              <p>One "straight" MAN who u see, cannot even fight himself for his "greivances" but to pass people information to fight for him and now using other ppl's ID to create havoc in here. While u are at it, do check up this guy by the nick of "johnbtm" in that Blowing wind site u talking about.</p>
              <p>Another MAN cannot even fight on people's term as cyber fighter but to resort to digging up unrelated personal issue to fight. (opps he didn't really have to "dick" up, ppl passed to him. But he even got to cheek to go around bragging how resourcesful he is as a policeman). Now he even threaten to come to my house and "exposed" to my wife. </p>
              <p>Yet another super MAN, man of all man, who just not even man enough to keep his words but used any small excuses to break it by abusing his authorites to delete every single post which he promised not to and replace it with slanderous comments that he think can hurt me.</p>
              <p>See these three MAN's behaviour. Even who you call an "old gay" got more character, guts and attitude than you.</p>
              <p>What more can u "MEN" do? MEN who have dick but no balls.</p>

              even got to cheek to go around bragging how resourcesful he is as a
              policeman). Now he even threaten to come to my house and "exposed"

              <p>Yet another super MAN, man of all man, who just not even man

              <p>Hi to everyone!</p>
              <p>A short intro of myself - I'm Jeremy and I'm a sort of gay activist, in other words to promote the tolerance and understanding of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people or LGBT.</p>
              <p>I have been asked by 1 of my friends to come in here and explain or clarify 1 or 2 things. I shall try my best and feel free to ask any questions and I may answer them when I am free or on my next visit.</p>
              <p>My friend is a friend of a cabby and was told there's some kind of anti-gay feeling among cabbys in this forum. I was directed to this post. Sorry I haven't been able to read all the the previous ones or what has transpired up to now. So my answer will be based on what i read here and what I was told. Sorry if it's long but I think clear the air explanations might be long to emphasize a point or 2, I may have to make multiple posts. Ermm I noticed there's no spell checker here, so if I make some grammar mistakes, I apologise - we really have become too used to such things.</p>
              <p>Ok first let me begin by what I was told. A cabby here was condemning others on being poor parents and scolding others on all sorts of things, and also some name calling. This caused the cabbys affected to do some digging and they found out from some sources that the person doing all this was actually gay. And he was married with kids and kept this from his wife and others. They then exposed him after finding out about his gay activity in another forum where he posts. I haven't checked out that forum but maybe I will in the coming days.</p>
              <p>Now I have read this post from the start and it's clear that the cabby mentioned is Bingjames as he has posted his feelings above. But I am also confused about some things he says about policemen and abusing authority? But anyway let me just stick to what I came here for.</p>

              <p>There seems to be a lot of things here, but let me start with the most important.</p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong being gay or bisexual. Many gay men contribute to society and are law abiding, they even defend their countries. I am sure you read of brave soldiers fighting in wars and saving lives while being gay or bisexual. So please don't condemn gays for their orientation. They are humans too and have feelings like you and me. 1 gay activist I look up to is Alex Au - please feel free to read his blog, Yawning Bread. Mr Au has stood up for democratic rights for all Singaporeans besides just gay rights. In many ways, it's Mr Au who brough this AIM saga into the open.</p>
              <p>It takes time to discover that you're actually gay or lesbian. These feelings can begin at an early age or sometimes a person discovers it when they are older, even sometimes when they are married - in this case they are of course bisexual, since they have a wife and maybe kids as well. Myself I discovered it in my 20s and it took sometime to really discover the real me, if you get my drift.</p>
              <p>The next important is coming out - Coming out refers when a LGBT person openly declares to the world - or to his friends, relatives etc that he is gay. This is not an easy thing believe me, even in more open countries like the US or Europe, what more Singapore. But despite what some LGBT say, I think Singapore today is much more tolerant of PLU - People Like Us, than it was say 10 or 20 years ago.</p>
              <p>It's really a hard thing to do to come out in the open and say you're gay or bisexual. You may get rejected or worse get mocked or ridiculed for being frank and open. It may cause relationships to fail and I know of some parents who totally reject their kids after being told so. Then of course there is religious associations that reject gay lifestyle choices but let's not go there.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I'll make a small confession here, I have come out but not fully - that is my friends, colleagues etc all know I am gay but not to my parents, yes they suspect it afterall I'm nearly 40 and unmarried.</p>
              <p>But as a gay activist we generally advise gay people the following:</p>
              <p>Come out if its safe to do so. That means if you're from a religious group that is very anti-gay, then maybe its better to keep mum.</p>
              <p>Come out if the people around are matured and understanding. Come out if you are confident enough. And better to come out if you know someone is going to expose you.</p>
              <p>For bisexuals its a bit different:</p>
              <p>If you discovered your orientation early - as a kid, teenager or young adult, then perhaps its better you tell your partner if he/she is straight. And you must tell them this before marrying them. Why? Because if you fail to do so, it can wreck havoc to your marriage, it can be devastating to your wife/husband and worse to your kids. You must have the guts to explain this before marriage or at the very latest just after marriage, where a quiet divorce can be done if the other partner rejects it. But don't keep it silent until you have kids, it's very unfair and cruel to them.</p>
              <p>We in the gay community demand others respect our right to be gay but similarly what we must do is we must respect others right to be straight. So if you are going to marry a straight person, then shouldn't you tell them?</p>
              <p>Of course if you marry another bisexual, then it becomes a lot easier and both parties should come clean with each other.</p>
              <p>Finally there are the few cases where a person only discovers his/her orientation after marriage or in adulthood. Here the advise is subjective and on a case to case basis. If you think coming out will cause damage to your spouse and kids then its better to keep silent until a time when the kids are older. But generally we would advise that at some point its better to come clean than live a lie.</p>

              <p>Now coming to my purpose here tonight.</p>
              <p>Bingjames I am not sure which discovery category you are in, but I think its safe to say you are married with kids and a bisexual. If you discovered you were gay or bisexual early before marriage then you should have told your wife that, shouldn't you? If you have told her already and she accepted it, then hey, that's the best thing right? Everyone is happy.</p>
              <p>Next then is marital fidelity or for gays/bisexual - being faithful to 1 partner. You will find that almost all gay activists promote this - being faithful to one partner. If we want gays to be accepted as normal people then we must also behave normally - that is be true to your partner and not sleep around.</p>
              <p>So Bingjames I think you best can answer this question as I as know little of transpired before this. Are you faithful to your wife after marriage? You see you were the one who made the choice to marry if you knew your orientation before marriage. You must again make the choice of being faithful, either to her or if you have a gay partner, to him. It's not fair to either party, if you keep silent, or worse if you have multiple partners.</p>
              <p>Then we must also caution on unprotected sex if you have multiple partners. Do you use a condom, have you gone for regular screening for stds?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Finally I come to those who bash Bingjames for his orientation.<br>Please stop this and accept him for what he is, a bisexual. A person's sexual orietantion has nothing to do with his/her character or their jobs. And even a cabby can be gay, lesbian or bisexual.<br>As for parenting, gays, lesbian and bisexuals can be good and even great parents too. So that should not affect bingjames giving parenting advise, provided he too has come clean with his orientation to his spouse and eventually to his kids.<br>My personal advise to bingjames is you shouldn't be name calling and judging people or doubting their parental skills. To each his own, right brother?<br>As a bisexual man, you should stand proud, dispense good advise and not mock others. You must remember that the straight communtiy also have a right to demand that we in LGBT movement behave civilly and properly with them, if we want their respect.</p>
              <p><br>Ok I think this should be enough food for thought. Feel free to ask questions.<br>Bye bye and remember - 1Love</p>
