That articles claim that it is good competition and good value for money. So I tried but to my shock, my short trip from Anderson Road to Marina Bay Financial Centre </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">cost me a crazy $112.</strong></p>

If I took a taxi, it would only cost me 30+ 40 dollars. Before you use Uber please check out the pricing first.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">Look before you leap. Do not blindly follow what online Uber supporters are telling you. Expensive it is but the driver gives good customer service. Still it is too expensive or too pricey to pay for good customer service. I only need to get to my location for a reasonable price.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">See how people said about Uberï¼š</strong></p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">Before Uber and Grabcar, I had to stand under the scorching sun with a young child waiting more than 45 mins for a damn cab. It's either they do not want to go to the place you want, they change to hired immediately after spotting you or they act as if you are invisible driving right pass you. There is no way getting a cab during peak hours.</p>

Even you call for 3 hours also nobody wanna pick you up! I was once at ION Orchard shopping during Christmas. No one wanna pick us up because ION no need pay CBD charge. We had to walk to Wisma to take a cab. Is this call fair to us? With Uber, I don't even have to walk and wait under the scorching sun!</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">And Uber drivers that I've encounter are way more polite than taxi drivers! Btw I've taken Uber more than 50 times. None of them were as rude as taxi uncles. I'm not saying all uncles are rude but you have no idea how rude can 1 person be especially when they are earning your money.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">I choose Uber because its hassle free. Usually when I do not have cash with me I can simply tap a few times on my phone and in less than 5 mins, I have a driver waiting for me right outside my door. It's not about fair or unfair. When there were no competition, taxi drivers are picky. They choose their passengers. When there's competition, they get angry, call for fairness. So what about fairness for passengers?</p>

Whatever cab come I take, Mercedes, black cab all I take. Like I said, not all taxi uncles are like that but compared with uber and grab, my own opinion is taxis uncles whom I've taken with are more rude.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">When my daughter was only a few months old, I take cab, uncle never bother to help me put pram inside boot. I had to leave my daughter lying at the back seat then go and put pram. When weather is not good, I had to stand under scorching sun or raining weather to hail a cab. Some uncles because wanna earn a little more so they'd rather choose to take on calls passengers.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">If all taxi uncle choose only to take on calls passengers then the rest of us wanna stand by road hail cab die lor. So after uber came out, I was relieved because I no longer need to wait 45mins or more for a cab. I can stay indoor, wait for driver to come to my doorsteps then go out.</p>

              rest of us wanna stand by road hail cab die lor. So after uber came
              out, I was relieved because I no longer need to wait 45mins or more
              for a cab. I can stay indoor, wait for driver to come to my
              doorsteps then go out.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">&gt; Before Uber and Grabcar, I had to stand under the scorching sun with a young child waiting more than 45 mins for a damn cab. It's either they do not want to go to the place you want, they change to hired immediately after spotting you or they act as if you are invisible driving right pass you. There is no way getting a cab during peak hours.</span></p>
              <p>Where did you stand to flag for taxis?   If you stand at bus-lane or bus-stop areas during peak hours, many taxi drivers are not willing to take the risk to take customers as they would have to pay the fines if they are spotted entering the bus-lanes or stopping within 9 metres of bus-stops.</p>
              <p>Under LTA regulations, taxi drivers cannot reject customers after finding out where they wish to go unless they do not know how to get to that place, is changing shift or you request to go to places which he feels uncomfortable going like going to remote cemetery and waiting there for 30 minutes.</p>
              <p>If they chance to BUSY immediately after spotting you, it most likely is they needed to go to toilet or needed to take a meal or smoke break.  They probably forgot to change to BUSY prior to seeing you.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">&gt;During holidays? Even you call for 3 hours also nobody wanna pick you up! I was once at ION Orchard shopping during Christmas. No one wanna pick us up because ION no need pay CBD charge. We had to walk to Wisma to take a cab. Is this call fair to us? With Uber, I don't even have to walk and wait under the scorching sun!</span></p>
              <p>During public holidays, some taxi drivers choose to spend time with their family members as that is the only time that they could gether together.  Remember when they take that break, they shill have to pay taxi rental to the taxi companies unlike employees who get paid public holidays or are paid higher rates to work during public holidays.  And there is sudden huge surge in demand....so it explains why it is harder to get a taxi.</p>
              <p>As for the Ion case, the taxi driver who is out to make money would definitely choose to pick up from Wisma if it pays $3 extra if he is near that place unless he happened to drop one customer at Ion and you are waiting at the taxi stand 10 metres away from the drop off point.   So experienced shoppers would walk to Wisma to take taxi during evening peak hours like experienced street hailers would not wait at small roads and would walk to major roads to flag for taxis.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">&gt;And Uber drivers that I've encounter are way more polite than taxi drivers! Btw I've taken Uber more than 50 times. None of them were as rude as taxi uncles. I'm not saying all uncles are rude but you have no idea how rude can 1 person be especially when they are earning your money.</span></p>
              <p>Can you please mention how rude the taxi drivers were to you?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">&gt;I choose Uber because its hassle free. Usually when I do not have cash with me I can simply tap a few times on my phone and in less than 5 mins, I have a driver waiting for me right outside my door. It's not about fair or unfair. When there were no competition, taxi drivers are picky. They choose their passengers. When there's competition, they get angry, call for fairness. So what about fairness for passengers?</span></p>
              <p>Comfort cabs are equipted with facilities for accepting credit cards (Master, Am Express and Union), nets and ezlink card payments.  However it is hard to grab them during morning peak hours.  In the morning when I log on to the system, I get 1 booking call within 5 seconds and as many as 9-10 during 3 minutes span.  However I could only service 1.   I obviously would not choose to service 1 that is 3 km away or has an unknown address which requires me to check the street directory. However once I bidded for it, whether I like it or not I have to attend to it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">&gt;When my daughter was only a few months old, I take cab, uncle never bother to help me put pram inside boot. I had to leave my daughter lying at the back seat then go and put pram. When weather is not good, I had to stand under scorching sun or raining weather to hail a cab. Some uncles because wanna earn a little more so they'd rather choose to take on calls passengers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">If all taxi uncle choose only to take on calls passengers then the rest of us wanna stand by road hail cab die lor. So after uber came out, I was relieved because I no longer need to wait 45mins or more for a cab. I can stay indoor, wait for driver to come to my doorsteps then go out.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">hmm......my understanding is taxi uncles only do not bother to come out to help if the customer could handle by himself or themselves.   Isn't call booking the same as waiting for Uber (except during peak hours when all operating taxis are already snached up by customers)?  I encountered situations before whereby old people going to hospital told me that they had waited 1 hour for taxi on the street during peak hours and they were very happy to be able to take my taxi.  Many people also wait at bus-lane places during peak hours (like near PAP HQ at Upper Changi Road) whereby taxi-drivers have to take a risk to fetch them.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;">The existing situation cannot be solved by introducing more taxi drivers as the off-peak hours demand isn't that high to justify it.  Many have left the industry after trying it out.   The playing field currently isn't leveled for example taxi drivers wait 30-45 minutes queueing at Changi Airport for customers wheras Uber drivers wait for a much shorter time.   Also remember this fact: our hotel rates and housing rates are comparable with those of other developed cities like New York, London, Tokyo and Sydney but taxi fares are just 1/4 of these cities despite having the highest cost of car ownership and higher cost for taxis.  For example, It only cost $13.30 by taxi to go from Marina Sands Bay to Terminal 2 of Changi Airport during off-peak hours.   However if you wish to pay more for Uber services (whether forced or by choice), no one would stop you.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 24.2857px;"> </p>

              @bro taxilim88, I thot you out of taxi trade liao...still driving ar??? alamak.
              
              Be it Grab or Uber or MDT, still hv to struggle lah, still hv to hold steering, still hv to step on pedals.. we are all suck into the game of those richs businessmen who make us all look like a fool running around with these and that, and at the end of the day, we are still the drivers, they laugh all the way to the bank. That is how Capitalism works, no choice, just let you know only, so that we all can calm down and be contented.
              
              So, the best is still be a Casket Driver, no Uber, no grab and no MDT or smlj so many assholes talking.

              Anything that increase the adrenalin of earning higher is consider addictive, it is absolutely perfect for one to seek higher earning, but the question is alway, can you maintain at that position or you need to go higher? 
                  
              All these result in more pressure and stressful life, when you become a Elite, you cannot face the agony of going down, which will be consider as a demotion, 
              
              and that is also why many Drivers who are even at a lost is claiming themselves earning more and more, from 3k to 4k to 5k to 6..10k per month. That is one of the definition of 10 TDs, 10 Assholes.

              Cabbies only saw grab and uber snatching their business away. But many taxi and limo unker failed to realise - many of their CDB fares are switching to electric scooter and e-bicycles.
              
              Now got electric kick scooter that can go 55km on a single charge using a 18.2Ah 36V lithium battery. With this kind of range, even those living in Jurong West can chiong to work in CBD and back on just one charge. No need uber, grab, taxi, bus or mrt anymore.

              I know of people who actually use their stat board wife to claim taxi fares. Not sure if the auditor got see the taxi ho beh always the same one or not.
              
              That is why I always thought stat board management are gong kia.
              
              Ever heard of NOL? The SAF scholar CEO keep losing money. Other shipping companies can earn but NOL lose. Must be a goondu right?
              
              SMRT leh? Also run by a SAF scholar CEO. Trains keep breaking down, and end up must provide free bus rides. You tell me he is not a bodoh kia?
