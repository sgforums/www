              <p>the new electric taxi coming soon.</p>
              <p>some of the initial things 
              are like say charge 15min can go to 200km on paper but average nearer to
               20min go 150. currently got a handful of charging stations with 2 
              charging pts at certain locations. if there are already vehicles at all 
              the charging pt, probably will need to queue wait or look for the driver
               to come back drive away before next party take up charging. or even if 
              the driver come back it is still not clear if there is any mandatary 
              requirement by when must drive away, though the charging itself will 
              probably be chargeable per time basis each time the charging is plugged 
              in, from $1 per min depending. then rental from 200 up, can be around 
              220 to 240.</p>
              <p>the good is the vehcile will be like well build like suv, comfortable with builtin child seat, top speed under or around 90 at full load. very smooth and quiet running with zero emission. no more oily.  can help save the environment.</p>

              I have doubt in Singapore govt allowing electrical stuff, they agreed to pirus because of petrol usage, Singapore have invested alot in petrol chemical industrial and refineries business. It is a big cash cow them, from fuel taxation to mark petrol prices, and one of the best refinering and storage places in Asia, do you think our govt will allow electric car to be on the road, maybe yes, but definitely not in our time.
              
              Electric car and gas driven car is not new, even solar powered is already in place, and tropical places like singapore can alway use solar power, but if that is used, then govt will lost a huge income..???

              Take for example, with hot tropical sun, every HDB top can install solar panels for each block resident usage, that will be green, friendly to the enviroment and yet, make full use of the sun power, which is natural, but why govt are not doing it and more so, do not allow people to use it.
              
              Because if you use solar, which take in sun energy and can be kept for evening use, Power supply will bankrupt, you see the implication??

              <p>SINGAPORE – Solar panels will be installed at 680 HDB blocks and three HDB-owned commercial and industrial properties by end-2016. It’s part of the HDB’s Solar Capability Building Programme - which aims at harnessing solar energy for use at more residential blocks. The solar panels will provide an alternative and renewable energy source for Singapore and are key to HDB’s sustainable development efforts.</p>
              <p>Jurong East, Marine Parade, Sembawang and Tampines are the four towns that will benefit from the latest round of solar panel installations. This is on top of the 200 blocks islandwide that will be fitted with solar panels by the end of this year.</p>
              
              <p>HDB’s latest and largest solar leasing tender to date was awarded to Sunseap Leasing in October. The tender also covers three commercial and industrial properties owned by HDB - HDB Hub at Toa Payoh, Woodlands Civic Centre and Eastlink Industrial Building.</p>
              <p>Under the tender, Sunseap Leasing will bear the full cost of the solar panels - which are installed on the rooftops of the blocks. For previous tenders, HDB had funded a portion of the cost to kick start the solar leasing programme.</p>
              <p>Sunseap Leasing’s business development manager Shawn Tan said: “We don’t collect any upfront money from our client. We come in, supply and install solar panels and sell this energy to our clients at a discounted rate of what they are currently paying to a traditional grid source.”</p>
              <p>HDB said that as larger tenders are being called, there will be economies of scale. “Based on the current sustainable business model of solar leasing, HDB will not be funding any portion of the upfront cost for future projects to install solar panels.”</p>
              <p>The solar energy that is generated will be used to power services in the common areas of the HDB blocks, and these include the lifts, staircase lighting and water pumps.</p>
              <p>Sunseap Leasing’s Mr Tan said: “The direct benefit will essentially be that the building itself will draw less power from the traditional source, as it is drawing power from a renewable source of energy. That translates directly to a reduction of carbon footprint.</p>
              <p>“Because there’s a reduction in the energy you draw from a traditional source, the tariff we charge the town council is at a discounted rate. So when they use solar energy to replace the traditional source of energy, there’s some form of savings in their utility bills.”</p>
              <p>The town councils only pay for the energy that is consumed. HDB says the savings can help town councils offset the rise in energy costs, which in turn benefits residents. If it happens that no solar energy is harnessed, these common services will then fall back on the usual electricity source.</p>
              <p>HDB said it is moving toward using solar energy on a wider scale and aims to implement the solar leasing business model in more HDB towns islandwide. It added that it will also continue to test the various types of solar energy technology to determine what is most suitable and efficient for Singapore’s climate conditions. CHANNEL NEWSASIA</p>

              <p>Shenzhen is different.  Taxi drivers there are employees with monthly salary, not self employed.  They will not have a problem to go back to their depot to charge their taxis.</p>
              <p>Singapore's taxi drivers are self employed.  You need to have convenient charging stations across the island.  Time is money. These are not ordinary 13Amp power points, but 3-phase, 63Amp chargers.  You need to upgrade the infrastructure facilities to be able to take the electrical load. And it is not cheap.</p>
              <p>It's another chicken and egg problem..Chargers in place first, then buy taxi or must have taxis first before can put chargers?</p>
              <p>HK has tried out in 2013.  Report in my next post below (too long).</p>

              <p>In many ways it seems like the perfect way to travel. With zero tailpipe emissions, super-quiet transmissions, rapidly increasing ranges and low running costs, electric vehicles are heralded for their ability to quickly and effectively reduce roadside pollution, thereby improving local air quality. However, in Hong Kong at least, they are seemingly still a novelty. That’s something the government says it’s striving to change.<br><br>There are 611 electric vehicles in Hong Kong, a marked increase from the 100 cars on our roads in 2010. While the majority of these are privately owned, 159 of them are in the government’s fleet. And we’ve got one electric bus route, part of a year-long trial run for KMB. But there are only 45 electric taxis on our roads at the moment, all produced by Chinese manufacturer BYD. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">One taxi drives – roughly – 400km a day in our city. These vehicles reportedly contribute a whopping 20 percent of the city’s road mileage every day. That means replacing the city’s 18,000 taxis with electrically powered vehicles could make a tangible difference towards reducing roadside pollution, particularly as official figures show that 80 percent of LPG taxis have a defective ‘catalytic convertor’ – and it’s this convertor that filters around 90 percent of the pollution they emit. The government’s ongoing Clean Air Plan states that LPG-powered taxis and minibuses with worn out convertors are the main sources of roadside nitrogen dioxide emissions in Hong Kong.<br><br>The government is now catching on to electric transport. In the policy address back in January, CY Leung promised to ‘promote the use of electric vehicles’ by testing out more electric buses and providing more chargers for electric taxis. He even promised to drive an electric car himself, albeit on a ‘trial basis’. <br>The Transport Department says it is soon launching a pilot scheme in six car parks, which will see 50 new electric taxi chargers installed, as taxis need faster, higher capacity chargers than private cars. There are currently 47 chargers in 12 locations.<br><br>But the question remains, despite the government’s moves: are local cabbies interested in making the switch to electric? One driver is clearly an advocate. Lau Chi-yan has been driving an electric taxi since October last year and he does regular pickups from the airport, where there are three dedicated, free taxi chargers. He tells us that driving electric isn’t any cheaper – ‘the rental cost is the same and money saved on LPG is counterbalanced by time spent waiting for the cab to charge’. But Lau nevertheless says he stopped driving LPG because it’s ‘better for my health – and for the Earth’.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Lau is happy with his taxi’s performance so far – ‘on the highway, no-one can catch me!’ – but he’s not happy with the effort it takes to charge the vehicle up. “It takes two hours to fully charge the taxi,” he says, “but we can only use the chargers at the airport for 45 minutes each time. Sometimes, we take people to the airport and then there’s not enough electricity left to go back. Then we’re waiting and waiting [for a space to charge]. There are only three chargers. We really need five or 10. Once, I gave up waiting and went to use a charger in Tsuen Wan instead. But my taxi slowed down and stopped in the middle of the Tsing Ma Bridge!”<br><br>Another problem at the airport, specifically, is that electric taxis have to charge and then join the rank at the back, meaning it can be several hours before they pick up their next passenger. Lau hopes the government will provide more dedicated taxi chargers soon. “They said they’d put one in Tung Chung but it’s been three months,” he says. “We’re just waiting and waiting. If charging remains a big problem, maybe I will give up. Many of my friends have given up already.” BYD tells us that five new stations at Tung Chung will ‘open soon’. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Dr Hung Wing-tat is associate professor of civil and structural engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and lectures in transport management. “The real issue [about charging taxis] is the space, the land,” he points out. “The private sector won’t ever offer dedicated space for taxis to charge, because if you don’t allow people to park there, you’re losing income.”<br><br>Philip Tsing has driven an LPG taxi for 23 years. He is dismissive of giving it up. “Electric taxis are basically an experiment,” he argues. “You don’t know how well they will perform. It’s more like for fun! I worry about the life expectancy of the battery. Also, taking two or four hours from your day to charge it up? That’s time that you could be spending with your family.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">If the government follows through soon with its promise to provide more chargers for taxis, at least some of the drivers’ concerns could be alleviated. However, not everyone is convinced that this is going to be a seamless transition. “We welcome electric vehicles – but if you look at real polluters, in terms of emissions, that’s actually diesel vehicles, mainly buses and trucks,” says Kwong Sum-yin, chief executive officer of local NGO, Clean Air Network. “We’d have more results if the government would prioritise this. We still have around 30 percent of minibuses running on diesel – it would be a good incentive if we could look at that.”<br><br>Last year, the government’s Clean Air Plan detailed a scheme to retire diesel trucks and retrofit engines on old buses. But this isn’t due until 2019. “Maybe they think they’re already doing enough here”, says Kwong. “But we’d like to see more things done to speed up the replacement of all the vehicles. Our fuel standard is Euro V now, but [the less polluting] Euro VI is already being used in Europe! Why are we always chasing?”<br><br>James Middleton, chairman of local charity Clear the Air, is not sold on electric taxis. “They need hybrids here,” he argues. “Electric cabs need to recharge and that means burning coal to generate electricity. There aren’t even enough recharge points – it’s a problem. Hybrids, which can run for 24 hours continuously, would issue less pollution than the electric cars that have downtime off the road for recharging.”<br><br>Hybrid taxis, which switch between petrol and electricity, don’t need charging – they do it while moving. Yet, they haven’t proven hugely popular yet, perhaps as they are more expensive to buy than regular LPG cabs. They then also need to use petrol, which is not tax exempted. “Hybrids don’t offer a big enough saving,” says Dr Hung, “unless the government thinks of a way to make them financially more attractive, perhaps by having tax-free petrol.”<br><br>While it remains to be seen what the impact of the government’s pilot scheme for more chargers will be on our city’s taxi drivers, the authority also plans to purchase 36 electric buses and trial them in the city before the end of this year. It’s looking like a slow process – but it seems there’s some spark of hope here for cleaner, quieter streets.</p>

              Aiyo, ah Lim...up to now, you still do not understand our govt way of working meh???
              
              Singapore registered itself as an enviromental friendly savy so as to tap on the global green world community. Therefore, Singapore must do abit of it duty to ensure that it possess such facilities and more importantly, with action.
              
              And when they do a bit of it, they will announce it very big to the world and people like you fall for it. 
              
              Yes, solar panel, why for a few block, and why are newer 27000 BTO flats not build with solar panels as it will be more easy to do with it construction, why our vehicle is still using diesel, petrol, hybrid and not completely CNG or electrical?
              
              Ah...you read alot in the media, but who control the media in Singapore. And you know why they are nicknamed as the Wayang Party??

              That's why I said, got business and political implication one lah, like in Singapore, if all go Solar and electric, jurong island can close liao, so is tuas south, so is PUB aka power supply plant from senoko to tuas...then, alot of jobs will be lost, foreigners will be send back, singaporean unemployment will go high, govt income will be less result in no Pioneer generation funds, no rebates and so on, and TDs will have less paxs.
              
              But also good, I dun go JI and TS
                  
              It is like saying, dun drive car if there is not a need rather than a neccessity, but you are pouring in more and more COEs and yet at a ridiculous price. So on one hand, govt said, take public transport lah...take Mrt lah, walk lah, cycle lah...but they also wish you buy car so that they can earn COEs (a piece of toilet paper) from you.
