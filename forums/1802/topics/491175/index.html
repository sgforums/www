              <p>By right is cannot stop there one....so you have to take the risk and bear the fine if caught by LTA law enforcement officers doing so.  </p>
              <p>For customers wanting to alight there, you could tell them it is bus lane and you cannot stop there as you would have to pay a huge fine if caught.      </p>
              <p>For customers flagging you to stop, you ask yourself whether it is worth it to risk having to pay the fine to earn a few dollars to at most $20+ dollars.   Remember most of the times, there are other customers in front that you could fetch within 5-10 minutes.</p>
              <p>Also remember, the bulk of our public buses have cameras too and even though you see behind no buses coming, the picking up time may take longer than you expected and a bus could just come from behind and take a picture of your taxi blocking them even though there may not be any LTA enforcement officers around.</p>

              <p>My understanding is dotted bus lanes are counted the same as bus lanes as far as stopping to pick up passengers is concerned so it is prohibited.   The only difference is vehicles that are going to turn into the street around the corner could enter to do so.   At least this is what I learned from the course we took before we sat for the taxi license examination.</p>
              <p>Anyone was told differently about dotted bus lanes?</p>

              <p>yes dotted lines is bus lane, example whole road during bus lane operating hours is bus lane , dotted or continous.</p>
              <p>dotted is for the purpose of telling u that u can filter in early to make a left turn, but sometimes cheng hu very kiam siap , draw a little bit of dotted only <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>continous line is like a land mine , intrude into it and u are on candid camera <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              Candid camera, if you notice, always start and become very active in bright early morning peak period, and mostly are mended by Bolehland ah nehs, because for the following reasons.
              
              Early morn they arrive from Boleh land, get their briefing from their supervisor (usually king of ah nehs), then they proceed to their destination to catch motorist, as quota given to them is approx. 5 to 8 summons, they will be very desparate to do it fast, like TDs during the first 2 to 3hrs trying to break even the rental first. 
              
              So, you will see they just snap and snap away, even between bus lane straight and dotted lines, your rear wheel hit the straight line, they also snap, because they want to finish the quota, then can go park and rest..or masterbate.
              
              Then come evening time, bolehland LTA ah nehs would had left to cross over to Malaysia so as to avoid the jam, these times, more locals will be out, and as usual, they need to finish their quotas as from 5 to 7.30pm, because when the sunset, camera not so effective liao, and most are fat fat old old LTA uncles..eyes also blur blur.
              
              Therefore, by knowing how they operate, we can then be more vigilant and aware of their existence and non existence. For by 10am, when LTA ah neh already have his quotas of summons and need a break, even you cut into red lane for a while, they also dun give a damn, many cabbies said, it is heng or suay, but to me, it is a matter of knowing how these people works.
