              well done max... finally you are on the road.... 
              
              take the first 2-3 weeks to learn more.... money after that can earn... and drive slower and safely...
              
              if not sure location, dont on meter first... ask pax first and confirm already then press... 
              
              got time, study street directory.... read the major roads and intersactions....one day read 2 or 3 HDB towns a day... 
              
              in 6 mths, you will be expert liao... can teach me liao... haha
              
              good luck

              <p>Thanks ALN</p>
              <p>i put a map beside me wherever i go, i try to see which road to turn to go. I also ask if pax knows it, then can guide me. I find that actual on the road is very different from looking at maps, though it helps to know the major road to turn into to get there.still not sure about aye to cte, ecp connection. also which road from city can go into ecp?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I may also turn the wrong way, if he pax dont guide me along.......  very very long way to go to reach your level of experience on the road.</p>
              <p>cheers and thanks</p>

              <p>I have lots n lots to learn. looking at maps about the roads, places and most importantly.....where to pickup pax in the morning and afternoon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am only managing rental, fuel and not much else. not sure of which direction and where to pickup pax. just going around and join taxi Q whenever possible. Asking pax to guide me to where they want to go.</p>
              <p>currently I go to commonwealth, clementi, jurong and boonlay to Q. sometime one way then come back empty to Q again....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any guidance is much appreciated...thank you</p>

              <p>OK Dun Worry,</p>
              <p>I, think waiting in Q at Taxi stand for newbie is a  bit difficult, wait for On-Call jobs is much better. Any Job offer just press 10 mins...( any probelm encounter pls Msg me i will guide u on this)... In the morning roam near the places that you know more, pickup any street job along you go. If the job completed like in town, better head back... staying in town nothing much you can fight with those Old Birds and there are to many over there, just an example from my experience if job completed at Shenton Way, head to Beach Road to Geylang or toward Marine Parade or East Coast, Bedok or Pasir Ris there is more chance of getting pax along. Or you can head toward Telok Blangah, Alexandra, Tanglin Halt, Ghim Moh, North Buona Vista Road or near the MRT many paxs this spot... than  back your homeground. This is how i started from a newbie before using this formula. Today not a probelm for me. you name it... i will take it and fullfil you... just pay the meter fares haha.</p>

              <p>You too Happy New Year.</p>
              <p>Making is not an important issue, just as a newbie, you are lucky your rental and fuel are all there.</p>
              <p>Just an example last night my hirer said everywhere in town all are congested. You know how he run his night all at housing estates. Everywhere along  he go pax flag him heading toward town, he politely told than the situation about the jam, but ferry them to the nearest MRT stations. Wau Pian he make a handsome sums out of this moves and many. So not all like him, other my just chiong to the destination and got struck and just singing song with the pax in the jam.</p>
              <p>I think Guru ALN may got his own way, maybe he can update us on his part, Happy New Year Guru...Night Shift.</p>
              <p>Today day shift also good many after lunch along the routes many ATM around,</p>

              everywhere in town congested on ny eve nite? not really lah... b4 11.30pm only marina sq area and vivo/sentosa nia and of course CTE towards town... 
              
              in fact town traffic no movement at all from 11pm to 1am... cos all waiting in town for countdown... i was eating mee at maxwell at 12am to 1am... relax first...
              
              after 1am all the way to 6am... penguins all out fighting with one another for cabs.... thousands of them lining up roads in town flagging for cab e.g. clark, boat, mohammud sultan, river valley, clemenceu, middle, victoria, serangoon..north bridge, PS...etc etc
              
              outside town, east coast got hundreds of penguins, few even flagging along ECP... west side i dun know... suppose hol v area also good.
              
              sentosa, vivo, i avoided completely... not worth the jam...
              
              once i reached town 1am to 6am, call dropped like atomic bomb liao... only place in town to get a cab is really those spots where the cabs just turn out from CTE e.g. PS bus stop... if u wait few meters after PS, u can wait till 6am if not calling for cab... seriously... i was half the time avoiding those paxs who spilled over onto the roads... i saw this scene on labour day eve... ny eve is many more times that... 
              
              amazing nite for cabbies... enjoy while it lasts....next year is pay back time... haiz...

                                      hours... CTE many exit you can do... kampong bahru toward outram on left and CTE, kampong bahru toward Eu Tong Seng at OG also CTE. which CTE.</p>
              <p>Just remember at Vivo. on right ECP on left AYE now the about CTE. you can never get wrong on direction.</p>
              <p> Orchard for those Hotels, when pax asked to go Airport chances are more so now you study well, where is the exit to Airport from Orchard. Get ready yourself for future need.</p>
              <p>Orchard to Tourist Attraction where they go venture themself by taxi. Like example Zoo, Science Centre, Bird Park etc. you must know where is your direction, cause they are tourists cannot render to you or guide you, they are as poor as you  on road knowledge.</p>

              <p>i make less than my rental most of the time...</p>
              <p>is erp off from 11am to 12pm?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I go to bukit merah ( i notice along this route not very interesting cause the refuelling depot is there, many comfort taxis is running too heavy over here)  to commonwealth avenue( i notice better only at MRT station) to Ghim Moh also difficult cause a taxi kiosk is there many old birds station there) towards clementi ( old birds from Ghim Moh will also round there), </p>
              <p>For bukit merah you can avoid... go to other route like from Tiong Bahru,Bukit merah view, Henderson Road, Redhill, Lengkok Bahru, Tanglin Halt... also can connect to Commonwealth avenue west.  why? more HDB blocks more chances. You can play around with all this choice or others.  Never alway go back the same way.</p>
              <p>If 150 to 203 km is OK but collection is a bit low. maybe your routes you run there is not much paxs around, try the above an see what is the different.</p>
              <p>Just like fisherman out for their catch, does he know which spot below the water got more school of fishes, all depend on experience, If there is many seagull flying above below must got plenty. This formula...ya</p>

              <p>thanks kinwashi for your help</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>no wonder i run empty along bukit merah. I'll take other routes as you say.</p>
              <p>I reach my hirers place after 7am, so its 7+ to 5pm to handover.</p>
              <p>normally I run around 150km, 203km only once. got $60 only once on my 1st day driving, after that....have not reach that since..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thank you</p>
