              <p>hmz.. i think gps won't help much cos you need to spend what 15secs setting destination? if at taxi stand, already many horns blaring at you. sometimes customer oso dun know destination name.."just go straight, hill something". knn, from coronation plaza, lucky uncle little bit knowledge, hillview lor. if dun know anyhow input gps sure kena L/R/C. if u kena "seraya something" how? Ave/Road - Jurong Isle ; Cres - Upper Thomson ; Lane/Road - off Haig Road (got 2 Seraya Roads in S'pore). Maybe gps helpful, but main issue is the time required to select destination, other road users won't give u the time. cos s'pore drivers all very impatient one.</p>
              <p>very simple one...Springleaf Tower in Anson Road. GPS won't tell you you must go by Prince Edward Road because the drop off point is inside the building (up a ramp leading to the carpark). If you come by Anson Road, may God bless you. cos can only drop your pax at International Plaza. GPS?</p>
              <p>best way is pool's way .... the hard way, kena L/R/C from customer. most pax know better than us which route to use at what time of the day cos they are likely to be taking taxis daily. I always ask which route they want to use. any jam not my problem. hey, i didn't suggest the route. this method, 2 months guaranteed all the important places/roads you'll know. many pax will teach shortcuts which they discovered.

              Just like last Sunday from Harbourfront taxi stand, one handsome teenager. Uncle Gopeng street...fast. There is one condo overthere, going there for my tennis game.
              
              Like this kind of destination, what shall you do. GPS or Street directory too late. Already on board.
              
              Just simply ask them back cause he know where he is going Gopeng street and the destination for sure.
              
              So Sir where is the right location, btw M hotel and Amara hotel. So easy Tanjong Pagar road here we go. Sometime in this kind of senerio, open your golden mouth nothing is wrong anyway.

              <p>No need to ask unless you are so sure the place , like me , i seldom asked nowadays , cos heng heng i know those places , and i always got reasons for travelling my route .</p>
              <p>Like at Esplanade Mall a few Saturday ago ..... pax wanna go to Tampines St.72 .</p>
              <p>I haven't asked , he said : " Please go by Nicholl Highway . "</p>
              <p>I replied : " Sir , are you sure ? Due to Fireworks Display , Guillemard Road very jam , all rushing back ... i came down from there ! " ( although i didn't )</p>
              <p>I hate Guillemard Road , traffic lights damn sian ...</p>
              <p>He love this route , cos save $$$ , shorter . Typical Tampines resident , must go by Nicholl Highway &gt; Guillemard Road &gt; Paya Lebar &gt; PIE .</p>
              <p>To sound convincing , i added : " It's up to you , if u're rushing home , go by KPE &gt; PIE &gt; Bedok Reservoir &gt; Tampines 10 , cannot be that much of a difference ."</p>
              <p>Ok he finalised ..... that is not finish .</p>
              <p>After moving out of Esplanade Mall , i quickly go left into Esplanade Drive , he quickly asked : " where u going ? "</p>
              <p>" ECP via One Raffles Quay , less traffic ! "</p>
              <p>Add : " Wow , if want to go by ECP via Suntec , very jam , if go by Beach Road  worst .</p>
              <p>he then say : " Ok ! "</p>

              Another way.
              
              From Pasir Ris to Mosque street, about 8.30am.
              
              Madam ...how any particular route. Yes ECP exit Rochor.
              Just wondering why every body like Rochor exit. Unfortunately when proceed to Rochor along  the journey sign board flashed heavy traffic massive jam toward Rochor.
              
              So you still wanted to proceed by this way?
              
              Any alternative. Yes! Exit Fort Road headon to Nicoll Highway. Wow no jam at all.  At destination. stop the meter $22.60. Sir i just saved another $2.00 by using this route Thank You.
              
              OOPen your golden mouth nothing can stop you from paying more.
              Yes. next time will use this and alway. Gooday.

              <p>I use a GPS unit when i drive, as i am not totally confident esp when it comes to the newer housing estates. However i do not depend entirely on it. I will still ask passenger for preferred route, and use the GPS as a supplementary guide. Before a major turn, I will ask passenger to confirm if its correct. Even if the pax is wrong and the GPS actually shows a better route, i do not question the pax; i will just follow the instructions.</p>
              <p>I do not need to sit still and key in destination once the pax comes onboard. Proceed in the general direction first, then find an opportunity to do keying in when stopped at traffic lights etc. Its impt to know ur GPS's functions well so you wont fumble. Takes me less than 10secs usually.</p>
              <p>If kenna "Seraya something" situation, just key in Seraya and all the various possibilities will appear, with the region (eg Jurong, Thomson, Katong) and you can then confirm with the pax which one is the intended destination.</p>
              <p>It also comes into good use when the pax has no idea where the place is, but only have the address and expects you to take him there. And its an obscure road that you have not heard of. GPS is priceless in that kinda situation.</p>
              <p>Of cos its impt to have a general feel of Spore roads, and have a good directional sense. If not, no GPS can help, sure kenna LRC from pax. Also impt to use a reliable GPS unit with a good and updated map. For me its a Holux with Mapking's SLA maps.</p>

              yo Zone, wau u just got VL only so fast a hirer liao?
              
              u drive 7am to 8pm Mon to Sat? i will get relief if i were driving like your hours.
              
              for me i will only omo if 
              a) i very fussy about relief behaviour
              b) i need money and will drive more than 15 hours a day
              c) i old and retired liao... just drive for fun and for own transport...haha
              
              otherwise, might as well get a relief...imagine u drive 6am to 6pm... 12hours... and relief save u rental of $45.... u can nett $45 for the extra 2 hours now?
              
              esp if you comfort cos can easily find relief....
              
              alternative is you find relief for selected days you not driving or driving full....
              
              good luck

              <p>yo zonc,</p>
              <p>with relief, you can still take home $100 everyday except that you can stop picking up pax at 4pm. 4-5pm slowly relax top up diesel &amp; clean taxi. same income. which better? but sat. &amp; sun. of course slightly less.</p>
              <p>unless u want to earn more than $150/day than omo.</p>
              <p>wif relief and 9 hr driving take home $100-$150 easy. of course got good days &amp; bad days.</p>

              <p>Hi Moh Toh Leng,</p>

              <p>I found one GM4320 gps at eastgear. $499.</p>
              <p>Where to go on saturdays and sunday day relief? thank you.</p>

              <p> I got my Holux 53CL 9mths ago at $499. I believe its should be alot less now cos i saw that the larger 55CL is going for $499 now. Got it from Perfect Watch in Sim Lim Square, but Eastgear is actually the distributor. I decided against Garmin cos of it relies on Malsingmaps which are not really up-to-date unless you are a contributor. I rather Mapking/SLA where mapking will send you regular updates. So far its 95% accurate. Eastgear gives good and prompt service.</p>
              <p>I am a PT and dont drive on Sat/Sun, so cant help you there.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>How long does Holux acquire signal after you key in destination? does the cab have to stop to get signal? can get signal in changi airport pickup point?</p>
              <p>That Gm4320 gps that i saw is also from eastgear. they put it in front of their counters, say its the latest chipset n faster in acquiring signals. And it also uses Mapking like Holux.</p>

              <p>If you are driving around with the GPS unit turned on, then you are already locked in on the grid and it knows exactly where you are liao. There is no question about getting signal. After keying in destination it takes about 2 secs for the GPS to compute the route. If there is no direct line of sight to the sky (under any kind of overhead structure) then there is no signal.</p>

              <p><br>You can always key in your destination while in the airport pick up area, then once your cab is back on the road, the GPS will lock on almost immediately and compute your route..not a problem.</p>
