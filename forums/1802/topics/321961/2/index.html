              <p><br>No la , our peak hour from 5pm to 8pm .</p>
              <p>Then 8pm , all CBD , extra $3 , if got booking lahgi good , +$3.50</p>
              <p>All the way to 2359  hr ...... the 50% midnight charge .</p>
              <p>What golden time &amp; percentage ?</p>
              <p>Count like that difficult .</p>
              <p>we just take one customer inside CBD , to anywhere , if got $10 in 15 minutes , good liao , my target of $25 can smell .</p>
              <p>$10 inside CBD to say ..... it's like Paragon to Farrer Road .</p>
              <p>$7 + $3 CBD surcharge .</p>
              <p>So i need to get $15 in 50 minutes ... how ?</p>
              <p>Spent 10 minutes go back CBD , get one say .... wlands , $17 + $3 = $20 .... 30 minutes job .</p>
              <p>If nicely Wlands take one to Yishun , another $5 eg , per hour $35 .</p>
              <p>3jobs = $35. Just nice 1 hour like that .</p>
              <p>The more surcharges we get , the less mileage we go , the more money we get .</p>
              <p>Imagine 10 CBD trips , is = plus $30 extra .</p>

              <p>Day shift and night shift ........customer is different , day shift plenty of short trips .</p>
              <p>But if short trips if connected , it's better than long trips .</p>
              <p>Day shifts pax if long trip , usually it's heading town .</p>
              <p>It's quite saturated in town pattern .</p>
              <p>Unlike night shifts , reverse .</p>
              <p>All inside town , going home .</p>
              <p>we have to rush into CBD to take another to go home , unlike day shift , every housing area there's a certain level of demand .</p>
              <p>Unlike evening shift , housing area usually low demand .  </p>

              <p>My conclusion : It's different .</p>
              <p>Night shift must be tactical .</p>
              <p>Day shift is all about Q-ing , anywhere u go .</p>
              <p>Night shift if Q like Day shift , for me sure die tat night .</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Very difficult to explain la ... if u are not in this ground . </span></p>

              1. Mentor why your old bird relief hit alway $240, my answer if i am not wrong. He started 5.15am there is another 50% midnight charges with extra 40 minutes ahead me cos i start from 6am.
              40 minute make many diferent.
              
              2. Driving Taxi it all depend how you move your machine around, there is no standard that every hour there is guarantee pax all around that particular route, just like minesweeper for mine not every trip is sucessful with abundant catch. Some route you sweep other also follow, i think timing and luck count. (your is your not your than forget about it). Try next route. so collection likewise amount is not important, for me rental and diesel is in hand, the rest what the balance collection is profit that is enough for me.  So there is no fixed income in taxi driving this trade with experience or no experience, Rain or Shine we need to  lookupon on top our head that he is going to gave you your soon soon driving for the day.

              I just wondering as an Hirer you love only night shift with so many handsome rewards. BUT.
              
              My question look at those matching Hirer and Relief either Citycab and Comfort and the other Taxi company, most Hirers is willing to release night shift but not day, mostly day they keep for themself why is this so. Looking for day relief is difficult.

              <p>I started off driving a cab as a 2nd shift driver .</p>
              <p>Did all those homework , and adopt certain strategies , and technics .</p>
              <p>ironically , the 2nd shift tricks cannot be apply for the 1st shift , totally not in control .</p>
              <p>I started off as a booking man , i can forgo any street customer and chose to take bookings , still being choosy makes more $$$ .</p>
              <p>Day shift i had tried , customer control , not cabby . cos many taxis , no booking somemore , got booking is only $2.50 .</p>
              <p>Night shift bookings is $4 .</p>
              <p>Night shfit we control our routine , that was last time .</p>
              <p>We always opt for bookings than street .</p>
              <p>we know where, when , what , which is our potential .</p>
              <p>Me already master the trick , that's why LTA hike the fare to make us lose abit of those control .</p>
              <p>Like peak hour , we will go Tuas , Jurong area .</p>
              <p>After 8pm , it's best to stick in town .</p>
              <p>10pm CBD guarantee got $4 bookings , and can chose location . ( last time my MDT is the old one )</p>
              <p>We avoid going to northern s'pore .</p>
              <p>Like Yishun , Sembawang and Wlands .</p>
              <p>Always chose to go Western S'pore , where we know the trick at Tuas and Jurong area . Or Eastern S'pore , where i know T2 is a potential good ground for $$$ .</p>
              <p>All those things i idid , has to do with those surcharges , unlike Day shift , nothing much .</p>
              <p>I like surcharges , the lifestyle and most important , it match my desire to follow up my hobby - soccer .</p>
              <p>Day shift cannot afford to watch midnight games on TV </p>
              <p>Night shift can .</p>
              <p>same amount of salary ,</p>
              <p>Only thing no good , i fear sunlight , afternoon sun , cannot tahan .</p>

              kin, 
              
              my observation is that driving day time got few advantage
              
              a)healthier 
              
              b)day time got more business hours 6am to 6pm compared to nite shift 6pm to 1am. After 1am except Fri/Sat, everyone is asleep... so per hour collection is better for nite, but day shift got more hours of collection. 
              
              c)with diesel up, day shift less wastage cos better connection
              
              d)morning peak pple rush to take cab... evening peak even in town taxi must q
              
              Also if nite shift, make sure you start at 5pm before jam... i can only start at 630pm... HDB no demand so i have to spend 20mins in jam to go town... like that earn what?
              
              In fact i always collect more per hour during 8pm to 1030pm than 630pm to 8pm. cos less jam and more taxi demand...
              
              Finally, part time means we no need to die die must collect a lot to feed ourselves... we have the option to drive happily and healthily... i keep reminding myself that too...

            <div class='col-md body'>I still cannot figure up for night shift there are so many different btw day and night shift peak hours collection, for day it start from 7am to 9.30am it only 2hrs and the half. For night 5pm to 8 pm it only 3 hours. just addon 30 minutes. This Golden time. For day we send them in, but night you fetch them out, but town are so congested during evening rush, actually for that three hours how many trips you can run in and out from CBD and make those handsome collection.</div>

              <p>Day shift those traffic jams also no joke ..... For what i think , cos most pax during peak hour heading into town , u cannot really escape those jams .</p>
              <p>So ur income slightly affected during peak hour .</p>
              <p>For night shift , like for me , starting at 5pm .....</p>
              <p>If i picked one from Tengah Airbase to Bugis , eg , $25.00 . Half an hour , KJE-BKE-PIE no jams .</p>
              <p>If Bugis Q-up , very fast , 5 minutes , pick one to anywhere , i got options to escape jams . Extra $3 .</p>
              <p>AMK - i can go back Thomson .</p>
              <p>ECP route : I got Nicholl Highway as an esape route .</p>
              <p>All on experiences .</p>
              <p>If the pax stick inside CBD laghi good , i can connect one more $3 tariff inside CBD .</p>
              <p>Sometimes , we have ways to find pax that will stick around town .</p>
              <p>we know which area the customer mostly go where .</p>
              <p>Like Ikea Alexandra , do u think there's Pasir Ris customers ? or Tampines customers ? This Ikea Alexandra is catered most to western Singaporeans .</p>
              <p>Like wise , it will be stupid to curse Ikea Tampines' customers that u picked that never go to Jurong . All short distance .</p>
              <p>Like Bedok MRT , 90% u pick will be around Bedok .</p>
              <p>Like Tenah merah MRT , most u pick goes to Kew Cresent or Bedok South .</p>
              <p>In town , i can easily spot a Caucasian , and i know i won't be going Punggol or Sengkang .</p>
              <p>The most damn unlucky , Serangoon Garden .</p>
              <p>I plot my own income .</p>
              <p>Base on xperiences .</p>

              <p>Hi Poolman,</p>
              <p>I am a new part time cabbie, driving for the 4th time last Friday. My experience that night is quite the same as yours. I started 1 hour later at 615pm and stopped driving at about 4am. I did not have a dinner break like you but 2 short pee/smoke breaks. I grossed $300 and drove 380km. It was better than my previous Friday night where I grossed only $250. I hope it gets better as my experience grows.</p>
              <p>That night, I picked up 4 Indians from Changi Business Park going to 4 different locations in Tampines, with total fare of about $8. I found that irritating, time consuming and unprofitable. I dont know if I am right to feel this way, and if so, what can I do to avoid this kind of fare/trip.</p>
              <p>Any advice will be helpful. Thanks.</p>

              Wow look like night owl shift, so interesting.
              
              According to my survey cos i am a day shift driver, all the drivers  meetup during washing session at the depot asking around.
              Even my hirer also driving night according to him, 5pm to 12am. If you hit than that is the jackpot of the day, 1am to 3am that is the bonus.  4 days of the weeks Mon to Thur. Why i know cos the driver record book for the last 2 weeks or so he only did below 200km on his record. But i will try one or two night and see for myself.
