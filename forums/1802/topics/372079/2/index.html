              <p>Hi Poolie Shifu,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the wakeup call, it really is useful. Your wakeup call is the best cos I like things straight to the point. Your words are golden advice and I have to be realistic in this cruel world but it has become better with friends around in this forum (Poolie, ALN, CM840_2009, RotaryEngine, KCTK, Teolk. Sorry if I miss anyone out) Really got alot to learn from you and other experts here. All of you are sharing with me your experiences and I will read carefully as the commuters, road experiences, driving conditions and traffic congestions are all the issues to my rice bowl. I got to plan carefully like what you've mentioned. Thanks for all the concern from everyone. Shifu,<br>I will plan out something and work what's best for me as I will tailor myself to my needs and plan properly. I don't wish to overwork and leave my taxi hanging at the carpark not earning a single cent. I will plan my trip well before I even start and don't wish to start blindly. Slowly, u will get to know I'm a person who doesn't like to have my<br>time wasted. Time is very precious to a Virgo but I need to plan well which I know I won't take long as it's how fast I got my taxi license, I will do the same to $ too. I am a fighter too like what you mention but I will rest well at the right time, go gym instead of going kopi hanging around talking cock (at times need to but not always), "talk cock" means hangout to discuss strategies of driving, share experiences and then move on to get more customers. That's my mindset.</p>
              <p>By the way, Poolie shifu, your "talk cock" = experiences that is priceless. Thanks for sharing.</p>
              <p>bro CM840_2009,<br>I don't really need a huge loan, I will work things out by Monday. :) Thanks for your concern.</p>
              <p>shifu ALN, <br>I fall into some of cat b and confirmed cat c! Damn hungry!<br><br>Thanks for all the advice and directions. I have a better sense of direction and vision for myself. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Actually come to think of it .... OMO , to start at 1pm , ends @ 12am , not too bad .</p>
              <p>First , enough sleep .</p>
              <p>Second , 1pm not too bad , at least got something , by 3pm , should be able to cover $40 , which is what half a shift cost .</p>
              <p>3pm when others changing shift time , ur engine just start to run hot ..... up to 5pm , should be able to achieve another $40 .</p>
              <p>If base on what i fare from 5pm to 12am , $180 , i predict averagely this OMO can collect $240-$260 range , which is good enough to get $100 - $120 nett salary , the least .</p>
              <p>3rdly , can still see their wife or children , not so isolated case .</p>
              <p>If i am a OMO , i will do that .</p>
              <p>What's TeoLK's timing ar ???</p>

              <p>when i chiong , no sms , no phone calls , even my wife call me , i will also say : " Hey , free i call back , driving at 120km/h , ECP . "</p>
              <p>When i chiong , my brain kept working working , focusing focusing , thinking thinking , planning next move , like in a chess game .</p>
              <p>Like in a chess game , 1 wrong move , that's it , checkmate !!!</p>
              <p>Every single move , precision must be there . The direction i am heading , it's very crucial .</p>
              <p>I take one example .... 10pm .</p>
              <p>If in town , kena one go Wland , that's it , the night is almost game over .</p>
              <p>why ?</p>
              <p>Wland hardly can't connect any pax .</p>
              <p>And next move is to come back town , it's a bloody long way , by the time u hit town again , it should fastest round trip 45 minutes , u lose out on at least 1 trip .</p>
              <p>So solution ? 10pm , never pick any locals , or chose a spot where normal u get no wlands trips . Or pick and chose at Tekka .</p>
              <p>If one evening , u went Yishun once , went wlands once , went Punggol once , that evening u not likely to achieve good figures .</p>
              <p>This is tactics .</p>
              <p>Alvin Tan , agree on this ?</p>

              <p>I omo for a reason,I think everyone should. Not just because someone can't,lazy or don't know how to find relief then jump into the omo ship.</p>
              <p>take mentor pool as example,he did $310 from 4.30pm to 3.30am nett salary $230 with rental at $45. If I put in the same effort same timing same collection,my nett salary only $185 cos my rental is $90</p>
              <p>if I chiong 26 days that is $1170 less i collect.</p>
              <p>den y i still chose OMO?</p>
              <p>I need the taxi during the daytime to do my own thing &amp; i find it uneasy to have relief.But Sunday/ph is a must to rest for me so i have a full day relief</p>
              <p>let's say I rent out my taxi in the daytime for $42, I may have to take taxi around &amp; do my things.I waste time as well,time is $$$.so in the end i chose OMO</p>
              <p>lots of newbies started as omo cos they are so green in the trade,how to expect they know how to find relief even b4 they collect the taxi. And not forgetting how Comfort &amp; Smrt come out with super attractive package to lure newbies to sign up.What OMO get 3 free days rental,what $2500 sign up bonus,what course fee refund</p>
              <p>To me it's all bullshit</p>
              <p>end up you'll find yourself OMOing in a crown,paying $90 rental daily.</p>
              <p>knn u think company care? those ccb will be laughing all the way to the bank </p>

              <p>my driving timing starts 7am to 10am sometimes till 12pm. I'll make sure i get $130 b4 i stop for half time. $130 = rental + whole day fuel</p>
              <p>then i go bank in rental</p>
              <p>then 4pm start again till i get $130 to $150 salary then i stop. most of the time by 9.30pm i'm back home. sometimes 7.30pm  i hit target liao</p>
              <p>the key is how u make full use of the 2 peak hrs.</p>
              <p>fri &amp; sat I drive a bit longer,my target for weekends is $200 salary</p>
              <p>monthly normally my salary range from $3200 - $3600</p>
              <p>but no life</p>
              <p>So my family life is 9.30pm to 11.30pm b4 going to bed &amp; again 12pm to 4pm.</p>
              <p>Like wat i mentioned b4,once i achieve my objective,I'll convert to ah pek style of driving. maybe in another 4-5years,that's y i sign up with prime lol</p>

              <p>If in town , kena one go Wland , that's it , the night is almost game over .</p>
              <p>why ?</p>
              <p>Wland hardly can't connect any pax .</p>
              <p>And next move is to come back town , it's a bloody long way , by the time u hit town again , it should fastest round trip 45 minutes , u lose out on at least 1 trip .</p>
              <p>So solution ? 10pm , never pick any locals , or chose a spot where normal u get no wlands trips . Or pick and chose at Tekka .</p>
              <p>If one evening , u went Yishun once , went wlands once , went Punggol once , that evening u not likely to achieve good figures .</p>
              <p>This is tactics .</p>
              <p>Alvin Tan , agree on this ?</p>
              <p>Teo , any comments ?</p>

              omo hours.... i will take advance to airport 4-5am.... then drive till 11am.... or 1pm...
              
              rest 1pm to 4pm
              
              drive 4pm to 11pm
              
              total 14 to 16 hours.... sunday find full relief... sat morning also find morning relief....
              
              if i omo, it IS to earn money.... dun talk about family life or proper rest.... cant have best of both worlds....
              
              if i omo and drive 10 or even 12 hrs.... that is waste time to me... just be a relief or rent out half shift is better and healthier....
              
              my opinion lah.... never try before....

              <p><br>$5000 .... divided by 27 days , equals to daily nett must be $185 , plus rental $80 , fuel $50 ( i don't think so little on petrol ) , i make it $100 on petrol more like it .</p>
              <p>Total overheads $365 per day ....</p>
              <p>Note : My hirer drove 5.45am to 4pm handover to me , $52 all on petrol ( he trial it ) . So i am not going to go low on fuel for your estimations .</p>
              <p>If $1 to 1km ..... to get $365 , u need 365km , 365km x $1.70 on petrol , $62 .</p>
