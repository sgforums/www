              <p>axelc, i believe you have read many threads here. Don't make yourself confuse. My advise to you is to go down to all the taxi company. Sit down and get their explanation of their latest offers and benefits.  Don't commit instantly -- put down in your own comparison chart and i believe there will be one or two companies that suit your requirement. </p>
              <p>If you have really no money for big deposit, Silvercab has one new scheme for newbie driver. You only put down $250 as deposit and the rest will be top up to $1 K.  Better you go down and collect all informations and see for yourself.    Comfort is bullshiting you, You can get a Crown anytime.</p>
              <p>If you really need monies, then sign up with SMRT for 6 months and recover your course fees, medical fees, licence fees, etc.....to get all those incentives monies but you will be driving a Crown like Teolk for 6 months.</p>
              <p>After that then you start to talk to all bros here and i believe everyone will have their own opinion and you still have to decide for yourself.</p>

              <p>i couldn't tell you what to decide. However, i think you don't have to go all companies. Forget about Prime and Smart.  Prime 5 years commitment doesn't suit you as a newcomer.  You need time to find out taxi life. Just compare comfort, smrt, silver and transcab for your own goodness.  Because their offer and benefits keep on changing. Ask questions at taxi co and don't take things for granted.</p>
              <p>What i tell you today may not be valid tomorrow anymore.</p>

              <p>Dun be too rush to be a hirer yet .</p>
              <p>I suggest a plan ....</p>
              <p>Cos TransCab need full deposit for hirer .</p>
              <p>I suggest TransCab ...cos auto and they give the most money , and it's comfortable and popular .</p>
              <p>U be a TransCab relief first .... like 3 months , cos relief can pay instalments .</p>
              <p>So within 3 months , ur security deposit settle , right ?</p>
              <p>Then 3 months  expereince should be sufficient , then be hirer .</p>
              <p>While waiting for the new Wish , hang on with the hirer .... until u get the key for the new wish ?</p>
              <p>How about that ?</p>
              <p>All win win win situation .</p>
              <p>Driving for Comfort will die , cos Crown will kill you slowly , hahahahah</p>

              <p>hi axel, when i was a newbie, i started out as a comfort hirer going omo. extremely bad move!!! first month was especially bad. i didn't have any problems with the driving part cos i have my own set of wheels for many years. but the learning curve for destinations &amp; routes is really very steep and you gotta learn fast. in my first week there were days when i took home $20 after rental of $104.86 and diesel of about $40. also, i didn't know how to regulate my working hours, so there were days when i finished at 11pm and then couldn't wake up the next morning. i couldn't drive nights cos my night vision is poor, so out of necessity i have to drive in the day. it was only from my 2nd month when i managed to find a night relief that i settled into a work routine. that was back in end 2007 when the economy was still doing fine. it was all very demoralising and i was asking myself is it really so difficult to drive a taxi. it was also a kind of awakening for me when i realised that some people really do treat taxi drivers as the lowest form of life in sgp, maybe even lower than maids.</p>
              <p>so what we are trying to say in this forum is that : newbie hirer = bad idea, newbie omo hirer = extremely bad idea. tiredness = high chance of accidents.</p>
              <p>listen to poolie, "sit on the cow while looking for a horse". start as a relief first, build up your knowledge base and then consider your next move. don't be impulsive. good luck in your new career!</p>

              a) retirees with enough saving, driving for fun and dun like relief to disturb them, treat taxi like own transport
              
              b) beri hungry cabby.... like me.... haha
