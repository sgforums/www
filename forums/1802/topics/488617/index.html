              <p>Went into the carpark, slow down at stop line intending to turn left, saw a car coming from the left, so stop to let him turn.</p>
              <p>He is turning at 45deg instead of 90deg, never mind, I reverse to give him space to turn. But as I reverse, he continue moving until his left rear wheel hit my right bumper, causing a dent.</p>
              <p>I have already reverse to avoid collision, but that guy just continue moving while I reverse.</p>
              <p>Submitted the case to Transcab, but was classified as 50/50.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>

              <p>I understand most carpark accident is 50/50. But in this case i got the video to proof I am trying to avoid the collision but reversing, and he is the one who persist on moving forward.</p>
              <p>I agree I slow down instead of stopping at the stop line. If I hit his vehicle right after passing the stop sign, 100% my fault.</p>
              <p>Point here is, I or we DID NOT hit each other even after I pass the stop line. I had already stop when I saw his vehicle. So not stopping at stop line causing collision is not valid here, right?</p>
              <p>At most I kanna fine for not stopping at stop line.</p>
              <p>You can see from the video I had already reverse for him to let him pass. For your info, I had to look at the rear and side mirror for any vehicle or people behind while reversing, I cannot be looking at the front while reversing, right? </p>
              <p>He is the impatient one who did not want to wait for me to reverse, and continue moving while I reverse until he hit the bumper, what can I do? I do not even have the time to warn him.</p>
              <p>So based on you guys analysis, I am at fault also for the collision in this case?</p>

              <p>Bro relief, I understand what you are trying to say. But there is no collision even after I pass the stop line.</p>
              <p>Your case is collision when you move out, I understand, suay.</p>
              <p>My case is NO collision when I move out, collision happened while I am reversing to give way to him, and he presisted on moving forward.</p>
              <p>I had already done my part to avoid, but atlas, this sotong impatient driver just don't know when to wait. </p>
              <p>Can I based on this point and go look for Jasmine? </p>
              <p>Anyone successful in appealing a 50/50 case?</p>
              <p>I rather get fined for not stopping at stop line then to pay the $1070, because of a goondu.</p>

              I think we all sympathise your situation, as we are all TDs having experienced many such cases before learning to be street and road smart on the road. So, I guess you take it from here, learn a lesson, altho expensive, but it is part our hazard and life as a TD.
                  
              Private settlement can another way, but of course that will not be a 50/50 chance, and as that vehicle is a expensive, he may want more pay out, and in private settlement, thru my experiences, better to have a black and white.
                  
              You may claim that you are not wrong, so is that private car owner, he may be fighting for 100% yr fault with his insurance company. So, I guess, we take from here unless Transcab's Aunty Jasmine can do pay for you, you may get a successful appeal, not on insurance, but on Transcab account, which I think is most unlikely unless you got a connection with Her, but tia kong, my bro CT already booked her.
                  
              And for TC, you know lah, they are famous in faulting their own drivers than other

              <p>So based on bro relief understanding, the decision by the insurance company is final, and if want to appeal have to go through a lawyer, which is impossible for us peasant. It will already cost a bomb just by discussing with a lawyer.</p>
              <p>I thought that even though I slow down instead of stopping at the stop line (my fault), as long as there is no collision, I will not be at fault for the collision.</p>
              <p>And I also thought that I had took measures to avoid the collision by reversing, and he is the one who keep pushing on and finally hit my bumper, I should be safe from any liability, because it is the other party who insist on moving forward which caused the collision.</p>
              <p>My thought is, yes, I did not stop at the stopping line which is my fault. But I did not collide into his vehicle. He is the one who continue moving while I try to avoid the collision. From the time I stop till I reverse until he hit my bumper, there is ample time for him to stop and wait, but he did not.</p>
              <p>I thought the insurance company will judge based on the above, so I was totally wrong.</p>
              <p>I want to do private settlement also cannot. The moment the vehicles collided, he came down with his handphone to took picture, while I went out without my handphone intending to do a discussion. This arrogant goondu argued for awhile and tell me to find a good lawyer, went back to his vehicle and immediately drove off. I quickly went back to the taxi to take my handphone, and only manage to capture the rear of his vehicle, not even his damage.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I will still look for Jasmine and ask her how does the insurance company come up with this decision.</p>

              <p>Bro Strike,</p>
              <p>From video, it seems that idiot did not signal his intention to turn right.  No signal lights seen.</p>
              <p>So, failure to signal, he is also in the wrong. A normal person might think he was going straight.  If he had signaled, you might have reacted faster and reversed earlier to give him more space to turn.</p>
              <p>So at best 50/50 case cos u did not stop at stop line and he failed to signal.</p>

              <p>Seems like the main fault here is because I did not stop at the stop line.</p>

              <p>Another question, if the other driver had waited for me to reverse, we would not have collided, right? So is this the "cause of action " that caused the collision? </p>
              <p>So whose smlj "cause of action" caused the collision? </p>
              <p>I talk about reverse because it is an action I took to avoid the collision, but the action the other party took is to keep moving forward which resulted in the collision. </p>

              <p>Look at it this way.  Because you did not stop at the stop line, you overshot the junction and had to reverse. Thus you contributed to the accident even though that idiot was impatient.</p>
              <p>Had you stopped much earlier at the stop line, this might not have happened.</p>
              <p>That idiot did not signal, so he was at fault too.</p>
              <p>That's why I said at best 50/50.  Count yourself lucky if you are not 100% liable. It is not possible the other guy is 100% liable and you nothing.</p>

              <p>compare to other bigger cases, true, ts part is mild and even forgiving to willing roll backwards since he feel he made a slight misjudgment. in most cases, the other party will usually give and take..also like what ts did, will probably patient a bit wait a bit see got enough space can move then move on.. then nothing happen liao..</p>
              <p>but this other bugger is a brute who drives a big continental car. this type they expect to be served, not to serve. to them, they are high class, td is not even on the radar of what they consider human. closer to strays they see on the road, roll over get kill? too bad lor. but don't say this case, this type will push their way any situation then proclaim its the other party fault no matter what. they are willing to go all the way to argue out..even in the end 80/20 they also shiok. this part is ts suay encounter (but as they say, climb mountain often sure will meet tiger one day, this one all td must mental)</p>
              <p>but the worst part that is not suay but by own will, is go submit this video of all people..to Red Co.  this is like putting head into the lion mouth. ready to be bitten. if the other party is already one enemy, then sending this video in is as good as kiap between 2 enemies. sure die. because Red market strategy is very simple. Eat-All-You-Can-While-You-Can. they can also eat paying passengers who call in feedback..what makes you think they don't eat their own kind. Red practice is as long as there is 0.01% doubt, means td either 50% or 100%.</p>
              <p>i am driving for Red and this happen, i will probably agreed to private settle with the driver, humble down and ask for forgiveness. this type once they feel shiok. 200 they also ok la. they don't need money. they need FACE every second of their life, even if they are wrong. ESPECIALLY if they are wrong ;)</p>
