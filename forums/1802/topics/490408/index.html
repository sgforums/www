              Brother, whenever there is a new food stall or kopitiam open near yr place, many will tends to patronise, look look, see see, if good, will continue to patronise, if not, just walk away and visit your usual food centre and life goes on.
              
              Taking this approach, Pte apps such as Uberx and Grabcar are the latest new kid in town, meaning, just open. So, many people will try, some find it good, some find it no good, some never even want to try it out, or some dunno how to try on it.
              
              Therefore, in the recent survey, tia kong 53% believe that these apps need to be regulated, 20% never use them, 10% dunno what it is, and about 17% said they are good, should not regulate it.
              
              Coming back to TD, today, nite drivers are taking less due to pte apps, day one do not affect much, because apps hv an advantage of no midnite and call charges. Press only, can get already, so efficiency and effectives while our nite drivers are still interviewing those at the Q.
              
              So, at the end of the day, intake of TDs will surely be affected, that resulted in many thrown keys and companies scrambling to come out with newer and newer pattern to recruit drivers and at the same time, retain drivers.
              
              Govt on the other hand, are reluctant to regulate pte apps due to it freelance nature, just like tuition teachers, freelance photographer, freelance marine workers, freelance nude model and even freelance pros..so why should they regulate a pte freelance transport. And anything being regulate will involve cost and enforcement, which LTA is literally speaking, short handed and short sighted

              Bond, those other 60+ jobs is taken by mostly ex taxi drivers who had switched to pte apps ride for whatever reason. So if you look at it closely, in a nutshell, if these 60 apps call drivers do not drive for apps, they will also be driving for a taxi companies, and they will also be competiting with you on call.

              <p>Still got people say very difficult to call for cabs during peak hours lah... just not as many because Grabtaxi made it easier to tab the services of taxi from the other 4 taxi companies.  One of my customers said during morning peak hours, even Uber would not be able to service her needs.</p>
              <p>On Saturday and Sunday at shopping malls, you still see long queues waiting for taxis.  However this situation cannot be solved easilly as there is a sudden surge in demand during Saturday and Sunday....and adding more taxi drivers is not the solution as there is no such big demand during weekdays.  So waiting slightly longer during high demand periods is the only way to work it out.</p>
              <p>Fortunately for Singaporeans too there are 50000 non-active taxi drivers who already have taxi license who continue to renue their license everytime knowing they could be retrenched anytime and would need this job.   Otherwise some people in power sure suggest hiring more foreigners to solve the problem.  These 50,000 people made sure the situation is "Singaporeans wants taxi driving as main and backup job".   So in the unfortunate event of<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> mass retrenchment during economic downturns, many Singaporeans would not have financial problems.</span></p>
              <p>Transcab currently has at least 800 taxis not rented out; Comfort has at least 100 taxis not rented out.   So there are at least 1000 taxis not rented out.  This equates to 2000 jobs (not including those existing hirers who are unable to find relief drivers) readilly available for Singaporeans who need jobs if they are retrenched in future.  </p>
              <p>Recently we saw Coca Cola announcing the plan to shift production plant to Malaysia in 2016.  With this move, I foresee more factories shifting away.   Because the manufacturing industry Singaporean citizen/PR to foreign worker ratio is 1:9, the taxi industry can provide enough jobs for Singaporeans even if a few tens of factories shift away to cheaper countries like Malaysia, China, Vietnam, Thailand and India.</p>
              <p>So the existing Singaporeans who are always complaining about this and that have to think longer term and wait slightly longer and not pressurize the government to open up taxi industry to foreigners and PRs or suggest or support usage of driverless cars as they could be retrenched anytime and may need taxi driving job.  Even if they would not end up in that situation, they must think what happens if 55,000 pure Singaporeans taxi driving jobs (affects 220,000 Singaporeans) are lost to driverless cars or foreigners.</p>

              <p>Also the priority should be Singaporeans first.  If foreign workers or PRs are retrenched, they go back to their own country and could find another job there.   Those from third world countries could easilly buy a house there after working here for a few years.  Singaporeans who are retrenched here are stuck with the Singapore's high cost of living.</p>
              <p>I often talk with foreign workers when driving taxi.  One Philipino maid I talked with said she saved enough money to be able to go back to Philipines to live comfortably.  A few Malaysians told me Singapore is too expensive for them to want to settle down here so they rather work here, save money and buy house in JB (unlike Singaporeans who only can buy houses that are at least 1 million ringgit (S$333,333), they could buy cheap houses there and buy Proton Sagas which only cost about S$13,000 each).</p>

              There are quite a number of new TDs or those taking TDVL  are new citizen of Singapore from China, philipines and malaysia. 
              
              ICA gives away new citizenships are mainly for those who are well educated, able to contribute to the singapore economy and society, but today, you see them becoming TDs, what does that imply?
              
              If new citizens today become TD of Singapore, why need to get degrees holders who hold mangerial position to quailify as a criteria to be a Citizen of Singapore. Just call in their countries' Taxi driver can already...tio bo?
              
              With regards to these Pinoy maids and all these PRs, they are the same as us, 10 TDs, 10 asshole characters, so dun believe in them too much. Most can say heaven and got many money here and there, and that their goods are cheaper in their countries, but to be frank, most of them are suffering too.

              <p>They were deemed as needed by the country and were granted Singapore Citizenship.  However, like Singaporeans, they are not  immune to retrenchment.  TD is also a backup job for them if they give up their original citizenship.  Our Stanford PhD TD Dr Cai Ming Jie is the best example.   However he has returned back to China and is now working as a General Manager at <span style="color: #252525; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17.92px;">Hongye Innovative Antibody Technologies according to Wikipedia.</span></p>
              <p>Third world country workers if they are able to save money in Singapore should go back home happilly since cost of living back home is higher.  Many Malaysians are happy to live in JB and work in Singapore since they could be with their folks, enjoy benefits of having a car and save a lot since money converted back to Ringgit is very favourable.  If they rent in Singapore, a substantial part of their salary would go to rental so they rather spend more time on the road.  Many working in factories work only 3-4 days a week (12-hour shift) as their employers calculated already and do not want to pay overtime rates to get them to work longer hours.  So they are also very happy since they have 3-4 rest days per week.   However those working in Malaysia (especially JB) and earning Ringgits are suffering as prices of some foreign goods went up due to Ringgit depreciation.  Many employers of foreign workers pay for their lodging too (eg SMRT bus drivers from China) so those foreign workers would go back home happilly too unless they do not save money that they earned.  Those foreign workers from 1st World Countries like USA, Japan and UK if they get retrenched here could still go back home to become TDs where they charge a lot higher taxi fares should they be unable to find a better job back home.</p>
