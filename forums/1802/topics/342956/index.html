              <p>Was discussing with friends that if Singaporean is out of job, last hope is to be a taxi driver cause the pre-requiste for taxi driver is being a Singapore citizen. (<a title="To Become A Qualified Taxi Driver" href="http://www.taxi.org.sg/tvl.htm"><span style="color: #000000;"></span></a><a title="http://www.taxi.org.sg/tvl.htm" href="http://www.taxi.org.sg/tvl.htm"><span style="color: #000000;">http://www.taxi.org.sg/tvl.htm</span></a>)</p>
              <p>But my friend argue that that's being racist! Why can't FT or PR become taxi driver too?</p>

              if a local taxi driver can serve me just as good or better, i see no reason why allow FT and PR... cabby is a job and if local can do it well or better, why need to open up to foreigners when there is no lack of local taxi drivers?
              
              think about this... wd you allow your gf or sister or daughter to be driven home half drunk at night in a taxi driven by foreign worker?
              
              how long it needs for a foreigner to know where and what is ang-sa-lee and best way to get there?

              <p>True. But the same thing is there's many other jobs which local can do well yet is taken up by FT.</p>
              <p>I was accused as being racist by my friend when I bring up the arguement that it is dangerous to let foreigners be taxi driver as they can rob the passenger and run away...</p>
              <p>Anyway, maybe not FT, what about PR then?</p>

              <p>GPS... won't tell you that Springleaf Tower in Anson Road must come by Prince Edward cos the drop-off point is at Prince Edward side, not Anson Road. And in the CBD area can't just drop the pax along Anson Road. There are many many more such situations. FT with a GPS...hmmmz. So oxford, imagine it is your first time to Springleaf Tower for an interview (some high flyer job paying $200+K a year), FT with GPS takes you to Anson Road....alamak cannot stop here sir, I turn back and let u drop at International Plaza taxi stand or CPF Building taxi stand ok? not ok ah..so how? yeah, you will get there, sometime, eventually, but late for your important interview, so how?</p>

              <p>A good GPS is far better than the majority of taxi drivers I have met who don't even know Singapore roads, much less buildings. The fact is: you have not proven that a local will know Singapore roads better than a foreigner with the right training. Put all cab drivers through a rigorous exam (London can drivers spend a year in training to sit the 'Knowledge of London' exam). London cab drivers are required to know the shortest route between any two points in London. Do the same for taxi drivers in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Whoever can get through the exam, regardless of citizens or foreigners, will deserve the license.</p>

              <p>GPS systems are not heuristic in nature.</p>
              <p>The role of human memory over the best  routes to take at different times of the day, beats the data churned out of the GPS that does not take into account multiple factors that affect road conditions.</p>
              <p>Secondly, foreigners may not have lived here long enough to know non-official but vernacular names of places/buildings/streets in Singapore.</p>
              <p>We've got enough service quality issues with foreign bus drivers as it is. This is Singapore, not some kucing kurap place where cost is the only sole factor.</p>

              <p>if a local taxi driver can serve me just as good or better, i see no reason why allow FT and PR… cabby is a job and if local can do it well or better, why need to open up to foreigners when there is no lack of local taxi drivers?</p>

              <p><br>Frankly speaking, it isn't exactly safe for the ladies even when the driver is a Singaporean, but somehow the idea of my gf/sister/daughter boarding a cab driven by a FT just doesn't seem comfortable.</p>

              <p>This FT thing has a bit of truth to it.</p>
              <p>Coffee shops have FTs and I can experience the service standards has changed for the better.  Mustafa has FTs and I can safely say they has better courtesy than their locally bred staffs (most, there are exceptions but few).</p>
              <p>Personal opinion; the FTs will over time behave like locals, because many Singaporeans still do not have the social grace to react to courtesy or 'grace' bestowed upon them. Example, the cashier says (with sincerity that I can feel it) 'thank you for shopping with Mustafa....etc'. What would be your SPONTANEOUS answer to that.</p>
              <p>I had stood aside and observed, many locals do not EVEN hear what the cashier was saying  and when those who did, do not understand what this appreciation of custom the FT cashier was trying to convey to them. They just stared and left.</p>
              <p>People like to be recognised or at least appreciated for what they do, many locals do not reciprocrate appropriately to sitiuations and requests. We demand that our needs be catered to and do not know how to reward accordingly, be it a kind word or materially.</p>
              <p>In time, without these 'sustenance" even the most enduring service providing diehards will give and become a Singaporean. (I'm puttting a capital 'S' in singaporean out of courtesy).</p>
              <p>C'mon! let's all grow up and be less self-centered and be one with <em>..........humanity?</em></p>
