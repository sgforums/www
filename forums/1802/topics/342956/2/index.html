              FT service standard good? i seriously doubt it... look at delifrance filipinos... for sure they can only speak english... so local have to adjust to be served by them... and their english got a strong accent... and they are not exactly very speedy in their service to say the least... the local old aunties can do much better in my opinion...
              
              the PRC at coffeeshop? they are as hardworking or as lax as their employers allow them.... and whenever i order, i will speak directly to local cos i gave up telling PRC kopi xiu dai or teh po

              <p>Once i picked up a Consultant from WFA , workforce agency , he told me the garmen wanted taxi drivers , but not the young one . They have plans to get rid of younger drivers , they want the younger generation to work , rather than to drive .</p>
              <p>So instead of getting rid of them directly , the garmen overhaul the taxi fare system to discourage those burdened younger cabbies to quit for a fixed salary job .</p>

              <p>Pool is super right.</p>
              <p>Oxford, since u are such a big proponent of GPS, please tell me which model to buy and which maps to download which will lead me to Ang Sa Lee, Lam Bo Leh, Bo Leh Long, Kin Jio Ka, Chit-ko, Chup-ko, etc. It is a fact of life that many elderly customers WILL use these names as they don't know the england name. Many pax in their 20s &amp; 30s always tell me Tanglin Halt 16 Lau or Tanglin Halt 10 Lau. Best...Chinese FT takes taxi driven by Indian FT.....Chinese FT Mah Lee Shi Ta Lu....Indian FT ????? At least our younger generation of Malay, Indian compatriots understand quite a bit of mandarin to get by. FYI not a single taxi company provides GPS in their cabs. The ones in Comfort/Citycab cabs are not GPS but simple maps.</p>
              <p>Get a vocally-challenged (not mute) passenger asking you to send him to Ang Sa Lee and the problem is doubly compounded. Don't even bother asking the passenger to write down the destination. Literacy aside, some are hyper-sensitive and will think that you are mocking them. It really takes a lot of locally knowledge to even guess the destination.</p>
              <p>FT, possible, just not in the near future. Take a peek at our gahmen's 5 year plan. FTs don't vote in elections. Taxi driver vocation is considered a job of last resort by many Singaporeans who want to be at least assured of a way to earn money in the worst case scenario, even those who have a job now. AND not necessarily only blue collar workers. Many PMETs are taxi drivers now. Just ask the guys in this forum. You can rant &amp; rave but our gahmen will keep it this way in the forseeable future. Period.</p>
