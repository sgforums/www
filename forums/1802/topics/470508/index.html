              One of our customer had sent us an interesting video that he managed to capture with his in car camera. Through us, he wishes to inform fellow drivers to pay extreme attention to similar setup.
              
              I have taken a close look at this video and admits that I do agrees with my customer on his view. Over the years, I have come across a few cases of similar nature. For a long time I have suspected that there are many possible fraudulent accident cases but for the first time, I managed to get my hands on a possible video to cement my thoughts.
              
              Looking at this video from a professional position, i tried to brainstorm a possible solution to advise the rear vehicle on his possible recourse to this accident, however after pondering for a while, I realized that it is almost impossible to have a justified defense on the rear vehicle position. There is no way that any in car camera could have captured any evidence to prove this is a fraudulent staged accident. To further complicate the matter, I do not think that the authorities or the insurance companies have the abilities to be able to contact the driver to the 2nd Malaysian car to investigate even if they suspect this to be a possible fraud. Drawing from our companyâ€™s experience from operating in Malaysiaâ€™s claim system, I think it is almost impossible for any variable investigation to be carried out hence the possibility of similar cases still happening across Singapore, even at the very minute you are reading this blog.
              
              In my view, there is a way to try to curb this problem for the insurance companies. 1st is to narrow down the accomplices that are operating in Singapore. For a fraud case to work, there must be a company from Singapore submitting the case for the 2nd Malaysia vehicle. If the insurance companies were to pull their data together, I am sure they are able to see a pattern of claims submitted from a few resources. From this information, they can approach the matter from these few entities that are based in Singapore.
              
              Another tricky situation is that the claims are submitted through a Malaysian company, However I believe this is quite unlikely as there will be many logistic problems like transporting the vehicle back to Malaysia for repair and surveying the vehicle prior to repair as required by the law for claim in Singapore
              
              I will not go into further details on how to counter these type of problem as this article is meant for motorists to keep their heads up while driving. My advise is to keep a safe distance from any Malaysian vehicles while hopefully the authorities could find a way to put an end to this problem.

              <p>the video got pulled..</p>
              <p>i think i saw it before.. guy in front brakes, the guy behind brakes and the 3rd car slams into the 2nd car? very normal.. the car in front of you stops you keep going? there is nothing wrong in what the 2nd car did..</p>
              <p>quite simple.. follow at a safe distance.. even at the right lane of the AYE and the guy in front of me slammed on the brakes, tyre smoke and all, i managed so stop in time because i am old school and followed the 2-second rule of following the car in front of me....</p>
              <p>the other cars behind me didn't and i got rear-ended..</p>
              <p>do not blame the malaysian cars and think up conspiracy theories for your own reckless driving.. keep a safe distance.. and if it is raining or when your vehicle has more people, the braking distance is larger...</p>

              <p>Not reckless lah, if people want to make you, what can we do, both turn into centre lanes and speed off, taxi, who make their bread on the road is sure to take the lane that car drive the faster mah, then suddenly the front brake, the second brake on time, but taxis Bang..</p>
              <p>Malaysia peoples, if you ask them what they are scare of, they are not afraid of racial riot, or that food is not enuf, or that cannot get a job, they are more scare of crime, it is one of the highest in Asia region. So, maybe because singapore is too low, they just want to make some here.</p>
              <p>You drive into malaysia, you will not be worrying much about tolls, jam, foods and stays, you worry more about your safety, your family and your vehicle.</p>
