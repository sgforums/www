              Mai ani kuan kong lah, drive taxi also an occupation mah, just a freelance occupation, an honest living, just that you do not get motivation often like other job, whereby they got pay rise, bonuses, free dinner, family day, teamwork, and so on.

              Everyman tends to see other good, but never themselves, that at time include their wife or gf, somehow, pple wife look better, pple gf look better in a way, other pple home look more nicer, other pple car look more chio, other pple style look better, other pple kids look more brighter. 
              
              Same goes to job, other pple job look better, easy and relaxing, but we will never see the true difficulties till we are on the JOB. Tell me, before you become a TD, how you look at taxi driver job. This is typical human behavorial and characteristic borne in, we cannot change it, but as long as we know it exist, we will be able to understand it.
              
              So, the next time you kpkb about yr taxi driving job, think of other having to face strict discipline hours, strict rules and regulation of companies, internal politic and gossip, the ever stress and pressure of demand, timeline, bosses bossing around, productivity, safety, management, grievences, victimisation, and so on an employee faces in his or her workplace.

              <p>Haha it wrks both ways la bros </p>
              <p>Let's off topic abit....</p>
              <p>Some see taxi driving as a upgrade </p>
              <p>Their previous jobs were worst so after starting to drive taxi they feel it's way better than their ex shit jobs </p>
              <p>Some held higher post with gd pay b4 they down grade to taxi driving </p>
              <p>I personally think only "tis group" will find it hard to adept n start complaining </p>
              <p>Including myself! I also hate taxi driving lol </p>
              <p>**Just sharing my background**</p>
              <p>I "used" to held a gd post with gd pay back then like many bros here </p>
              <p>I was getting paid gd money for doing simple tasks</p>
              <p>only need to wayang n use eye n mouth power nia lol </p>
              <p>No need to get my hands dirty no need to stand in hot sun etc etc life was so relaxing back then but to achieve all tis u need experience la</p>
              <p>I had 13 yrs under my belt so it was piece of cake to me </p>
              <p>but nothing last forever I got retrench </p>
              <p>My job was taken up by foreign talent for cost cutting n rest is history </p>
              <p>I decided not to go bk to my ex line bcoz I've to start fm bottom again in a new company</p>
              <p>Chances also very slim as companies started to employ more n more foreign trash bcoz they were much much more cheaper </p>
              <p>I also know tis forum n outside got many bros whom held high posts or ran their own business etc etc </p>
              <p>Read many stories here b4....I can't remember much but think one even had a property in Australia or something </p>
              <p>So not every one thinks taxi driving is a shit job wit last resort la </p>

              Taxi driver to me, it fit best with people who are happy go lucky type, good sense of humor, live to forget and forgive, and most probably, for those who hv gone thru certain thick and thin in life and already see life more clearer, or so called wake up liao.
              
              You must posses within, lot of self discipline, self motivation, and self actualisation, if not, seibei hard to pass life, can alway hear some taxis buddies of mine at hoy fatt road kopi everyday kpkb about taxi driving life, and most already drive more than 10 years and some even 20years above. Life goes on.
              
              So, I will leave some enlighten words to perk up those kpkb drivers, Like it or not, You are a Taxi driver, and Since you are a Taxi driver, might as well enjoy it.

              <p>To be honest la,  you look at all the TDs around you,  the look of desperation, age and background. Okay i know got a small percentage live in private land housing and just hire a cab for personal usage but most drive because they are left with no choice or for pocket money because of a lack of retirement funds. They need to survive. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Touch your heart and ask yourself la. If you have enough savings to retire or each child give you pocket money or there is a 3k-4k job with benefits and weekends off waiting for you,  would you still want to drive anot and risk your life on the road. There are 101 things to do and you can fry stocks on the sideline relaxing in the comfort of your home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For young people,  i mostly see Malays driving. Maybe cause this job suits their family environment. For aging people, you see alot of them driving due to the fact that they are unable to retire due to lack of funds. If you got money would you drive? The answer is no. I got money i wont even want to use my fully paid private car to Uber. Facts. </p>

              <p>Conclusion. I can safely say, those driving taxi belong to one of the lowest caste in Singapore. Actually 3-4k salary is a small sum in Singapore. You are actually seriously underpaid as a Singaporean. And Singapore is expensive. Some rich men can go nightclubs or flowerjoints throw few k or 5 digits 1 night. Some worked hard their entire working life and have enough savings or pension to relax and do some side investment after 55 or 60 and wont even need to drive taxi for a living. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly speaking la,  got money will you drive anot?  Many TDs if tomorrow touch lottery or big 4D throw key and go Merc showroom and purchase a personal car already. Why still need to tolerate all the nonsense of the passengers and taxi companies or worst still,  go airport queue few hours for what, it is not very fun you know. And few days back at night T3 got big accident involving 2 taxis. Rush here and there for what, the max fare you can collect is $40+ during that period will it make you any richer or happier? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Damn stupid man some TDs i see. No wonder they are destined to drive others for a living till they see the last light of the tunnel. Dead end. æ­»è·¯ã€‚</p>

              <p>To each his own. I am speaking from my perspective.... taxi driving is really last resort for people like me. It is of course better than a cleaner or kopi kia or whatever but why must compare with these especially if you are educated?</p>
              <p>I could have been a tutor but I don't like teaching. Was in the broking industry and seen many many of my colleagues became millionaires, driving big cars, staying in big houses. But I didn't have the luck and kena bad debts.</p>
              <p>Later did some small business and was raking in tens of $1000s profits monthly until it went downhill. Of course by then cannot find any job liao so taxi driving is a last resort, stop gap, temporary measure to support family and property and living expenses.</p>
              <p>But I learn a lot of how TDs struggle to make ends meet. Yes, it is a tough life but there is the freedom to move about, the chance to talk to friendly people, eavesdrop on juicy gossips, go places in SG you never knew existed before, learn to handle nasty pax, learn to drive safe, discover so many new roads and routes, discover just how big this llittle red dot is actually.</p>
              <p>For me this is a temporary occupation so it is ok. But I feel for those who gave up on life and are resigned to this type of life, especially the OMO TDs.</p>
              <p>Never give up on your dream even if you are now driving a cab. Spare some time to reflect and work on something that will give you a better life. Yes, you can get used to this life, the mind is a funny thing. You can get used to poverty and maybe even love this life, just like you will get used to collecting cardboards when you are old....</p>

              <p>More jumping in means more Singaporeans got retrenched.</p>
              <p>I have been talking with my customers too.  One of them said he was considering becoming a taxi driver too as there does not seem to be a lot of good jobs out there now unlike before.  Another one said his collegue that got retrenched spent a few months without success finding a job.</p>
              <p>Renovation industry, stock brokeage industry and property agent industry also not doing well recently so maybe that is why a lot are becoming taxi drivers.</p>

              <p>Just to add, beware of complacency. One can be happy even when poor. Drive taxi for 20-30 yrs also can be happy lah. Happiness is not about money or lifestyle but a state of mind.</p>
              <p>A siao lang can be the happiest person on Earth but do you want to be like that? If you don't mind, then any job also can mah. Cleaners and cardboard collectors also can be very happy - got free exercise.</p>

              <p>Talking about pirates, noticed many at JEM, MBFC, even MBS sometimes, on ambush, lol.  Pirates like to go Sentosa because not many TDs like to go there. Pirates definitely eating our cake lah, many pax take grabcar because they are familiar with nd trust grabtaxi app. Also cheaper than taxi during peak and after midnight, I think.</p>
              <p>Pirates also complaining not many pings and hard to achieve target set for incentives. Bottomline it, the industry is getting saturated liao.....sian</p>

              But then, in this world nothing is free, luck is luck, no such thing as lady or gentlemen luck, given to you is because of luck, that is why it called lucky draw. 
              
              Many drivers also hv luck, some even kenna millions, but not all drivers can hold big money, after wining, spent lavishly, drink, sex, affair, buying, bad company, wrong investment..you name it, end up, frankly, worst than the time they did not strike. 
              
              You are quite decent, at least know how to save and go look for other job, but what is few hundred thousands dollar today, buy car or house also not enuf, still hv to struggle, but different bosses only.
              
              In life, the most important thing is, we must set priorty, what we want, our goal and our objectives. Without setting priorty, most will end up gong gong going no where but keep depending on LUCK
