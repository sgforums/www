He may not need to tell you that he is changing shift , judging from what he says you should know. Or maybe there is a heavy jam in the west at that time &amp; thats why he rejects it. </div></blockquote>Change shift is just excuse for surcharge of $2 during peak hours. Some even turn to change shift sign when approach you. After 4 pm. it very difficult to get taxi. Some even turn to other side of lane when approaching and drove past, whereby there is no customer in it and no change shift sign. After 4 pm, you will see less taxi but more passengers waiting for taxis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>helo, peak period 5pm to 8pm and 7am to 930am... 35% of fare during these duration. e.g. if you board before 5pm, the 35% surcharge is only imposed on the fare incurred from 5pm till end of your journey, not whole fare... booking fee or CBD surcharge are not subject to 35% surcharge...hope this clears</div>

              <p>i shared a silver cab with my friend ytd and the first destination was my place then my friend's place. we went in to the cab and told the uncle of the 2 destinations and in the end, he overshot and had to make a detour back. my friend told me that the uncle was very angry after i've alighted and asked her why i kept quiet when he passed by, caused him to make a detour and his job is just to drive not remembering the exact places. he even used very rude comparison like "you expect me to send you upstairs? you expect me to wipe your butt after you've shitted?"</p>
              <p>i mean he was very very rude to say that because in the first place he didn't even say that he did not know the road well. if he had said that, we would have kept an extra lookout and guided him along. since he did not say anything, we thought he knew his way there and so my friend and i just chatted happily away. if passengers' job is to guide the driver and the driver's job is just to drive and not recognising the place, why would we spend the money to take a cab when we apparently did because we want to relax on our journey home?</p>

              <p>taxis are only used as a last resort (e.g if I'm running late for an appointment or super heavy rain &amp; I'm carrying lots of things) otherwise it would be the trains &amp; buses for me..</p>
              <p>As for rainy days, most people would rather spend to get themselves to their destination without getting wet..</p>

              <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
              <p>I &amp; my wife encounter a very bad experience this morning with a Silver cab driver.Not only he was driving recklessly from the beginning, he even drove to wrong route 3 times! My wifet old him that he was making the wrong turn and that he was driving the longer route.He began to get aggitated and start scolding my wife.I intervene and started to record his conversation when he started to be rude.Asking me and my wife to "shut up" and we are not qualified to tell him on his driving speed(he's driving at 120km/h- I think even a primary school kid know that he is speeding).I told him that my wife is 7 weeks pregnant and he shouldn't speed, but he refuse to listen.I decided to alight the taxi as my wife was shaken by his recklesness. He even got the time to wind down his car window and scream at me and wife "You go and DIE!".</p>

              <p>Due the incident, my wife couldn't sleep all night.Doctor diagnose her as mentally traumatised.Thank god nothing affected by in born baby.</p>
