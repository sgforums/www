            <div class='col-md body'>After having supper with a friend along a coffeeshop in South Bridge Road about 10.15pm last night, I decided to take a cab home. I crossed the road to Cross Street as there are people waiting on both sides of South Bridge Road, not mentioning the taxi stand outside the Indian Temple which have a small queue. I waited along Cross Street for 30 minutes but still cannot managed to flag a cab. With people streaming out of the pubs along Club Street in groups and standing ahead of me within 10 meters and faking that they cannot see me adds flame to my frustration as I was tired after a long day and wants to get home for an early rest.<br><br>During this 30 minutes, I notice several cabs with 'blue light' on the car roof indicating available but with 'On Call' plate on the windscreen passing by. This really makes me wonder if the taxi drivers are taking advantage of the cab booking system to earn the extra dollar through phone booking. In the end, I walked to the entrance of a condominium along Club Street and flagged a cab that just dropped off a resident there. By then, its alrealdy 11pm.<br><br>I know that its the long wait for taxi that fueled me to write here, but I know I am not the only person out there who faces this frustration. I know those people who works in the CBD area, who can only get cab by booking when they finish work as they will almost never be able to flag a cab off the street during the period of 6.30pm-8pm.<br><br>Why are we at mercy of our own public transport system? Might as well make it a flat rate for flagging on the road and booking(excluding advance booking) but increase the starting meter to say $3. So taxi drivers do not play hide and seek just to earn that extra dollar through phone booking system. What if a tourist would be to wait for cab for a long time and they do not know the phone booking number?<br><br>Rant end.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LTA implemented a "Booking " service point demerit system , so Taxi company must comply with the regulation , or face with demerit points and subsequently got fine ! All LTA's fault .<br><br>Without this booking service standard system , taxi company won't do their best to force cabbies to earn extra dollars thru their booking system . Now they're making all ways to meet LTA demand on bookings quotas .<br><br>Taxi companies can always set a higher flag down and solve alot of problems with complaints .<br><br>I would be happy not to take any booking if the flag down is always $2.50 + $2 peak period surcharge ..... ie go up a taxi $4.50 .<br><br>Now with the peak hour $2 surcharge up to 7.59pm , commuters has got no problems at this time .<br><br>But after 8pm , when there's no surcharge , communters fly to flag a taxi home .... when a surge like that happens , the demand goes up , the supply went down , then price will go up .... like share market !!!<br><br>well , it's all commuters fault also afterall , it's them who make taxi like indispensable in public transport .<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">My advice : when there's a $2 surcharge , don't wait , grap a taxi and go ... don't wait til after 8pm , just to save $2 , you might end up paying $4 for booking a cab home . </span></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not really a complaint..But I made the stupidest mistake today..I was at Rivervale Mall's taxi stand and I wanted to go to Hougang Plaza in a rush to meet my friend..the time on my watch was 9.29am..just nice a Merc E200 NGT drove in, and I thought: "Hmm..might as well take it, since I haven't had a try in a CNG Merc cab."<br><br>So I hopped on..and just after the driver switch on the metre, the truth struck me like a bullet..there was the $2.00 peak hour surcharge..I forgot the peak hour surcharge is until 9.30am..if I had waited a little longer at the taxi stand I could have saved 2 bucks..I can't believe I worked at comfort before and I forgot about it..and coupled with the fact that the flag down rate of the CNG Mercs is 3 bucks, this made for a very expensive taxi ride..total fare: $6.40..oh wow..if I was just a few minutes late, the fare could have been $4.40..dammit.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Those going to airport , those going for meetings and business trips ..... and the most important , Comfort's corporate customers can get a cab . This corporate customers is those people who make cabbies , Comfort cabbies possible to survive as a cabby .<br><br>Increased $2 make many changed their travelling habits , from taking taxis to taking buses / mrt or even bought a car .<br><br>Then those who need a cab , instead of booking a taxi ($4) , now can get a normal (extra $2) taxi at the taxi stand .

I was frustrated of course, and started to curse both of them as i've waited for some time.<br><br>I mean, im the one who flagged it and signalled to you first that im boardin, but how can you do this.<br>I actually ask some of the drivers regardin this matter and they told me such acts are wrong. They shouldnt do this. I know. But what can i do  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So if there're any cab drivers here, do you do this?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>as in dont care who flagged or signalled to you first, as long as you see any target you just stop for them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was one incident a few weeks back, where my colleagues and I were having lunch.. As we left the hawker centre for our office, we saw 1 auntie in her 50s with a big basket of stuff she bought from the market flagging for a taxi in the car park. She wasn't walking very well. The driver refused to pick up the passenger and instead drove up another 5 metres to one of my colleague, who was walking slower than us, and asked her if she needed a taxi. Any taxi driver who thinks that this is ok, please explain why this is accepted. I agree that the taxi driver has the right to reject picking up passengers who have pets around. Please give me a reason (a good one) on why the driver has the right not to pick up that auntie. All the things she bought were packed properly and inside a big basket. Unless they are telling us that dead chicken meat bought from the market is considered a pet?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Or that she is not walking fast enough and that would delay his "precious" time to pick up other passengers?  I wrote to to Comfort to complain and the response given was that the driver is given a warning. How serious is the impact of the warning? Taxi drivers, please advice. And remember to give your reason to support that taxi driver if you think that that taxi driver did the right thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Other than the usual sudden stop sudden turns by taxis, recently I encountered a taxi driver who complained to me about him getting summons for stopping at a busstop...<br><br>Story goes:<br>I was waiting for someone at the passenger drop-off point, and subsequently the front part of the taxi stand cos there was space in front...<br>BTW its at Bishan MRT there...<br><br>Then up comes a taxi behind me...Cabby comes out and complains to me that he got a summon because people like me are blocking the taxi stands...And thus forcing him to go to the busstop to wait for passengers...<br>I admit I was at fault for occupying their taxi stands...But there was nobody behind me and he could have waited behind me...<br><br>Then while he was complaining, I saw a couple of taxis 'chiong' to the busstop to get customers and no taxi came to the stand...Apparently the taxis went to the busstop so they can get customers easier...<br>After he got his message across, he also chiong to the busstop and wait for customers...<br><br>So, was it my fault for his summons? I would feel that its only 30% of my fault...Cos if the taxi stands were to fill up, the other taxis would also wait at the busstop...<br><br>This above just applies to one taxi driver and not all...</div>

He may not need to tell you that he is changing shift , judging from what he says you should know. Or maybe there is a heavy jam in the west at that time &amp; thats why he rejects it.</div>
