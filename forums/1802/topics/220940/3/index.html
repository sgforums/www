              <p>2nd : he asked me whr do i want to go &amp; i already replied
                                      him : Hoy Fatt Road</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he said ok &amp; drove on..till he read redhill MRT area there
                                      &amp; he missed the turn &amp; went straight to Tiong Bahru area..I
                                      pointed that out to him that he missed the turn &amp; guess what
                                      this cab driver said??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cab Driver : U YOUNGSTER AH..DUN EVEN KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE
                                      PROPERLY! TALK OSO DUNNO HW TO TALK</p>
              <p>(**he really raised his voice when he made that comment)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just kept quiet &amp; continued my fone conversation wif my
                                      fren..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yet..that uncle cont. to ramble~~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cab Driver : IF U KNOW THE RD..SHOULD DIRECT ME MAH..INSTEAD OF
                                      CHATTING OVER THE FONE..TALK TALK TALK....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still kept quiet..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cab Driver : U THINK THAT I M SCARED OF U AH? WAN TO COMPLAIN
                                      ABT ME RIGHT? GO AND COMPLAIN LAH! THINK LIM PEH SCARED SI
                                      BOH..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>zzz..i really cannot take it up till this stage liao loh..i
                                      raised my voice back @ him (more like shouted back =X) that I
                                      didn't even mentioned abt complaining him &amp; I am merely just
                                      pointing out that he took the wrong route..AND he was the one who
                                      said OK before he moved off (i.e he knows the route)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, I just asked him to drop me off @ the nearest bus
                                      stop area &amp; got off the cab..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's more infuriating was that, he waited down there in his
                                      cab while glaring at me until i got into another cab =.='''</p>

              eh yamizi, 
              
              why not just take another cab? makes 2 happy persons...no cab want to go your office? 
              
              give you $5 and you insist on $4.9? are u not a bit fussy also? and you blame the cabby for being fussy in his own way?
              
              if you want, just give him another 10cents or 20 cents lor.
              
              btw, what are you complaining to comfort about? i dont think comfort can do anything to the cabby leh as long as he is licensed. Never overcharge you, Never swear at you, Never take longer route...

              <p>there wasn't any other cab, and the way he said shut up was on the top of his voice and that was somewhere around chinatown and the cab was already on the move. even if i get down which will not be easy to get a cab</p>
              <p>and as i was paying using e-voucher, i can only take comfort or citycab</p>
              <p>i don't have change, and why not i pay you 10-cents and let me have a good rundown on you, you want?</p>
              <p>and you must have misread the last part, i suspect this driver was not licensed, the number reflect a list of chinese and malay drivers, but not an indian, then this indian driver pop out from where?</p>
              <p>probably you have yet to understand what is call service standard, you need no service provider to hurl vulgarities at you to prove lousy service standard</p>

              <p>i'm very concerned with this licensed driver issue, previously i was chased out by a cab because he doesn't want to accept my taxi voucher (the old hand-written type) for reason being he didn't on his satellite system, which is not necessary!</p>
              <p>i called to the customer service, my main concern was that i didn't see his id there, you sure that driver is registerd? and they gave a very usual they had 'reprimanded' the driver which is not what i intended for in the first place!</p>

              <p>You have a point there and if he's concern where is the passenger heading to, he should have asked before I got on the cab, in fact, by right, taxi at taxi stand cannot choose passengers</p>
              <p>I think you haven't understand the 10 cents part. We should find one day meet up, I give you 10 cents, and I re-enact the whole situation to you but first, you have to visualise that you need to rush back to office, you're using e-voucher, and there's a comfort cab right in front of you! viola~</p>
              <p>Those don't wish to pick me up due to destination inconvenient to drivers happen a lot of times already, I don't complain those sort of stuff, 'cos I understand they prefer passenger's destination to be on-the-way to make life easier for them to change shift.</p>
              <p>But I don't think I deserve all the top-of-the-voice rundown and 'shut ups' from him.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you complain to comfort that they don't want to pick you up, I believe most probably nothing happens to them.</p>

              <p>When he reaches my housing area, which is a private housing

                                      all the small notes and change, and chase me off the cab.</p>
              <p>immediately when i got off the cab, i realize that i was short
                                      changed of 2.70  because i totalled the changes it was only
                                      10.</p>
