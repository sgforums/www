              <p>As I said before, the richs will alway want the poor to be poorers, reason being</p>
              <p>1. More poor and poorers make less rich people but richer people</p>
              <p>2. More poors can help to work for the rich</p>
              <p>3. Due to our poor state, the rich can then exploit the poors further, eg like us, either thru increase of rental or fuel taxation</p>
              <p>4. If 100,000 poor men make one rich man, 200,000 poor and poorer men would had make one richer man.</p>
              <p>low income in today singapore context is at $2,800, so if you are earning $2.800 you are consider poor, and below it, which I am, you are the poorest. But taxi drivers are earning $7,000, tio bo?</p>

              <p>In Taxi driving, everyday before you start, you r in a liability. And in accounting, liability should be reduce in order to offset for higher accrue profit, but in taxi driiving that liability keep increasing.</p>
              <p>A liability is much worst than a debt, because it is a going concern debt that can never end, and it is alway the liability which make one entity to carry on working/driving and working. Therefore, by sustaining the liability, it can ensure that you will be on the road for at least 250km</p>
