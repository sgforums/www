              I beg to differ, today, in a global society, preference is ignorant..and btw OZ and Londoner is the Arabian (if you measure it in the map arabian is in btw Oz and london) so I dunno why you take Oz.
              
              As singapore proudly call themselves a global society that hv free access to net and trade, we are actually a global citizens that fit many countries culture and way of life, but funny how, in a free world and self proclaimed globalise economy and society, locals are not given the freedom of this and that, so in conclusion, we are cocoon in the global world.
              
              Today, indonesia economy bloomed because of China need to their resources and business, unlike the 60s, whereby china is still living by itself, today, the indonesia are wary of Chinese influences and present that even on issue of the south China sea islands, indonesia are quiet about it. And one of its Minister even supported China occupying those island, he said "South China Sea" belong to China mah

              Too bad the Indians learnt from the English, and it is the english that taught them about class and caste, so today, you see indian go brahmin to pariah class, and if you notice, the foreign indians here do act same like the british attitude, seibei how lian.
              
              Yesterday, I took a 94yo local chinese old man from holland to stirling road, still healthy, look better than our late LKY, he told me, many taxi drivers he spoke to, all kpkb fark the PAP govt, vowed to kick them out.  He said, he is just a blue collar worker all his life, and from his experiences, many Singaporeans did not realize how good their life is today in comparing to pre independent days and other countries, he urge taxi drivers to treasure what they have now, grumbling is ok, but if you are going for an election, think wisely, look around you, make a comparision before deciding.
                  
              
              For him, it is a vast different, Singaporeans of all walks of life are enjoying life now, just that they are never satisfy, never realize it, never blamed themselve in failure and alway have a blaming culture on other, especially the govt. But to take it from him, a 94yo man, he said, we should be glad and happy with this govt

              <p>You cannot like that say. Ah gong planned this taxi trade long ago, because long long ago, he already planned to flood Singapore with millions of foreigners. Twenty years ago, the MRT and bus were filled with locals. Nowadays, the MRT and buses are packed with foreigners. Out of 100 people, I can only see maybe ONE who looks like a local. No need to thank the old man. Life twenty years ago was so easy. HDB was so cheap. Salary was pretty good. Food was cheap. Times are becoming harder and harder. I am sick and tired of hearing SHIT from sixty year old people telling me the young generation had it easy. This old farkers like to think they are heroes. Lan jiao OK. The world is becoming hard and harder to survive. You tell me whether it was easier to make $one million 20 years ago or now? 20 years ago, smart thrifty cabbies can save enough to buy a landed property. Now leh? Can or not? Dont talk to me about last time how difficult hor. Farking hear people say that, I will argue with them till the police come.</p>
              <p>Life is becoming harder not just for the honest people but also the thieves. 20 years ago, you can still try robbing a bank and maybe get away. Now leh? Only crazy people will even think about that. Conman have to shift their activities online. No more robbing banks. Now you have to trick people into transferring money into your bank account.</p>
              <p>What about politics? You think it is easier to win elections now or 20 years ago? Of course it is much much harder now lah. You try to win people's votes, but make one mistake and it gets broadcasted internationally with a few mouse clicks.</p>
              <p>What about war? You think it was easier to win a battle 2000 years ago or now? Those people who fought wars in ancient times dont have to worry about so many things, and dont need so much budget. Now leh? To win a modern battle, only countries like China, USA and Russia can do it. You need lots of money, manpower and ideally a communist government like China who can mobilise millions of people without asking for permission in a democracy.</p>
              <p>The list goes on and on. It is harder for actors, singers, dancers, restaurants, auto makers. All those who made their fortunes, most of them got rich a long long time ago. Now to become rich, it takes extraordinary talent. Life is becoming harder and harder. Not the reverse.</p>
