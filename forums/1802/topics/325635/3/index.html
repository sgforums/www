              KCTC - your anderson route is really the shortest if PIE-stevens... i observe many times it is the impression that put us in trouble.. shortest but too many turns and winding road...

              yah agree it is my fault so i admit and accept his nagging lor... but what is done is done, so i offer him an alternative to make him happier... to drop him same spot... less than 3min... what time wasted?
              
              anyway he wanted me to take a small road... can consider a dark alley... if day time avoid jam i can understand... 2am... is there a difference?
              
              after that every turn i ask him how he wants... he replies also sian... usually no need to ask... like from kallang to gey lor 28... u want to take sim ave or guillarmard... no difference but later he say he can save one alley distance how?...like that take cab everyone not happy...
              
              when me take cab, i go in i will tell driver e.g. turn left here then CTE exit xxx... clear cut... beyond that any small difference ok la... if you want to save $0.2, then either u can take a bus and direct cab all the way... can turn into all the alleys in singapore if you want... haha..

              <p>hey kin, i think google routing useless. Savannah is at Simei Rise, totally no connection to Jln Pelatok &amp; Jln Segam. that condo is Sunhaven lah. not sure about distance, but need to go in and then out of CBD. sure kenna f one. only in ok. camden not in CBD somemore. grange rd leads directly to camden already, why still need to turn into paterson rd? so not so accurate distance after all. thanks 4 the input anyway.</p>
              <p>hey alvin, the knn pax is right, got shorter route, just that he din know it either. i posted it myself in the shortcuts topic earlier...basically same but ..... &gt; PIE &gt; thomson &gt; whitley &gt; dyson &gt; chancery hill &gt; chancery lane &gt; balmoral &gt; anderson &gt; ...</p>
              <p>no traffic, very few traffic lights, no ERP. but many turns as u mentioned so very easily misunderstood. this one should be the shortest &amp; fastest.</p>
              good pax..so far for me malays best (more than 90%) easy going, not calculative, friendly esp the older generation.<br></blockquote>

              Hello..Asking .... Taxi Driver. Is there anything wrong over here.
              Hello...this kind of,
              Passenger.
              One thing does puzzle me though, that of why the drivers constantly ask the passengers which way they would like to go. Having just arrived in Singapore I pick up a taxi at the rank just outside the airport. I give him the name of the hotel and off he sets. After five-minutes this driver will invariably turn around and ask me whether I would like to go by the PIE or by the East Coast Road.
              
              
              Stupid question really as the average person arriving at Singapore Airport and especially one who is going to a hotel would not have a clue about the transport system in Singapore. I used to think that the drivers where testing their passengers as to their knowledge of Singapore and that if they showed ignorance then they would be carted off on a tour of the city without knowing any difference.
              
              
              But this has not been the case as I have often put it to the test. The driver has asked me and I have given him no inkling as to my knowledge of the city? and he has taken me the quickest route! Such is life!Listen everybody: the Taxi Drivers in Singapore are of excellent quality and any prospective passenger is assured of an easy, safe and smooth-drive to their destination? don? listen to me.

              <p>Thanks, guys.</p>
              <p>Btw, for those interested in taking up a VL or just wanna know, I'll list down the procedure and how long and how much it costs for each "phase".</p>
              <p>6 Jun 08 - Submitted TVL application form at a Comfort/Citicab roadshow. Paid $40 and provided a passport sized photograph.</p>
              <p>Received approval letter from LTA around end of June/start of July. Sorry no exact date cos I don't have the approval letter.</p>
              <p>3 Jul - Went for medical checkup at a clinic nearby home ($25++) and X-ray at an X-ray clinic(?) ($12+). Note that X-ray results can only be collected the following day.</p>
              <p>4 Jul - Collected X-ray results and applied for online TVL course at ComfortDelgro, Sin Ming. Paid $267.50.</p>
              <p>11 Jul - Attended online training orientation at Sin Ming's Citycab Training Centre. Provided another passport sized photo here. Started my "e-learning" this nite and managed to book an excursion on 3 Aug, the earliest date available.</p>
              <p>3 Aug - Excursion day. Issued exam schedule on this day. Spent $3.20 on kaya toast, eggs and coffee during the break.</p>
              <p>12 Aug - Receive TVL certificate after passing the tests. Retook one module that cost me $15 more. Btw, parking charges at the S'pore Taxi Academy is $1.20 per hr.</p>
              <p>3-4 weeks later - Should be issued my TVL.</p>
              <p>So, if I tentatively receive my VL by 6 Sept, the whole process will have taken me 3 months and $362+ (including the eggs).</p>
              <p>Since the initial application can be made through post, the only necessary "contact time" would be the 1)medical checkup and X-ray, 2) the application for the TVL course at Sin Ming, 3) the orientation (after office hours), 4) the excursion (sunday) and 5) the exam. I'd also expect the collection of the VL to be during office hours as well.</p>
              <p>Sorry if I bored anyone with my long post.</p>
              <p>I write a lot when I'm happy.</p>
