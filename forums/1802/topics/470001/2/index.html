              <p>I will said, there is an indepth purpose within the job scope rather than racial discrimination,</p>
              <p>Cdg have already got sufficient malay and indians staff to handle Malay and Indian drivers, what they are facing is those old uncles who are in a way, whereby report are concerned, are more fluent in their dialects, and therefore the scope required that type of personnel that fit it, and it does not imply that if a malay or indian who can speak hokkien is ineligible? Some malay and indian friend of mine can speak cantonese and hokkien better than me, knn.</p>
              <p>Simply put it, it is more of the job scope requirement.</p>
              <p>We take another example, if a boss need a fluent bahasa malayu speaking salesman to market his product in malaysia, indonesia and singapore, careless if chinese, malay or indian or others, as long as you can speak malayu, you are a potiential candidates, and by stating it on the requirement, at least it can filter off those who are unable to speak malay.</p>

              <p>If it is a job scope requirement, then the reasons should be stated.  TAFEP encourages companies to state reasons for requiring certain skills to avoid being labelled as discriminatory.</p>
              <p>Thus, the requirements could be stated as such:</p>
              <p>"The job requires effective communication with chinese speaking taxi drivers. Knowledge of Mandarin and local chinese dialects is essential".</p>
              <p>Comfort Transportation/City Cab, as a large corporation, should be more enlightened. And they have signed the Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment Practices !!</p>

              <p>Fair employment practices???..lols.. that is only a logo, and in term of practices, it is up to them (employer) to practices whatever they deem "Fair" not what the employee deem "Fair".</p>
              <p>Essential is not a requirement, it can be ignore or opt out if one is seen as fitting to be one even if he or she does not know local chinese dialects. It is only an Essential.</p>
              <p>It is part of the public communication skill that Cdg is protray here, there are many angles to look at it, but being Temasek/NTUC/Govt Linked, discrimination is taken differently in a way that they are alway right, fair and correct.</p>
              <p>Comfort Delgro is public listed under the umbrella of a GLC + Delgro, main shareholders are their own corhort of companies, from unions' organisation to investment arms of singapore govt, by which SMRT holds a big chuck of it. The management appointed role is to answer and provide profits to all these shareholders. They are therefore, better immune and protected from discriminatory remarks than any of the other taxis companies or any Privated limited corporation in singapore, so to speak.</p>
              <p>And for that matter, the ability to evade sensitive race mentioning is already a plus sign in it, any chinese, muslim or indian in it, could had make it worst.</p>

              <p><br>Ah Guan is the 30% young one lah, tho there had been an increase of young TDs on the road, but  old one like you and me are still the majority.

              <p>The increase in youngs run in tandem with the mature ones, therefore the end result is an increase in taxi drivers and taxis on the road.</p>
              <p>And that is also why I and my bro foolsh can only earn abt $30 to $50 net per day, but for us, that is enough liao, but how long can we go on with $30 to $50 per day in this ever increase of cost of living, I dunno, maybe one day, instead of Stout, I got to drink cheap indian whisky liao</p>
