              Its all depend on yr needs, yr passion and your energy level.
              
              Needs could yr profit - rental and fuel cost, your financial position, your family and personal needs
              
              Passion belongs to more of a motivated to drive, to serve, to enjoy what you actually wanted to do, as saying, the best job is alway one that he or she enjoyed the most.
              
              Financial position can vary differently, are you in debt, are you just drive to pass time, or are you those kiasu type, die die must make this and that amount of money in order to survive, or are you those who see thing open type and believe that there is alway another day to drive on, let go home.
              
              Family needs is one of the most critical reason on how a drivers make his money, and his time spent on the road, the motivation factor is alway moving towards the family, from childrens school expenses to house groceries, bills etc etc, this is also what most TD in Singapore are doing for family needs.
              
              Personal needs is up to individuals, if you like to smoke or sex or spent lavishly, your cost will go up naturally, and you might need to earn more to break even, so you tends to spent more time on the road

              Let take a look at a normal job hours thru the eyes of the laws,
              
              The laws said, a person should work 44hrs per week, anything more, should be consider as overtime. 44/7 give you about 8hrs per day, that is the norm of human working inorder to enjoy his personal and family life. 
              
              For me, for taxi driving,  I alway believe that a energetic driver will tends to earn more and are more alert leading to able to take more calls and also evade more unfortunate cirumstances like accident and summons. It is not about old or young drivers, it is about the amount of time you rest as what the body needs you to rest.
              
              Many a time, driver drove 12 hrs and above, can hardly find life in them, go home, still hv to deal with some house issues, eat and then sleep, worst will be those going out for some personal events, and as the days goes by, tiring will crept in, and as the saying goes, a tired Taxi drivers is alway a angry driver

              The passion for taxi driving must be one who enjoy what he is doing, the willingness to serve, the willingness to provide and transport people from A to B to C and yet get a thankless return.
              
              There are all kinds of pple driving taxis, each hv their own history and past, driving to pass time does not imply driving for fun, it imply that one needs to stay active, make the brain and limbs work abit so as to make some return and make onself still in sane and productive to the society at large.

              <p>huat ar. Why worry about how each and every TD driver is driving. Which way is correct / wrong. There's no correct / wrong method to drive. Just that as long you break the law, good luck to you.</p>
              <p>You wan to drive 4 / 5 hours as TD, go ahead.</p>
              <p>If you wan to drive 12 / 13 or 18 hours as TD, go ahead also. No 1 stopping you. Only bro bowah will be kind enough to pick you on your last journey hor... but there's no free lunchy ok? You think he do it for free? Phui!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, what for you yourself think whether how ppl look @ you if you choose which style to drive.</p>
              <p> </p>

              Frankly, I have had sent Taxi drivers on their last journey many times liao, no free one lah, smlj free, only those very close one, then maybe give discount, even neighbour pick up at AP also no free, smlj casket driving free...4 hrs leh, alot of time wasted hor, and time is money. 
              
              I dun need to eat, my family still need to eat mah.
              
              For taxi driving, beside aging natural death, there are also cardio arrest and stroke death, some got died due to cancer from prostate to lung to stomach, intestine...etc etc, 
              But there is one that I wish to mention, and that is Skin and throat Cancer.
              
              Usually when the cause of death for TD is Skin cancer, i will ask the pathologist for some reasoning, they said it is due to long period in dry air condition. So brothers, please do put a wet cloth or some wet stuff in your cab. 
              
              For throat and nose cancer, beside smoking, it can be due to the chemical liced artificial fragrance bottle or gel in yr taxis, so brothers, becareful.

              After CNY, I think we can meet to play chess...
              
              Not to worry lah, Singapore population is still increasing, altho we might hate FT and foreigners, but from a TD perspectives, they are also giving us business to earn. And due to high COE, many also forgo driving. 
              
              For tourists, there is nothing much to say, as for those who reside here in Singapore including citizens like you and me n PRs, their common hobbies are travelling, shopping and eating. Travelling in convienences and privately is still a very much Singapore style.
              
              Jan is alway start low end high due to after christmas and NY spending, after CNY, most companies will close their financial year, and as the market is slowing down couple with oil price sliding, the results can be drastically disappointed, this translate into pples having less or no extra bonuses, low wage increases and more restructuring leading to more retrenchement.
              
              Within this sentiment, more peoples will join Taxi trade, be it for a long or short period, it will add more competition for the current lots of drivers. Taxi companies will promote for new hirers with many kind of benefits to lure them in. 
              
              Therefore, you might not see a reduction in paxs, paxs will be there,  but you will see an increase in nos of fleets, and that is where driving will be abit OBK. In another words, it is not no paxs, but too much Taxis

              It is not about traffic penalties increase or more cams on the road that you decided to drive safely for the sake of not getting summons.
              
              We hv to broaden our view, let take it that all these are to help us drive safely so that we can go home to see our family, have a good dinner or breakfast and live happily. Such will create a naturally good driving habits, and once you hv a good driving and safety habits, smlj summons or cams also no problem liao
