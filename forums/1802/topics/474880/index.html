            <div class='col-md body'>Serious advise needed.... My car jerks very badly since I collected 2weeks ago. Last week it dies on me and the workshop guy said was the sensor issue... less then a day after repair, the jerks came back again. Notice that whenever i switch back to petrol, there are no more jerks but once I switched back and it jerks again in awhile, or either whenever I pumped full tank of CNG, it jerks badly and no power when driving off. These have been going on for a week and yesterday it dies on me again. This time after I collected my taxi, I drived less den half an hour, the jerks are back and i went back to workshop. These time they changed the spark plugs... after driving off, the jerks are back again.... suspected if it was the gear box issue or otherwise? This is my first experience with CNG car... Please help... the car keep dying on me how to earn???</div>

              <p>Bro Nemo4713 you are driving TW1.8 Right ???? <span style="line-height: 1.231;">There is common !</span></p>
              <p>You can try:</p>
              <p>1)  When you stop at traffic light etc, put to Park, that for sure will reduce the Jerk.</p>
              <p>2) Top Up Mandai or SRG North CNG, It will Jerk much lesser than Toh Guan Gas<br>(Reason, SMART CNG are purer than Toh Guan, More power less Jerk BUT more expensive) </p>
              <p>3) Every 40Km~50Km switch to Petrol mode for a while then switch back to CNG.</p>
              <p>4) Install a <span style="line-height: 1.231;">voltage stabilizerï¼Œ it will </span>absolutely reduce your Red Baby Jerk<br>(I had two for my TW 2.0 SHD 9xxx, My Red rubbish truck never Jerk at all)</p>
              <p>The reason for the Jerk is becuase for the impurity in the CNG gas and after few hundreds KG of CNG used, the Nozzle start get stuck ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚</p>

              <p>Old problem. Try stepping on accelerator harder when moving off.</p>
              <p><span class="postbody"><em><strong>'CNG is now an old story' <br><br></strong></em>Fed up with her CNG car stalling every day, she drove back to the workshop to remove the entire kit. The number of new CNG cars has plunged from the July peak of 419 units. -BT <br><br>Mon, Nov 10, 2008 <br>The Business Times <br><br>By Samuel Ee <br><br>SLUGGISH and sometimes jerky performance seem to have driven a wedge between the Singapore car buyer and compressed natural gas (CNG), with the love affair set for a possibly unhappy ending. <br><br>Some cars retrofitted with CNG kits have been causing problems for owners, who say their cars now face a loss of power or worse. <br><br>"One owner was so fed up with her CNG car stalling every other day that she drove back to our workshop and told us to remove the entire kit," says the manager of a parallel import company. The cost of a CNG conversion can range from $3,000 to $4,500, depending on the size of the gas tank installed. <br><br>The manager believes the car's petrol engine was not designed for CNG use, so there may be durability issues. <br><br>"Unless it is like the Mercedes-Benz E200 NGT, which has a factory-fitted CNG kit," he says. The Merc is the only such OEM (original equipment manufacturer) model available here. <br><br>The executive of an authorised distributor says that his company also faced CNG-related woes. <br><br>"We have stopped all retrofitting works and no longer offer the CNG alternative to our customers," he says. "There were problems with the ECU (electronic control unit) and engine mapping, which caused a lot of minor problems. There was power loss, the engine stalled and even the trip computer's readings were out." <br><br>He adds that with such serious technical issues involved, the dealership had no choice but to pull the plug on CNG retrofits. Also baffling was that different cars had different problems or none at all. <br><br>"The same CNG kit installed in two different cars will have different results," he says. "It is probably the lack of expertise on the installer's part they don't know what to do." <br><br>Gilbert von der Aue, manager of C Melchers, agrees that some CNG installers are less well-trained than others, but he says that "only a very small percentage of cars are having a small issue". Melchers is one of the better-known names for CNG retrofits in Singapore, which has a total of around 20 installers. <br><br>"Our group does about 55 per cent of all retrofits, and out of all these cars, only 2 per cent have issues where certain cars will have a slight drop in performance compared to petrol," he says. <br><br>He explains that the jerkiness occurs during acceleration and if the driver is "light-footed". "CNG's burning characteristics require more gas to flow in, so you have to adapt to the way of driving," says Mr von der Aue. <br><br>As for the other issues, he says that they could be due to the tuning of the cars, which a less-proficient installer may not know how to perform effectively, or even a problem with the car itself. <br><br>"We have seen inherent problems with the existing car, like its compression ratio. CNG technology is very precise, so it is far less forgiving than petrol," he says. "It is a proven technology and there are no technical issues for Melchers." <br><br>He attributes the steady drop in sales of new CNG cars to worries about the re-introduction of the special tax and adverse publicity about long queues at the only two CNG public refuelling stations. There is a special tax of six times the road tax for bi-fuel cars such as CNG cars, which can also run on petrol, but there is an exemption until Dec 31, 2009. A <a id="_GPLITA_5" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1802/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;">review</span></a> of the special tax will be done closer to the date and some people fear the exemption will be lifted. <br><br>The number of new CNG cars has plunged dramatically from the July peak of 419 units. It slipped to 320 cars in August, and further to only 283 units in September. <br><br>One parallel importer who used to sell about 20 CNG cars a month now only gets two or three orders. He says that the advantages of these cars their lower running cost (CNG is cheaper than petrol) and reduced <a id="_GPLITA_2" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Discount Buddy" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1802/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;">registration</span></a> taxes (new cars retrofitted with a CNG kit attract a green vehicle rebate of 40 per cent of open market value) - have been overshadowed by adverse publicity and falling petrol prices. <br><br>He says: "CNG is now an old story."</span></p>

              <p>Someone in the company wants to save money and not buy spare

              <p>Best way to solve the problem is to keep going back to repair
              until they cannot take it and change the correct part for you.</p>
              <p>Or get the new renault and make tons of money for someone.

              <p><br>I think you hv to be logical here, first, CNG lack power, if not army tank would had used it, second, CNG are air, and air are like bubbles, just you blurp after eating, all because of air, and that is also why CNG give you that jerking, third, as air, CNG dry up engine faster than instead of lubricating it, therefore engine piston, piston rings and its liners due to dryer running surface, at time will jerk to move up and down.</p>
              <p>And then the major point of all is CNG taxis and vehicle in singapore are mostly converted ones, therefore it is a modification, and that imply a diversion of it design of what was intended, that is diesel or petrol driven.</p>

              <p>Useless even if i tell you. And if i tell you, i might get into trouble <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>The problem will also come back in one or another form because toyota wish are old taxis already. Some problems are interlinked.</p>
              <p>Junior Mechanics don't know how to fix it fyi.</p>
              <p>Talk to Jasmine / Senior Mechanics nicely and they will fix it if they can.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But most likely both of them cannot do anything for you unless ________ . (fill in the blanks).</span></p>
              <p> My best advice is to return vehicle and find another reliable car.</p>
