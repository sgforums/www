              <p>Even though I would not chase after someone who evaded $10, I would avoid drink stores that charges $1.10 for coffee if got another that charges $0.80 nearby.</p>
              <p>I also would avoid food stores that purposely marked up food prices.   Encountered a few times food stores that purposely marked up curry chicken prices by 50 cents (told me curry chicken not counted as meat but as special meat when everywhere in Singapore it is just ordinary meat price).  </p>
              <p>1 customer I fetched before told me a store that he frequents charges different price for the same items that he purchased differently everytime (like Uber pricing).</p>

              <p>I probably already fetched closed to 10,000 customers but never encountered customers running fares but got encounter machine screwed up losses and sometimes started the meter minutes after the taxi moved off.</p>

              <p>There are ppl who drink npp coffee every few months, or are even under covert surveillance, these ppl if u met them before, seem relaxed and carry on their lives like nothing happened. They know how far the law can go, so they play accordingly. I always believe - poverty is not a crime. So when i witness crime in action, i always look the other way. Let the police do their job, My assistance comes at a cost, but since there is no reward, i rather ignore.</p>
              <p>In life, some live in bliss, some in silent suffering, some in meaningless existence, and some in constant abuse. At any point, some can endure, some chose to end it all, and some chose to commit crime to find temporary relief.</p>
              <p>If u read enough history, u will find that Kings started off as warriors - or to be blunt - murderers. So nationhood originated from criminal acts and large scale killing of people. Once they controlled the land, they invented laws and tales that place them at a level on par with God.</p>
