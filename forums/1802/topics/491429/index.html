              Picked up 2 malay girls from zouk around 3.30am.
              Sent them to 670c Edgefield plains.
              One half drunk another one sober.
              No atm card, no credit card n only got $15.
              Fare $28 plus.
              Beware night drivers who frequent zouk like me.
              Feel like sending them to police station but today got make money. ..let them go.
              
              Recently govt talk a lot on police protocol.
              I wonder whether our police got protocol on such situations for taxi drivers.

              <p>I will take the $15 and forgo the rest. You can ask them to transfer but most probably nothing will happen. No point wasting time at police station for statements and all that rubbish nothing will happen to them 1 la. At the most they ask their parents or friends come down station pay.</p>

              One of my cabby friend go n chase a female pax who run without paying. Managed to grab the handbag. He went to report police n return the handbag. Not that he wants to snatch the bag but the pax run so fast n does not even care to retrieve back the bag. The police threatened my cabby friend that he could be charged for robbery. 
              
              Moral of story.. dun have to report even if they have a protocol. Really waste of time

              <p>I am a night driver. I can find average 2 pax an hour after midnight. I am saying as a whole. Seriously i would rather forgo the trip fee than have a lousy pax that run fare or puke. Prevention is better then cure.</p>
              <p>Lido is simple. From the traffic lights at Waterfront hotel you stick your head out see whether any people gathering or hanging around the front porch of Holiday Inn or not. If there is, heck care the queue and just enter the front and take the 2nd lane. Normally they see green light cab they just run to take. Cause there only can have 1 cab waiting at the first lane. If no people or they never take just move on.</p>

              If you drive at night, you are a night driver regardless of how you drive. You drive night shift, yes, so you are the night driver. 
              
              In every trade, night shift pay the most, be it in allowances or pay. So, as a nite shift driver, I expect you to earn more than a Day shift drivers, but because of today Pte apps alternative, nite drivers are also suffering. That is why you see many hirers who use to drive night are now looking for night reliefs.

              It is not a matter of generosity, if a govt is already not generous, how you expect the subjects to be generous or cultivated generosity. 
              
              It is because of dun want to create more problem and unnecessary time wastage, you call police, you wait, police come, 
              
              write here and there, make statement, then ask the girls to pay, girl said no money..wait transfer, police tell you later they transfer.
              
              ..aiyo, dunno how many paxs and calls at punggol and sengkang you missed liao.

              It is not authority never protect me, we pay taxes, from income tax to Gst, indirectly, we are paying them to serve us. It is more of a matter that even tho, you called the authority, such cases keep happening, so WHY is it still happening?. 
              
              Because authority did not take stern action, in their mind, it is a small matter between a taxi lau and his paxs, best is they go settle themselves, we just remain as statue of Laws. 
              
              So, many are not even afraid when you call the cops, because they have experience many times before.

              These 2 Malay gals I think purposely dun pay. 
              When I decided to pick them up after several ppl knock on my locked door. They asked me go ponggol roughly how much? I told them n they assure me got enough $$$. Reach already they dig their bag n say only got 15.
              I told them I send them to police, they say OK. I changed my mind coz what time liao as I need to hand over car at 6am. If they made this fare evasion rule in such a way that the police reimburse me first then I will support this rule. Everyday driving close to 350km...you really think I got time to go police station for follow up during the day.

              <p>So stupid to go and report $10 fare evasion case.   Report $10 fare loss ( not talking about $10 silver mint souvenior coin ) would result in at least 1 hour loss of income.   Also these things do not happen often (every 10000 customers, how many evade?).  </p>
              <p>Yesterday fetched on customer to casino and I wished him good luck at casino and he immediately wanted to tip me $10 but I rejected him.   I told him to only tip (if he wants to) the taxi driver that drives him back home if he wins at casino.</p>
              <p>At least 1 time my machine "Cocked up" I also collected a lot less than should collect (difference more than $10).  </p>
              <p>Like fews months ago got one TD said one customer was so stupid to ask him to drive all the way (with meter on) to his home to collect a less than $10 bag of grapes.</p>
              <p>The police officer must be thinking my time to handle cost more than $10 to handle and if it is me, I also would not chase after him or her.</p>
