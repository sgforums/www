              <h1 class="clr">Malaysia's 'worst in the world' taxis tarnish national image</h1>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 18, 2008 (AFP) - The ads promoting "Malaysia: Truly
              Asia" aim to welcome visitors with a warm smile to a prosperous and
              modern nation, so the taxi fleet branded "the worst in the world" can
              come as a bit of a shock.</p>
              <p>Even the locals are not spared the shabby service of unkempt and
              hostile drivers behind the wheels of decrepit vehicles who refuse to
              use the meter, overcharge and pick-and-choose which destinations they
              will travel to.</p>
              <p>At the popular KLCC mall under Kuala Lumpur's
              iconic Petronas Twin Towers is a typical scene, as a gang of cabbies
              negotiate with a young Norwegian couple just metres from a signboard
              warning against "taxi touts".</p>
              <p>"Flat rate, flat rate, no metre,"
              one driver insists as the tourists try to find a cab to take them to
              their hotel, less than two kilometres (1.2 miles) away.</p>
              <p>Anxious
              to escape the baking heat, they agree to pay 25 ringgit (7.22 dollars)
              for a trip that would have cost less than three ringgit on the meter.</p>
              <p>"Is it expensive? We don't know, we thought it is normal here," said the woman as they piled in with their shopping bags.</p>
              <p>More
              frequent visitors, however, are vocal in their criticism and say that
              aggressive and unprofessional drivers are tarnishing the nation's image
              as a squeaky clean and hospitable destination.</p>
              <p>"I first visited
              Malaysia in 2006 and I was impressed by everything I saw except for the
              worst taxi service I have endured," said Kabir Dali, an Indian tourist
              waiting in vain for a metered taxi at another mall.</p>
              <p>"I paid a
              whopping 260 ringgit (74 dollars) from the Kuala Lumpur International
              Airport to town and was later told that was twice the proper amount."</p>
              <p>Complaints
              about taxis are common in many countries, but in Malaysia it has
              escalated to an outpouring of frustration, on blog sites and in letters
              to newspapers.</p>
              <p>In a survey by the local magazine The Expat, some
              200 foreigners from 30 countries rated Malaysia the worst among 23
              countries in terms of taxi quality, courtesy, availability and
              expertise.</p>
              <p>The respondents lashed the fleet as "a source of
              national shame" and "a serious threat to tourists -- rude bullies and
              extortionists".</p>
              <p>Salvation is in sight though, as a number of
              smaller, up-scale operators enter the market to provide a more
              expensive but quality taxi service for frustrated visitors and locals.</p>
              <p>The
              uniformed drivers, behind the wheels of smart new multi-purpose
              vehicles and sedans, switch on the meter as a matter of course and do
              not refuse destinations -- surprising and delighting commuters in the
              capital.</p>
              <p>Abdul Razak, operations manager for Dubai-based Citicab
              which launched here in January, said that even in poorer nations such
              as Thailand and Indonesia, taxis are smarter and the drivers far more
              courteous.</p>
              <p>"I would say it is the worst in this region,
              undoubtedly. I have travelled to all countries in this region and our
              company operates taxis in many parts of the world. The situation here
              is the worst I have seen," he told AFP.</p>
              <p>"The vehicles are in
              shabby condition, the driver will take you if he likes your face --
              that is, if he agrees with where you want to go for the price he
              insists on."</p>
              <p>The government has called on taxi firms to lift
              their standards, but various campaigns have achieved little, and many
              blame the lack of enforcement on rampant corruption in the police and
              bureaucracy.</p>
              <p>"It is difficult for the roads and traffic
              department to take stern action," said a security officer at one city
              mall as he watched the touts swoop.</p>
              <p>"Taxi operators and the
              company which hold the licences are all linked to some politician or
              another," he said. "Drivers here are ruthless because they are
              unchecked by authorities who are almost non-existent."</p>
              <p>John
              Koldowski, from the Pacific Asia Travel Association, said that "less
              than desirable" taxi drivers have an outsize impact on a nation's image.</p>
              <p>"The
              first contact a tourist gets with locals is often during airport
              transits to hotels and it creates a very, very strong first impression,
              either be good or bad," he said.</p>
              <p>"Authorities certainly need to do their jobs and act upon any complaints strongly, quickly and visibly."</p>
