            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to take this opportunity to highlight and share my personal unpleasant experience to cab takers out there.<br><br>On 15/11/2007 at 2015hrs, I boarded a Premier Taxi (<strong>SHB 8343C</strong>) from Singapore Post (Paya Lebar) to Tampines Central. As I was in a rush, I only realized that I had insufficient cash with me after a few minutes before moving off.<br><br>Thus, I politely asked the taxi driver (male Chinese) if there were other modes of payment but he told me bluntly only cash. So I informed him that he could drop me near the ATM so that I could withdraw cash to pay him. He did not bother to reply and instead instantly put up a disgruntled face which could be easily spotted from the rear mirror.<br><br>When we were close to the destination, he asked me where I wanted to alight and I informed him that I could alight near the Tampines MRT station despite the fact that I was going to Century Square directly. This was due to the fact that there is an ATM machine at the Tampines MRT station and within a short distance to avoid delaying the taxi driver further. He remarked that I should have told him earlier so that he could go by a faster and more appropriate route.<br><br>He asked if the place was congested and I replied that I did not need to alight at the Tampines Mall Taxi stand as the location was always crowded. Instead, I told him I could alight at the bus drop-off/alight point beside the Tampines MRT station. I repeated to him again that the reason for alighting at the said location is to ensure that I could withdraw cash to pay him. He ignored and did not respond again.<br><br>Upon reaching the destination at around 2025hrs, the taxi driver wanted me to leave something behind while I left to withdraw money. He said because he did not know me at all and did not trust me. I agreed with the point he raised but the only item with me at that time was the airmail parcel valued approximately US$80 which I had just collected from Singapore Post. The taxi fare shown in the meter was less than $8 dollars. I only had $6 dollars plus and could not afford to risk leaving the parcel behind in case he drove off with it. Thus, I proposed that he followed me to the ATM.<br><br>He refused and claimed that he will be fined for leaving his vehicle behind. While I agreed with his point, I was trying to think of an alternative solution and it was at this moment that he started to turn aggressive and raised his voice at me. He shouted phrases that Â“I should not take taxi if I have no money with meÂ”, Â“DonÂ’t try to pull off any tricksÂ”, etc.<br><br>I felt he was starting to adopt personal attacks based on his words used and thus I told him that his attitude was unprofessional and unacceptable. Sensing his aggressive behavior, I moved out of the taxi and try to contact the taxi company. He came out of his cab and began hurling abuses, shouted and yelled at me in full view of the general public as he wanted to use the situation to humiliate me. He also mentioned that I should not rebuke and raised my voice because I had no money to pay him which I did not yell at him.<br><br>I managed to find the companyÂ’s contact number and called to ask for advice and raised my complaint. While I was talking to the customer executive, Tasha, the cab driver shouted that if I wanted to call the police he could drive me to the station. I told him that I was not calling the police and continued to provide the information to Tasha as requested.<br><br>Suddenly, he took out his handphone to snap pictures of me while I was still assisting in the report. I did not stop him from taking photos as the first thought that came to my mind was that he wanted to use it as a proof that I did not pay the taxi fare and if I intervened, it may turn into physical attack based on the tense situation.<br><br>Next, he returned back to his taxi and drove off even when one of the passer-by waved to him to wait. All the happenings were reported to Tasha. I also enquired about his possession of my photos without my approval and payment of the taxi fare since he just drove off. Tasha mentioned that she would submit the report for the management review and I will be kept informed.  Till now, I had yet to receive any call from the company and to pay the outstanding fare.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps I should also provide this information that I just found out after the incident.<br><br>Actually I wonder how many of us actually know that all Premier Taxis can only accept cash. Their cars don't equipped with any mode of payment. Got this info from the taxi operator that I called to lodge complaint and seek advice. Yet to verify true or not.<br><br>Furthermore, there is no indication of cash payment only in their website and cabs. They expect passengers to have ample cash to last the journey. If got traffic jam then jialat liao....</div>

If I dun put myself in his shoes, I wun be bothered to think of so many alternatives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I admit that not havng enough cash with me is my fault but his gangster and threatening behaviour towards pasengers is ridiculous.<br><br>I wish to state that my sole purpose of posting the incident here is not to seek justice nor pin-point whose at fault. Rather, it is to let all cab takers out there know and learn from this incident so that they wont land into the same situation as me.<br><br>At least I got to know that from this incident that all Premier Taxis only accept cash as they do not have other modes of payment. So have ample cash if you consider flaging these cabs.</div>

You never know which taxi will come &amp; its not always comfort &amp; Citycab. If all NETS payment services are available in all taxis , i believe this incident could be avoided as if you do not have enough cash , you can use either cashcard or NETS.</div>
