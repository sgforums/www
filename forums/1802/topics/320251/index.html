              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One Common Taxi Number</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1.    LTA, together with all the taxi companies, will launch a  
              common taxi booking number, 6-DIAL CAB (6342 5222) on 21 July 2008. The aim of  
              this common number is to make it easier and more convenient for taxi commuters,  
              especially tourists, to call for a taxi in Singapore, as they need only remember  
              one number.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2.    The common taxi booking number complements the taxi  
              companies' call booking systems. The respective taxi companies' call-booking  
              hotlines will continue to be in use. Commuters who have preference for taxis  
              from any of the taxi companies can continue to book a taxi from the company  
              directly, by calling their respective hotlines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3.    The common taxi booking number is one of the initiatives in  
              the Land Transport Master Plan announced early this year. It provides commuters  
              with an additional avenue to book a cab. With the common number, commuters will  
              be able to book a taxi from any of the taxi companies by calling 6-DIAL CAB. A  
              commuter who makes a call to 6-DIAL CAB, will have access to up to three taxi  
              companies' call centres. The call will first be routed to one selected<sup>1</sup> taxi company's call centre. If the call centre's lines are busy, the call will  
              automatically be re-routed to another taxi company's call centre. The call will  
              be terminated only after three attempts to route the call is unsuccessful.  
              Please refer to <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/CTN_Annex_A.pdf">Annex A</a> for more details.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4.    Ms Tammy Tan, ComfortDelGro Corporation Group Corporate  
              Communications Officer said, "Many Singaporeans are already familiar with  
              ComfortDelGro's taxi booking number, 6552-1111. There is however one group of  
              commuters who may be confused with the different taxi booking numbers and they  
              are the tourists. For them, the common booking number will be of help."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5.    Mr Lo Chee Wen, Vice President, SMRT Taxis said, "The  
              new common call booking number for taxis is an added way in which we can serve  
              commuters, on top of SMRT's call booking number 6555 8888. We welcome it and are  
              happy that commuters now have another convenient manner to reach us when they  
              are in need of a taxi."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6.    Added Mr Lim Chong Boo, Managing Director of Premier Taxis  
              Pte Ltd, "This should help visitors to Singapore who may be unfamiliar with  
              how to get a taxi. We trust the LTA will work closely with the Tourism Board to  
              promote this common number to the visitors."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7.    "With the supplementary common taxi number, it will be  
              easier for the public, especially tourists to make a taxi booking without  
              memorising all the taxi booking numbers," said Mr Tan Soon Chye, General  
              Manager, Prime Car Rental &amp; Taxi Services Pte Ltd.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8.    Transcab's General Manager, Jasmine Tan stated, "One  
              Common Taxi Number is another choice for the passenger when call for  
              booking."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">9.    Welcoming the additional option, Chief Executive of SMART  
              Automobile Pte Ltd, Mr Johnny Harjantho added, "We are ready to give our  
              support for the one number system as SMART drivers stand to benefit from the  
              potential increase in the number of phone bookings to our company."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">10.    Mr Seng Han Thong, Adviser to the six Taxi Operators'  
              Associations said, "The Land Transport Authority has consulted the Taxi  
              Operators' Associations on the feasibility of a common taxi booking number and  
              the TOAs view the common number as an additional avenue for taxi drivers to  
              receive more call bookings. Firstly, the Singapore Tourism Board will be  
              promoting it among tourists visiting Singapore. At the same time, Singaporeans  
              will also benefit from it as they only need to remember one telephone number to  
              call and as the chances of them getting a taxi in a shorter time will be higher  
              as the system will forward their booking requests to the next available taxi  
              company. These would translate to more call bookings and thus, higher earnings  
              for our taxi drivers."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">11.    Mr Yam Ah Mee, Chief Executive, Land Transport Authority,  
              expressed, "We are glad that the taxi companies are supportive of this  
              initiative to enhance convenience for taxi commuters and will continue to  
              explore other avenues to do so."</span></p>
              <hr>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><sup>1</sup>The system automatically allocates calls to the 
              taxi companies based on a pre-determined algorithm. The algorithm assigns calls 
              based on a weightage defined by the respective companies' market share of all 
              call bookings, including those received by them directly, in the preceding 3 
              months.</span></p>
