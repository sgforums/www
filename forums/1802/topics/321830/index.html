              <p>Hi, all.</p>
              <p>The 6-month period necessary to qualify for the incentive is on the part of the new hirer. Don't think there's a bond for the introducer. He just loses out $500 if he quits before the new guy finishes the required period.</p>
              <p>Introducer gets the $500 when the new hirer completes a 6-month period. New hirer still subject to a year's contract. $500 of security deposit will be forfeited lest he fails to honour the 1-year contract.</p>
              <p>The new hirer only gets $1000 after 6 months in a 3-4 years old Crown. With a 1-2 year taxi, the incentive is only $100, and it's $400 for a 2-3 year old cab. Opting for a &gt;4 years old Crown gets you $800 after 6 months.</p>
              <p>Lower incentive for the &gt;4 years taxi may be cos you'll get a new Sonata at lower rental charges when your old cab is scrapped.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I'm wrong... Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hello again.</p>
              <p>I just got the approval letter from LTA for my VL application yesterday. Guess my next step will be a med checkup. Thereafter, I'll be signing up for Comfort's online training programme.</p>
              <p>I'm looking at being a full-time whole day driver with Comfort. My tentative driving plan would include driving from 8am to 6pm on weekdays. I'm attending part-time polytechnic classes on weekday evenings from 6pm-10pm. After which I may drive to a little past midnite. Friday nites I plan to drive till about 4am and Saturday nites maybe 10pm to 4am. Sundays should be my rest days.</p>
              <p>May sound a little ambitious, but my schedule doesn't allow for sharing with a relief except saturday day shift and sunday whole day. So will most prolly settle for Comfort's cheapest cab: a 3 or 4 year old Crown for $86 - $88 a day.</p>
              <p>My target nett earnings per month is about $2800, +/- $200 perhaps. I don't expect this right off from the first month, but I won't mind driving longer hours during my learning period to make up for slower income.</p>
              <p>Criticisms, encouragements, advice are all welcomed.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              Helo Drive,
              
              Welcome, although i now have one more competitor on the road.
              
              Your schedule sounds a bit tiring... but more importantly a better option is:
              a) be a relief driver 6am to 6pm for 5 days... do your sum and I think you will not be worse off financially plus you get more rest plus peace of mind of not being a hirer... the only down side i see is that you wont have own transport... but then i won't fancy if it is a crown 
              
              b) take up other companies scheme with lower rental... comfort advantage is for those who want to drive a lot (cheaper diesel) and those who need relief

              <p>Thank you very much for all your replies. Appreciate the concern and effort.</p>
              <p>Maybe a little more background bout me is useful...</p>
              <p>I've been working as a "technical specialist" for over 7 years. I work on heavy machinery, so it's basically tough manual labour outdoor work. Working hours are 8-5 on weekdays and 8-5 on alternate saturdays. Sometimes, need to work on the non-working saturdays and sundays as well, with a weekday off the following week. Best part is, cos of the nature of my industry, we'll only know if we need to work that weekend ONLY on friday. So in short, I can only confirm two sundays off every month, the other weekends pend on job exigencies. This isn't the only reason I wanna leave, but don't want to bore you all with the details.</p>
              <p>As for the course I'm attending, I'm almost halfway through the 4th year of my 5-year course. Doing very well in it so far, thank you. So you can say juggling between work and school isn't new to me.</p>
              <p>I'm married with a cute 9mth old baby girl and a working wife. Financial liabilities do not allow me to take a pay cut if I want to look for another job. Poolman, I think you misread my post: I never said I don't mind lower income. What I said was I don't mind driving longer hours to make up for the slower income during my learning curve. One of the reason I look to taxi driving is cos of the potential of getting more income by doing more work, unlike the fixed income of being an employee. Also, I'm in control of my precious weekend time with my family instead of being at the mercy of my work.</p>

              <p>As for being a day shift relief or letting out my cab during the night, I have some concerns.</p>
              <p>Every morning, I'll send my baby to her caregivers and my wife to work in town. Meaning at 8am, I'm actually already in the CBD. I can start to head to the mid-east or mid-west housing estates to start my shift, but I would have lost out the 6am-8.30am customers.</p>
              <p>And then there's the low-demand period between 10am and 3pm. After which I only have a couple of hours before school to cover overheads and earn for the day. That's why I plan to drive a few hours AFTER classes; to make up for the lost hours in the morning.</p>
              <p>The Sonata is tempting, I agree. But the extra $20 in rental is quite substantial, especially for a newbie driver..</p>
              <p>As for opting for other companies, lower rental charges seem to the only thing they have over Comfort. In my opinion, Comfort's lower diesel price and their quarterly cash incentives beats lower rentals.</p>
              <p>Thanks again for all your kind advice.</p>
              <p>By the way, where's the best place I can go for my medical checkup if I live in Hougang? I would prefer if they open after office hours so don't need to take leave.</p>

              hey Drive,
              
              medical-i think can do at houg point healthway clinic
              
              your schedule - even if you can take it, i still dont think you are better off financially then being a 6am to 6pm relief. 
              
              cos you start at 8am to 6pm... so this part is same whether you are hirer or relief... 
              
              but then your after class driving 10pm to 1am you collect say $25x3=$75...only enough to pay for your nite shift rental of $44 and diesel $15... 
              
              like that I prefer not to drive the nite part and have a better rest... not forgetting the weekend where you still incur rental but not driving full...
              
              ...but it's your call.
              
              for me it is still comfort day relief or sign up with prime taxi $74 rental nett
