              <p><span><span style="color: #666666;"><strong>Taxi drivers find ways and means to safeguard  themselves</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span> Jinny Koh<br>jinny@mediacorp.com.sg </span></p>
              <p><span> Some taxi drivers have taken matters into their own hands when it comes
              to their own personal safety. Some have resorted to not wearing
              seatbelts for a quick getaway, some keep packets of chilli powder with
              them, while others refuse to pick up passengers whom they feel are
              suspect. And many do not file police reports even if they have been
              attacked.</span></p>
              <p><span>All these go against the rules and </span><span>regulations cabbies have to abide by. But taxi drivers Today spoke to say they have no choice but to resort to such measures.</span></p>
              <p><span>Cabbie Benny Ong, 51, said that when he was attacked in his taxi,
              his first thought was: "How to retaliate when the attacker is a
              passenger?" It was only when the attacker disembarked from the taxi
              challenging him to a fight, that Mr Ong drove away.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, he did not make a police report, as he felt it was too
              much trouble. "I could use the time to drive and earn more money
              instead," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>Citing similar reasons, cabbie Zhuo Zhong Lim, 51, did not file a
              report after he was punched and robbed a few years ago. He added that
              he knew many taxi drivers who would not make police reports after such
              encounters.</span></p>
              <p><span>According to the police, the number of reported taxi robberies
              has risen from 24 to 49 between 2006 and last year. There were 14
              reported cases from January to March this year, while anecdotal
              evidence points to a larger number as many of these cases go unreported.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, Today understands from the </span><span>police that it is a standard procedure for every crime victim, including taxi drivers, to file a police report.
              </span></p><div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Meanwhile, taxi operators have also set up their own standard operating procedures (SOPs) to assist cabbies in distress.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mr
              Tan Soon Chye, general manager for Prime Taxi, said drivers have been
              told to alert the company immediately when they feel uneasy about a
              passenger. A broadcast will be made to all taxis around that area,
              "acting as a psychological deterrent for the robber sitting in the cab
              knowing he is being monitored".
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              However, cabbies told Today such measures cannot be relied upon when an attack happens — by then, it would be too late.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              A
              59-year-old cabbie, who wanted to be known as Mr Tan S L, has not been
              wearing his seat belt during the night shift for more than 10 years. He
              feels potential robbers could easily hold it against his neck,
              preventing him from escaping.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Today understands that this is a practice adopted by many cabbies.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Prime
              Taxi's Mr Tan reiterated that the use of safety belts cannot be
              compromised as it is in the interest of drivers to belt up. "The
              possibility of them getting into an accident, with the long hours they
              spend on the road, is much higher than them being attacked by a
              robber," he said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Another rule
              being flouted by cabbies seems to be their refusal to pick people they
              deem dubious or suspicious-looking at secluded and notorious areas.
              <strong>Under the Land Transport Authority (LTA) act, it is an offence for
              drivers to decline to pick up a passenger without a reasonable excuse,
              and they can face six demerit points, a $300 fine and a two-week
              suspension.</strong> But cabbies say the penalty is a small price to pay.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              "Better to be safe than sorry," said Mr Ong, who admitted he is wary of shabbily-dressed passengers.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              So,
              what can cabbies do as they struggle to strike a balance between their
              lives and their livelihoods? Some drivers suggested closed-circuit
              cameras in taxis, so that passengers know they are being watched.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Operators
              are not in favour of such measures. Group Corporate Communications
              Officer for ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited, Ms Tammy Tan, said that
              surveillance cameras may be a deterrent, but there is a need to balance
              it with the privacy of the passengers.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              And
              for those cabbies, where flouting rules is not a risk they want to
              take, cabbie Johari Saleh, 43, seems to have found the answer. He keeps
              a packet of chilli powder beside him all the time, which he could throw
              at a potential attacker.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <p></p>
              <p>Besides
              taxi drivers, bus drivers have recently been in the news for being
              attacked. Last June, SBS Transit put up posters in all its 2,800 buses
              and interchanges urging the public to stop attacks on bus drivers after
              receiving 18 such reports in the first half of the year.</p>

              police reach within 5min? mas selmat escape within 11 mins.. whole army and police activated also cannot catch...

              <p>i remember once my good old buddy fella cabby was robbed off at
              Gul Road ...at 2am in the morning .</p>
              <p>he activated the security alarm , but it takes the police 45
              minutes to locate him .</p>
              <p>what the fuck is GPS ?</p>

              <p>GPS huh... Can you locate for me where is 01degree 40.534 North, 103degree 09.045 East on the map right now and tell me which street its on?</p>
              <p>The problem is, there is a serious time lag when Panic button is pushed, Taxi company receive the alarm, Taxi company call police, ops room received call, ops room interprete location, ops room send dispatch to ground unit, ground unit attend to emergency...</p>
              <p>This can be easily be sloved if all alarm is relayed to police itself, but that means more work...</p>

              <p><br>i was thinking about that as well.</p>
              <p>i think fencing up is still the best. adding on a central lock system, so that the robber or free ride punks cannot attack nor flee. but the central lock system will come with safety issue.</p>
