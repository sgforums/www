              <p>Not raise the educational requirements, continue keeping FT out and reserve it only for Singaporeans.  Less educated Singaporeans also need this as back up job (eg Taxi uncle who needed 80 attempts to get vocational license).</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In fact there are 50000 Singaporeans (non-active Taxi drivers) who already gotten Taxi vocational license who continue to renew it every year or few years who are playing it safe knowing they may be retrenched anytime by their companies.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">So 100,000 Singaporeans want Taxi Drivers job not including others who want it as backup job but have not gotten Taxi Vocational License.  The number of active taxi drivers already exceeds the no of regulars in SAF which happens to be the largest group out of all government-related organizations.  This is the reason why they put ex-Chief of Army to head the Taxi Association.</span></p>

              Casket drivers also on the increase, the Govt, in understanding the needs of casket business as Singapore, facing an old age population that is getting worst, more healthcare and funneral personals are needed.
              
              However, unlike taxis, casket drivers can come in all nationalities as long as the subject has the necessary certification and licences. And they also put an ex army chief to take care of the social part such including aging and dying problem.

              Gentlemen, 
                  
              Working or driving, in making more or less is one matter, the time and effort spent is another matter. 
                  
              And with regard to taxi driving and casket driving, giving the opportunity, I will take casket driving anytime the contract come around, why? because altho the income may lost to taxi driving, but the hours and rest taken is hugely different, CD works only 4 to 6 hrs, with plenty of rest, just 1 pax, drive less and relaxing,  free foods, kopi and TCSS, I can get $150net. Taxi driving, may hv to take 10hrs fully operational inorder to command maybe around $200net (elite and rangers not included). 
                  
              Therefore, TD loses their life time more on the road with more stress and tireness, and still hv to look out for traffice, tree prunting, calls,  TP, cams, smlj bus lanes, lj paxs and easily get affected by virus, flu bugs and other illnesses with pax is contagious and the list goes on.

              <p>There is a clause in Comfort's Code of Conducts that forbids cabbies from talking about politics.  So unless customers initiates, cabbies do not talk about it.  But I do not know whether the 4 other taxi companies have such rules.</p>
              <p>Politics is internet (yahoo.com, theonlinecitizen.com, sammyboy.com, www.tremeritus.com, etc..) talks and coffeshop talks (especially Hougang Blk 322).  If cabbies do talk about it, they talk in one-hard-to-find coffeeshop among themselves in Telok Blangah.  </p>
              <p>But cabbies do spread news very fast even if they do not talk to customers about politics. 50,000 cabbies talk to wives, 100,000 knows about it.  Talk to kids, 200,000 knows about it.  Wives and kids spread to others, 400,000 to 800,000 knows about it.  Total voters only 2,200,000.  If Comfort does not have the rule to forbid talking about politics, cabbies could really affect election results.  One day one cabby reaches out to 18-25 cusomers,  50,000 cabbies reach out to 1 million customers. 1 million customers spread, whole Singapore knows about it.</p>
