              <p>A chinese man with beard like those in kung-fu movies. Stout and tough looking with streetwise look. If he wears a kung-fu style shirt it would be perfect for him but he has on a big baggy T-shirt. Very menacing looking man.</p>
              <p>He immediately boarded (front seat) my taxi after the previous customer had alighted.</p>
              <p>(All in Hokkien) "KNLBCCB, sibei tulan taxi don't stop for me! All waiting for calls is it!"</p>
              <p>Wah liao, si liao, how to handle him.  Best is to make friendly with him and hope he has sympathy (most kung-fu people in movies can empathise with suffering peasant), explain taxi driving hard to make a living, most have to come all the way empty from far away towns to city to pick up next fare thereby wasting time and fuel so they try to make up by taking calls. Tell him he look very macho with the beard and all, not easy for me to grow beard because my whiskers are sparsely populated, how I wish to have a beard like his. Pay him many compliments. At last he cooled down.</p>
              <p>He proudly told me he was the first in Singapore to be convicted for road-rage. He slashed and stabbed victim with knife and was jailed. He still feels the victim had asked for it. (Which I personally agree, there are people who really asked for it, sibei lau lan, don't know what tiger they are facing.)</p>
              <p>He confesses he likes to fight and had learn kung-fu from books and movies and how he can keep calm while fighting, able to 'siam' his opponents' attacks with or without weapons.</p>
              <p>"Come, let me teach you a few moves."</p>
              <p>He promptly took my left arm and twisted it before I can say no.</p>
              <p>"You must know where to hit your opponent where he is to hurt most."</p>
              <p>Poked below my ribs and I let out a yell.</p>
              <p>"I have use only minimal strenght and you yell, this shows how effective it is."</p>
              <p>"Please, let me learn from you next time we meet, now I'm driving and I have to concentrate." I changed the subject and asks how he likes to go to Leng Kee at a cross junction.  "We can go from here or you like to take another route?"</p>
              <p>He told me another route which baffles me. Anyway I don't wish to discuss which is the 'correct' route with him. So I told him to direct me as we go along.</p>
              <p>Another BIG SURPRISE when we nears his destination. I had asked him before is it Leng Kee where there's a lot of cars for sale and he had said yes. </p>
              <p>We ended up at  Leng Kie Car Dealers along Commonwealth Ave.</p>
              <p>All in all he is actually a very nice man when we get talking. Really do not mind meeting him again, not purposely but if fate arranged it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Are u being too sensitive ? I was used to be like that , not now .</p>
              <p>Juz left ear in , right ear out , or occupied yourself with the radio ... that will be better off .</p>
              <p>still i think u felt guilty , which is not your fault , still u felt bad , into too sensitive to it .</p>
              <p>From SGH to Wlands ..... depending on time ... i normally encourage them to use CTE , especially after 10.30pm . </p>
