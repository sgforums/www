              FW I never scare one, I scare only local drunkers, in fact, FW are more obedient and never make noises if you go wrong way...they look more scare of you than you scare of them. 
              
              All FWs are brief here about our laws and orders much better than locals, any visit to police stn can means the end of their stay in Singapore.
              
              All FWs are actually more cleaners than locals or PRs here, because they need to go for check up every 2 years to renew their Permit, they are checked on VD, HIV and many other transmitting illnesses, Locals and PRs, some never check for years

              <p>I took them to Tuas South Ave 4 that night. They were not drunk and what Bro Bowah said is correct. They are typically timid and won't dare to do funny things ...</p>
              <p>All posts actually had valid points.</p>
              <p>What went through my mind otw to Tuas were:</p>
              <p>1. Why I take them when it's still early with potential paxs ard town area?</p>
              <p>2. Why I take them knowing this trip confirmed empty trip out?</p>
              <p>3. Would I get into trouble by rejecting them? Or could they be LTA assisnged fake paxs?</p>
              <p>4. Where would be my next area to get paxs?</p>
              <p>Then otw into Tuas, I'm surprised that there are few taxis (hired) otw out of Tuas... I was hoping that I could be the next one lor..</p>
              <p>Luckily for me, after dropping them... I drove out slowly hoping (maybe) for current call..Then I saw someone waving at me and I went to take them (3 of them Filipino).</p>
              <p>One of them said: Uncle, we are going to OT, but can you wait for us for 10 mins? We need to change first.</p>
              <p>Me: Ok, I send you to change first( nearby only)</p>
              <p>While waiting (w/o the meter on), I smoke, take toilet break and do some strectching. They came and off we went to OT...</p>
              <p>Lucky night for me (even though rare case)... But would I get the luck if I reject them? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>That said, these cases are a few. FW seldom rob taxi drivers. Observe body language before picking them up - you get this from experience I suppose.</p>

              <p>Geylang of course is good place for pax 24-7, but must just be extra alert. Especially in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
              <p>FWs in Geylang, for sure you can 'interview' one - this people won't complain one. Interview is not just for location, but also to see if they drunk, or behaving suspiciously. Normally people with bad intentions, will have some hesitation. Maybe they hail 1 cab, then back down, then hail yours. Or if they hail a few cabs, all kena reject, this one you must be careful, must find out why the earlier cabs never take. Maybe they told the Td they only got $10 go Tuas, of course everyone will say no, then by the time they see you, they decide waste time to explain, just board, then go Tuas then talk see how, or 'chow cab'.</p>
              <p>But normally Bangla and FW Indians, will not pull such stunts. For others must see where they go, if going to a dorm, or areas got people one, no problem. Dorms all got security. Tuas if ship workers, also quite okay one, they usually got money, they go geylang for 'horse riding', so normally will have money for that will have money for cab fare. Talk to them, find out about their ship name etc, all this can be of use if something go wrong.</p>
              <p>For ladies in that industry - no problem. I'm sure you will enjoy the fare! But beware China girls, some of them very tricky. Vietnam, Indon and Thai all usually no issue.</p>
              <p>You must be careful of Ah Gua, especially local one - the Thai ones, no issue. Local ones usually pokai type, might try some tricks. Ah Gua the Champions League location is OT, the Premiership standard is Changi Pt. Geylang is all the char par lang ( I dunno if I spelt this right). So becareful of local Ah Guas in Geylang.</p>
              <p>For locals, the old gangster type - also ok, they will not rob TD. It's the younger ones you must be careful a bit. Read body language. If not comfortable, don't pick up is okay what. Lose a pax better than lose a fare (non payment) or kena rob.</p>
              <p>The last advice is try not pick up those who suddenly run to grab a taxi, they might be fleeing from something. Or those involved in some argument or fight - be it with other guys or with their gf. if the guy and girl argue in the street, they will also argue in your cab. If the guys are angry with someone in the street, they might point their anger at you instead later.</p>
              <p>Drunkards all this no need to say. Just remember to keep your doors locked before you finally decide to admit a pax in 'hot-spots'.</p>
              <p>I hope you find this advice useful</p>

              <p>Don't forget, our Sg dormitory also have very strict rule and regulation hor, like army camp like that 1 hor.....</p>
              <p>And lastly, this bangla worker is a "lao jiao", in Sg many many years liao, can speak simple English, do simple business in tekka, like phone card business, remit business......</p>
              <p>This are the 1 many many lobang 1, than in the taxi, will purposely make his iPhone5 ring, than kay kay tcss.....</p>
              <p>And don't worry, this type open his wallet chao chao few hundred dollar 1, won't run 1......</p>
