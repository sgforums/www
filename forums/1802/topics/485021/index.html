              <p>is all up to you man. Are you really concern about reputation, care about ppl gossiping your job title? or interested in bringing the dough back to the family? most important do what you are interested in.. If you think driving a taxi is your passion and interested in, why not? if you intend to work as a worker for the corporation, why not? open a business and be your own boss, why not?</p>
              <p>Dont be fickle minded, at the end of the day you yourself suffer with so many dilemna in your life. Seriously, no offence...if 1 get to do well in studies and aim for high pay, one will rather go towards that direction...but some who really scores well but cant do well in life....rather lead a carefree lifestyle be a TD, why not.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, what matter most is inside your pocket. Money.</p>
              <p>my concept of life is very simple...when magazine is fully loaded with bullets, best is go firing range. Not happy with your job? Find another one, or throw letter or??? so many ORs?</p>

              Frankly speaking, you need to have passion in whatever you do, then the thing can work, like being a waiter, the passion to serve, to please client, to bring about smile on client, and the passion in satisfying client, as for Taxi driving, you need to have the passion to roam around singapore, to see all kinds of peoples or nuts, to able to see how the society go round and keep changing, the passion to be on your own, different destination, different trip, and most importantly, the passion to drive, serve and bring others to their desire destination.
              
              If the passion to drive, serve as a public transporter to bring peoples around to their destination exist in you, then you can be a taxi driver for a long long time, if not, consider throw key and look for something that you are passionate with, like me, the passion to serve the dead.

              Human, by nature is very hard to die, especially in a society like Singapore, you can hardly end up facing a wall with no way out, it is all in the mind, like most of you would had been working until give up and found a niche in taxi driving, and when that moment you left yr last job, you might be thinking,,,,cham liao, end liao..but human tends to have a nature of never ending attitude, and that is why we are all struggling day in and day out.
              
              Now if you throw key now, walk out of the taxi office with no job, I can guarantee you that within a week, you will find a job..because like all animals, the homo saipen (human) are good in search for foods for survive.
              
              ON the othe hand, if you keep driving and looking for opportunities, it will hardly materialise because you are still driving and do not intent to give up, and you are naturally finding something similar to TD which will not exist in a corporate world.
              
              So, to summarise, throw key first...talk later...if you dun throw key, talk and think until cow come home...still a TD. UNDERSTAND!

              <p>Frankly speaking, you need to have passion in whatever you do,
                  then the thing can work, like being a waiter, the passion to serve,
                  to please client, to bring about smile on client, and the passion
                  in satisfying client, as for Taxi driving, you need to have the
                  passion to roam around singapore, to see all kinds of peoples or
                  nuts, to able to see how the society go round and keep changing,
                  the passion to be on your own, different destination, different
                  trip, and most importantly, the passion to drive, serve and bring
                  others to their desire destination.</p>
              <p>If the passion to drive, serve as a public transporter to bring
                  peoples around to their destination exist in you, then you can be a
                  taxi driver for a long long time, if not, consider throw key and
                  look for something that you are passionate with, like me, the

              Wahahaha..passion is important in every you do, however, for TD, that passion do not last long, some maybe one month only, give up liao, some tong 1 year, give up liao, some bo bian no more passion also hv to tong, then tong ah tong until see thru liao..like me ah fu...see thru already mah.
              
              Taxi driving is a short live passion as there is no glory nor promotion in it, and that is also why people throw keys here and there, and the turn over is high, old one with no more passion, see steering also sian liao...will go, new one immediately come in with high passion. 
              
              Buit there are people with high passion in it after 20 ++ years of driving, and most of these drivers are contended people, people who I called, enlightened taxi driver.
              
              With regard to throw key and find a job, please remember that driving taxis is not employing you, you can throw key then go find a job, that make you more urgent and determine to find a job. But if still driving, that urgency to find a job may not be there, and as you hold, the years go by, by then...lao kok kok like me, who want?

              <p>Aiyah what prospects u want.we r no longer young. Earn some
              money and wait for the Lord to call us home. That's the cycle of
              life for everybody. If have children. Provide them the best
              education by all means. that is the least we can give to them.
              Other than that. We r nothing. We r not movers or shakers of the
              world. </p>
