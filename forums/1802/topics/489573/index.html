              <p>So after 2 over years of taxi drivers supporting grabtaxi , now this company has turn its back on those who have helped them build up to what they are now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://s8.postimg.org/wc4woho91/mail_google_com.png" alt="" width="464" height="826"></p>
              <p> <img src="http://s27.postimg.org/y41mzwhgj/grab3.png" alt=""></p>
              <p>This i would say is the ultimate betrayal that a company can do to its supporters.</p>
              <p>To all you grabtaxi fans that so whole heartedly supported them making them to where they are today, you are now second fiddle to a bunch of unlicensed drivers who are not made to go through the TDVL like what we gone through.</p>
              <p>Best part of all , they have no regulations and rules to govern them! How is that Taxi drivers? Do you feel angry and betrayed?</p>
              <p>If you have any ounce of pride left in you , you will feel angry, you will feel betrayed.</p>
              <p>So tell each and everyone of those grab fans , stop taking their calls.</p>
              <p>You guys have a durian party this year isnt it?</p>
              <p>My gut feel is that taxi drivers will not be on their invite list to feast on durians for very long.</p>
              <p>Stop this disease from spreading.</p>

              <p>1. is it illegal? did the authorities say cannot? is it free market? then blame who? the conversation can already stop here.</p>
              <p>2. when someone do not eat from a rice bowl does not mean others do not eat from that same rice bowl. it is anyone's choice. if not eating, then pls go and dont disturb the rice bowl</p>
              <p>3. so far that rice bowl (and other rice bowls) has fed me full full even beyond full. i have no complains.</p>
              <p>4.  the market is so big enough for so many, but some people just cannot see open. maybe these people cannot make la so they have free time instead of busy making more, they resort to whining and complaining about changes they cannot adapt to. they call others disease, maybe they should reflect if they are the disease.</p>
              <p>5. i on the other hand hope there is more promotions. the more the merrier! :)</p>

              As a kind word of advice.
              
              "You simply cannot please everybody, but as long as you applied the 20/80 rules, whereby 20% are not happy and the rest 80% are ok, that will be fine"

              <p>I make use of you. You make use of me. Nothing wrong here.</p>
              <p>Think drivers don't really support them, we take calls because we can make money.</p>
              <p>But I don't like their min $30 driver credit deposit and stupid Wallet for grabay. Who wants to put money in the wallet? While uber &amp; hailo automatically pay to your bank account for cashless transactions, GT ask you to cash out if not the money stays in the wallet (which you can't even use to top up driver credit or buy anything!).</p>
              <p>Stupid ploy to trick blurr drivers to leave money with them.... really sh^t company but as long as they give me good calls, I will still use them like they use me....lol</p>
