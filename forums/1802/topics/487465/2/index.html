              <p>For smart guy that still not aware how UberX is changing pax behaviour. How is it possible for private car without taxi licence and driver without taxi TDVL to fetch pax.</p>
              <p>From the discussion, now the smart guy know that UberX part time driver does not use the car drive to KL.</p>
              <p>With technology advancement, to take taxi, no need to go to the road and flag the taxi and dont know who is the driver.  Now, the taxi can come to you and u know who is the driver.</p>
              <p>UberX is becoming an alternative to taxi for both pax and driver. Yet the authority, taxi companies and NTA all still sleeping waiting for thing to happen.</p>
              <p>If the authority not going to do anything, in 2 years time, when DT line become operation, less demand for taxi trip. UberX become an mature alternative for pax and driver taking significant share from converntional taxi. New player similar to UberX may join the industry.  Taxi industry will become a mess.</p>

              My friend checked with Uber. He was told to convert his car to commercial, meaning not owned under private name. Then insurance will need to change too. I find it more troublesome than being a hirer. Unless really no choice you can't get TD licence. Just sharing no offence.

              If good, everyone will jump ship liao...first will be my ex chief, followed by his kakis,...ct...hammer...etc etc. 
              
              In here, you dun need to know which is good or bad, just follow their movement, you will make a good choice, although they may sometime make a wrong decision like smlj radio calls...phuixxx. Long ago, I already told them radio call is facing out, that time somemore can argue with me...now all in grab, easy liao mah.
              
              So, the current trends is sign up for grab, take pirus, and forget all these Uber or Ahber or tiber

              <p>Congrats.  How many hours do u intend to drive everyday? Newbie start off as OMO is very siong. Most ppl start as relief and once they are comfortable, become hirer.  Even then, they are not OMO.  They have relief drivers. Unless u need the car to fetch wife and children.</p>
              <p>All coy more or less the same.  Comfort got more calls definitely, but U can join Grab, Easy, Uber and Hailo.</p>
              <p>Not sure about PR for family, but as a taxi driver, not so easy.  It is considered self employed and unsteady income with no CPF. Another consideration is whether ur wife has ever worked in Spore under a work permit.  If so, then will also be more difficult to get PR. Good luck.</p>

              <p>Hello bro Sunny,</p>
              <p>Wah, stop 1 am then start 6 am, very siong lah.  Standing 18 hrs and driving 18 hrs are two different things.  Driving needs 101% concentration cos a lot of idiots on Spore roads. I got a friend do split shift like u, but he stop at 10pm. Hand over to relief. Sunday rest day.</p>
              <p>Never heard join Comfort can buy house easy.  I dun think got such a thing.  Comfort only care about whether u can pay rental on time and got customer complain anot.  Lol...</p>

              <p>Drive 12 hours shift n 1 day off for family. This is the standard for driving taxi. Anything more than 12 hours , you are putting your life n health on danger.</p>
              <p>Now you may not understand this. 3 months down the road. You will understand this trade. Money cannot earn finish , life n health is more important.  </p>
