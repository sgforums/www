              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Payments through Visa cards will be re-introduced in ComfortDelGro taxis from next month, almost three years after Visa started phasing out its service from all cabs in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">But, as with the use of all other brands of credit cards in taxis, Visa-swiping passengers will have to pay a 10 per cent levy - a surcharge that Visa had wrangled with cab firms to remove in the past. This led to Visa payment services being stopped in ComfortDelGro, Trans-Cab and Prime taxis in July 2013, with Premier and SMRT following suit.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Visa's country manager for Singapore and Brunei, Ms Ooi Huey Tyng, said that following a review, it has decided to re-introduce card payments, including its contactless payWave option, for taxis.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;"> </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">This is because the taxi industry landscape has changed, she said, with the popularity and availability of third-party cab booking apps such as Uber Taxi and GrabTaxi.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Through the apps, passengers can pay with Visa, and without a surcharge. There are close to 700,000 such transactions every month - an eightfold increase from a year ago, the company said.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;"> </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Ms Ooi said that while many Singaporeans have this surcharge-free option, tourists and business travellers may not be familiar with the apps and have to rely on using credit cards, so Visa hopes to cater to them.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">While the 10 per cent levy will prevail, Visa remains firm on its no-surcharge policy for all its transactions. "We are very disappointed that we have not been able to remove or reduce the 10 per cent surcharge after longstanding discussions with Comfort," said Ms Ooi.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">"However, it remains an important option we need to provide for our business travellers coming to Singapore. We still believe... it is the best decision for our cardholders."</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Before Visa removed its payment service in taxis in 2013, there were about 140,000 transactions each month.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">ComfortDelGro group corporate communications officer Tammy Tan said its taxis will start accepting Visa card payments from Jan 1, with the full roll-out across the entire fleet of 17,000 cabs taking about three months.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Asked if Visa payments will be re-introduced in cabs run by the island's four other operators - Premier, Prime, SMRT and Trans-Cab - Ms Ooi said the company is open to working with them.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Cab companies have said previously that the surcharges are needed to cover a fee they have to pay banks for every card transaction - estimated to be between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Mr Amer Subhi, 39, an international sales manager from Israel who travels to Singapore about once a month, said the return of Visa payment in taxis is a good move. "But the 10 per cent surcharge is a bit high. About 1 per cent to 2 per cent should be acceptable," he said.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px;">Cabby Henry Tay, 45, who drives a MaxiCab, said: "My fares are higher than for... normal taxis, so customers generally want to pay using credit cards. Having Visa back as one of the options will be welcomed by my passengers."</p>

              Got paper count or cash to count, consider ho liao lah, one day, got nothing to count that time, knn, toilet paper also must count how many layer just to save it.
              
              Today, there are many SAF regulars or people, getting retrenched or early retired, who come into the taxi trade hv a sum of money in place already, so many do not mind cards or cash, cos they can pay the rental, unlike our time, tiam tiam gamble, chiong lasup bar, kio kuay, borrow from ah long, any 3 or 4 TDs together only, either gambling or betting will start liao. So, end up, most like me...tiam tiam say..Money not enuf lor, so, whenever pax pass me his card for a little fare, I will pass him my casket namecard.

              <p>casket nail where got so expensive? I be your nail supplier since u willing to pay so much.</p>
              <p>I dont want to support mastercard or visa. Greedy companies providing useless service and ask for so much commission is cannot support one. I dont believe in paying a fee for money transfer unless is TT transfer. Local money transfer in singapore should be free, or with minimal costs.</p>
              <p>I also dont support cashless society. It means government can trace money flows easily. Already we got many police officers sitting inside aircon office cho bo lan, instead of patrolling the streets. Sit in front of computer screen, bio chio bu, snacking away, drinking coffee and playing chua tai di, instead of doing their patrols.</p>

              You go rent a taxi, taxi will tell us this and that, that and this, Uncle, if you OK, please sign here, paid there, and come back again, and also remember to take a photo, but yr eyes must be placed on the DRO neh neh, that is why signed blindly. 
              
              It is not something you dunno abt MDT, cam, this and that in a cab, it is also not up to you to negotiate nor bargain, you go in and rent a taxi with yr eyes open, not close, if you not happy, can also walk out with your eyes open, thereafter, on the road or walking on the road, you close or open is nobody business.
              
              So dun tell me smlj this cannot and that should not have, friend, you spent quite sometime at this trade, and it is this trade, that helped you in a way know more about people, experiences and opportunites, so dun bite the hand that fed you before hor..people do, heaven see hor, sar kar is ok, but dun be che art hor.
