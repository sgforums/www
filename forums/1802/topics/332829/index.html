              <p>If the cost is shared among a few teens, then its not a big deal &amp; nowdays most teens can afford the lastest gadgets &amp; stuffs so wats a mere $18 - $25 for them..</p>
              <p>If they want convenience &amp; speed, then taxi would be their best choice otherwise just make do with the MRT..</p>

              <p>i agree that youngster are rich nowadays. Their weekly allowance for aged 15-20 are about 75/weekly or higher for the lucky ones? They can get more allowance if they want.</p>
              <p>So taxi fair shared by 2-3 ppl? or even 4 ppl? its quite worthwhile, even mrt is much more cheaper (from what i think) , but sometimes convinence are no.1 for them? I dont know, but for me i will take cab if i have 3 people or 4 people. I rather spend 2 or 5 bucks more for near places</p>

              i observe many types of pple take cab
              
              - can claim type
              - habitual (cant tahan bus/mrt type)
              - big group similar destination type
              - after 1am party goers
              - those shop until tired type
              - to or from ulu area like conoration west, seletar camp type
              - in a rush type
              - elderly and with baby type
              
              u add all these types of pax, quite a lot liao... 
              
              actually cab fare not very expensive if no surcharge... e.g. serangoon to woodlands only $14... very far liao...
              
              only when 35% or 50% surcharge kicks in, then it gets expensive...

              <p>Already encounter something new on drop off point by paxs. how to avoid ERP or Congestion.</p>
              <p>Here is some example....Lucky Plaza first stated, than drop me at Merriot Hotel, save one gantries, just walk across Tang.</p>
              <p>Paragon Shopping, drop me ...along Cairnhill road exit Cairnhill Place Carpark than basement or turn out to Thong Sia Building,  just walk across.</p>
              <p>My contribution.</p>
              <p>Whampoa market if from Thomson to Balestier, exit Jalan Rajah it will connect into the market. less hazzle on or the traffic lights and junctions.</p>

              <p>i agree that youngster are rich nowadays. Their weekly allowance

              They can get more allowance if they want.</p>
              <p>So taxi fair shared by 2-3 ppl? or even 4 ppl? its quite
              worthwhile, even mrt is much more cheaper (from what i think) , but
              sometimes convinence are no.1 for them? I dont know, but for me i
              will take cab if i have 3 people or 4 people. I rather spend 2 or 5
