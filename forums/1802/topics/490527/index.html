              <p>I dont know if drivers really do the maths.<br> A new I40 or prius rental 137/day average, while private car rental 65/day avg. <br> Difference is 137-65 = 72 more to rent a taxi.<br> <br> Example your fare per month is $7000 ( definitely achievable, Taxi can go up to 9000 if hardworking).<br> For uber less 20% of 7000 = $1400<br> $1400/30 = $47<br> <br> $72 - $47 = $25<br> You bascially paying $25 more per day if you are renting a taxi then renting a car for uber.<br> <br> $25 is equivalent to 1 Taxi job from town to airport during peak hours.<br> <br> Furthermore  this havent include Petrol. Taxi pump the diesel at the 
              cheapest rate  at about $0.90/L, and prius mileage per tank is 2x that 
              of normal sedan,  while normal sedan pump a $2/L petrol.<br> <br> Taxi have Peak surcharges, CBD surcharges, midnight charges, Airport charges. Uber and Grab dont have.<br> Allow to take street jobs while uber and grab No.<br> <br> Unless you are having another job like real estate, Insurance, free 
              lance sales, business, and you need a car for your profession as well as
               having your transport cover + income<br> Or<br> Buy a 2006 or 2007 car, fully pay it, drive till the COE end, scrap it and get back PARF.<br> <br> If not I don't think it makes sense for someone to rent a car and go full time all in as a uber driver instead of a taxi driver.</p>

              <p>Uber is for the less serious drivers.  Regular taxi drivers went months without pay before they could drive a taxi (Apply to LTA, LTA screening, pay and pass medical exam, pay and register for course, wait to take course, course, study for exam, take exam, pay and retake exam, wait for letter to collect license, register with one taxi company and pay deposit, attend a few more company courses, find a hirer or relief for non-OMO drivers).  </p>

              <p>This one definitely one.....they were making a loss to attempt to gain market share.... only 6% of taxi drivers switched to them despite their huge incentives...94% felt that it is not worth it to switch to them and did not do so.</p>
              <p>Don't know how Minister Khaw would regulate them... maybe award them with a regular taxi rental company license and ask them to switch their operation to regular taxi rental business.   If there are 3000 ex-taxi drivers with them and at least 1000 unrented taxis with the 5 taxi companies, they could be allowed a few hundred taxis for a start.</p>
              <p>They are currently operating like a huge "pirate-taxi-renting" company.</p>

              As a drivers, no matter how you calculate, who you drive for...at the end of the day, you are just slaving for all these companies, be it Uber, grab or taxi companies. 
              
              Think about it before you decided to drive for any of them, but the best advice as a $30 net driver here, is....if can, dun drive lah, go find a job,...blow job also good.

              The most important thing to come out of this is for taxi rentals to drop. The taxi and limo fares are reasonable.
              
              The fact is taxi rentals cannot keep going up to support CDG share prices.
              
              The taxi fare also cannot keep going up every 2 years, since salaries will not change much.
              
              It is time for taxi companies to re-evaluate their business, trim off the fats and become lean and competitive.
              
              Business must adapt continually. The local taxi scene has stayed stagnant and already maxed out the old formula.

              Agreed, then be the OKT lah, why be the prostitute? Think Wise.
              
              Yes, we all are slaving for someone, but how much of the slaving, you decide, and I can tell you that Taxi or apps driving is a total slaving, long hrs driving, earn peanuts, less or no benefits, everything settle on yr own including yr MDT, repair, sick, aging..
              
              And why are people driving for them, because most young punks/people today like freedom, relax, easy going job, hate to compete with foreigners, own self pawned better than get pawned by others...but the true is, we all pawned silently and mercilessly.

              <p>Yo dear Uber Drivers, interested to earn extra side income while
              on the road meeting new faces?<br> <br> Anyway, still deciding on whether to test test drive uber and grab
              myself to meet new people. But the opinions and feedback is mixed,
              but would like to know the probability of having a PMET as
              passenger?<br> <br> It wont take you additional time doing this, and very attractive
              incentives. Real estate agents and sales experienced pals are most
              welcomed....<br> <br> You can private msg me and we carry on from there..</p>
              <p>Anyway, its banking and finance related</p>
