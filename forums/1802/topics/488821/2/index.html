              <p>Not surprising at all. More lucrative than running a traditional taxi company with so much overheads. 20% comm vs 30 cts? Who don't want? UberX has set the trend and other clones are appearing now. This is totally expected.</p>
              <p>Going forward, CDG surely will come into the fray. Maybe even Hailo &amp; EasyTaxi will come in or other taxi apps companies also.</p>
              <p>But if LTA requires driver licensing, then it will hard for them to get drivers. If can get TDVL, many will prefer to drive taxis. LTA could save the day for TDs....</p>

              <p>Hope you are right that they dont survive. But i think they will co exist side by side with taxis except that now their drivers are licensed so safer for pax. </p>
              <p>There will always be demand for such private or pirate taxis as the pax profile changes with higher income levels. So it is a matter of whether the companies can be profitable doing it or not.</p>

              Private booking have alway been around, but during these few years, it have perked up due to a more afluent society and the so called,"" call taxi, no taxi, wave taxi, taxi do not want to stop, taxi driver pick and choose"" slogans. 
              
              Couple with an increase in populations and more open economy the govt is trying to promote. The pte companies like Uber or grabcar are all ready for it, they are not stupid, they hv studied the situation, get it analysed by professional before they decided to embark on it.
              
              And bear in mind that nearly 3/4 of these pte car drivers are also ex TDs who had in a way get tired of taxi driving and wanted to try pte type or that their TVDL  get gantoned by LTA. For the rest public who joined are either PRs, the so called foreign talents bestowed by our govt, but got no talents to show, and people who might have catch up with the laws and choose not to be fully employed.
              
              As for locals who owns cars and used their car for pte booking are mostly those in desparate position, either kiam ah long or unable to service the car installment, these are mostly temporary one. Because most Local car owners like me would prefer not to do it, can afford to buy car, use it for leisure, if cannot, then dun drive.
              
              Finally, as said many times, local TDs are , like most of my brothers here, including me, we only TCSS or TBNA type (TALK BIG NO ACTION), and because most do not see each other eye to eye and yet calling each other dog and cat, for another 100 years, how can TD be united, and when you are not united...smlj voice you hv also no use...so let carry on with our TCSS and TBNA better.
