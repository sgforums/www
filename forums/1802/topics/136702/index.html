I'm assuming a lot of torque from the diesel engines since the acceleration seems quite strong; also how about the brakes since they stop without engine brake without much effort.

As you can see, SMRT only has 1000+ cabs but it is around for so many years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .<br>Another factor is competition.
