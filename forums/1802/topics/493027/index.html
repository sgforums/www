              <p>I have an ongoing accident case from 2015. Private car coming out of MRT drop off at an angle bang into my left passenger side door. I was going straight along the road. Since i didn't have video recording, it was classified as 50-50. I got a hold of the other party's report. He also no video recording. The cb go and report it as totally opposite (i.e I turn into drop off point and bang him!). I've submitted my passenger witness report to support my statement.</p>
              <p>Although it is a case of u "i say" "u say" but i have additional witness report. Taxi insurance simply is not using it to fight my case. As of now they have already claimed more than 50% of my liability and the case is still on going.</p>
              <p>For this matter, when taxi company does not want to help u fight (probably to save on their legal cost), what can we as taxi drivers who are at their mercy do? Who to approach for help? Will any help even be rendered or we simply suck thumb and pay up whatever libility?</p>
              <p>Anyone with similar experience to share and advise?</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>MP is an option i can try. No agreement to delay. 1 week after the accident i get letter from the Ah Lian and they start deducting GIRO installment. Other than the accident, other things are ok to support my income so not considering throwing key yet.</p>

              For taxi accident, getting a lawyer is when you are not at fault, then want to claim the opposite gao gao, then get a lawyer, there are many sungei road and serangoon road lawyers wandering around taxi accident reporting areas, once not your fault, then will automatically show their nice gleaming name card while smiling with their smoke tainted teeth.

              <p>Went to see MP. Got to talk to one of the reps. Based on my case with witness statement, i was advised to approach MOM for help. Would this even work? Always thought MOM won't attend to those self-employed like us. Was asked to return to MP if MOM reject. Feel like going on a wild goose chase but will give it a try anyway. Any of u have been helped by MOM before being taxi driver?</p>

              <p>Initially was $1070 which was paid up last year. Now, more than a year after the accident they are claiming more ($250) with more to come maybe as the case still on going. Max liability is $2140.</p>
              <p>What bothers me is that, i know it's not my fault and i've submitted pax witness statement as such. But till today it is not being any weight to fight my case even though the other party has nothing to back up his claim other than his words. Btw, he is a 75 yr old fart who still dares to lie to save money with one foot already in his grave.</p>

              <p>Taxi Company will not act for you.  You have to help yourself. Your case was in 2015.  A bit too late to fight now.  Let me give you my own case.</p>
              <p>I was at a cross junction turning right.  The right turn green arrow was in my favour.  As I was turning, the other car going straight in the opposite direction beat the red light and bang into me. I did not have any video footage as the bloody Sonata camera did not work.  The old cameras will fail when there is an impact.  I tested it myself when I took the camera out.  Shake the camera a bit and the video recording stopped.</p>
              <p>Without video evidence, I was 100% liable as I was the turning vehicle. I had to pay $2,000 to Comfort.  What I did immediately was to get the video footage from LTA and make a police report.  They have the j-eyes or junction cameras.  I had to write to LTA and called them as well.  Luckily, they had the footage of the accident and said they will pass it to TP.</p>
              <p>Then I had to call TP to make sure they get the footage from LTA.  Chased TP everyday to make sure they handle my case promptly.  I also went to GIA and paid to get the other party's accident report.  True enough, the other party denied everything in his report.</p>
              <p>It took TP almost six months to settle the case.  In the end, they charged the other driver in court under Section 65(b) for inconsiderate driving.  The culprit pleaded guilty and TP sent me a letter to inform me.  Only then with that letter can I go back to Comfort to reclaim back my $2,000.</p>
              <p>With that TP letter, Comfort won the case and claimed loss of income for me.  Only recently after more than a year is my case fully settled.</p>
              <p>In your case, you should have immediately requested for SMRT or SBS Transit for video footage as all MRT exits and drop offs has CCTV to deter illegal parking. Still you can ask for it, but a bit too late now.</p>

              Let me also share my experience, 
              
              Once I hit a small dog, it died, owner scolded me and took my licence plate, the dog was not belted, I told dog owner I cannot see your dog, who had run into the side of the road, even with cam, I will not get the picture as it is so small,  owner make police report and engage lawyer and report to taxi company, taxi company give them my detail by court order. I also make police report
              
              I was summoned for a hearing, owner claim dog was lashed and I was driving over the limit, charge me compensation $5000, if I lose, I would have to pay $5000 + all other courts and his lawyer expenses, so immediately I go around that place of accident to paste my name and particulars on lamppost, lifts, letter boxes and ask for witnesses.
              
              Talked to my MP, even get an appointment with Minister to address my case, but even Justice Bao (aka Tharmasamuragum) also say, must have witness, best is get a few.
              
              After a month, attended the second hearing, owner presented his witness, which was his mother and a neighbor friend, all said the dog was just out one the zig zag double yellow line, and I was driving at 80km on a HDB road, when hit the dog was wedged against the curb because the driver did not stop. Judge asked me if I got any witness to defence my case, I told him, still pending, case was adjourned to another 2 weeks.
              
              I went to visit taxi company's DRO, head, IO...all bo yew lan me, then I pay a vist to my rich mother in laws to borrow money to prepare for the payment. Then I got a call from a teenagers living near the place of incident, he said he had the cam of what happened.

              <p>It was my first ever accident and made many rookie mistakes. Naively, believed that the taxi company will fight my case with the witness letter which is why i allowed a long time to lapse without taking other action like seeking cctv footage.</p>
              <p>Btw, recently i did call up SMRT to query about getting access to cctv footage but was given the answer that they won't give and that i have to make police report / TP report first and go thru that channel. Did not call up LTA though. In your case, was LTA willing to help without much resistance? Did u make police and TP reports first?</p>
              <p>U r pobably right about all this being too late. We can only learn some lessons for the future.</p>

              <p>i think going through the proper channel is still the best option. :) Get police report, then seek the affected parties and so on.</p>
              <p>Right to say, SMRT will just shoo your case away. Who are you to them? It can be any strangers who just call them 24/7 just to provide footages on accidents. They wont be so good to entertain you unless you go through proper procedures. :) </p>
