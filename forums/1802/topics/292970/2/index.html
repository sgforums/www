            <div class='col-md body'>Oh i forgot to add that you have to pay network charges for all booking, ranging from $0.40-$0.70 per booking, depending on type of booking, i.e current or advance. So you don't get to keep all the booking fee by yourself. I use to pay about $120.00-$160.00 network charges every month.<br><br>That day comfort was in the news about their satellite booking, I can't remember which day was that. it was reported that the satellite booking system has netted comfort $50,000 daily. Can you imagine the kind of money they made, and this is excluding their rental intake for all more than 11,000 taxis. We poor driver drive like hell and did the companymake any effort to help their driver. When the cost increase, they just pass the the cost to the driver.</div>
