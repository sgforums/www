Machine-printed receipt has its boarding time, alighting time, distance, and the extra charges printed clearly. I believe most of the taxi have this.<br><br>Any chance the taxi was called by hotel in advance? Did you inform hotel to get a taxi for you?  When you boarded the taxi, did you notice the meter was S$2.40 or S$2.50?<br><br>Many taxi drivers cheat tourist by saying extra mid-night charge...its only additional 50% of the fare...</div>
