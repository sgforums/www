Unless the hotel can prove that this taxi was within their hotel boundary within the said timing ( by circuit camera ). Nothing has proven that the taxi was within the hotel boundary to support the case .<br><br>Now the scenario is : " The cabby insist the TS has mistaken the taxi number .

If yes you may try writing to PTC. Suggest that next time when you visit Singapore , take Comfort (Blue) , Citycab (Yellow) or the white one. Some taxi drivers are smart &amp; they know wat to do to cheat ppl despite those cab companies mention above are quite perfect.</div>
