Feeling too generous all of a sudden huh? Reimburse JSV then if you want him to at least have any notion of forgetting this whole issue.<br><br>Obviously you've failed to realised this whole issue isn't solely about the money involved.

And to wipe this smear off, I would love to see him being taken off the streets.<br><br>If a taxi driver had overcharged me as well, then I would do everything I can to make him suffer for it. I don't want no bloody cheats plying our streets and tarnishing the reputations of those drivers who are just trying to earn an honest living.<br><br>My dad is a taxi driver as well (Comfort), and he works long hours to put all his four children through university. Even so, I've seen him round down the fares of students and senior citizens who take his cab. And to have the reputation of cabbies tarnished by fare cheats... that just won't do.<br><br>It is not just about JSV crying over spilt milk, but also about preventing good cabbies like my father from slipping and falling on the milk.<br><br>If the cabbie's a cheat, then I say, let's get him off the streets.</div>

Following the driver's denial of the incident, we proceeded to download data from the taximeter of the said taxi.  However, the data revealed a trip from 4.44 am to 5.12 am, reflecting the fare of $25.20/-.<br><br>We then proceeded to check the timing of the taximeter to ascertain if it had been tampered in any way, but found the taximeter to be functioning correctly.  In addition, we were not able to locate any 'Singapore Taxi Fare' receipt book within the said taxi.<br><br>As we do not have concrete evidence against the driver (which is imperative in order for us to prove our case beyond reasonable doubt in court), we regret that we are unable to take <strong>punitive action against the driver for the alleged offence of overcharging.  Nonetheless, the driver has since been warned to refrain from any errant practice, and his vocational licence record has been updated to reflect the occurrence of this incident.  Should the driver fail to comply with our regulations hereafter, we will not hesitate to take more severe action against him. </strong><br>We hope to seek your understanding on this matter, and thank you for bringing the matter to our attention.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br><br>Bus &amp; Taxi Regulation Division<br>Land Transport Authority<br>Singapore<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is obvious to me that LTA is trying to sweep the issue below the carpet and some officer at LTA is trying to cover up.  I have provided copy of the receipt given by the taxi driver . What else they want was as proof ? Simple handwriting comparison will prove my point.<br><br>I have decided to write directly to  Yam Ah Mee - CEO of LTA and  Low Tien Sio - Depoty CEO of LTA as a next step. Let them decide what to do!  Entire org chart of LTA is here<br>http://www.lta.gov.sg/corp_info/doc/org.pdf<br><br>Again it is not a question of Money. Corrupt taxi drivers like this guy are disgrace to the great country of Singapore and its wonderful hospitality.<br><br>LTA should know this issue is NOT going to go away easily.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Does any one know the address /email for Smart Auto? I am sure they do not want this kind of bad publicity either and they should know they have a dishonest taxi driver in their fleet. Their fellow honest taxi drivers ( Some of whom I am sure are reading this forum, can see the pictue of the receipt and decide for themselves, what kind of crook they have among themselves. Smart Auto should fire this taxi driver. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

I bet several drivers are using this on unsuspecting tourists and locals. Any local printing press can do this in bulk or even in small quantities.<br>Print a book for $10 and scam the tourists. Who cares if teh image of Singapore goes down!!<br><br>Most probably Taxi company is not even aware of this scam (Thanks to this forum, now they may be aware of this, if they are reading the posts here).<br><br>Driver did not fill l out all fields. Even in the Lincense plate row, he put in the hotel room number I stayed. When he asked for the room number I stayed, I did not suspect it. I managed to get the license plate number, even though I was in a rush to catch the flight.<br><br>LTA could have simply compared the handrwriting of the driver with the receipt.<br></div>

It was at 4.45AM and dark and hence I might haev misunderstood as blue. However License plate number cannot lie. Also LTA has located the taxi meter data from 4.44AM to 5.12AM!</div>
