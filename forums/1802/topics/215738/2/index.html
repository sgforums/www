            <div class='col-md body'>Dear<br><br>Thank you very much for your message. I have attached the picture of the receipt with this note. (Please see the picture).<br><br>This driver gave me a receipt under the company name  "SINGAPORE TAXI". He tore up a sheet from a booklet and gave it. Apparently no such taxi company exists and this taxi actually belongs to SMART AUTO as per information I got from Singapore message boards. Apparently this taxi driver has printed his own taxi receipts and ripping off several people. Does SMART AUTO know about the SINGAPORE TAXI receipts handed out by one of their drivers? Such taxi drivers are disgrace to clean image of Singapore.<br><br>When I asked for the machine printed receipt, driver refused to give it saying the machine was broken.<br><br>As the taxi was nearing the airport meter showed $14.20 and suddenly changed to $48 at the time it stopped, while I was looking out the window.<br><br>Driver asked for my room number (which was 1421) at Meritus Mandrin and wrote that as the taxi number.( He thought he is being a clever fox). Since I was a foreigner and rushing to catch the plane, I did not want to argue with him and politely noted the taxi number  (SHB 7448R) at the back of the receipt and paid $48 plus Additional $2, (Since I did not have the change) and walked off. Driver also refused to sign the receipt, when I asked for it.<br><br>However it is easy for the investigating officer to find out who was driving that taxi during that time of the day (4.50AM) which is in the receipt and easily compare the handwriting.<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: LTA@lta.gov.sg [mailto:LTA@lta.gov.sg]<br>Sent: Thursday, October 19, 2006 8:16 PM<br><br>Subject: Feedback Reply from LTA<br><br>Our Ref: LTA/BTR/C38.006.01511854/1<br>Date   : 20-OCT-2006<br><br>SHB 7448R<br>FEEDBACK NUMBER:426854<br><br>Thank you for your feedback of 18/10/2006, and I am sorry to hear of your<br>unpleasant experience.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority does not condone any malpractice or misconduct<br>by errant taxi drivers in any incident involving taxi passengers and view<br>all complaints lodged with us seriously.<br><br>In this respect, we wish to inform you that we will be assigning an<br>Investigation Officer to look into your feedback against the specified<br>taxi.

" , then we would say : " On meter " , they just don't stop here , they would continue asking : " Singa Dollar or US Dollar ? " ....... and also they always asked : " For all of us ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>Answers to your quesions are given below:<br><br>a) Date and Times of incident (boarding and alighting time)?<br>&gt;&gt;Oct 17th  2006 Approxinately 4.30 AM( Boarding) and  4.50 AM (Alighting)<br>b) Please email a copy of the fare receipt if any?<br>&gt;&gt; This was already sent to Tan Wee Lee on Oct 20th, 2006.. I have attached the copy one more time.Recirpt said SINGAPORE TAXI . He ripped it form small booklet and hand wrote the receipt with his own handwriting.<br>c) Did the driver switch on the taxi meter?<br>&gt;&gt; Yes Driver switched on the meter. Just couple of minutes before the taxi entered the airport, the meter was showing something like $14.20. when the taxi reached the airport, he was pressing few buttons and suddenly it showed $48<br>d) If yes, how much was the fare recorded on the meter upon arrival?<br>&gt;&gt;  Just couple of minutes before the taxi entered the airport, the meter was showing something like $14.20. when the taxi reached the airport, he was pressing few buttons and suddenly it showed $48. He said he added the night time charge etc and hence it is $48. driver refused to give the machine printed receipt. he said printer is broken.<br><br>h) Anything else do you wish to state?<br>&gt;&gt; During the ride taxi driver kept asking me questions like whether I am new to Sinagpore etc. I guess he decided to rip me off when he realized I do not know t he local culture taxi rates etc,Driver asked for my room number (which was 1421) at Meritus Mandrin and<br>wrote that as the taxi number.. Since I was a foreigner and rushing to catch the plane, I did not want to argue<br>with him and politely noted the taxi number  (SHB 7448R) at the back of the receipt and paid $48 plus Additional $2, (Since I did not have the change)<br>and walked off. Driver also refused to sign the receipt, when I asked for it.<br>He is not only ripped me off. But also the taxi company by keeping pre-printed receipts like Singapore Taxi<br><br>i) In the scenario that driver refutes the fine and claims trial in<br>Court. Are you prepare to testify in court if required to do so? If yes,<br>Please let us have your particulars eg. Name, NRIC and address etc.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Sir. I am in United States of America. Does LTA expect me to come to Singapore for this spending additional US $2000? If LTA is &gt;&gt; willing to foo tthe bill, I  will be happy to vist Singapore again!   Alternatively, I can talk to you or the judge over the phone, if needed or if you can schedule the case when I come to Singapore next time, I will be happy to testify in court.<br>&gt;&gt; My address :<br><br>From: Sent: Friday, October 20, 2006 1:17 AM<br>To: 'LTA@lta.gov.sg'<br>Subject: RE: Feedback Reply from LTA<br><br>Dear<br><br>Thank you very much for your message. I have attached the picture of the<br>receipt with this note. (Please see the picture).<br><br>This driver gave me a receipt under the company name  "SINGAPORE TAXI". He<br>tore up a sheet from a booklet and gave it. Apparently no such taxi company<br>exists and this taxi actually belongs to SMART AUTO as per information I got<br>from Sing apore message boards. Apparently this taxi driver has printed his<br>own taxi receipts and ripping off several people. Does SMART AUTO know about<br>the SINGAPORE TAXI receipts handed out by one of their drivers? Such taxi<br>drivers are disgrace to clean image of Singapore.<br><br>When I asked for the machine printed receipt, driver refused to give it<br>saying the machine was broken.<br><br>As the taxi was nearing the airport meter showed $14.20 and suddenly changed<br>to $48 at the time it stopped, while I was looking out the window.<br><br>Driver asked for my room number (which was 1421) at Meritus Mandrin and<br>wrote that as the taxi number.( He thought he is being a clever fox).

Driver also refused to sign the rece ipt, when I asked for<br>it.<br><br>However it is easy for the investigating officer to find out who was driving<br>that taxi during that time of the day (4.50AM) which is in the receipt and<br>easily compare the handwriting.<br></div>
