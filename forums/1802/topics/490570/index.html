              Pirus is hybrid. japan make, Almera is fully Tomyam make, in the pte market, low volume in selling it.
                  
              Pirus higher hp, Almera, weaker and take more petrol.
                  
              At $116 and $71, different is $45.
                  
              Given both travelled the same distance per day, 300km, Almera may hv to put $15 extra petrol than Pirus. Now the different is $30
                  
              Pirus cab, can sweep, can take call, can Q at taxi stand
              
              Almera grabcar can only wait for call, given the saturated market in apps riding, i would say that grabcar actual serious competitor is themselves and Uber, taxis is secondary. Unlike previously start, where there are high incentive given as promotion, fewer cars, today, it is getting larger and larger by the day, and calls will become more diluted among the apps drivers themselves.
                  
              However, Prime needs a big deposit, and contract is in years.
                  
              Final verdict. ...Pirus

              After appealling, 
              
              We found that subject wanted to drive taxi is his right, but we advised him, driving taxis is like marrying a wife.
              
              First time no drive before, tiam tiam want to drive, hand very itchy after having the TDVL, see taxis like very beautiful, feeling good.
              
              Then after awhile, like after many sex with wife and get to know each other in and out, the driver will feel the same, sian liao, everyday same shit, different arshole only.
              
              Then as time goes by, see the steering wheel also sian liao, tiam tiam want to lim kopi, eat and buy 4D, due to lack of social activities, become pui pui, weak weak and ai koon ai koon.
              
              Thereafter, think of throwing key and go outside and work, but think back, can work or not, now got so much freedom, go back to work, seibei jialat one, so carry on driving and cursing till I arrive with my van to pick him up.
              
              Final Verdict: If Dun drive dunno what is taxi driving, go drive, then throw key, at least can experience it.

              <p>Those who have tried full-time taxi driving for at least 6 months know the pros and cons of taxi driving and therefore could determine whether it is better to continue driving or look for another job. Â But this is also dependant on how much one can earn as a taxi driver and how many hours one can stand per day.</p>
              <p>Good jobs are not easy to find for 80% of taxi drivers (80% are 50 or above). Â Young chaps likeÂ <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">Muhammad Hasnor Hashim</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">Â Â </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">also definitely would continue driving taxi since he is making very good money (but most are not like him).</span></p>
              <p>Pros: Â No boss (and superiors) to nag at you and hinder you, don't have to kiss ass, dont have to deal with office politics, lots of freedom, got one car to use and no one overwrites you and takes away your profit (unlike in sectors like property agent, renovation, sales jobs) and not a humiliating job even for PMETs (need more face ex-PMETs could choose to drive black or white cars), can work until age of 75 if one is healthy enough, Â can ownself adjust number of hours to work per week according to one's needs and health when one is old (work as weekend relief or 1-day weekday relief, 8-12 hours day relief or 8-hr night relief or team up with another old driver (and another night/day relief) to work just 3-4 days per week) plus would not be forced to work overseas. It is also a productive system whereby if you work hard, you get what you deserve; you would not be hindered even if your relief/hirer driver partner is lazy or unhealthy.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Cons: No CPF, no holidays, no bonus, no medical leaves, must continue to pay rental if don't work, long working hours, must be responsible for accidents, damages Â and fines, higher risk of dying from overworking and must pay rental even on Sundays and public holidays, suffer income losses when need to go for servicing, when car malfunctions or meet with accident, must pay some rentals if need to use super-reliefs if hospitalised or go for tour and cannot be lazy or take too long or too many breaks otherwise would make less money (for most lunch break is just 15-30 mins).</span></p>

              <p>No one forces you to work until age of 75.... you only work until 75 if you want to and if you could still pass the medical exam by then. Â Most people would have paid off their housing loans by then and would have already have grown up kids who are working.</p>
              <p>However, if you retire at the age of 60, you may not have enough money for old age or find it hard to pass time since you are used to working long hours and even working on public holidays.</p>
              <p>Where got need to Uber or rely on grab? Â Old bird could survive purely on street hailing even if don't have calls from MDT. Â  One stretch of time few months ago, I went for 2 months almost without servicing MDT calls everyday and was making "good money" ... so you all old birds sure even more no problem especially since many of you were "kings of street hailings" before switching to "kings of MDTs" and "Grab Rangers".</p>
