              <p>Excess lah not assess, bro</p>
              <p>Go check your insurance card, see how much your excess, some can be as high as 5k</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>EXCESS IN A MOTOR INSURANCE POLICY</strong><br> <br> <strong>Q: What is excess?</strong><br> A: Excess, also called deductible, is to the first amount of the claim 
              which the insured has bear.  If the insured has an excess of $500 and 
              the total repair costs $3,000, then the insured has to pay $500 while 
              the insurer pays the remaining $2,500.<br> <br> <strong>Q: Why should there be an excess?</strong><br> A: The insurer normally imposes some excess as this would serve as a 
              form of co-insurance.  With an excess, the insured would tend to be more
               careful because if a claims occur, the insured also has to be out of 
              pocket and contribute towards the claim.  In general, the higher the 
              excess, the more careful would be the insured and hence the lower risk 
              of having a claim.<br> <br> <strong>Q: Very often, I see terms such as Excess: $500 (Section 1 only).  What does the æ��ection 1 onlyï¿½ mean?<br> </strong>A: Your insurance policy is divided into many sections.  Section 1 
              normally covers own damage claim.  When you buy a Comprehensive motor 
              insurance policy, you are covered for own damage, ie if your own vehicle
               is damaged, you can get the insurer to pay for the damage, whether or 
              not you are at fault. <br> <br> Thus, Excess: $500 (Section 1 only) means the excess applies to an own 
              damage claim only.  Take this scenario: If the insured hits another 
              vehicle and his own vehicleæŠ¯ damage is $6,000 and the third partyæŠ¯ 
              damage is $8,000, then the excess of $500 shall only apply to his own 
              damage, ie he pays $500 and the insurer pays $5,500 for his own damage 
              of $6,000.  For the third party claim, the insurer would pay the full 
              amount of $8,000.<br> <br> <strong>Q: In some cases, I see terms such as Excess: $500 (Section 1 &amp; Section 2 separately).  What does this mean?<br> </strong>A: Section 2 in the policy, on the other hand, deals with third 
              party claims.  So if there is an excess on Section 2 as well, it means 
              if there is any third party claim payable this excess shall apply. <br> <br> Using the same example above, the insurer pays $500 and the insurer pays
               $5,500 for his own damage of $6,000.  For the third party claim, the 
              insured has to fork out also $500 while insurer would pay $7,500 for a 
              claim of $8,000.<br> <br> <strong>Q: What if I see: $500 (All claims).  What does this mean?<br> </strong>A: It means the total excess applicable for every accident.  Using 
              the same example above, the insured pays an excess $500 while the 
              insurer pays $13,500 (the sum total of $6,000 and $8,000, less the 
              excess of $500).<br> <br> <strong>Q: Is it common to have excess for æ��ection 1 &amp; Section 2 separatelyï¿½ or on a æ�‚ll claims ï¿½ basis?<br> </strong>A: No.  Such excess is not common.  The insurer would normally 
              impose such excess for special cases, eg when the vehicle is a high 
              performance or luxury vehicle or when the insuredæŠ¯ profile is not 
              favourable.</span></p>
