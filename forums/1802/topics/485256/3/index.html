              TD unions is more of a social Unions, if you got school going childrens, it is good to get back to sch vouchers, bursaries, scholarship, hardship grant,  NTUC fairpirce discount coupons and personal insurance.
              
              When it comes to companies or medical issue, they hardly can settle..why? Because TD unions are sponsored by Taxi companies.

              Every companies got their own policies, if not sure, can ask, my understanding is that for some companies, changing cabs or upgrading use different contracts, therefore the deposit is not portable, that mean, cannot transfer, they need you to sign a new contract and so on.

              Remember, in Taxi driving, there is no such thing as long service or loyalty even if you drove for a company for 30 years, they can alway ask u to fark off and you can also throw key.
              
              30 years of driving and decided to change cab with the same company can be the same as a newbie just entering to sign a contract, so if you dun understand, can ask, if ask already, still dun understand, then dun sign, be bus or casket drivers, and if still still dun understand,...I recommend you my Bro CT..he can make your under stand.

              Frankly speaking, limo and MPV drivers are mostly people who want to work less and earn the same as normal..more like lazy driver..but not all of them, however, the pressure of rental and at times wondering around empty can be siao especially for those who like to work and have pax in their cab with meter running, careless if got surcharge or special disposal rate.
