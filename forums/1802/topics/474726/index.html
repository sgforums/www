              <p>like me!"</p>
              <p>i was down this normal road in the west then i saw a 
              pax at roadside looking the other way, so i horn lightly then she turn 
              around and wave me.</p>
              <p>after she board, i was just about to ask her 
              why look the other way, is it for cab...then i saw just in front got 
              this big black Toyota Picnic stop in lane 2, about 1 car space from the 
              lights..driver door open. car looks ok no problem.</p>
              <p>there is 
              also a Sonata with pax, half body on lane 3, half on lane 4, car also 
              look ok..and i think the Picnic driver is standing in front of the 
              Sonata taking a phone videoing the Sonata!</p>
              <p>he is like 50s. and dress casual smart. but he look very angry and shouting.</p>
              <p>just nice the very nearby traffic light turn red so i stop and open window a bit hear.</p>
              <p>that
               Picnic Driver was shouting  something like this.."that the Sonata dont 
              know what is give way ah?? the Sonata only a Taxi..how come he dont know
               to respect Private Car Owners?? how can he drive like he own the road 
              when it is Private Car Owners who pay big money for their cars and the 
              roads?? Taxi is peanuts, rent only, not your own car!..want to 
              challenge? come on! will make the TD lose his license and rice bowl! if 
              the Taxi dont know his place on the road and in the society, then dont 
              blame him for takaning him, to teach him a lesson! how can the TD almost
               cause accident to his new car which is a few hundred thousands..and the
               TD afford or not!?"</p>
              <p>Then all the time, the TD is 2 hands holding 
              the steering wheel, looking a bit scare scare. the pax (i think is whole
               family) inside also sit quiet. after some time, that Picnic Driver go 
              back slowly to his car, still half scolding half gesturing.. the TD also 
              turn into lane 2, but stop directly in front of the Picnic before the 
              lights! i notice the TD keep looking back into the rearview wor..</p>
              <p>after that lights green i drive off liao, dont know what happen next..what do  everyone think ah</p>

All road users has their fair share of contributing to paying the various taxes and therefore should be treated equally. Nobody should claim to be a king of the road. The principle of right of way shall prevail. If a driver has the right of way but still slow down a give way, this is fundamentally a gesture of goodwill.

              <p>In an accident, if you are in the wrong, you are liable.  What car you drive is immaterial.</p>
              <p>The more successful u are, the more humble u become cos u always think that you are not successful enough. </p>
              <p>It's those half past six axxholes who think that they are successful just because they have something that others don't. That's why they remain where they are cos they think that they have "arrived" and become complacent.</p>
