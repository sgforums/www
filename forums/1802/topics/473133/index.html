              <p>TransCab <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Cabby takes woman to wrong place -- then demands $5 to fix mistake</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/sites/default/files/public/styles/sgseen_featured_image/public/article/images/featured/2013/08/cabmain.JPG?itok=U0vos69d" alt="" width="462" height="280"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">STOMPer Grace says this taxi driver not only failed to take her to the correct destination, he also tried to charge her an extra $5 to take her to the right place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">According to Grace, the cabby was also rude and confrontational during the ride.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The STOMPer wrote:</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"This is regarding the very bad behaviour of a Trans Cab driver.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"On Aug 5, I made a taxi booking with Trans Cab, and SHD5745K, a red-coloured vehicle, responded. The trip started at 2.26pm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"I told the cab driver my destination was Great World City. However, after traveling halfway, I realised the route taken was slightly different and that it was taking longer than the usual route that I usually take, so I asked the driver if he was taking a longer route.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"The first time I asked him, he did not give me a reply. The second time, he said in a harsh tone,' when you directed me out of the place, there was only one way out'. So I said okay then.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"Five minutes later, he stopped outside Vivo City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"I was furious. I told him that I clearly said that my destination was Great World City and he took me to Vivo City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"At this point I told him that I would get off the cab. He then told me that he would lodge a police complaint against me saying that I boarded the cab and refused to make payment, threatening me by saying that he had all my information since I had made a booking.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"At this point, the cab fare was around $17-18.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"So I made him an offer saying, okay then, let the meter stop and take me to Great World City and I would drop the matter.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"He said 'No. You have to top up an additional $5. If not I wont drive you to the location and you get off here'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"I asked for his name and he said very rudely, 'There is no need for me to give you my name, you just take down my taxi number'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"He continued by saying that 'When you lodge the complaint, I can argue with the company or police saying that you spoke inaudibly and said Vivo City and Not Great World city, and I can further say that why would I be so foolish to drive you to the wrong location? "</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"All of these was said in Mandarin.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"I was already very late for an important job interview, and this particular driver still refused to budge or apologise when he is in the wrong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"So I had no choice but to agree and let him take me to Great World City with the additional $5 charge making it $22.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"It is very frustrating that Trans Cab is allowing this kind of driver on the road. Taking a cab is meant to be a pleasant and enjoyable experience and yet this driver is making it troublesome for me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"The entire journey the cab driver was rude and unreasonable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"It is wrong that he took me to the wrong destination, and he even refused to apologise, insisting that he is right and that I was the one speaking inaudibly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"I would like that Trans Cab do something about this serious matter."</span></p>

              <p>During my course, I had a coffee chat with my lecturer and he foresee better prospect for local taxi industry. ..comparable to London cabs..</p>
              <p>Hope it would hhappen. . But when you see such articles,  you would think how long is it going to take.. Of course,  passengers must be of London cabs type..willing to compromise lah...</p>

              <p>Bro Bowah, why do we need LTA if they care more on violation of traffic, mo;est, thief and breaking of laws when we have TP and SPF?</p>

              <p><br>I thot LTA is higher than TP in regard to road safety and laws. TP is only a watch dog, LTA set the rules and laws. TP make sure people follow, and SPF is of course will get involve once it is a criminal offence.</p>

Then I will use my big grin and ask, hello, good afternoon, how is your day?? then press the meter, after the exchanges of greetings, then ask, and where can i take you? Mostly pax will said "Oh.sorry.eh, temasek poly uncle"</p>
              <p>Then I replied jokingly, "Uncle not from temasek poly lah, I sex 2 only"</p>
              <p>"Temasek poly is near??..Tampines? right?"</p>
              <p>Pax replied "yes yes uncle, you damn funny..hahaha"</p>

              <p>Pax replied, "Sure Uncle, you turn left infront, go all the way to SLE then exist woodland ave 2, from there go all the way, I will guide you further..."</p>
