              I will like to take this opportunity to qualify the safety of drivers along little india, it is not just a mere stirring up, we need to protect ourselves, because if these few days, one cabby go knock down another ah neh or ah bangala, whereby the sentiment is still high, thing can get nasty again. 
              
              So, we need to be caution and play safe, of course best is not to ply those road if possible, fark care smlj calls, boycott them also good, which is the safest.
              
              The govt is trying to calm the situation, but safety for motorist and people going there is still an agenda that need to be discuss and not taking it as a shame or stirring up issue, of course with a first world govt, they will alway wants to erase such images as soon as possible. 
              
              For I know, indian, bangala, pakistan, sri lankan are formerly like us, under the british rules know as one country call the East India Company. After the brit left, independency start to evolve, therefore there is a mixture of people in each of these country, Bangala and Pakistan are muslims, some indian are also muslim, sri lankan got more hindu and buddhist.
              
              I was told that there is no pakistan workers here due to their terrroism nature, but there are of course pakistani tourist and talents here, Bangala never grew moustache, indians mostly hv moustache, as for Sri Lankan, they are more quiet and courteous due to their minority nature and perhaps, brought up.

              Little india formely was a nice place to go, not until foreign invaded the place, all hell break loose,
               funny how, with our strict traffic rules all over singapore, only little india do not control it, red light also cross, many jaywalkers, dash across, vehicles park here and there, 
              
              you do that in Chinatown or orchard, sure kenna summon kao kao, and then, those shops there can sell their product until the roads, town council or MP of that place also dun care?? In HBD heartland, you sell abit out of your shop only, kenna warning liao.
              
              These are brewing signs of trouble. No matter how you want to bred an indian culture there, this is still SINGAPORE INC, not India.

              <p>sorry Bro Bowah I  respect you but, I do take offence to your comment above. You generalising Pakistani people ( I am one of them) and labelling them to have terrorist mindset which is not correct , would you like to generalise Chinese people perhaps as "drug addicts mindset" or thai people as "prostitute mindset" and the list goes on.</p>
              <p>Let me clear this to you that the reason why Pakistanis don't like to work here is that they are pretty much aware of the crook employers and their terms and conditions and would not commit to such "slavery" there are plenty of other countries where one can make better living.</p>

              <p>sorry Bro Bowah I  respect you but, I do take offence to
              your comment above. You generalising Pakistani people ( I am one of
              them) and labelling them to have terrorist mindset which is not
              correct , would you like to generalise Chinese people perhaps as
              "drug addicts mindset" or thai people as "prostitute mindset" and
              the list goes on.</p>
              <p>Let me clear this to you that the reason why Pakistanis don't
              like to work here is that they are pretty much aware of the crook
              employers and their terms and conditions and would not commit to
              such "slavery" there are plenty of other countries where one can
              make better living.</p>

              Labelling is general in the sense, Singaporeans are also labelled as kiasee, kiasu and nosiy eaters, malaysia are also labelled as with $$, Malaysia Boleh.
              
              Pakistani do not work here is not because of employers, it is MOM decision, MOM decide to engage which country, not even laos, or vietnam, but maybe soon, as for talents, no issue, all pakistani and viet are welcome, in fact the world if you got talent to bring about prosperity, peace and harmony for this country, but if you are here with a problem instead of solving the problem, then, you are not welcome.
              
              We take as what it is, the mess in pakistan tell lots of stories, in my contract marine oversea repair job during my days , any jobs that is pakistan, the allowance can go triple, otherwise no one wants to go, not even the muslim colleagues.

              Let be logic here, in general meaning we look at it at a general perspectives, if your neighbour is noisy type, in general you feel every one inside the family are damn noisy, but once you get to know them, maybe only the son and father are noisy, the wife is ok and gracious.
              
              However, that give us a general feeling, and it good to hv it so as to take precaution and safety measure when visiting them or engaging them. I hv to be frank when I worked in karachi with missle and bullet flying out of a sudden, and why employers are willing to pay me 3 x to go pakistan tell a lot of stories. Sorry if I offended you, but my concept remain, it is not a safe place.

              <p>yes....its the govt mindset and protocol.</p>
              <p>same thing for PR applications.... HK, taiwan, malaysian and prc all got chinese...but different standards apply to them when they apply for PR.</p>
              <p>hk often linked with triads....so their applications need to go thru more levels of checks, esp with ISB.</p>
