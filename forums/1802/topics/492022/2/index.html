              If you attended the safety driving by TP, I attended because want to reduce by 22 points...cam Flash is a part of a safety driving. TP said, sometime you drive on highway, lots of vehicles but still moving, and most are driving within the limit or just at the limit, the cam will also FLASH, and you wonder...who ar who kenna...but you notice all are driving at the limited speed.
              
              So TP told me, as there are many vehicle, the flash is just a warning to all to slow down and maintain limit speed, because whenever you saw a flash, you will slow down, no matter what speed you are in, and that is what they want, it is just a safety warning, but if the flash piak piak twice in quick succession...ah...

              Lanjiao road like portdown, where got cam one, got once, a LTA even asked me how to get out of the place...lols
              
              Look gentlemen, Cam is not something TP will anyhow erect, it is a cost to erect and maintain and more chores for TP to keep reading it, on the other hands, our TPs are also short handed, not much local youngster want to be TP, few already die in road accident.
              
              The red hot cam is at bugis, Victoria, lornie, near schools, hospitals...

              When come into junction, try to slow down abit lah, then use the 3 arrows cum 3 seconds rule lah, you notice almost all junctions in singapore got 3 arrows painted on the road.
              
              if you reached the first arrow, traffic light signal green slow down abit, 
              
              if you reached the second arrow, traffic light still green, chiong all the way liao, if second arrow traffic light is amber, brake
              
              If you have reached the third arrow, whether traffic light is green or amber, chiong liao
