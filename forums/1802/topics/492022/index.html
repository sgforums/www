              Which instructor said that I would like to see him.?
              
              the rear wheels of my car just crossed the line without even going to the middle part of cross juction,appealled still no give chance 12 pts n $200.
              
              TP definition of beating traffic light is:as long as the rear wheels crossed the white horizitonall line considered beat traffic.

              If want to see photos, the officer said, under de laws, to view an offence TP cam photo, you must get lawyer or get ready to pay bigger fine, because PHOTOs are TP property, not yours. Some show it to you is just to stop your argument only.
              
              Every cams on the road are calibrated differently due to junction length, space, and location. Once red light is on, it will trigger the camera, object passing by will trigger a snap from the camera on a wide angle view that is adjusted by individual TP personnel, so that is why some junction, you get snap but no letter..understand bo!!!

              Since kenna snapped, there is nothing much can be done, just train yourself to look poor, pathetic and think of a plan so that when letter come, you appeal, then on appeal date, you go now office, act poor. 
              
              Very simple only,...like me, 
              
              Wear old slipper, big old trouser, abit torn off old shirt, messy hair, no jewelleries and watches, no hp and look poorly literate (low education) but still got good manner.
              
              First is greet, bow and apologise, 
              
              Second, admit the offence and ask for leniency by saying house got 3 young kids, one housewife, 2 old parents, one with diabetics, another with prostate cancer, one old grandfather bed ridden...or said whatever sad thing you can think of.
              
              Third, said no money, need  drive to feed many mouths..ownself also got high blood, hypertension, high cholesterol ..every other high stuff.
              
              Mostly, the officer will give chance, then later when you out of TP office, change to Armani shirt, Uniqlo pants, rolex watch, iphone 8 and so on...

              when you last time go change your family particular at TP, that is when you get yr licence or taxi licence only... as for health, it confidential, they will not know.
              
              The idea is not about making a statement, yes, I agree if you make a statement (black and white and saved), or declare your demerit points, you better dun lie, 
              
              but now is begging for leniency mah, it is about individual livinghood and poor family mah,  then see if the officer tolong you or not?
              
              Dun tell me you kenna summon, just go and pay,,,,at least make an effort to appeal and wait lor, then when time come, do your best acting skill, afterall, life is a movie
