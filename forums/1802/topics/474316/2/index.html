              <p>Anyway, I am a casket cum taxi driver, to be F1 is for the rich, not a sport, because not much people sweat except the driver who are paid millions and promised super star gf.</p>
              <p>People have misaligned what really is sport (if you google it again),</p>
              <p> it had become a rather dollars and cents, from football to table tennis you name it, unlike last time (yr favorite quote), today sport are much riggered and for F1, it is a business operation, just like Cdg and all other taxis companies..whoever won, all get a share of a big pie,</p>
              <p> if not why the loser keep coming back, even you get last, you are also a millionaire and can go on to Singapore grand prick, korea grand prick and so on without elimination.</p>
              <p>And to add salt, because these organisers knew that there are lots of million and billionaires got too much money and need to spent it somewhere.</p>
              <p>How the history evolve from a true sport till today a multi billion business is totally out of sportmanship. This are all what call westernisation effect, since young, too much hollywood movies, too much macdonald, too much western jeans and all those super singers, naturally locals get americanised or britishnised, and that is also how the west brain wash asian, thru media, thru movies, thru hot music, and money generating sports like F1 and pro football.</p>

              <p><br> You believe in google, you believe totally in what the net say? If
              net got people like you and me around, you better think twice
              before believing it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am a casket cum taxi driver, to be F1 is for the rich,
              not a sport, because not much people sweat except the driver who
              are paid millions and promised super star gf.</p>
              <p>People have misaligned what really is sport (if you google it
              again),</p>
              <p> it had become a rather dollars and cents, from football to
              table tennis you name it, unlike last time (yr favorite quote),
              today sport are much riggered and for F1, it is a business
              operation, just like Cdg and all other taxis companies..whoever
              won, all get a share of a big pie,</p>
              <p> if not why the loser keep coming back, even you get last,
              you are also a millionaire and can go on to Singapore grand prick,
              korea grand prick and so on without elimination.</p>
              <p>And to add salt, because these organisers knew that there are
              lots of million and billionaires got too much money and need to
              spent it somewhere.</p>
              <p>How the history evolve from a true sport till today a multi
              billion business is totally out of sportmanship. This are all what
              call westernisation effect, since young, too much hollywood movies,
              too much macdonald, too much western jeans and all those super
              singers, naturally locals get americanised or britishnised, and
              that is also how the west brain wash asian, thru media, thru
              movies, thru hot music, and money generating sports like F1 and pro
              football.</p>

              <p>F1 don't start off with rich people and most sport don't started with that either....</p>

Having not seen a grand prix victory since 2006—and following B-team Super Aguri’s withdrawal from F1 earlier this year under similar circumstances—Honda’s decision to pull out of the 2009 season comes as little surprise.</p>

              <p>PRC mentality on google and facebook is good because it never want a total american influence on it society, what is F1 and baseball, but as long as it can make money, welcome, they are not going to stop shanghai F1, do they?</p>
              <p>And without google and facebook, the nos 2 biggest economic is still moving, what happen to US of A, civil servants budget not approve?? strike? stop work? it is going to cost US more lost on their GDP, and today, traders are scrumbling stocks and us bonds before it gets burnt.</p>
              <p>Jap is a total different story, where is Audi manufactured, where is volvo manufactured, where is VW manufactured, beside those smaller plants around the world, China, a land that evade google and facebook is the largest manufacturer of all these conti cars.</p>
              <p>Jap being under the umbrella of America after WW2, what can they do? take in baseball, open auto manufacturing shop at america, free trade for america, beside culture, more or less hv to follow the american, and after opening so much manufacturing plant in US, what happen, all collapse because of high cost, move to thailand, because cannot move into China, and that is where they lost their market, now you know why the french and german are good to CHINA? because of BMW, Audi, VW and Airbus business.</p>
              <p>You dun get too much americanisated, it is no more a powerful house economy except it NYSE, which are run by jews, who make tons of money to sponsor their motherland, the Israel.</p>
              <p>You think LKY look at google and said, oh, I believe what it write and all those shits, you know where is wlkileak? now if singapore is to shut down google, they will do it, but because of our economic more ties to US with lots of stake at hand including arms and US militants present here, what choices do singapore have?</p>
              <p>Therefore do not take nets info at face value, evaluate and judge by yourself, the angmo will alway talk good about themselves, they will find ways to dig Asians out of both money and mindset, then they will later enjoy themselves at barbados with cuba cig and latinas big boobs girl.

              <p>Economically speaking, if you look at the cycle of economic flow, if the west are up, like in the 80s, japan will boom, but the rest of asia will go down.</p>
              <p>So inorder to for west and japan to go up, they must make asia down, and in 1997 finanicial crisis, what happen, asia economy was moving like a train, and the west uses money issue to bring the whole asia down, which is the financial crisis, are we asian the one who did it? no, it the jews, in doing, the west boom, and then suddenly 911 come into the picture and the west get stalled, and after 911, China boomed all the way.</p>
              <p>Jap and west till today still cannot overturn the economic in their flavor, so they use hollywood movies and game like F1, tennis and golf to penetrate into Asia so as to keep their influence, and also in hoping to cope another downfall in asia economy, but today, they are not facing thailand, malaysia or Singapore, they are facing China, a total different picture whereby the Jews, the US and the Jap got no anwer to it?</p>
              <p>Then they start to use google to penetrate China in hoping to make China people get westernized, but China knew what is coming, they block it off.</p>
              <p>Now if china is to pull out their US treauring bonds out of US, US of A can go bankrupt</p>

              <p>Do you know what china call google? goo ker</p>
              <p>China open it economy under with free trade agreement, its understand the impact of american, if given too much space to their starbuck, macdonald, KFC, Google, facebook, GM motor and so on, China will loose it grip on it citizen getting americanised and end up instead of holding a communism culture, it might go into a revolution again and fall on the american way of ruling, and that is exactly what happened in the mid 21 century that led to china civil war.</p>
              <p>To get Google out, is a stab on the westerner on it influence, because google not only give information, but more so, it bring about westerner culture into it new breed of citizens.</p>
              <p>And as I said earlier, westerners after losing it colonisation grip on Asia, and had more or less spent their money earned from years of colonisation, now need a new route to influence asia which china do not buy it, so is Dr Mahatir</p>
              <p>But being under a APEC and APEX economy bound, to reject google, they have to another way to force it out indirectly and that is where what you wrote above is the reason for getting google out without a violation of their economy and trading treaty.</p>
              <p>And this is written by google, face value, but the underline of it is not so simple and easy to comprehend unless someone like me can explain to you, and that is why i use to say, you believe in Google?</p>

              <p>FI is a social recreation $$ sports, not those we run on the school and army track and field type of sports, in fact everything can be call sport as long as it is a challenge, same goes to horse racing, dog racing, and F1 car racing.</p>
              <p>So each definition deviate greatly, I do not term it as sport, as some may said, you not sporting leh, so what, if a track with the same kind of drivers, same car makers going around the world challenging each other on this and that tracks, sometime you win, sometime I win, end up all win $$.. you call that sport, but not me.</p>

              <p>FI is a social recreation $$ sports, not those we run on the
              school and army track and field type of sports, in fact everything
              can be call sport as long as it is a challenge, same goes to horse
              racing, dog racing, and F1 car racing.</p>
              <p>So each definition deviate greatly, I do not term it as sport,
              as some may said, you not sporting leh, so what, if a track with
              the same kind of drivers, same car makers going around the world
              challenging each other on this and that tracks, sometime you win,
              sometime I win, end up all win $$.. you call that sport, but
              not me.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.4em;">Formula One drivers are some of the most highly conditioned athletes on earth, their bodies specifically adapted to the very exacting requirements of top-flight single-seater motor racing.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">All drivers who enter Formula One need to undergo a period of conditioning to the physical demands of the sport: no other race series on earth requires so much of its drivers in terms of stamina and endurance. The vast loadings that Formula One cars are capable of creating, anything up to a sustained 3.5 g of cornering force, for example, means drivers have to be enormously strong to be able to last for full race distances. The extreme heat found in a Formula One cockpit, especially at the hotter rounds of the championship, also puts vast strain on the body: drivers can sweat off anything up to 3kg of their body weight during the course of a race.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Physical endurance is created through intensive cardio-vascular training: usually running or swimming, although some drivers prefer cycling or even roller-blading! But the unusual loadings experienced by neck and chest muscles cannot be easily replicated by conventional gym equipment, so many drivers use specially designed 'rigs' that enable them to specifically develop the muscles they will need to withstand cornering forces. Strength here is especially important, as the neck must support the weight of both the driver's head and helmet under these intense loadings. Powerful arm muscles are also required to enable the car to be controlled during longer races.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">In terms of nutrition, most F1 drivers control their diets in much the same way as track and field athletes, carefully regulating the amount of carbohydrate and protein they absorb. During race weekends most drivers will be seen eating pasta or other carbohydrate-rich foods to provide energy and give the all-important stamina for the race itself. It is also vitally important that drivers take in large amounts of water before the race, even if they do not feel thirsty. Failure to do so could bring on dehydration through sweating - not surprising given that the physical endurance required to drive a Formula One race is not dissimilar to that required to run a marathon</p>

              <p>As I said, it can be a sport in the eyes of the beholden.</p>
              <p>As we breed and cultured, we all hv different school of thought, everything also exert physical attributes and preparation, even cooking contest, fashion contest and children art contest and so on.</p>
              <p>How you define it (which you alway choose to take google) is up to individual, like for me, I take google as a tool, a reference, but certainly, not a one information centre that represent everything.</p>
              <p>I guess posting here over F1 over our differences lead to no value by it nature, let take it as a different view, perspectives and culture. gum bo?</p>
