              I would said that the injection of Uber and Grab had in a way, make up the whole mess in our taxi transport system. Normal our ruling party, aka PAP are very strict and structural in any system within the boundary of Singapore, but somehow, they still unable or not willing to put the current transportation mess right, that is very unusual of them.
              
              The reason for not interventing could be, they really want Taxi driving out of Singapore

              All along, SG taxi was never considered public transportation. Cannot use bus lane, cannot stop at bus stop and ERP must pay.
              
              So we already know PAP policy makers have been waiting for the past decades for taxi apps to flourish, then slowly reduce taxi company licenses to just CDG, SMRT and Transcab. Yellow tops will slowly disappear.
              
              Temasek linked taxi app companies have been filling in many commuter's needs so it is good. By reducing the taxi population, they got more COEs to sell to an ever increasing number of new citizens.
              
              But they cannot totally remove the traditional taxis because there will always be the professional crooks, murderers, robbers, scammers, bankrupts and drug pushers who have no education and depend on the traditional "no questions asked" taxi, AFA's anonymouse HIV screening, legal brothels, kopitiam ah longs, private 4D, private turf club bookies, horse racing match-fixers, soccer match-fixers.... too many lah. Singapore got a billion dollar shadow economy consisting of all kinds of illegal trade.

              Govt is playing a double head snake policies here, what can we do, they got that 70%++ mandate to do it, yes we are considered as a public transport because TD serve the public, but a much premier public transport that give one the luxury of privacy and at the door step.
                  
              Today, we are talking abt driverless car, smlj is taxis? even car sellers/agents are now getting threatened. Such disruptive innovation will kill off companies/organisations and occupation who are still swimming in a well of boiling water.

              <p>Not important enough, because S$50 million from City Harvest Church is what can feed tens of thousands of pioneer generations that buy rice from NTUC or Giant. A technical recession is hardly the problem here in Singapore because if a recession is here, spend more time at a temple or a mosque then.</p>
              <p>Ever since Lehmann Brothers, the economic boom has practically been driven entirely by a pseudo optimism about China economy. In other words, the boom happened because of people that neither believed in Jews nor democracy, so the moment the boom ends and we go back to recession [which was where we came from since 2008] we simply see China going back to being communist. And all this while the USA has been involved with the British in the Afghanistan War that barely ended over the past 14-15 years. If we go by a Western i.e. MIT definition of technical recession, what they are trying to tell you is that the American banks are going bust again perhaps. So if you work at Citibank or Standard Chartered, or are graduating soon and finding work in such a westernised commercial firm, well, be prudent perhaps.</p>
              <p>Now the industry may be the same, however there is a difference between the China Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. If you are already a financial expert I can skip the details.</p>
              <p>:) If you believe in those numbers from Department of Statistics, Singapore practically stayed in pseudo stagnancy over these years since the last recession, our economy grew because Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong put His rank and name beside two integrated resorts that His Jew-advocate colleague Denise Phua said was causing social problems.</p>
              <p>If we didn't have those casinos and hotels, and consequently all those new inventions including MSF, we wouldn't even be considered to have recovered from the Lehmann Brothers recession because the Chinese tourists till hookers wouldn't even have been coming at all, so instead of asking about the technical recession, ask yourself do you still want those PRC hookers and tourists, or not?</p>
              <p>Because if your Asian tourist cuts down their budget, you got a whole bunch of people coming through Bio and Life Sciences over the past decade, so you gotta ask yourself how many new spectacles do you need, or are you willing to lose a leg here and an arm there so that you can keep them economically busy by inventing artificial limbs as a key line of business for our economy because our healthcare system can still absorb loads of sick people now that Ng Teng Fong Hospital also gets running.</p>

              <p>Bro, if they do business within M country, is ok......</p>
              <p>But if they want to serve SG-M business, make sure pricing must be right also......</p>
              <p>Like for eg, 1 way SG-KL, usually is around SGD 600, how can they charge SGD300, of course we know now Ringgit weak mah......</p>
              <p>Than from SG until custom, they simply want to hiong only, without insurance cover, I report them is to safe guard we Sinkies only.......</p>
