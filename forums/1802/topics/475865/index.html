              progressive career scheme for its bus captains which could see 
              Singaporean drivers taking home up to S$3,500 a month, the company said 
              in a release today (Nov 7).<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> The <span class="highlight">SMRT</span> Bus Captain Scheme aims to train
               bus captains to provide better service to commuters and increase their 
              productivity, and includes the restructuring of salary ranges, 
              productivity and performance incentives, as well as a refreshed training
               plan to enable career progression into supervisory positions.<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> Under the scheme, the average Singaporean <span class="highlight">SMRT</span> bus captain will be able to earn up to S$3,500 a month after overtime 
              and with performance incentives — which will be awarded for punctuality 
              and meeting high safety and customer service standards.<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> The scheme was developed as a result of an ongoing collaboration between <span class="highlight">SMRT</span>’s management and the National Transport Workers’ Union.<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> “The ability to retain talent and maintain our staff’s workforce health is key in ensuring that <span class="highlight">SMRT</span> continues to deliver an excellent travel experience to commuters,” said Mr Desmond Kuek, <span class="highlight">SMRT</span> Corporation President and CEO.<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> “The new BC scheme takes a progressive approach to training our bus 
              captains beyond basic driving skills to include service and supervisory 
              skills. In doing so, they can also progress in their careers to drive 
              more complex routes, provide better service, and even move into 
              supervisory and trainer/mentor roles.”<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> The new career progression framework will also set out a clear route of 
              advancement for bus captains into supervisory positions such as <strong><span style="color: red;">Master Bus Captain</span></strong>, which includes group supervisor and instructor responsibilities.<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> “Previously, competent drivers hit their career ceiling after three 
              promotions when they become Chief Service Leaders,” said Mr Ong Chin 
              Ang, Executive Secretary of National Transport Workers’ Union.<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> “We also recognised that there is still room for current wages to move 
              up. By adopting the Labour Movement’s Progressive Wage Model concept, 
              the union worked together with <span class="highlight">SMRT</span> management to relook and restructure the scheme to help bus captains 
              achieve better career progression and wages, and ensure its 
              sustainability.<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> “With the new model in place, traditional front-line roles are 
              transformed and bus captains can look forward to training and 
              advancement opportunities to supervisory positions with higher wages.”<br></a> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/local-smrt-bus-captains-can-now-earn-s3500-month"><br> In May last year, <span class="highlight">SMRT</span> announced an 
              upward revision of the basic monthly pay of its Singaporean bus drivers 
              by 35 per cent to S$1,625, which the company said would enable them to 
              take home an average of about S$2,500 each month after factoring in 
              overtime, allowances and incentives. </a></blockquote></div>

              I don't think so it will create more congestion. .. if I hear correctly, its gg to be 6 private bus companies. ..I dont think smrt or sbs is involved. Somemore express type of service.. 
              
              It could be each private company will be in charge of 1 location..

              <p>Gentlemen,</p>
              <p>The intention is to help people moving in and out of CBD, and do not worry, good paxs will still take taxis, there are still many atas people or feel atas people who like to be ferried in privacy.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, think of the good, with their help, we might not need to go into 350km per day, and MOST IMPORTANT..taxi driving will still very much left for SIngaporean.</p>
              <p>Because if paxs keep complaining no taxi no taxi or taxi interview here and there, then how? get salaried foreigner to be TD?? so now they cater buses, and after all, these buses will ferry those pax who lives in Ah woods, ah kangs and ah rongs...what left are good paxs, so now, maybe I can succeed in 13 CBD paxs</p>
              <p>Do not get me wrong, I am not siding the govt or LTA, but if you look at it closely, the motives is good, and also help to reduce taxi population.</p>

              <p>As I said earlier, cleaner paid is going to go up, security guards is also going to go up, so is bus driver and so on. This is no joke, if employer cannot pay the mini, licence will not be renew for them to do business, in another word, there will be a minimum wage for different sector.</p>
              <p>So now is left TD, still the same, still struggling, still same income, what then, may I ask, is Govt going to do to help this group of people, dun give me the bull about relief one year than can become Hirer, this are bullshit idea just to gather support.</p>
              <p>What we want is how can TD be protected against a backdrop of rental increases, high fuel prices and paxs attacking?</p>

              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has awarded contracts for six City Direct services to five private bus operators under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP).</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">The six routes will operate from Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Batok/Hillview, Jurong East, Sembawang, Sengkang and West Coast to the Central Business District during the morning peak, and in the return direction during the evening peak.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">An LTA statement on Saturday said the new bus services will be launched progressively in the first half of 2014.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">There will be two trips on each service during each of the peaks, with more trips to be added depending on demand.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">Ren Quan Transport won the Ang Mo Ko contract at $1.13 million and the Sengkang contract at $1.28 million.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">ComfortDelGro Bus Pte Ltd took the Bukit Batok/Hillview contract at $0.9 million, and Loh Gim Chong the Sembawang contract at $1.16 million.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">Transtar Travel Pte Ltd clinched the Jurong East contract at $1.45 million.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">The West Coast contract went to Woodlands Transport Service Pte Ltd at $1.23 million.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">The total value of the contracts is about $7.16 million.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">LTA said the contracts for three other services -- Bedok, Eunos and Hougang -- weren't awarded as there weren't enough valid bids for an award to be made.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">A new tender for the three services is expected to open by the end of the month.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">LTA said with limited stops and the use of expressways, journey time on the City Direct services are expected to be comparable to that of taking a bus or LRT and transferring to the MRT into the city.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333;">Under BSEP, private bus operators are being roped in to supplement the services of public transport operators to ease peak hour congestion and waiting time.</p>

              Bro, it's not that they can't solve... it's just that they do not want to chop off TD jobs whichis the only trade meant for spore citizens. .. do you really think they can't solve it...
              
              If the above implementation caused congestion,  they can do it in taxi stand I/o bus stop.. anyway, taxi stands are empty...
              
              Bukit panjang mrt will be up soon... and yes, ppl will say breakdown lah.. but anybody really know the reason for the breakdown? They are already working on it...
              
              Like I mentioned, just drive honestly and be otr for 8 solids hour.. td can still make it one.. but just felt sad that some chose other methods and pull the rest into shit hole..
