              Taxi drivers are not like food selling business whereby you can sell 10 plates at one go, TD can only serve one pax at one time, and if that pax sent you to far north...good luck to you.  So, it is very much depend on Luck, nowaday, you can grab or take call with destination, use it wisely to your advantages. 
              
              And when the going get tough, go home sleep, dun waste your time on tough period.
              
              The statistics had shown that many taxi drivers are now returning back to be hirers instead of being relief, OMO had increased in the last year to 11,000 drivers, this trend happened because of the need to have flexibility in driving so that you can gain from both peak period, and with more apps and calls, as OMO, you are more in control and able to earn more within a shorter period of times.
              
              This is also in line with Govt and taxi companies hidden agendas. In a right condition, taxi companies prefer more hirer and less relief, more relief becoming OMO is good because more taxi will be rented out, and as for govt, by inputting mileage rules, they expect OMO to ply on both peak period then 2 men operation, moreover, getting relief is difficult, so might as well go OMO.
