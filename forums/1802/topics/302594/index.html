I am 38 nia leh bro .....<br><br>My advice : Go on with your plan .<br><br>Got one taxi license won't die in Spore one .<br><br>Becoming a cabby now , without experience , indeed is difficult .<br><br>Plan A : Take a license , then start off with something light , as in part/time Fri/Sat or Sunday .<br><br>Learn-As-U-earn ....<br><br>Upon completion of 3 months , then u judge yourself on where u stand , are u ready for Full-Time ? U judge and feel the taxi market ...<br><br>Got potential ?<br><br>Are u a fighter or not ? U judge ur own fullest character , after 3 months .<br><br>If u learn the trade now , think of the prospect of Singapore Flyer , Sentose IR , Universal Studio IR , MICE , F1 night race .... etc .<br><br>Mice is good , those conventions , exhibitions , one shot come 35,000 , and one shot 35,000 f*ck-off from Spore .<br><br>When got Mice , chances to go Airport from town is as good as up 50% chances .<br><br>Hey , i forgotten about Terminal 3 , remember A380 ? First has been launched , the first in the world , i think we'll have 18 of them !!!<br><br>Once at Airport , with a single A380 landing , one shot 250 taking taxis .<br><br>Go town hotel .... most likely .<br><br>Well .... Singapore will be indeed one buzzling city .<br><br>With those IRs ..... 14 million targetted tourist each year for instance , u'll have like how many chances to get a customer ?? With only say like only 20,000 cabs in Singapore on the road each day ?<br><br>My math no good , u go and count the ratio !!<br><br></div>

Spore Expo got what sales ?<br><br>The arrival time in Changi Airport .... T1 consists of which flights , T2 consists of which flights , etc etc etc ... All can be found inside the internet !<br><br>And while on the road , u'll learn the trade happenings at Geylang also .

But enough time to realise that you have to really enjoy driving to like the job. No point looking at how much taxi can earn if you cannot tahan driving or worse if don't like driving at all. And mind you, you are not always talking about smooth auto transmission petrol car here... some old crown taxi are in bad state....<br><br>Anyway, yeah one wed night i was lucky with good connections and made $120+..... but that is one off...... I drove last night again and made much less...a lot depends on luck (although Poolman will disagree)... like last night after queuing at clark quay... the pax wants to go to fort canning hill...@#$#@!<br><br>and 2 times I picked paxs at novena square, the paxs want to go national skin centre (just behind) Q@#@!<br><br>Overall, I am still enjoying taxi esp Fri/ Sat nite... but much more if I spend less time looking for pax<br><br></div>
