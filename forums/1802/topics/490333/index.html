              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Rental for sure must pay on time. Between Hirer and Relief must not have money-related issues. Else relationship will turn sour and unhealthy. I am Hirer therefore I sure pump FULL TANK but I have known some relief's smelly patterns that they don't pump full tank m*ther f*cker! If top up fuel also wanna cheat sure will cheat other more stuffs also. Most important between Hirer and Relief isÂ </span><strong style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRUST!</span></strong></p>

              That meaning Old uncles are better, more chin chai, easy going and also responsible.  heard hirer or relief saying, finding a good relief or hirer is more difficult than finding a wife.

              OMO can drive, why cannot, one man hired out the cab leh, not 2 men mah.
              Just that OMO no life, old faster and up lorry faster. My bro KTC was an ex OMO driver, that time he kiam ah long, kiam OCBC&lt; kiam Amex, casinos..so OMO, now he looks very old but still very howlian.
              
              He drivse OMO got various reason, then with a fark up how lian character, who want to partner him, the whole singapore Taxi drivers also know him. Siam all the way.

              <p>I have been to many countries. I cannot imagine retiring in any Western country except America. I never take taxi overseas, either rent cars or take the subway. USA is still the best country with the best government. Their licensed gun culture, licensed prostitution, established pornographic economy, combined with relative safety on the streets and the presence of extremely intelligent people is something I cannot find anywhere else. Even the children of international criminal gangs send their kids to study there and not here.

                      diligence la. Must agree with terms in who wash the car etc all or

              <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19.696px;">Responsible<br> 1. Do not give last minute notice when not driving.<br> 2. Top up fuel tank to full or pay by mileage litre price<br> 3. Keep vehicle clean both internally and externally<br> 4. If scratched vehicle or bumped somewhere must inform, don't
                      quiet quiet then kenna discovered. (Ever kenna a*Shole* like that
                      before)<br> <br> Easy-going as in don't be so calculative or aka Chin-Chai la. Must
                      learn to give and take depending on some situations and
                      circumstances sometimes. I used to have an old uncle as Hirer and I
                      was his relief. Sometimes he can be late to handover taxi to me and
                      at times when he doesn't wash, he will pass me more $ cos I need to
                      go queue to wash. So both of us give and take and workout happily
                      till he had some issues and couldn't drive no more. (Probably
                      health or eye-sight related, I wasn't updated on this)</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Those above are after leanring from some TD Lao Jiao about the standard protocols to prevent disagreement and unnecessary quarrels between Hirer and Relief. Works well for alot of uncles and their relief so I better follow. It's just a matter of time than to find some relief who does not follow protocols then more issues and soured relationship. Aiya, you won't understand one la. Anyway, we all have different opinion about chin chye and give and take so let's respect one another's opinion ya?

              <p>I think most of your points is being protective of yourself, there's no standard protocols in taxi partnership......</p>
              <p>If so difficult to find a relief in your area, than you must work out something to better the rest of the hirers around there......</p>
              <p>Too standard, relief obviously don't like especially your area, your area can be consider a prime area for TD, close to town, that's why relief will be very demanding, unlike area like ah Wood or ah Jurong......</p>

              From a relief perspectives, I only find malay hirers and older aged hirers better, those lower middle age hirers who really need to make a living out taxi driving as the sole bread winner, will tend to be more strict and demanding. Maybe they are too stressed.
