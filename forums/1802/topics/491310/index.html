              <p>This one depends on whether there are hirers living in the same block or near your block and what companies they rented from.</p>
              <p>Most likely, you are not ready to become a hirer (especially OMO hirer) so it is better for you to start as a relief.</p>
              <p>It is easier to find a hirer if you join Comfort.</p>
              <p>However, I heard Transcab offers better rental rates after rebates (but not sure about it) so you could be saving on rental if you partner with a Transcab hirer.</p>

              Thanks guys. I guess not much choices for me atm as I just gotten retrenched. 
              So thinking of driving taxi for time being first. 
              
              Am thinking of either premium taxi and SMRT. Both no deposit needed. 
              CDG need even $1000 for relief right? Guess just have to bite the bullet and chong longer hours. 
              
              Thank you.

              <p>From age of 45 onwards, very difficult to find good jobs.</p>
              <p>Many jobs in the market with nicer sounding titles are not salaried jobs so income is not stable.  In other words, jobs like property agent, renovation sales coordinators, financial adviser, insurrance salesman and many other sales positions without base-salary are jobs that could essentially waste your time for many months and still make you poorer (you have to incur expenses but many not get anything/enough back).</p>
              <p>Though it may be true that some of these jobs's upper limit is very high (like property agents could earn more than 1 million a year) but the median (not average which is distorted by the people who make a lot) salary/profit is actually quite low.</p>
              <p>The way I see it is "earning more than 1 million as property agent is like striking Toto".  If one despires for a job with a high upper limit (like CEO or earn more than 1 million commission), then one could just spend $14 per week or $728 a year on Toto to balance it out.</p>

              <p>Once you switched over to being an entrepreneur, tasted the life of not having a salary and yet making more and having more free time for yourself - there is no turning back.</p>

              <p>There really is many money to earn from businesses you see
              around. The most important question is which one suits you, and
              whether you are prepared to tough it out for a year. Passion is the
              key. The next is understanding local laws and how police think and
              operate. There is no such thing as a 100% legit government or
              business. Law abiding or not, frequently depends on whose side you
              are on. Very simple - police can carry guns, we cannot. So whether
              things are legal or not, depends on who got the bigger cannon - aka
              the government.</p>
