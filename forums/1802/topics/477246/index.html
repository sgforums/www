              Aiyo, its is more on individual ego and preferrence lah, dun take, other take lor, with current newer fleets of taxis rental over $130++, what choice do we have? All taxi companies already do their sum liao, they know what hirers are looking for, and all of them actually are one cahoot, but different system only, and if you are too calculatives, it is hard to judge, mere differences could be a only a few dollars.
              
              So, let take rental and jump out of the picture, the next is to look at the services, the vehicle power, the vehicle reputation and also also individual liking. As long as you are song, every day see the cab also song, then take lor. 
              
              Cabby drive renault said i40 better, i40 driver said renault better, pirus said chevy better, chevy said sonata better, wish said pirus better, then got this skoda said it is the best of all..lols, human mah, tends to compare and see other good, and taxi companies completely understood that, that is why they come out with all kinds of prices, vehicle and system for you to pick and choose.
