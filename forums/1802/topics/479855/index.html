              <p>Of course not all will be successful depends on the offense la.</p>
              <p>But here's some:</p>
              <p>TP is of course the hardest.</p>
              <p>LTA ERP is the easiest. Normally in a year you can appeal 2 ERP - normally ah.</p>
              <p>Here is the ranking of hard to easy to appeal.</p>
              <p>1) TP (red light camera and speeding/moving offences)</p>
              <p>2) URA</p>
              <p>3) LTA</p>
              <p>4) HDB</p>
              <p>But TP parking 1 year 1 time you got a chance. Red light camera you can forget about it. Speeding also next to impossible. However moving offences, you can appeal, go see the officer, sometimes can come down to lower moving offence, say you kena 9 points can appeal to careless 6 points.</p>
              <p>But TP and LTA don't play, due date means due date, you go over you have to go ATOMS and pay, usually more, miss that - court case. As long you send an appeal before due date, it's ok, the summons is on hold.</p>
              <p>Advice, 1st send appeal via email or in writing. This is will take around 1-2 months. If rejected go down and see officer, if he/she reject can still ask for further deferment to pay.</p>
              <p>LTA can appeal in writing, if rejected go down and see officer, maybe can cham siong a bit. For ERP high chance.</p>
              <p>URA quite hard, but sometimes if you go down you play hardball a bit - state your case and your rights (you must have some grounds), they can relent a bit.</p>
              <p>HDB - if you got many, go down see officer, sometimes they can give chance cancel/waive 1 or 2 if you settle the rest.</p>
              <p> </p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Now when appealing these points to note:</p>
              <p>1) If you got another pending summons - for TP and LTA especially - go clear that 1 first.</p>
              <p>2) Always put the blame on somebody else, not on yourself - pls la don't say stomach ache. And dont say dog run across your path pls. Make a genuine reason - pregnant lady story is out too - unless you really got a pregnant lady willing to back your story up. Say your father mother sick, wheelchair bound pax etc. Death is the best excuse.</p>
              <p>3) Admit your mistake when appealing for waiver. Don't be a yaya papaya - you are the 1 asking for something not demanding. Although I have actually use very harsh terms once and got a waiver, but I had good grounds and was prepared to pay the summons - never thought successful but in the end it was. (This was because I said I would pay and write to the highest levels to let them know what happenned). This you can only do when you have good grounds, dont anyhow threaten, you can be charged for criminal intimidation, so be careful. The best is be humble.</p>
              <p>4) Road conditions, explain if in your favour, you parked in a deserted road at 3am and kena summons, of course mention this - traffic was nil or very light, lighting was good, you caused no serious obstruction - all this you can mention</p>
              <p>5) Dont blame others, dont go say officer only summoned your vehicle and not others. The law doesnt work this way. Eg if say got 20 cars parked illegally, what would I do if I was the officer - summon the first and last car normally.</p>
              <p>6) if you have a good record - state it.</p>
              <p>7) Beg for a last chance and promise not to do again - admit your mistake, admit the officer was right, important to explain the officer was right and doing his job and you were wrong despite whatever reasons, but ask for compassion.</p>
              <p>These are some points, important is NEVER to take a chance and fight in court. Remember most traffic offences are strict liability meaning yes or no. No such thing as you beat the red light because you had an emergency, question is did you beat the light, yes or no? Very simple. You only fight in court when there's a grave injustice and you are definitely right and have witness or evidence to prove it. Other than that do waste time. TP quite and the others too, will not want to charge you in court unless it's a serious offence, better to pay the $300 composition than go to court. The judge wont listen you and give double or triple that, worse still, license can be suspended.</p>

              <p>Got this 1 Lakeview member, soembody was telling me, mati mati want to fight the case in court despite TP wanting to end it at composition level. Good luck to him.</p>
              <p>Whether fair or unfair, these are the rules, you want to see the video or film, you gotta pay for it.</p>
              <p>In ths case, I belive he insist the TP was wrong to book him for a moving offence, want to challenge in court. When a policeman goes to court and swears under oath this becomes evidence. To win, you gotta to prove 1 of 3 things, a) he's lying b) he has bad blood against you or c) he was mistaken.</p>
              <p>And another thing, in a traffic offence any oral admission is admissible in court - that means if at the scene the policeman ask you a question and you admit - game over, he go to court and say on this day and time, he admit to me his mistake - your case has collapsed. No need to a written statement or confession unlike criminal case. Remember sorry is an an admission - the moment you say sorry and ask him for a chance means you are admiting to the offence.</p>

              <p>So thats some of the tips I can recall off hand, good luck.</p>
              <p>1 other thing for about taxi drivers and LTA taxi offences. This I cannot advise much due certain oaths I have made before.</p>
              <p>But there's 1 thing I can advice - if you admitted or found guilty, dont be agressive talk nicely or write in properly, usually they are preapred to lower the charge. The enforcement team might be out to get you, but the investigation team is not like that - they usually will help, most are retired police officers or from other civil service depts like the army etc. Some are serving policemen. IOs usually want the case to end at their level not go to court, so ask for ligheter charge or ask to waive 1 or 2 and you will plead guilty to the more serious one, they will normally entertain.</p>
