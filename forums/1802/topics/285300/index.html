(roll eyes) uncle replied.<br><br>She called and say that the boss say its alright if i dun pick them up.<br>so i just tell the uncle what they have told me ,<br>immediately her friend called again and say sorry &amp; ask me go pick them up.<br>so i tell the uncle stop at the taxi stand which is less than 500m and pick my friend up.<br><br>" eh sorry hor, get down the car la, i dun want to drive you le, " he shouted at me and pull down his cab at the side of the road.<br><br>obviously i was shocked la. i stared hard at him<br><br>what really pissed the hell out of me is that he point at me and say ," go compliant la my car plate no. .......... get down la"<br><br>My friends was still on the line. so she heard the whole conversation.<br>Zzz i was like less than 500 m from them only .<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br></blockquote>My point is this.<br>Is it wrong to ask the taxi driver change here and there but it's still on the way down.
