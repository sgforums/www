              If not registered relief, you need to go office with a hirer to register as cdg relief driver, paid 1k, then can come 3rd floor to find me.
              
              If registered, 10minutes can start liao. You need to provide IC and name to hirer for verification, he will register you thru driver portal. 
              
              If you want, u can pass me your IC.

              No lah, the one who drove get into an accident (touch wood) is responsible, be it relief or hirer, 
              
              Let me take on own fault (meaning the TD admitted wrong), he shall paid 1,800 if first time, and $2,000 for second time, however, if both time occur in a year, his contract will be terminated. This apply to cdg.
              
              If own fault, relief is the driver, he must report and paid the penalty, the only sway for hirer is that he gets no earning for few days or even a week if the damage is serious, even if he complain to cdg, cdg will tell him, he is the one who get the relief, not them.
              
              In reverse, again if relief is the one get into an accident, but not his fault, cdg will go after the other driver insurance, they will claim addition lost of income for hirer, can be 100 to 150 per day of downtime, that amount goes into Hirer account, not relief, whether hirer want to share with relief or not, it up to him, again, he is the one who get the relief, not cdg.
              
              What ever happen, each must be responsible for his action, be it relief or hirer, however, when come to corresponding, cdg will alway first call the Hirer...hello, ah siao, your cab SHxxxxx ready for collect at Loyang

              <p>Bro bowah, in fact what you say is correct, only problem is whether the relief is farked up or hirer farked up only. but still all points to hirer. haha. CDG or any Taxi companies will look for hirer.</p>

              <p>Its not accident. It's the part when the super relief rammed the vehicle likes a sports car and then send to the workshop when the hirer is away. So when the workshop make a check that the vehicle was damaged due to own damage and not wear and tear, all fingers point  to the hirer. The relief gets away easily. Hirer must go after the relief and if the relief pays is OK but if he plays dirty , the hirer lppl must pay.</p>

              They do register, but they are not that strict in term of discipline, due lack of audit as listed company requirement, locals taxi companies like TC and premier runs on their own managment policies that can tweat and change easily, and that created double or triple standards, favouritism and so called bo standard system.
              
              However, having said that, companies like TC and others that do not hv to answer the public shareholders, they are more nimble and swift in their management, meaning that they can adjust better to the changes in taxi industrials, unlike cdg, they need to hold meetings, AGM and executives committee to approve certain changes, and therefore they are less flexible, more strict on their system and that is why, end up more stringent on their drivers.
              
              So, there are pro and cons in how you look at the taxi companies, if you are a law abidding person, straight and no hanky panky type, cdg is good for you, but if you those not bothered by rules and laws, able to curry flavour inorder to work your way thru and dun not mind sub standard or double standard decision of management, then , TC or premier etc suit you.
