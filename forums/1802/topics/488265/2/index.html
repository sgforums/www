              Brother brother, sorry to say.. do you know that because of you,
              many other TDs like me, J007, my ah fool and so on suffered more.
              You are driving a normal cab only, not even limo or uberX, and if
              you are going to serve pax so nice and allowed them 5 destinations,
              these farkers will start to think and spread around that Singapore
              TDs can go 5 destinations and still kowtows here and there, then
              when my ah fool or me refused to take them, they complaints here
              and there...so please dun spoil the market.</p>

                  Frankly speaking,  as TD if you insist to have dignity,  then sorry to say you better quit.  
                  Driving will be miserable. . You will keep arguing with pax . Lower your dignity but does not mean you agree with pax instructions 100%. My mentality knn send you fast and fuck off fast. ..time reach. ..end shift . Safety,  avoiding traffic fines and making  $ is the priority.  Dignity put aside

              <p>Tell u another story.  One time oso fetched one knnbccb ABNN couple.  Asked them any preferred route, they  dun want to say.  Then go my way lor.  Knn, halfway asked me why go by this way.  I said ok, now which way u want to go.  They replied, "now u go this way, oso no difference".  Then I continued my way lor.</p>
              <p>Nearing their destination, shout at me "Hello, LIM X X, you know what u doing anot? You want to cheat me, earn extra $2, you will lose $200, you know anot?"</p>
              <p>Knnbccb, limpeh kept quiet.  Reached Liao, fare about $12+, limpeh straight off meter.  Say, "No charge.  U no need to pay me". You should see the shock on the wife's face. They think we all TD very gian one.  Always out to cheat them. Then ccb husband say, " What? no need pay? I got conscience ok?"</p>
              <p>So, I say, "just pay ur usual fare then". They paid $12 and farked off. KNN, limpeh not hardup over your money. $12 big deal arh? They can keep their money and shuff it up each other's farking ass. </p>
              <p>So you see bro decent, u are not alone. We all face such issues some way or other.</p>

              sentosa cove pax are one of the worse kind. NO TIP one.</p>
              <p>Please la brother , drive CDG doesnt mean you have to kowtow to
              pax . You can go and ask Mr Yang , he will tell you Customer is not
              ALWAYS right.</p>
              <p>When you kena this type of pax , no need to be polite , show
              your displeasure to the max but not to the point of being rude.</p>

              refuse , the pax will tell me yesterday that uncle can U-turn , why
