            <div class='col-md body'><p>Drive taxi or limo is not suitable for all people. Many people who never hua taxi before, cannot understand the frustration of a no show, or fare cheats, or chasing money from corporate accounts or from own kaki sabotaging due to being a kiasu. Whatever job we do, must always be mentally prepared. Never let a stupid pax spoil yr day. Easier said than done though. Drive taxi or limo seems so easy, but can be very complicated also. Its too bad those born into riches cannot understand. Only their parents, those rags to riches kind, will show us compassion. So most likely, this ccb abnn was born into a rich family and her behavior shows that her parents never teach her properly.</p></div>

              It is not that her parents never teach her properly, her parents could be the one who teach her to act like this, because her parents, as paxs, can be more worst than her, and since young, she might see her parents and grandparents fark up action towards people in the society, she followed.
              
              India's Indian first lesson in human life is, never let other cheat you, only you cheat other, then you can become rich, the more you cheat, the richer you become, the more you let other cheat, the more poorer you become. So, naturally, they have this protective mentality and end up losing the social norm of human behavorial, by which, everyone is a suspect of cheating

              <p>Any comments fellow TD…</p>
              <p>Everyday I averaged 10 calls .<br>taking bookings have its advantage.<br>I clocked less mileage and the additional income from call bookings helped me to end shift earlier.</p>
              <p>So cannot complaint cdg … After all not bad.<br>a few times also call me to offer me $5 to take call.</p>
              <p>Taking calls have its disadvantages.<br>You cannot reject a few destinations with single trip.</p>
              <p>as a cdg TD, if you want to regularly take calls. ... temper control has to be your traits.</p>
              <p>I passed with flying colours. ...</p>
              <p>Today the topic trip took 1 hour 15 mins…</p>
              <p>Trip start 3.30pm from dempsy hill.</p>
              <p>picked one ccb Indian milf with her mother. .could be from india. .. speak with slang. ..<br>A bit brown Indian. .. not the northern white Indians. .. also not the southern mustafa chennai type.</p>
              <p>Mdm going where I asked.<br>ccb Indian : I going to sentosa.<br>ccb Indian : can you stop at Jones grocery at dempsy hill for me to pick up something.<br>Patient TD : ok mdm</p>
              <p>knn ccb … milf goes shopping for grocery.</p>
              <p>After 15 mins … milf mother boarded my taxi and say go to another dempsy outlet.</p>
              <p>Patient TD : where is mdm.<br>milf mother : she walked to another unit.</p>
              <p>Hazard light on and I drove another 50m. Waited another 10 mins. Milf ccb returned.</p>
              <p>Patient TD : mdm gog to sentosa rite ?<br>Ccb milf : can you go tanglin club to pick up my father? ( in a commanding voice )</p>
              <p>Seems like we singaporens TD is shit to these foreign rich talents.</p>
              <p>Drove to Draycott drive and waited another 5 mins for the father. ..</p>
              <p>patient TD : mdm can we proceed to sentosa?<br>Ccb milf : can you turn right to that Draycott drive condo for me to pick up something?<br>Patient TD : sorry mdm I can only turn left coming out from tanglin club lobby.<br>Ccb milf : then make a u turn <span>ASAP</span>.</p>
              <p>Luon luon luon …<br>i purposely press the meter and see how the milf react.</p>
              <p>Patient TD : mdm sorry the meter trip suddenly. You have to alight here or continue from here with a new trip.</p>
              <p>ccb milf : continue and press the meter but I will deduct $3.70. .. fair enough right<br>Patient TD : fair mdm</p>
              <p>reached the condo at Draycott drive and collect a parcel from somebody and then drove the ccb Indian family to sentosa cove sandy island. Condo .. very rich family. ..</p>
              <p>time took : 1 hour 15 mins<br>fare : $23</p>

              <p>this is serious wrong with the taxi fares structure. Because of such pax that is taking up the taxi unncessary which is one of the reason there is not enough taxi during peak hour.</p>
              <p>if the authority and taxi companies want to address the taxi availability for pax, this is something that need to look into, and surcharge need to charge for addtional stop and waiting. This will then reduce ppl misuse the taxi that cater for general public for point to point transportation.</p>
