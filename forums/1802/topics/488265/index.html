              Any comments fellow TD...
              
              Everyday I averaged 10 calls .
              taking bookings have its advantage.
              I clocked less mileage and the additional income from call bookings helped me to end shift earlier. 
              
              So cannot complaint cdg ... After all not bad.
              a few times also call me to offer me $5 to take call.
              
              Taking calls have its disadvantages. 
              You cannot reject a few destinations with single trip.
              
              as a cdg TD, if you want to regularly take calls. ... temper control has to be your traits. 
              
              I passed with flying colours. ...
              
              Today the topic trip took 1 hour 15 mins...
              
              Trip start 3.30pm from dempsy hill.
              
              picked one ccb Indian milf with her mother. .could be from india. .. speak with slang. ..
              A bit brown Indian. .. not the northern white Indians. .. also not the southern mustafa chennai type. 
              
              Mdm going where I asked.
              ccb Indian : I going to sentosa.
              ccb Indian : can you stop at Jones grocery at dempsy hill for me to pick up something. 
              Patient TD : ok mdm 
              
              knn ccb ... milf goes shopping for grocery. 
              
              After 15 mins ... milf mother boarded my taxi and say go to another dempsy outlet. 
              
              Patient TD : where is mdm.
              milf mother : she walked to another unit.
              
              Hazard light on and I drove another 50m. Waited another 10 mins. Milf ccb returned. 
              
              Patient TD : mdm gog to sentosa rite ?
              Ccb milf : can you go tanglin club to pick up my father?  ( in a commanding voice ) 
              
              Seems like we singaporens TD is shit to these foreign rich talents. 
              
              Drove to Draycott drive and waited another 5 mins for the father. .. 
              
              patient TD : mdm can we proceed to sentosa? 
              Ccb milf : can you turn right to that Draycott drive condo for me to pick up something? 
              Patient TD : sorry mdm I can only turn left coming out from tanglin club lobby. 
              Ccb milf : then make a u turn ASAP. 
              
              Luon luon luon ...
              i purposely press the meter and see how the milf react. 
              
              Patient TD : mdm sorry the meter trip suddenly.  You have to alight here or continue from here with a new trip.
              
              ccb milf : continue and press the meter but I will deduct  $3.70. .. fair enough right 
              Patient TD : fair mdm
              
              reached the condo at Draycott drive and collect a parcel from somebody and then drove the ccb Indian family to sentosa cove sandy island. Condo .. very rich family. ..
              
              time took : 1 hour 15 mins
              fare : $23

              <p>SMRT IO very friendly one. They will call you and says pax feedback issue and will listen to your explaination then bo taichi liao. I chase down pax also like that. I just explain what happen and they IO says ok he will explain to the pax.</p>
              <p>They bo simi side pax one lah. Last time I ever complain to SMRT about one of their driver overcharging me. I use grab on a Sat morning to book a cab cos my cab servicing overnight. That CB charge me $3.30 booking fee. I KPKB to SMRT and cc LTA. Also buay jalan. SMRT IO call me says the driver press wrongly and offer me $2 taxi voucher. SMLJ thought I beggar meh. From then I know waste time complain to them. If CDG smelly smelly will give $10 plus their doggie kanna jia liat by master liao...Lol</p>

              <p>some are ok, some are not.</p>
              <p>but in TS case, actually with meter on, its still a paid fare. what TS could do is to narrow down number of stops they need, by saying u need to change shift soon.</p>
              <p>press and restart meter, minus the starting fare is slight loss to TD as the first meter jump comes a bit later than normal meter jump intervals</p>

              As the saying goes, if you want to take calls, prepare to jia kor abit. 
              
              Indian nationalities names must know abit, anything with kaur, Med, Indra, suv, and so on must die die avoid. Usual local indian names are familar with us, the like of s/o and d/o is there, not used in india, and name such as subra, tamil, Aru..and so on 90% locals if not foreign workers working here, foreigner workers are ok steady pax, much better than their Indian ccb richie pax.
              
              Indian become rich is not because of they know how to work or got high qualification, most become rich is because of corruption, therefore in India, as in like China, the rich are super richs and the poor are super poors, and these richs become rich by taking money from their own people.  They depress and exploited the poors of their own country to become richs, and therefore, they have a mentality of wanting to depress others including SINGPORE TDs.
              
              So if can, avoid indian expatriates and their aunties at all cost. T2 got lots of indian paxs, got once, I saw 3 half white indian aunties and one guy pushing their cart full of baggages toward me, immediately I open front engine boots, told them my taxi got problem, sorry, warden ask me to pull out, I act act see here and there, another cab told them to book alphard...lols
