              Cost of everything is always going up, and at the end of this year, more things will go up when water and electrical tariff go sky rocket up. 
              
              Companies employee's representative will argue for high pay increase to match the high cost of living inorder to sustain proper living. 
              
              So, many companies have restructured their wage systems, pay higher but with leaner workforce and work on productivity like automation and robotic.
              
              Driving, be it taxi or Phv, is on the reverse course, and that to me, is dangerous especially for those who are very much in need to support a family, 
              
              as fares decrease, you will find yourself working backward against a higher and higher cost of living. 
              
              On the other hand, as fare decreases, bookings and calls pax might increase, that will compensate the lost of income due to low fare, but if you look closely, 
              
              unlike employees of company who still work on the same job and timing, Taxi drivers and PHv drivers will have to drive longer and harder (due to more calls) to meet their ex target or incentives, 
              
              and all these translate to more health problem and psycho problem such as anxiety and acute hypertension disorder leading to qi Siao and heart attack

              After years and months of wo ha on taxi and phv transportation, I think more or less for a small domestic market like Singapore, it is saturated already, as more initiatives of fares were introduce, it is now more on how it is going to perform.
                  
              Grab have already too many platform of fares, even if you talk about attracting drivers, it is more or less saturated, meaning, that is it, the number are more or less stagnated in this small market, hence, grab start to use their platform to work back on taxi driver again. The " n " turn graph curve applied here.
              
              And Just Grab and Grabshare are just 2 platform they are working toward Taxi drivers.
                  
              And paxs on the other hand, are more or less getting to use to phv and taxi all kinds of fares structure, and some of them are back to taking taxis as taxis are now more easier to get, that is why, there is some improvement in taxi business. Phv will be like pokemon go...come out only, everyone use, then later, people start to get tired of it.

              In fact, most working life is Singapore is hard, people are not afraid of hard life, it is ok, people are afraid of sad life and no life.
              
              Hard life is ok as long as you are happy with it.
              
              For life is like your penis, for no reason, it just get hard.
