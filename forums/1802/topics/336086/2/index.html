              <p>Oh this thread is still alive!</p>
              <p>I really appreciate "special service" when im with my kid &amp; a stroller. And i always tip such drivers &amp; thank them when i board &amp; alight.</p>
              <p>On a heavily drizzling day, my mum had not come down wif an umbrella &amp; cab was already at my destination. Barely 30 seconds, cabby tells me politely tat he's wasting time &amp; money waiting with me. Then for the next minute, he tells me again twice. So, finally I alighted with my toddler &amp; i was heavily pregnant! I hope he sleeps well at night.</p>
              <p>Strangely, ive met the worst kind of cabbies. Maybe im the worst kind of passengers ... who made cabbies wait or irritates them while chatting on my hp ... even replying them that im ok with any route also kanna by cabbies who nag that they hate passengers who dun say their preferred route &amp; then tells them off ... swaaaayyyy lor.</p>

              <p>Is there any excuse for a taxi driver to refuse to take a passenger who carries a pet in a pet carrier(that was me)?</p>
              <p>So I let the woman who was behind me in the queue to cut the queue and to my amazement, he also refuse to take her because of the particular destination. He claimed that it's close to time for change of shift.</p>
              <p>Should I then let another person behind me in the queue ride his taxi? He should have pick his passengers who flag for taxis along the road, not come to a taxi stand to choose his passengers.</p>

              <p>Im always very lucky to get on cabs who are dog-lovers themselves. And I always enjoy the rides cos we would share stories abt our dogs!</p>
              <p>My 2 small dogs will lick their paws &amp; saliva kanna the seat. I always bring along wet tissues if bring my dogs out so will "zi dong" wipe the seat before alighting. Some more, I dun even carry them in carriers. I jus leashed them &amp; cabbies still take me. Heng lor.</p>

              <p> A PUBLIC-SPIRITED taxi driver was commended by police on Thursday for helping in the arrest of a snatch thief.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday at about 8.30am, a Chinese woman in her late 30s was
                  at the ground floor lift lobby of block 45 Sims Drive when a man came
                  from behind and snatched her handbag before fleeing towards Lorong 17
                  Geylang.</p>
              <p>The victim gave chase and shouted for help. Her cries
                  attracted the attention of Mr Ng Choon Sin, who was driving his taxi
                  along Lorong 17 Geylang.</p>
              <p>Mr Ng quickly alighted from his taxi and went after the suspect.</p>
              <p>After a short chase, Mr Ng managed to catch the suspect who was later handed over to the Police.</p>
              <p>The victim's handbag, which contained her handphone valued at $700 and cash of $24, was recovered from the suspect.</p>
              <p>Commander of Bedok Police Division, Assistant Commissioner (AC)
                  of Police, Lim Kok Thai praised Ng for his public spiritedness in
                  aiding the arrest.</p>
              <p>The suspect, a 42-year-old Chinese man, will be charged in
                  court on Friday for snatch theft. He faces up to seven years jail and
                  caning, if convicted.</p>
