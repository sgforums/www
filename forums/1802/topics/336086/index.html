              <p>Anyone swear vulgarities at cabbies for reckless driving and made a complaint to LTA?</p>
              <p>We were on this yellow top driven by this unhappy old cabby who:</p>
              <p>- tune up his radio while im on my hp</p>
              <p>- swerve left &amp; right while driving</p>
              <p>- brake lightly on high speed causing us to jerk front &amp; back throughout the journey</p>
              <p>- pass unhappy remarks that he dunno where the destination is</p>
              <p>- each &amp; every word sounds buay song</p>
              <p>- did not slow down &amp; drove over a hump causing us to "jump"</p>
              <p>We had a 19mths old &amp; 6mths old baby with us. Luckily I held on to my baby carrier &amp; my 6mths baby din "jump" out of the carrier!</p>
              <p>The most stoopid thing we did was swore vulgarities at the cabby. Anyway i made a complaint to LTA &amp; then wonders if cabby could still get back at us for swearing at him? Anyone can advise??</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Muphy's Law says, What can go wrong can will go wrong. the one who wrote with the story.All are on the writer favour.  What about the Taxi Driver side.</p>
              <p>Why must the Taxi Driver be so upset doing it, if he is not upset on some matters why must he show  his anger,  this is all between the writer and the Taxi  driver who know what  inside that cubicle  yellow top taxi room, bystanders like us just listen and forget about it. What can we do here, as my friend above  already said why create an account and write here? again the Taxi Driver. As you know where to make your complain that it. why here and share with us, This kind of senerio every Taxi  you may encounter it. Nothing is special or Breaking News. Ya.</p>

              <p>so far i have asked 1 pax to get down my cab…Wau Pian  GURU cool man
                  like you also cannot tahan. Relax man... as a good Taxi driver you must
                  alway stay cool and tolerate. They alway say Customers is alway right,
                  neh i will tell you.</p>
              <p>My story just last week one lady pax from
                  Buangkok to Singapore Press Holding at Toa Payoh. at about 8.30am
                  weekday. Hey..morning..go by  CTE exit Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 and Lorong
                  Chuan than Braddell road.</p>
              <p>I,  turn around and just smile with
                  her...Why? what wrong...Maybe you encounter  Traffic jam by using this
                  route. What is her reply, You talk Cock i know my way. Wau Pian young
                  lady talking this way,  Ok  can ...you ask for it.</p>
              <p>First CTE many  moving
                  vehicles, Exit Ang Mo Kio Avenue I... Jam... Why? every day shift Taxi 
                  Drivers may know Why? Singaporean drivers very smart know how to avoid CTE ERP
                  gantries. Many will use Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 toward Boundary Road toward other Exits.</p>
              <p>So behind me she KPKB, jumble mumble, the taxi meter somemore keep jumping, somemore Peak Hours...Haha at Lorong Chaun already more than $18. So never alway say Taxi Driver love more longer journey. Maybe i will try out Serangoon Garden Way thing may not be the same to Lorong Chuan.</p>

              <p>Thanks mod for directing me ... im found this forum while searching for "how i can deal with that cabby" ... din realise got specific section to post what ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wah did i step on some tails or wat?? Oh ok i get it ... all cabbies here ah. Wats with me being so free signing up here in this forum? Can post without signing up meh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why cabby so obnoxious ah? We go to 2 destination - 1st tiong bahru to drop something for someone already waiting by the road when we reach there &amp; 2nd queenstown. So why he behaves like that i hv no idea man? His rude behaviour started after 5mins in his cab while im talking on my hp, tune up his radio volumn to drown my voice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What
                                      about the Taxi Driver side? Maybe he's feeling depressed cooping up in a small cabin everyday, hates his job, hates servicing passenger, hates the traffic, hates people cutting his lanes, hates to stop for every freaking traffic light??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What about me?! Talk on my hp NOT louder than his radio, catching up with my frens with our stories, nothing to do with a grumpy old cabby ... so i dun get it! Why he had to bahave like that??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you guys can tell me wats wrong with me or if this cabby hates to be disturbed by passengers talking on the hp or he does not have the right mind to drive thoughtfully since we are with kids?</p>

              <p>honestly, i dun dare to even tell him to drive carefully at that moment. We were on that expressway, high speed, jerking front &amp; back, swaying left &amp; right, I was hesitant about even asking him to drive carefully ... then with 2 young kids, how? Ask him to stop us on expressway ah ...</p>
              <p>By the time, he reaches lower delta exit, very close by to my frens house in tiong bahru already ... then tiong bahru so close to my house ... aiya i tot i can quickly reach home already so bear with it ... some more buay song to tell us off not to expect him to know wheres the block ... crazy! We din even ask him if he knows, we were looking out for the block ourselves &amp; directing him all along ... siao one.</p>
              <p>Final straw was when he went over a hump without slowing down, just when we are nearing our destination. We just lose it!</p>
              <p>And strangely, his licence is no where to be seen in the cab. The car plate number is stuck on something on both side of the car's interior &amp; the numbers cannot be seen at all cos block halfway. When we are back home then realised the receipt he gave was tore while its printing the cab numbers .. fortunately i captured his car plate number after alighting.</p>

              <p>no worries, im not offended. Free speech here mah ...</p>
              <p>It is true tat I generalised these grumpy old cabby cos they are generally very very old &amp; grumpy, obnoxious, watever. And generally, most cabbies are polite, civilised &amp; professional.</p>
              <p>Generally, in a month, i take 2 cabs per day for 24 days at least so i have a good stats to generalise them.</p>
              <p>After all, here's one place i can vent my frustrations. Dun tell me I come here to praise cabbies ah? i prefer to show my appreciate by tipping them instead.</p>
              <p>Aiyo all those cabbies not here now ... sure kanna flame tmr ... haha ... aiya, im jus a general passenger who hates very very old, grumpy &amp; obnoxious cabbies. maybe i shd find a thread where the passengers are ... *siam*</p>

              <p>Let me ask you, If a Tree without wind or monkeys do you think the tree branches where sway left to right.  Either Paxs or Cabbies. just without spark how come there is fire. Life go on, nobody are in the losing end. We don't make this world, we just try to live in it. Peace on Earth. Just the half an hour or more in this small cubicle Taxi room what a big deal througout the journey...ya</p>

              <p>Anyone swear vulgarities at cabbies for reckless driving and made a complaint to LTA?</p>
              <p>We were on this yellow top driven by this unhappy old cabby who:</p>
              <p>- tune up his radio while im on my hp</p>
              <p>- swerve left &amp; right while driving</p>
              <p>- brake lightly on high speed causing us to jerk front &amp; back throughout the journey</p>
              <p>- pass unhappy remarks that he dunno where the destination is</p>
              <p>- each &amp; every word sounds buay song</p>
              <p>- did not slow down &amp; drove over a hump causing us to "jump"</p>
              <p>We had a 19mths old &amp; 6mths old baby with us. Luckily I held on to my baby carrier &amp; my 6mths baby din "jump" out of the carrier!</p>
              <p>The most stoopid thing we did was swore vulgarities at the cabby. Anyway i made a complaint to LTA &amp; then wonders if cabby could still get back at us for swearing at him? Anyone can advise??</p>

              <p>I don't swear vulgarities directly at the cabby in the worst circumstance. At most..... I will just ask him to stop, pay my fare and walk off...</p>
