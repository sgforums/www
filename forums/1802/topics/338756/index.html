              <p><strong>Idea No. 1: Surcharge waiver ez-link card</strong></p>
              <p>I REFER to reports that commuters will soon be able to use their ez-link cards to pay taxi fares.</p>
              <p>I suggest taxi companies consider waiving peak-hour and CBD
              surcharges for the sick and disabled who rely heavily on taxis to take
              them to places of treatment such as hospitals and dialysis centres. The
              Land Transport Authority and EZ-Link could incorporate in the ez-link
              card a feature to waive taxi surcharges automatically. The surcharge
              waiver ez-link card, which would be similar to the concession ez-link
              card for senior citizens and minors, would be issued specially to the
              sick and disabled. When they used it to pay taxi fares, no surcharges
              would be levied during peak hours, regardless of location. The
              Government would give the taxi companies rebates for the waived
              surcharges.</p>
              <p>Take the case of my elderly mother who goes to the Kidney
              Dialysis Foundation in Chinatown three times a week for dialysis. Each
              time she completes her dialysis, the taxi peak hour is about to start.
              A trip home, which normally costs $4.20 to $4.80 during off-peak hours,
              easily sets us back another $5, making a total of about $10.</p>
              <p>Taxi peak-hour surcharges have added another financial
              burden, on top of the medical and dialysis fees we pay each month.
              There is no bus or MRT service we can take between our home and
              Chinatown.</p>
              <p>Another benefit of the surcharge waiver ez-link card is that
              it would cut down on illegal hailing of taxis in the street in
              Chinatown. This is because patients could take their time to walk
              slowly to the nearest taxi stand without having to beat the peak-hour
              and CBD surcharges.</p>
              <p>The surcharge waiver ez-link fare card could also waive other
              surcharges imposed in the future, for example, a fuel surcharge.</p>
              <p>I hope by sharing my mother's experience, the authorities
              will understand some of the constraints faced by chronically ill
              commuters and empathise with them when they have little choice but to
              flag down taxis illegally.</p>
              <p>The surcharge waiver ez-link card would go a long way to help the sick and disabled with their expenses.</p>

              <p><strong>Idea No. 2: Reward those who book early</strong></p>
              <p>A COLLEAGUE recently made a comment on the taxi booking system in
              Singapore. The current system charges passengers a fee when they book
              taxis, either promptly or in advance. While I see nothing wrong with
              paying to book taxis in advance, perhaps the taxi companies could
              consider scrapping fees charged for prompt bookings.</p>
              <p>First, removing booking fees for prompt pick-ups will reduce the
              number of taxis that pick up passengers in inappropriate places. Most
              of the time, these taxis cause inconvenience to traffic behind, not
              because drivers choose to stop there but because passengers choose to
              flag down taxis there. If passengers are not penalised with a booking
              fee, they have an incentive to book a taxi and be picked up in a
              convenient and safe location. Doing away with this booking fee may also
              boost demand for taxis, as they will be more convenient and affordable.</p>
              <p>Second, scrapping the prompt taxi booking fee will also tackle
              the problem of taxis taking advantage of the booking fee and not
              picking up passengers in long taxi queues. Vice versa, with more taxi
              bookings, taxis will no longer form long queues at taxi stands, thereby
              forgoing the chance to pick up flag-down passengers.</p>
              <p>From the viewpoint of the drivers, time spent driving without
              passengers will be reduced significantly, leading to savings in fuel as
              they will be able to pick up passengers via their satellite booking
              system. As the taxi booking process is already in place, there will be
              no significant cost to deter taxi companies from implementing this.</p>
              <p>With the Government trying to create a world-class public
              transport system, taxis should not be neglected as we look at ways to
              complement the MRT and bus system.</p>
              <p>Scrapping the prompt taxi booking fee will make taxis more affordable and thereby generate demand for them.</p>

              actually i think esp in town, calling is not efficient at all... in fact it wastes time searching and detouring to call pick up location... during peak hours, just to move 2 junction may take u 5 or 10 mins....
              
              street pick up is definitely the most efficient in town....just my experience....
              
              calling is only for those ulu areas without enough cabs....
              
              Meaning, if booking in town got no fee, I confirm wont take... currently even with fee, I already see the pick up location first then decide....
              
              for advance booking even worst... u have to forgo many trips 30 mins before the pick up time... that's why without the higher booking fee, me forget it totally... currently even with the higher booking fee, me also usually not take... unless it coincide nicely with my location, rest time etc i.e. the best type is b4 6am to airport type of advance booking...
