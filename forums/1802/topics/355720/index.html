              <p>On last Sat evening, my family and I got into a cab at Harbour Front.  I was with my elder parents and my sister-in-law who is carrying a toddler.  When it was our turn to board the cab, I struggle to load my 3 big luggage and a baby stroller with my dad as we had just return back from batam trip. I was kinda of puzzled why the taxi driver didnt bother to help but i dismissed the thought as I was very tired.</p>
              <p>When I got into the cab, the taxi driver scolded us for exceeding the number of passengers in the cab. As I was sitting at the front seat and apologised for forgetting that we have exceeded the number of passenger.  The taxi driver didnt stopped scolding us depsite of my aplogies.  He went on scolding us for the next 5 minutes.  Then he added on another scolding - he ordered all of us to put on the seat belt in a very rude manner.  He didnt said it once, repeated it many times even when we were in the midst of fastening the seat belt.  I told him tat we were doing it already and not to repeat so many times.  Then finally he managed to keep quiet. </p>
              <p>Within a min or two, we were soon reaching our destination.  As usual, the cab driver should turn in the road name as we mentioned to him earlier but he didnt.  I told him tat he had missed it.  Then he scolded me tat the other way can go in too.  He was at the top of his voice, obviously angry for correcting him.  He didnt even apologised for missing the turn and make us pay for longer route.  My well-tempered dad was very angry and decided to scold him for his lousy attitude.  The taxi driver didnt seem to know what is his problem and scolded us back in a nasty words.  Before we leave, this middle aged taxi driver wanted to changllenge my dad for a fight and said we had damaged his window.  My dad was certainly very furious and we hold him back and quickly got into the lift.  When we reached our level, we still could hear him hurling nasty words at the below. </p>
              <p>Though I have made the report to the taxi company, I just feel tat this taxi driver needs some punishment for this and sent for re-training.  Till now, I feel so angry for the treatment tat we received from this taxi driver who behaved like a hooligan.  If in the first place he felt tat he didnt want to fetch us as we had exceeded the number of passenger, he should decline it and we will understand.  We were just too tired to remember this clause.  I feel tat he shouldnt challenge my dad for a fight as he should know tat he is representing his taxi company.  I cant imagine who will be the next customer tat received such a treatment from him.</p>

              <p>something must have provoked him ....</p>
              <p>most likely after q-ing for so long , u guys got up and said : " Telok Blangah Height " , somemore exceeding the maximum passengers quota .</p>
              <p>I dun believe he hurling abusive languages , might be u just over elaborate .</p>
              <p>Maybe something sarcastic , that really provoke him to be pissed off . I dun believe any taxi driver would do that to spoil his whole day's mood  . </p>

              <p>This are only one sided story, nothing much we can visualise on this picture.</p>
              <p>Like i say, you need to reach home by taxi, taxi driver need to send you home and reward of his service that you pay him.</p>
              <p>Just for that few dollar not as much as $100 for that trip, why he need to show his mighty power for a challenge, he know his consequence if end up with a fight</p>
              <p>The four adults and a toddle, this is  not a big issue that he need to scolded you all, there must be other reasons on top of this that make his head boiling.</p>
              <p>There is another taxi waiting for you at your service, just simply ask him to stop unload all your stuffs at his rear booth, flag another cab and reach home safe and sound, would it be better, why end up in this way.</p>
