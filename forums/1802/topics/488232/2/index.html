              To be frank, once you become a TD, it is very difficult for you to go back to working life, unless it paid 2 to 3 times what you are earning...or that you drove only for a short period.
              
              If you already drove for years, forget it, you can hardly take those discipline and fark up bosses face, or more so, working with younger foreigners who at time, group together and make you a fool. Then you will start to think of going back to Taxi driving again.

              <p>How true. Working for others sucks lah. Working for yourself, you can suka suka work, don't work as you like. But TD is not the best option for those who want to work for themselves lah. There are other options, look around, ask around. There are in fact many options if only we dare to seek it out....</p>

              The direct opposite of opportunity is risk. 
              
              Most TDs are in their middle age or me, in my twilight years, do we want to take the risk again. After kenna conned by govt and many companies, do you think we are not tire of it.
              
              As we work thru our life, we gain experiences, knowledge and skills that no school or University can offer, nor do you hv paper to show. So, in paper chasing society like Singapore, both money paper and qualification paper, you lose out, but that is actually a lost to Singapore in term of our years of experiences and skills going into waste and never get tap on. 
              
              Then as we age, all these turn into Wisdom, people like my bro CT, ex chief, Hammer, taxilime and so on, have lots of Wisdom in them, wisdom is something that each individual curved out from it experiences and knowledge in life, and to them, by a blink of an eyes, they know what you are thinking and what kind of people you are...and that is why, they are also dangerous people and yet, good people.
              
              As such, they, unlike the younger ones, look at thing from many perspectives before undertaking it, therefore, by the ages, the years of working life left and the health, they may not take up a risk that can earn 8k or more per month in exchange for the last few years of glory in their life.

              Got lah, driving taxi can also relax relax mah...
              
              .. it depend on each individual, if you set target too high, every year want to for family holiday in europe, want kids to take so many tuitions, wear nike and mango fashions, too serious in life, call over $100 prostitute, shop at orchard cold storage, hairdo (provide still got hair) at top saloon, only take taxis or worst, drive own car, can live 3 rooms but go buy 5 rooms or worst condo, can eat nasi lemak but choose to eat at swenson or jackplace or Anston...like this...even if you are aeroplane pilot also hey hey chuan until lorong chuan.

              Got retrenched also got paid out mah, must take it as a man, not little problem only kpkp, we the one leg in coffin with nine nails, last time, during the industrial years suffered more, that time, no foreigner..limpek dig and dig..work and work all days, kenna left and right by MNC bosses, cheated by our Govt to give up our kampong house, then end up building jurong industrial, where got canteen? where got dormitory, where got taxi there, with a pathetic paid, hv to care for 4 kids, 2 aged parents + one old in laws, also pass life happy happy mah
                  
              That time also no laws, smlj is retrenchment also dunno, only know kenna fired or cantonses said, fry oily fish liao. All work thru connection one, if no connection, work until die also Lj cannot stand. Then kenna exploit by shop owners who sell are high prices, by ba wang chia who anyhow charge fares, and got their own  set of peak hrs, like when rain, it is consider as peak period liao... no standard one.
                  
              But life still goes on happily and steadily mah, today, knnccb a little bit problem in life only, kpkb liao, fark govt fark bosses liao. Not that I want to say foreigners, which most of us hate to work with or for, 
                  
              But Locals Singaporeans must be able to hv the working spirit mah, no one owe you a living, everything wants aircon enviroment, want short working hours, want freedom in working, want this and want that, demand this and that...lan jiao lah, all silver spoon brought up
