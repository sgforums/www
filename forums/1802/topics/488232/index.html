              <p>Ya lah. That's why I dun want relief. Because I also treat my cab as my personal transport so OMO loh. Want to treat as personal transport yet want relief help them tong rental. These people go fly kite lah. Got relief means equal share in the cab, no more personal. If see no open then better OMO. Cannot have the best of both world lah.</p>
              <p>Even find super relief I also very particular. I only use my personal relief and he is very popular must book him months in advance. Usually is I go holiday to suits his schedule. But really a very nice guy. </p>

              <p>Aiyah James, that's why they become relief wat.  No responsibility, freedom to throw key, no need worry about this and that.  Otherwise, they become hirer already.</p>
              <p>As long as rental Is high, it's a relief market lah...who needs who more..</p>
              <p>It takes two hands to clap lah...Give n take.  If u have a good relief, then must take care of him oso wat.....share benefits, help him earn more..</p>

              First, you must understand the meaning of relief, like you go toilet and relief yourself, relief is mend for giving you the time to rest and relax without much lost to income.
              
              Once you understand the meaning of relief, you will not bother minor issue because at the end of the day, you are relieved, no lost in rental or minor lost only, can be with family, relax and most importantly, preserved your energy to drive tomorrow.
              
              So, minor issue can just discuss and consult each other, if major issue become more and more common, then as a hirer, you can alway ask relief to fark off. 
              
              From a relief perspectives, he or she also do not wish to keep changing Hirer, like one of my neighbour relief driver, he droves almost all the cdg and TC hirer cab around our blocks, now, go out see those hirer also siam here and there, and hv to look for further place to find hirer...why, because of his fark up characters, so end up keep changing hirers until the whole town TD also know him.
              
              Most hirer will alway wish to find a good relief and drive for years or until both up lorry or my van, and this apply to relief too, most relief also like to drive for a good hirer for years, keep changin is also a problem.

              <p>Aiyah James, that's why they become relief wat.  No
              responsibility, freedom to throw key, no need worry about this and
              that.  Otherwise, they become hirer already.</p>
              <p>As long as rental Is high, it's a relief market lah...who needs
              who more..</p>
              <p>It takes two hands to clap lah...Give n take.  If u have a
              good relief, then must take care of him oso wat.....share benefits,
              help him earn more..</p>

              <p>First, you must understand the meaning of relief, like you go
              toilet and relief yourself, relief is mend for giving you the time
              to rest and relax without much lost to income.</p>
              <p>Once you understand the meaning of relief, you will not bother
              minor issue because at the end of the day, you are relieved, no
              lost in rental or minor lost only, can be with family, relax and
              most importantly, preserved your energy to drive tomorrow.</p>
              <p>So, minor issue can just discuss and consult each other, if
              major issue become more and more common, then as a hirer, you can
              alway ask relief to fark off.</p>
              <p>From a relief perspectives, he or she also do not wish to keep
              changing Hirer, like one of my neighbour relief driver, he droves
              almost all the cdg and TC hirer cab around our blocks, now, go out
              see those hirer also siam here and there, and hv to look for
              further place to find hirer…why, because of his fark up characters,
              so end up keep changing hirers until the whole town TD also know
              him.</p>
              <p>Most hirer will alway wish to find a good relief and drive for
              years or until both up lorry or my van, and this apply to relief
              too, most relief also like to drive for a good hirer for years,
              keep changin is also a problem.</p>

              <p>You must understand, ppl become relief because they don't want to be binded by contract. Come and go as they wish.  So dun expect loyalty.  But, there will always be loyal ones too.  Just treat it as a business and be loyal to $$$$ can oredi.</p>
