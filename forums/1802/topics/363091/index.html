However, a recent encounter was extremely serious.<span>  </span>At a busy junction in Orchard Road, while I was trying to turn my car left, a Mercedes cab on my left in a “left turning only” lane practically forced my car out of my lane into the right lane where another taxi behind me had to jam his brakes to avoid hitting into my car. After forcing his way into my lane, the Mercedes cab proceeded to cut all the way to the right lane so that he could get to pick up a passenger! This irresponsible behavior put me in danger and could have caused a serious accident to take place in a busy junction. I understand that Mercedes cab drivers are selected based on their driving experience. However I’m sorry to say that a reckless driver with fantastic driving skills is still a danger to himself and others on the road! Perhaps its time the Land Transport Authority should step in and assess what criteria our taxi companies are using to select their Mercedes cab drivers!</span></p></div>

              <p>Unfortunately, he had the chance that day. And he obviously couldn't be bothered if he had to drive in the wrong direction to get it. Maybe the LTA should consider installing cameras at junction.....</p>
