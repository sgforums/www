              <p>If Amos Yee can do without a lawyer, i can also do without
              property agents, insurance agents and doctors. I have not seen a
              doctor for years. I self medicate with prescription medicine that i
              bought myself - not thru doctor or polyclinic hor (i got training
              so dun try n follow). You are conned if u think polyclinic medicine
              is cheap. I can get most of the medicine at their cost price (dun
              ask how hor). Our hospitals and polyclinics have been selling
              medicine at inflated prices for decades. Sad to say but MOH has
              been profiting from your medisave when u report sick at a
              government clinic and buy their medicine.</p>
              <p>Same thing for groceries. I only need ntuc for eggs, noodles,
              washing powder, milk and otah. Things such as rice, oil, sugar, i
              buy at wholesale prices. Half what u pay at ntuc. Still have not
              mention car, lighting, pest control. I dun pay outsiders unless
              they can offer me something i cannot buy or parallel import and
              install or repair myself.</p>

              Aiya, everyone property also go up mah, I bought my 3 rm flat, that time only $17k, now they told me, uncle, you want to sell, we can pay you 300k, you just imagine how many times...i also dunno how to calculate, that is the truth of Singapore cost of living shooting up. But if I sell, i might hv to live at the void deck or outside cdg office at loyang.

              Western Medicine is only taken when there is a need, most generic medication are just for relieving while your body fight against the virus, bacteria or pain. And most are blockers that block this nerve and relax that muscle. And all come with side effects, big or small only. Other than that, to artificially boost your immune system, antibotic are given, and these can infact weaken yr immune system further in near future.
              
              Unless you hv a serious illness or chronic one that needs all these medications, then no choice, hv to take it as prescripted. And as medicine are chemical in nature, other side effect will occurs, so you hv to prepare for it.
              
              See a fatty buddy driver everyday pop 10 different pills, one whole plastic bag of medicine...from high blood to high cholestrol to urinal tract infection to migraine to hypertension, he told me actually take only 5, the other 5 is to counter the side effect.

              Spent also must spent wisely mah, most rich people become rich because they spent and invest wisely, and to tell you the truth, those who make them rich are the one who spent unwisely, take money like water. Got money only, spent liao.

              Lj lah, property by this age still not pay finish, then you must be asking for trouble, most of us in our middle ages, our property are usually fully paid, it become a fix asset, and like it or not, even you talk about a 3 rooms, + yr saving + yr CPF, if all these asset are add up, chow chow also half a million aka $500,000.
              
              But property cost is not realise until sold, like one Minister said, everyday, you see yr area property go up, you will feel happy, every month, you check yr CPF account go up, you will feel happy...but LJ lah, all these are not realized, happy smlj.

              You pay off so fast for what? smart people pay off their property slowly one, like buying car, who would buy in full cash?? since interest rates is low, slowly slowly lah, and with cash in hand to spare, invest on asset that give higher return than that low interest rates, surely you will gain, paid off so fast only let DBS laugh all the way to temasek and GIC

              <p>Pay off one shot also good......at least you would not have liablities to worry about, dont have interest payments to worry about and at night sleep very peacefully.   Stock investments sometimes can go wrong too.  Like from Oct 2007 to Feb 2009.</p>
