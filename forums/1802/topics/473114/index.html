              <p>Recently a friend related this incident to me. He fetch a female pax which some barang barang. She told him she wanted to go to her workplace and then asked him to send the stuff on his own to her home, where he family members will come down and collect and pay the fare. She provided address and contact details. But my friend scared refused to entertain, said she must accompany. Later he told me and said he worried of allegation of theft or damage.</p>
              <p>I told him why he so worried. The simple rule is this - If you never do, why so scared? The police do not work that way, I have never known a case where an innocent party was charged for theft. Perhaps there may have occured some, but this is very very rare. The courts do not simply convict people based on allegations alone, there are so many other factors.Let give you an example how a molest is determined - this is a true case - a boy alleges he was molested by the neighbour of cousin. Among the factors the prosecution asked the judge to consider were this 10 points:</p>
              <p>1) Victim had no motive to lie</p>
              <p>2)  He was mature enough to understand the gravity of the offence and the nature of the accused acts of molestation</p>
              <p>3) He did not embellish his evidence (did not tambah his story, add sugar and spice)</p>
              <p>4) His account of the incident was detailed</p>
              <p>5) His evidence was corrobated  (by informing his cousin and mother soon after the acts)</p>
              <p>6) His account was credible (believable)</p>
              <p>7) His conduct before and after the molest was consistent with the allegation of molest.</p>
              <p>8) He showed geunine signs of distress</p>
              <p>9) He made detailed and heartfelt complaints of his molest and having to endure them</p>
              <p>10) Any discrepancy was minor ( maybe the timing was slightly off or the sequence of the offences or his actions was not in the exact order).</p>
              <p>These are some of the factors a judge will consider, not just side with a victim and convict you.</p>
              <p>So don't be afraid, if you were honest and didn't take anything, you need not have to worry/ At the worst case, just ask for a lie detector test, if you never do, you definitely should be able to pass it.</p>

              <p>Another true story - CNB was tailing this drug trafficker, he then got into a cab and they stopped it. The driver was detained briefly (20mins or so) but released after verifying he did not know the accused or was involved in the trafficking</p>
