              <p>NTA says demand for cabs can be met in alternative ways</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>File photo: A line of taxis in Singapore. (TODAY)</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The National Taxi Association (NTA) said there are alternative ways to better meet commuters' demands for cabs aside from the measures that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is putting in place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement on Wednesday, which came after LTA said it is tightening measures to improve taxi services, the association suggested that taxi demand in the Central Business District (CBD) can be eased if cab drivers could pay a monthly concession pass of S$25 to S$30 to enter the zone from noon to 8pm instead of paying per-entry charges.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It also suggested a review of taxi pick-up and drop-off points and routes at some buildings in the CBD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On keeping taxis on the roads, the association renewed its call for a review of the system for new holders of taxi driver vocational licences to start off as relief drivers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It said this would enlarge the pool of active relief drivers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earlier on Wednesday, LTA said from January 1 next year, taxi companies will need to increase the minimum percentage of their fleet on the roads during peak periods from 70 per cent to 80 per cent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The companies are also required to have 80 per cent instead of 70 per cent of their fleet clocking a minimum of 250 kilometres per day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The requirements are to improve taxi availability and shorten commuters' wait for cabs. </p>

              <p>More taxis on roads after introduction of availability standards: LTA</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: There are now more taxis plying the roads following the Land Transport Authority's introduction of taxi availability standards in January this year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LTA said this at a media briefing on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It added the majority of taxi companies have met the standard of having at least 70 per cent of their fleet on the roads during peak periods, and at least 70 per cent of their fleet clock in the minimum daily mileage of 250km.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The figures are for the first nine months of this year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LTA said Comfort, CityCab and SMRT consistently met peak period and shoulder peak period standards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Trans-Cab and Premier met the peak period standards but not the shoulder peak period standards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prime did not meet either of the standards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for daily mileage, Comfort, CityCab and Premier consistently met the requirements from January to September.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SMRT met the requirements from March to September while Trans-Cab met the requirements from April onwards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prime did not meet the standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Going forward, LTA will require taxi companies to increase their minimum percentage of taxis plying the roads to 80 per cent during peak periods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Daily minimum mileage requirements will also be increased to 80 per cent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These standards will come into effect from January 1 next year. </p>

              i got to know a few old birds they say erp wont change better for taxi one. because if change better, private cars sales (and COE) will drop, everyone rush to take taxi license liao. then ghamen will luggi one big hole in erp collections.
              
              but its possible erp can change worse for taxi. that means if really got concession, the concession rate will be TWICE higher than normal vehicles. the reason is to avoid people rush to cheaper taxi. and also taxi can earn back from more willing passengers ma..when theres even lesser cabs inside cbd, then even more passengers will book cab into cbd. but even if these passengers unwilling to pay for booking into cbd, more of them will divert to other public transport like bus and train. either way the ghamen will earn ;)

              the relief system can also play around. reliefs must consistently clock a certain mileage KM per week or per month. if they dont, then their license will be invalid. they need go renewal class. this way, will force people not to happy happy get license then throw oneside, must constantly active driving, contribute to the taxi availability pool.
              
              one thing the Orange taxi. they are confirm tio mark liao. their system now quite against what the ghamen prefers, which is round the clock taxi availability. they only allow 1 driver 1 vehicle 1 full day gone. somemore no or almost no booking system!? how can every other company also got 2 shift and take booking, but their drivers can song song enjoy 1 freedom shift without answering any call?? so they must either force them to change their system. or get kick out.

              <p>the relief system can also play around. reliefs must

              they dont, then their license will be invalid. they need go renewal
              class. this way, will force people not to happy happy get license

              <p>one thing the Orange taxi. they are confirm tio mark liao. their

              the clock taxi availability. they only allow 1 driver 1 vehicle 1
              full day gone. somemore no or almost no booking system!? how can
              every other company also got 2 shift and take booking, but their
              drivers can song song enjoy 1 freedom shift without answering any
              call?? so they must either force them to change their system. or
              get kick out.</p>
