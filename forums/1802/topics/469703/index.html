              <p>Not that I know of.  Some insurance companies do waive off the excess under certain conditions, e.g. if the driver has 50% NCD. But, you cannot take up insurance against this excess as it is a form of co-insurance to ensure that drivers will drive carefully if they know that they have to pay something in the event of an accident.</p>
              <p>For taxis, do note that it is 3rd party insurance (some include fire &amp; theft). That means the excess of $5K applies only to 3rd party claims, not your own damage. So, in 100% at fault cases, if 3rd party damage costs $6K to repair, you pay $5K and Insurance co. pays $1K. But, your own damage, you pay in full even if it costs $10K.</p>
              <p>I am not an insurance expert, so I stand corrected. Anyone care to share?</p>

              <p>Sure, anything can be insured, just a matter of money mah, can go talk with NTUC income, should not be a problem,</p>
              <p>in fact, for private car, there are many car insurance products on the market, from normal kind of insurance to premium that cover even the excess, and you have to pay hell of alot to cover it, like NTUC income alone, the range for a 1.6cc new car start from 800 to 1800++, and subject to your driving record and car model.</p>
              <p>One of the cheapest around it tokyo Marine insurance, but you are an experience old man, in this world, where got cheap, big and young stuff??</p>

              <p>A $500 excess policy with $3k premium can be lowered to $2000 excess with only $1.2k premium. Some owners do this as they think they are safe driver.</p>

              <p><br>No lah, for comfort 2000 is for 2nd and 3rd time own fault accident, but after talk here and there, can reduce by 200 to 400 or even 1000, as said, cdg are more approachable and listen to driver when it come to insurance, whereas other companies will not have that luxury, why so?</p>
              <p>Just take a look at cdg fleets of taxis in singapore, it a goldmine for any insurance companies. And cdg had a large capacity of own workshop, from Pandan all the way to loyang, Parts changing between taxis are easy and common, Oh, you door damaged, change the door with the other one lor, then change here and there, so many everyday, so at time, you see a hirer having 2 keys to 3 keys, one for driver door, one for boots, and one for the other door...lols</p>
