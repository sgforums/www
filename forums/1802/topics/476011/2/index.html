              Aiyo, brother, your experience with LTA can be very much different from others.
              
              Look, brother brother, LTA officer are very well train in human psychology, they got training and people developer every year one hor, and that play a part in their appraisal and annual increment (AI) + promotion.
              
              When I took such courses, one of the main strategy is to first,,...to put it in simple layman term, must die die take the upper hard with whatever authority within your reach against the defaulter, if not, you will get cornered by them and end up as a poor authoritised person.
              
              So, when you got see LTA, you notice they whack you hard first, dun worry, tell them to cool it, it is not a problem, you can take the punishement, but let just discuss the issue and see what I or you can learn from it, you can see the officer immediately withdrew his acting, more toward his nature self, then from there, you move abit in to soften the punishment. 
              
              But because most TD like you like to think that you can go in and argue over the rules, they must die die put you down inorder to hold control on their authority over you. And when you suddenly become timid after the intital blast, they see your weakness and enact on it further, and that also make their job more enjoyable.

              <p>During my TDVL course my instructor advice is LTA very rich so don't give them any money (kena fine), so drive carefully and don't break any rules. Recent rule is 6pts straight = 2 weeks suspension.</p>
              <p>Also he mentioned that if kena suspension usually taxi co may avoid or even won't rent out the car to you (cos you likely give them trouble with LTA), many ppl on queue so by the time suspension ends no more vehicle available. Now is the taxi co market not the hirer's. True ar?</p>
