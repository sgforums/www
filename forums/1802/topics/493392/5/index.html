              <p>First of all, you must have the passion to like driving, but
              this passion will fate away after few months, as such, after a year
              or 2, you still driving even the passion is gone, you
              confirm.com.sg become a taxi driver or UG, most likely,
              permanent.</p>
              <p>If just starting 3 days only, you have lost that passion and
              excitement, then I guess better return key lah..because today taxi
              market is not viable to chiong anymore, even you drive 16 hrs per
              day, also cannot match our time of no UG,...that time, newbies like
              hammer, my ex chief, taxilim, Ct, Komade…etc etc all chiong 12 to
              13 hrs per day, and it is worthy because there are lots of
              paxs…..</p>
              <p>...so I guess those who are new and come into taxi trade…you

              <p>My feelings after two days of driving.</p>
              <p>- Though no fixed working reporting time but automatically will
              try to wake up early. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">early bird catch the worm</span></p>
              <p>- Can have lots of freedom but can't afford to</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 16px;">freedom comes at a cost.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.2px;">- Can eat a variety of different food but mainly junk food</span></p>
              <p>- Smoking breaks increases by 30 to 50 %</p>
              <p>- Pin more hopes to strike lottery</p>
              <p>- Everyday meet new ppl but all mute</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">chat with pax only when they chat with u</span></p>
              <p>- Body quite sweaty after few hrs of driving hopefully no
              odor</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">despite always seated in ac environment, our back still gets very warm.. once a couple of hours, step out for a break</span></p>
              <p>- Lazier at home when knock off</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">too tired to do anything. mind and eyes very tired</span></p>
              <p>Hopefully it is just a process. By gradually mastering road
              knowledge and taking more calls , i hope mental fatigue can be
              reduced and to hit target using shortest time possible.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">fatigue will always be there. healthy lifestyle is the way to keep u going </span></p>

              <p>No. The mini bus waited at stop line first. I moved my vehicle forward next to his assuming that the space is more than enough for him to move out safely. He didn't check blindspot so ended up brushing my front car side. I guess can only blame my backside itchy</p>

              <p>No. The mini bus waited at stop line first. I moved my vehicle
              forward next to his assuming that the space is more than enough for
              him to move out safely. He didn't check blindspot so ended up
              brushing my front car side. I guess can only blame my backside
              itchy</p>

              Today, car rental business are booming, so are 2nd hand car dealers, and in overall the automobile domestic business industrial index rose by 1% to 2.1% of our GDP or yearly domestic product. 
              
              All thanks to UG and their drivers, business which were suffering before 2013 are thriving, from towing business to car servicing to car insurances and most importantly, car repair business went up and COE maintained. 
              
              Why? because accident rates had went up that included few fatalities and serious injuries.
              
              And that is why, your statement come in "it aint as easy as it seem", 
              
              GPS Uber and Grab youngster or newbie just whack here and there, cut here and there, chiong here and there, .....
              
              and if a person mentality can only do one thing at a time, then sorry, driving is not for you, because driving, be it taxi or UG, you need quick reflexes as technologies need your attention on GPS, on your Smart Phone and on the pax, the road and the traffic including TP and parking.
              
              Today technology only help the companies and paxs, not the driver, the driver are actually much more worst off, more stress and more pressure leading to more accident and headache.
