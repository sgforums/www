              <p>ts is right and wrong at the same time.</p>
              <p>right becos the things mention is right. td face these all the time as long as they are bound to the trade...why are they bound to the trade? becos most td do not realize a fundamental of the trade, also fundamental of any economic situation.</p>
              <p>demand and supply.</p>
              <p>if supply exceed demand, then u are in trouble, becos u (seller) need them (buyers). so td problem actually come from here..they need the trade to earn the money. they need the buyers which give them the trouble.</p>
              <p>but if demand exceed supply, then things become interesting. becos they (buyers) need u (seller). so actually who are the people best suited to td? ironically, its the people who do not need the trade to make money, like those retirees or those who past time. $$ fly into my pockets every second every minute as i drive my buyers, as i chitchat with them, even as i typing now. becos even the most nasty of buyers cannot affect me, i still can find a way to make the greensgreens in their pockets happily jump into my pocket. to date, i never kanna a complain, i still even get recommendations what a joke haha.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">so the trick to becoming a happy td is ignore the carrots. suddenly the sun looks shining. the occasional dark clouds may be there but they cannot shadow u. the more attention you pay to the carrots, the more you fear them, the more you loathe the conditions they bring with them. i never pay too much serious attention to my buyers. </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">becos in my mind. I do not need them or their carrots. i have my own big farm. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">but if totally don't drive, will also boring :D</span></p>

              <p>I thought uncle foo found many new eating places so no more hunger for taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>All the points are not new, most of us here do it out of necessity, not hunger for taxi driving. We are hungry for money, for survival, not taxi driving. Taxi driving is most probably a last resort.</p>
              <p>Although taxi driving is all that and more, it can at least put food on the table and help pay bills. And it is perhaps better than working for a bullying boss for a low pay.</p>
              <p>So take taxi driving as a "stop gap" measure while you look for a better source of income. Never, ever give up your dream of a better life.</p>
              <p>Stay foolish, stay hungry (but not fot taxi driving, lol)</p>

              <p>Agree with your comments but taxi driving though free-spirited also requires a lot of self-discipline.  Self-discipline to drive up to 12 hours to make the max and not call-it-a-day at 8 or 10 hours point.   However this is entirely up to every individual taxi-driver depending on how much he wants to make and how much his body could take.</p>

              I would say that in whateve endeavour you undertook, learn to relax and be jovious, hv a good sense of humor and alway look at thing on the positive side.
              
              Hv seen many kanchiong drivr zoom here and there, of cos when new, learning period, a bit kanchiong, but when you gained experience, cool down and be steady lah. These cabby likes to set high target and pressure themselve, setting target is ok, but take it as a number, not something that if you do not reach will get punished.
              
              Furthermore, these kanchiong taxi uncles like to compares, from distance travel to fares collection to fuel usage to call elite and ranger...all these only add stress and more pressure to yr driving if you want to match them, so the best is can listen, but do not need to follow if u r not capable, just drive yr own way, have fun and smile often, because we the human are the only living thing that can laugh n smile, use it.

              important, but most things are only necessary. <br> <br> 2. Necessary things are only important when you do not have them
              and are generally ignored when they are amply supplied. These
              include oxygen, food, drink. shelter, and all physical
              needs. <br> <br> 3. Important things are important all the time whether you have
              them or not, whether you realize it or not. <br> <br> 4. People who regard necessary things as important are unhappy and
              frustrated even when they get them and even if they are quite
              unaware that the important things exist. <br> <br> 5. Important things are those which can be made ends in themselves,
              worth seeking and worth having. Necessary things, since they are
              not important for their own sakes, should never made ends in
              themselves, but must be permitted only to be means to important
              ends. Thus, material wealth, power, popularity, and prestige should
              never be ends but only means to ends, because however necessary
              they may be they are never important. <br> <br> 6. THE ONLY THING WHICH IS IMPORTANT IS TRUTH -- that is the total
              structure of reality. The meaning of anything arises from its
              relationship to that total structure. The reason that material
              things are not important is because of the subordinate position
              they hold in that total structure. <br> <br> 7. From this point of view, important things may exist on any level
              of reality. For example, physical health, exercise. and
              coordination are important on the physical level, but are not as
              important as things on higher levels, even though they can be made
              ends in themselves. <br> <br> 8. On the higher levels are such things as feelings. and
              intellectual awareness. <br> <br> 9. The important things are those concerned with the realization of
              the potentialities of an individual because such realization brings
              the individual in closer contact with the total structure of
              reality -- that is, with TRUTH. <br> <br> 10. Each individual is so inadequate that there are only a few
              things he can do to help realize his potentialities. Among these
              few are will - the desire to do this and the determination to do
              it. <br> <br> 11. Because of the inadequacy of the individual -- that is, his
              basic need for other persons and his inability to direct his
              efforts unless he has recognition of his relationships with the
              rest of reality, the individual can achieve nothing by seeking to
              obtain things for himself, because this makes him the center of the
              universe, which he is not. Thus, selfishness achieves
              nothing.<br> <br> 12. Thus the chief immediate aim in life of each individual must be
              to help others realize their potentialities. This is what Kant
              meant when he said that others must never be treated as means to be
              used, but always as ends in themselves. It is basic in human
              experience that those things a person seeks for himself directly
              are never obtained. They are only obtained indirectly as a
              by-product of an effort to obtain them for others. Thus the man who
              seeks only wealth for himself never feels rich, as the man who
              seeks power never feels secure, and the man who seeks pleasure
              never feels satisfied. But the man who seeks important things for
              others often feels rich, secure, and satisfied. <br> <br> 13. The need for others is present on all levels, the physical.
              emotional, and intellectual. Indeed, every relationship has in it
              all three aspects. The desire to help others experience these
              things and to grow as a result of such experiences is called love.
              Such love is the real motivating force of the universe and is, in
              its ultimate nature. a manifestation of the love of God. Because
              while God is pure Reason and man' s ultimate goal is Reason, it can
              not be reached directly and must always be approached step by step,
              not alone but in companionship with others, and thus through love.
              Thus love of others, ultimately love of God, are the steps by which
              man develops reason and slowly approaches pure
              Reason.</span></span></div>

              <p>Being a TD, in my opinion, is a free spirited job.  Not
              only taxis is not easy, most jobs in singapore are also not easy,
              the fact that most of us came from working class and decided to
              switch to driving taxis, should had known that working life is also
              not easy.  Taxi driving is more of no boss, just the taxi
              company and fuel you have to settle, working life is alway having
              few bosses on top of you, pros and cons, but in working life you
              just cannot walk away as and when you like.  In Singapore,
              alot of people works long hours, from construction to marine to
              shenton way offices, contrary to all that, the most important thing
              is, given your characters and background,  are you happy with
              what you are doing, the ways you are earning your honest living and
              the life you choose to be.  Of course most of us would like to
              give excuses that it is the society, the cost of living, the govt
              that causes or push us to drive taxi, it might be true, but it can
              also be some lame excuses to set one free from the domain of a
              disciplined salary paid job.</p>

              <p>Free spirited? Not really at all although it may seem like it to an outsider. The hard truth is there are rent &amp; fuel to pay. You need to put in the hours, no escaping.</p>
              <p>You want off? Pay for it. You want to relax and drive less, you earn less.You want to drive only when you feel like driving, take off as &amp; when you like like a free spirit? Yes, can but your earnings will be so meagre you can't even make ends meet.</p>
              <p>At the end of a hard day or night, even if the spirit is willing, the flesh is already weak. Serious taxi drivers are not a free spirited lot at all. They are just over worked self employed people, not business owners.</p>
              <p>That's why for me, this is just a temporary, stop-gap , "job". The status quo cannot continue. It is easy to get complacent and attached to the "job", like a comfortable frog enjoying the warmth in a slow boiling pot of water....lol</p>
              <p>But I am still grateful for the income it provides which is life saving....</p>

              Target setting must be achieveable and reachable, dun set a 7k per month target, if so, you might end up poorer, more stressful or at A &amp; E dept.
              
              Use SMART way to drive. Specific, Manageable, Archievable, Realistic, Time.
              
              Specific: spell out exactly what you want and be focus
              Manageable: ask yourself can you do it, can you manage it within yr capabilities
              Archieveable: able to archieve/reachable or nearly archieved is also good.
              Realistic: are you true to yourself, is it real and factual
              Time: you decide and plan yr time, most important is to plan it with a good balancing of Life.
