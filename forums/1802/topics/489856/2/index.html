              <p>Impossible to hit that high for OMO unless you drive super-long hours.</p>
              <p>If you calculate having to take one day off, you already lost $400-$500 per month.</p>
              <p>Because no one shares the rental with you, you have to pay (30-4)*57 extra so $1482 per month.   So your overhead is closed to $2000 higher than 12-hour shift drivers.</p>
              <p>Don't even think about $7000 per month for 12 hour shift so $5000 is not achievable.   I never hit it once even if I extrapolate my best ever day (multiply by 26) .  Even $6000 for 12-hour shift is a super-hard job....possibly only the most experienced taxi drivers who chong all the way could hit on a lucky month..... so $4000 is not quite possible unless you drive beyond 12 hours per day.</p>
              <p>According to Mr <span style="color: #333333; font-family: Lato, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4173px; line-height: 16.8202px;">Tan Chuan-Jin </span>, the average pay for OMO is $3173 ( see <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/specialreports/parliament/news/single-shift-taxi-drivers/1697164.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/specialreports/parliament/news/single-shift-taxi-drivers/1697164.html</a> ).</p>

              Driving of taxis is all abt earning peanut to sustain a high cost of living, in another word, a slave to it. But then in return, we get that freedom and no one on top of you.
              
              To be a smart taxi driver, u need to take a lower rental cab, easy access to fuel at lower price and also, a more disciplne and systematic company. Most pax are not bother by good cab, I drive a old cab, sound like truck, but still get good tips here and there. Then on the other hands, you need luck, but luck come about only if you know where to find it, you need to be at the right place or right Q at the right time.
              
              After you drive for 2 years, all these are in yr finger tips, but if you still gong gong and dunno where and how to find gd paxs, it is ok, there are still many street taiko pax for you to sweep, like my CT bro, road sweeper.

              <p>Siao Lang or not depends on you yourself.   If you must aim highest salary, then of course must work like mad.   If you only target enough is enough, then everything okay already.   I met quite a number of older taxi drivers who said they only work until make enough and would stop after that.</p>
              <p>Fortunately our industry most taxi drivers self-employed (except some SMRT new drivers).   Otherwise everyone would be in conflict with each others with the management taking money from everyone and giving the so-called best driver extra incentives.   There is reward for working hard but no extra reward for finishing top three.  </p>

              I think at the end of the day, we, as Taxi driver of Singapore, pledged ourselves as one united people, must know that, there is alway a tomorrow to drive and earn, therefore, whatever you think is enough, it is enough, try not to compare, because the diversity of taxi driver here is huge.
              
              There are young and old, weak and strong, male and female driver, just like at my age, I cannot go compare with a 30s years old driver, he can tong 16hrs per day as OMO, i see liao also scare, but during my young time, I also can tong 16hrs on the road, somemore, after driving, can go piak piak at keong saik street with cantonese lady.
              
              So, let us be calm, be your own boss, learn to give and take, forgive and forget, relax and smile, afterall, we all become TDs is also because we want to be free and easy.

              Brother, Drive Taxi better lah, everybody tends to see the other side is good, his gf/wife looks nicer, his house look better, his taxi looks more new and quiet, his style looks more modern, his job look better than mine. This is normal human behaviorial, learnt to acknowledge it and you shall be a more understanding person.

              <p>Dont know whose farking idea to use casket van for coffin. Just rent a 10 ft lorry with tailgate. Then use a casket trolley to push out from the mortuary and/or unload at the funeral parlour. One person can already - OMO coffin delivery.</p>
              <p>Casket also no need to use virgin wood. Should use waste pallet wood and fashion them into a casket.</p>
              <p>I really shake my head. People like Roland should incorporate green initiatives into their business of scrapping dead bodies.</p>

              Cannot anyhow use lorry lah, later body part kenna sold in the black market, how? that is why there must be a system and protocol to follow, and that is also why need licences and vocational licence to operate mah.
              
              If can anyhow, then can use lorry to go around pick paxs liao, why need a taxi..
              
              In this world, some business or in fact, most business targeted on human weakness, be it emotional or physical, like why casket and funeral needs to be nice and proper, because human think they need to put up a good show for their dead relative mah, then also need to show to the public, other relatives, from 3rd old uncle to 2nd auntie, if no give a good show, many TCSS one hor.

              <p>Singapore is a 1st world country, lorry is very unsightly and cheapskate.  And coffin very heavy, OMO cannot easy to lift.  If no money, just pay for undertaker to deliver from mortuary straight to oven... only $300+ if I'm not wrong... no frills.  <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              Undertaker job is not something like taxi driving whereby you can just join and drive, you need to start from a younger age, I learned the trade in my early 30s, handsome and strong, today, if you are in your mid 40s and above with no experiences in all these, just stick to your taxi driving lah.
              
              Not only lorry a unsightful transport to send your beloved ones, there is also laws and regulations to adhere to, just like Taxi regulations, all casket van/merc/decorated pick up are registered, they are not allow to pick people or just use it as going around with family (in fact family members also dun wan to travel in casket van).
              
              And for you info, there are lots of black market wanting body parts, from kidneys to eyeball to liver and so on, people are willing to pay few hundred thousand for it, especially those in waiting list and are rich, so let say if I will to send my Bro CT to mandai, half way, stopped, removed the kidneys or whatever, can make thousands of dollars one hor,,...that is why it need to be licenced and approved, otherwise my bro may end up with no eyeballs or kidney...
