Do you see how stagnant is our taxi industry even with so many taxi companies. The fare structure all the same. So do you think the taxi companies cannot come together and discuss about by rent together? They all up rental together, you hop where also honggan. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
