              Zen is japanese, in chinese it is çœŸ
              
              Zen discipline itself on realistic, simplicity and nature.
              
              For eg, you are a taxi driver, real??? yes, you are a taxi driver. Of course you can think you are the boss, you are the chief, you are the lau chiao etc etc, but you are still a taxi driver...full stop.  This is zen, be realistic.
              
              And since you are a TD, be as simple as taxi driver, dun go around creating this group or that group or make a mess out of your life thru gambling, prositutioning and alway like to argue and fight, just drive, earn your profit, your rights, your effort..be simple
              
              And then, most TD alway like to Kpkb, no business lah, no pax lah, govt do this and that lah Lj taxi companies cheat this and that lah, it is ok to kpkb, but at the end of the day, that is the nature of your trade, a Simple TD.
              
              Old, yes, we are old, so be it, everyone will get old, and when you are old, behave as one, cannot chiong still want to chiong??? cannot run, still want to compete?? be real, you are old, and just be simple and do what old does the best. And aging is nature.
              
              The understand of Zen is to ask oneself and admit one condition, thereby learn the simple way and accept the process of nature.

              <p>Trust me Mr Ng, boring is best. Better to lead a normal boring and dull life than to hv one fill with excitement.</p>
              <p>Excitrement usually means danger and trouble. Boring means peaceful, you bother nobody and nobody bothers you.</p>
              <p>Even if a pax irritate you, just tell yourself maximum 30 mins, before the farker f.o and will not be part of your life anymore.</p>
              <p>Outside, you work in an office if you kena a farker, everyday gotta see his face and worse still hv to work with him.</p>
              <p>Just like this forum, you dont like Uncle Joe - just ignore. Uncle Joe is a nobody to you. Uncle Joe tcss like Rbs, cannot make you poorer.</p>
