              <p>3 days OMO sure song lah. But if you keep doing this day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year ... seow liao. I also ever OMO for 3 days quite seong, not enough water, can't pang sai properly. Drink lots of water then everytime got to look for toilet. Unless you take it easy type, otherwise you sure want to cheong so how to always look for toilet? Also not enough sleep lah.</p>
              <p>But ... OMO for a few months to make as much money as possible then quit may be a good idea. Quicker way to save(for whatever reasons) but can't be for long term as your health will surely suffer.</p>
              <p>Can consider.....</p>

              Cool it brothers, we should not take on each other, instead, if you happen to get a good hirer, which is quite difficult to find, please treasure it, a good hirer and a good relief work best, they work naturally, each knows each other well, compliment each other, help each other, like my current hirer for 2 years, at first, he was very offensive.
              
              This is due to years of having conflict for many years with other reliefs, therefore they get dumbed and alway think relief problematic, same goes to reliefs, years of driving for so many lousy hirers end up also think every hirer is no good.
              
              But that is not true, as I shown my sincerity to him, slowly he come to appreciate it, and when relationship build up to a good one, you will definitely drive happier, it is a win win for both side, but if both are playing games with each other,...then driving will not be happy and a lost for all, instead of making more money, you might be thinking how to play with the hirer, or cheat him or pump less.
              
              Relationship between humans are important, it takes months to years to build, but one silly doing even for a mere second, can destroy it completely. Treasure it

              <p>hammer. me hao lian? i also dont need to explain to you either. i do things not swee? if u say i do it to him so many times, he would have sound out to me earlier instead of you. But because of one time, you already paint my picture black.</p>
              <p>I know you and him are good buddies. He shares alot of things with you and others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also have nothing to prove my point of this senseless argument with you. If your ego insists on winning this, by all means exploiting me, please carry on.</p>
              <p>By the way, to say the hard truth, any agreement is between him and me ( hirer and relief ), you can just stfu. If he is not happy with our partnership, sad to say, i will gladly return the key to him.</p>

              <p>You still dun get the point? Paying $80 a day doesn't qualify for you to say that you OMO unless you are paying full rental like the rest of the OMO here. You are only a super relief in this case so if you says you feel shiok this 3 days as a super relief then by all means. Understand my point? Simple right? So dun tell me you going to pay him the full rental because I doubt you have the ability so STFU and dun yaya tell me you can pay him the full rental. People with calibre no need to spell it out to me instead do liao then come tell me to diam diam. Action speaks louder then words. So unless you pay him full rental then you can yaya telling people OMO is shiok if not plus just STFU and diam diam understand.</p>
