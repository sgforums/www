            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think the cabby got heart attack. This is not the first case. Previously got one case of cabby stopped at roadside, lock his car and went into the bushes where he died. Another one was a premier cabby who died inside his stationary cab in pasir ris close. I urge all drivers especially cabbies to buy one box of aspirin from ntuc pharmacy (no need see doctor one) and standby inside. Once you experience chest pain, immediately take one pill and chew in your mouth. No need water. This will ease your chest pain and save your life while u call for ambulance.</p></div>

              <p>You never experience before right? People who get stroke or heart attack can lose control of their body. You never hear of the lorry case? The driver suffered heart attack and died while driving.</p>

              <p>What if old man is a lone ranger? Either no children or children unfilial and maybe wife died or divorced? There must be a sad story behind. Doctor? Some old people just waiting to up lorry. Shaking leg at home very boring. So take a gamble and drive until 73 lor.</p>
              <p>Still we cannot blame them. Because there are young marathoners and army regulars who died during a run from heart attack. These are young and fit people. There are also people who died of heart attack during sex or a massage. You cannot predict when you will die. Some people literally died cock standing. No kidding its real.</p>

              <p>The current medical checkup to renew taxi license is useless as far as checking for heart condition is concerned. You can pass the medical today, tomorrow, you can suffer a heart attack.</p>
              <p>Currently, medical science is not advanced enough to predict accurately exactly when you will have a heart attack.  There are a few types of tests:</p>
              <p>1. Resting ECG.  This is where you lie down and they put electrodes on your body to check your heart rhythm.  It is only as good as at that point in time the electrodes are on your body.  Nothing more.</p>
              <p>2. Stress ECG.  Same as resting ECG except that you need to run on a treadmill and they take the readings.  The running gets more and more strenuous. Also only good at the time of test or maybe for one or two more days.</p>
              <p>3. Angiograms.  There are 3 types. CT Angiogram, MR Angiogram and Coronary Angiogram.  Of the 3, Coronary Angiogram is the current Gold Standard.  These tests check for heart blockages and calcium deposits. They can tell you which artery is blocked and how much of it is blocked so that you can take medication to control or go for regular physical exercises so that the blockages do not become worse.</p>
              <p>Why do seemingly healthy, fit and young people suddenly die of heart attack during a run? One reason is that their arteries may already be partially blocked say 30%. During exercise, their artieries may tear due to calcium deposits dislodging along the artery wall. Bleeding will occur.  As a natural body defense, blood clot will occur immediately.  The blood clot together with the partially blocked arteries may choke off your heart totally and cause an infarction.</p>
              <p>Suggest that if you are above 40 years old and do not exercise regularly, smoke and have a poor diet to go for an angiogram test.  No guarantee, but no harm too.  Some people go for the angiogram and immediately the next day, they need to do an angioplasty or a bypass as their arteries are found to be completely blocked. A CT Angiogram currently cost about $1,300 to $1,500 and done by a heart specialist.</p>

              <p>The current medical checkup to renew taxi license is useless as
              far as checking for heart condition is concerned. You can pass the
              medical today, tomorrow, you can suffer a heart attack.</p>
              <p>Currently, medical science is not advanced enough to predict
              accurately exactly when you will have a heart attack.  There
              are a few types of tests:</p>
              <p>1. Resting ECG.  This is where you lie down and they put
              electrodes on your body to check your heart rhythm.  It is
              only as good as at that point in time the electrodes are on your
              body.  Nothing more.</p>
              <p>2. Stress ECG.  Same as resting ECG except that you need to
              run on a threadmill and they take the readings.  The running
              gets more and more strenuous. Also only good at the time of test or
              maybe for one or two more days.</p>
              <p>3. Angiograms.  There are 3 types. CT Angiogram, MR
              Angiogram and Coronary Angiogram.  Of the 3, Coronary
              Angiogram is the current Gold Standard.  These tests check for
              heart blockages and calcium deposits. They can tell you which
              artery is blocked and how much of it is blocked so that you can
              take medication to control or go for regular physical exercises so
              that the blockages do not become worse.</p>
              <p>Why do seemingly healthy, fit and young people suddenly die of
              heart attack during a run? One reason is that their arteries may
              already be partially blocked say 30%. During exercise, their
              artieries may tear due to calcium deposits dislodging along the
              artery wall. Bleeding will occur.  As a natural body defense,
              blood clot will occur immediately.  The blood clot together
              with the partially blocked arteries may choke off your heart
              totally and cause an infarction.</p>
              <p>Suggest that if you are above 40 years old and do not exercise
              regularly, smoke and have a poor diet to go for an angiogram test.
               No guarantee, but no harm too.  Some people go for the
              angiogram and immediately the next day, they need to do an
              angioplasty or a bypass as their arteries are found to be
              completely blocked. A CT Angiogram currently cost about $1,300 to
              $1,500 and done by a heart specialist.</p>

              You must remember that in Singapore, individual contract is never going to bother anyone, not yr wife or any close family member, like when you end up bankrupt, only you, not yr family member, you sign out the Taxi, not your son or daughter hor.
