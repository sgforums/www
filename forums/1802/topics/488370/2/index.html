              73yo is the final check up mah, if ok then can try 75yo, anyway, 73yo also can consider as 76yo liao....73yo pass away, in chinese, must add 3 years more...become 76yo lor. 
              
              Aiya, anyway, working pple the most get reemployed until 65yo, and their job are not so stressful, tire and danger like taxi driving, limpek at mid 50yo, after 4 hrs driving, already cannot tarhan liao..imagine at 70yo...wow! incredible Singapore, should put in the Guiness world  record for being the oldest TD in the world

                              <p>CDG is listed company. How can they issue a goodwill cheque of

              paid out to those who died at their doorstep, surely it must be
              covered and claimable from another party. At least also must book

              But in many companies, they insured their employees regardless of where they are, therefore, coming back to goodwill, it is a matter of willingness and the agenda behind it, as the famous saying "Nothing is free" for this case, it is a marketing strategy strike on the right note.
              
              I can spend 100 thousands on advertisment, pamphlets, recruiting (pay courses) and so on, but if I can spend 10 thousands and able to get more attention then but invisible 100 k, why not???
              
              Even right at this forum, we are already talking about the 10k goodwill, and not about the dead Cabby or how is his family, isn't that catching the uptmost attention???
              
              But for me, 10k to die is not worthy, I rather wait at BQ at 3am for ang mo to whack me, then maybe can get 30k and still alive

              In today context, 10k is a compensation, not a goodwill, I would like to suggest that taxi drivers to buy their own insurance, it will really help yr family when it the hard truth arrived, 10k from a big listed company like CDG that give huge dividends, what a laughing stock
