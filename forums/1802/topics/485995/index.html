              <p class="byline-story1">Priscilla Goy</p>
              <p class="byline-story2">The Straits Times</p>
              <p class="pub_date">Publication Date : 06-08-2014</p>
              <p class="body1"> </p>
              <p>Anyone caught using any function of his mobile 
              device and holding it while driving could be found guilty of committing 
              an offence, under proposed changes to improve road safety in Singapore.<br><br> This includes not just communicating with someone else via calls or 
              texts, which are offences under existing law, but also surfing the 
              internet, visiting social media platforms and downloading videos.<br><br> The new rules would apply not just to phones but also all mobile 
              communication devices, such as iPads, under the broadened Road Traffic 
              Act. The proposed amendments to the Act, tabled in Parliament on Monday,
               come amid a rise in phone-and-drive offences.<br><br> There were 3,572 summonses issued for such offences last year, up 21.6 
              per cent from 2,938 in 2012, according to Traffic Police figures.<br><br> In the first half of this year, 1,761 summonses were issued, compared 
              with 1,700 issued in the same period last year. First-time offenders can
               be fined up to S$1,000 (US$801) and/or jailed for up to six months. 
              Repeat offenders get up to double the penalty.<br><br> The new Bill "will strengthen (the) Traffic Police's enforcement powers,
               enhance competency of drivers, as well as clarify the expected 
              behaviour of vehicle owners and motorists on responsible road use", the 
              home affairs ministry said. The changes are expected to be debated at 
              the next Parliamentary sitting.<br><br> Associate Professor Gopinath Menon, who teaches transportation 
              engineering at Nanyang Technological University, welcomed the proposed 
              changes.<br><br> "Some drivers use their tablet devices for checking e-mail because of 
              the bigger screen, and they may even perform multiple tasks with their 
              tablets," he said. "Any type of distraction won't be good for drivers."<br><br> Last year, a street poll of 140 motorists by <em>The Sunday Times</em> found that about seven in 10 admitted to using their phones while 
              driving. This is even though most knew it was against the law.<br><br> Most respondents said they took calls and read text messages while 
              driving, but there were also those who played games and used social 
              media like Facebook.<br><br> While it is an offence when a driver holds a phone and uses it to 
              communicate with someone else, it is not against the law to use the 
              phone if it is mounted on a holder. This will apply to other mobile 
              devices as well, under the new Bill.<br><br> Other amendments in the new Bill include a requirement for work pass 
              holders who need to drive as part of their jobs to obtain a local 
              driving licence within six months after their work passes had been 
              issued.<br><br> This could affect some industries, such as construction.<br><br> BD CraneTech director Jeffrey Lim said more details will be needed as 
              this could affect work pass holders differently, depending on their 
              country of origin.<br><br> For example, those from India can convert their international driving 
              licences to local ones. "This should not take too long, and they would 
              still be able to meet the (proposed) requirement within six months," 
              said Lim.<br><br> But others from places like Myanmar or Bangladesh cannot do so and have 
              to take theory and practical tests in Singapore, he added.<br><br> The home affairs ministry said the amendment is to ensure that 
              "motorists, local and foreign, are familiar with Singapore's traffic 
              rules and conditions, and are sufficiently competent to drive on our 
              roads". It last amended the Road Traffic Act in 2010.<br><br> - See more at: <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/transport/story/proposed-amendment-road-traffic-act-makes-using-or-holding-mobile-dev#sthash.QThpzXIS.dpuf">http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/transport/story/proposed-amendment-road-traffic-act-makes-using-or-holding-mobile-dev#sthash.QThpzXIS.dpuf</a></p>

              Aiya, Singapore have lost all its social aspect of human life, especially Singaporeans and all those livng in Singapore had inhabited a serious phobia of no smartphone...can die one. 
              
              So, you see all pple on the street and public places are all on their smartphone, no buddies also nevermind, got smartphone can liao..and this is out of the social norm.
