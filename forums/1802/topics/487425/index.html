              <p class="first">In
               light of the slew of apps that attempt to make the local transport 
              system more efficient, one form of transportation remains arguably 
              underlooked in this part of the world: carpooling.</p>
              <p>It is, in a way, understandable why carpooling itself is not as 
              common in Asia than it is in the West- in a conservative Asian culture 
              like ours, safety concerns hails above all else, including convenience, 
              comfort, companionship and even cash.</p>
              <p>And start up firm Tripda is hoping to change just that.</p>
              <div id="attachment_130372" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="text-align: center;"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><a href="https://s2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/pv_f5LK9jRufEjBMs91JEw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NQ--/https://az598155.vo.msecnd.net/wp-uploads/2014/12/tripda-banner.jpg"><img class="wp-image-130372" src="https://s2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/VSfzpxUkQh68A9zE.JLrrw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/470c4ba751489061cfb90bc395366b89" alt="Image Credit: Tripda" width="630" height="210"></a></span><br> Image Credit: Tripda</div>
              <p>Launched late last year, Tripda is an online carpooling service that 
              is now active in 12 countries (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, 
              Argentina, Uruguay, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Philippines, and most 
              recently in US and India) with Brazil being the first country it 
              launched, in May 2014. The concept is simple: the platform enables 
              drivers with spare seats in their cars to offer rides to passengers 
              going the same way. The passengers get a relatively cheaper trip, while 
              drivers get to make a quick buck for something they were already doing 
              anyway. The service Tripda provides is free.</p>
              <p>Tripda is proud of the benefits of its service, one that they believe
               is social, economical, environmentally-friendly, secure, and 
              convenient. And they aren’t the only ones who believe in the value of 
              their service. The start up is backed by venture accelerator firm Rocket
               Internet, the same guys who brought you ecommerce giants Lazada and 
              Zalora.</p>
              <p>We spoke to Tripda’s <a href="http://www.tripda.com.sg/our-team">co-founder and CEO (Emerging Markets)</a>, Pedro Meduna, to find out a little more about the next transport venture you should keep your eyes peeled for.</p>
              <div id="attachment_130451" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="text-align: center;"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><a href="https://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/0826840cb9ae1bd2383ce27b6b1c57cb"><img class="wp-image-130451" src="https://s.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/BEeeMTigQ6vmhIsbAC8t8w--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/0826840cb9ae1bd2383ce27b6b1c57cb" alt="Image Credit: Tripda, on facebook.com" width="630" height="420"></a></span><br> Image Credit: Tripda, on facebook.com</div>
              <p>Tripda came about when Meduna and fellow co-founder Eduardo Prota 
              shared the same problem of living in the country and having to go to the
               city to work, and had to rely on friends or acquaintances travelling 
              the same way. The idea further developed during Meduna’s trip to Europe,
               where carpooling was a common form of transport.</p>
              <p>The co-founders then lived in US for awhile, and noticed the 
              potential of the ‘sharing economy’ there, and came up with the idea of 
              exporting the idea of carpooling to different parts of the world where 
              sharing a vehicle with complete strangers is far less common. They met 
              Rocket Internet, who shared their vision of exporting the idea of 
              carpooling overseas. The rest was history.</p>
              <div id="attachment_130391" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="text-align: center;"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><a href="https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/_333k1DO4NIVm6pgLWUcyw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NQ--/https://az598155.vo.msecnd.net/wp-uploads/2014/12/tripda-banner2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-130391" src="https://s.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/FzyOL3ib8E8ZFPQDNq7BzA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/7c40f129e49e037ac744adaa32c9f5f2" alt="Image Credit: Tripda" width="630" height="196"></a></span><br> Image Credit: Tripda</div>
              <p>Tripda’s main function is to connect people looking for a ride with 
              drivers who have empty seats in their cars. The service is available via
               their <a href="http://www.tripda.com/">website</a> and as a mobile app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripda.droid&amp;hl=en">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tripda/id912558450?mt=8">iOS</a>.
               The platforms are relatively easy to navigate: users first create an 
              account by linking their Facebook account to the service. Passengers can
               immediately browse for trips by keying in their pick up location, 
              destination and date of trip.</p>
              <p>Drivers, on the other hand, would have to <a href="http://www.tripda.com.sg/offer-seats">register</a> their ride by providing the company with an optional photo, its brand, 
              model, level of comfort, colour, and number of  passenger seats 
              available, among other information. They may also toggle option to allow
               for example, smoking, pets, music and even if they would like to engage
               in a conversation during the ride.</p>
              <div id="attachment_130442" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="text-align: center;"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><a href="https://s3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/YiSfoONIg2PZzft0afBrNQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NQ--/https://az598155.vo.msecnd.net/wp-uploads/2014/12/Tripda-Social.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-130442" src="https://s2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/1jpuHnYqerEDduHpeX6WEA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/b5192358e9d8ba28281c4a4fd7abc79f" alt="Image Credit: Tripda" width="630" height="316"></a></span><br> Image Credit: Tripda</div>
              <p>Meduna believes that the company’s philosophy of “think global, act local” is the key to their rapid expansion.</p>
              <p>“Every time we expand to another country, we look for a small team of
               great local talent to build Tripda and grow the carpooling culture 
              there,” said Meduna, “This gives us a strong understanding of each 
              market and their nuances – be it in culture, lifestyle, demographics or 
              key routes. Our on-the-ground presence makes it easier to engage with 
              users at every level and listen to their feedback in order to improve 
              our product.”</p>
              <p>Indeed, Tripda’s invasion into local carpooling Facebook groups in 
              Singapore, for example, has already begun. In recent months, ‘Campus 
              Ambassadors’ (CA) from Tripda’s ‘Campus Ambassador Program’ have put up 
              notices such as the one below in NUS Carpooling groups. This program 
              intends to further localise and integrate the service into the 
              Singaporean community.</p>
              <div id="attachment_130041" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="text-align: center;"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 310px;"><a href="https://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/07b16d029b45cd6744d3e0fa0a71dc61"><img class="wp-image-130041 size-full" src="https://s2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/qfaxsWMhboKCS0FAtJJY5A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTMxMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/07b16d029b45cd6744d3e0fa0a71dc61" alt="Image Credit: NUS Carpool!, on facebook.com" width="310" height="352"></a></span><br> Image Credit: NUS Carpool!, on facebook.com</div>
              <p>“Each university’s Campus Ambassador acts as a focal point to engage 
              fellow students and nurture in them the carpooling culture using Tripda 
              as a convenient, safe, fun and economical means of travel,” said Meduna.
               They currently have CAs in NUS and the Nanyang Technological 
              University, Singapore, with plans to expand this program into other 
              universities in the region. Tripda is also looking into partnerships 
              with companies, NGOs, and event organisers.</p>

              <p>With all this said, we were still concerned about the safety of using
               the platform for rides with complete strangers. Meduna is however 
              confident of the safety of the platform, and is encouraged by the 
              positive feedback he has received from Singaporeans, especially from the
               younger population.</p>
              <div id="attachment_130441" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="text-align: center;"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><a href="https://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/e63a32e0fbcca837425f77ac3c3d2093"><img class="wp-image-130441" src="https://s.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/9..1guEY1cqS4ndFq95EEg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/vulcanpost.com/e63a32e0fbcca837425f77ac3c3d2093" alt="Image Credit: Tripda" width="630" height="343"></a></span><br> Image Credit: Tripda</div>
              <p>“Tripda is built on the principles of safety and trust,” said Meduna,
               “We encourage community ratings and reviews by travelers who have taken
               rides together. The platform verifies drivers and passengers in 
              multiple ways and runs checks to ensure their privacy and security. We 
              want to give our users every information necessary to help them pick the
               perfect carpool buddy.” Read more about their security policy <a href="http://www.tripda.com.sg/security">here</a>.</p>
              <p>Meduna is similarly heartened by the response Tripda has received from its Malaysian users.</p>
              <p>“Malaysia was the first Asian launch for us. There is definitely a 
              high demand for our service among students and people commuting for 
              work. What made Malaysia the right market was its very established roads
               and highway network, and high population of cars. Furthermore, Internet
               penetration and Facebook adoption is high in Malaysia which is crucial 
              as users require a Facebook account to login to Tripda.”</p>
              <p>In addition, Meduna believes that the rising costs of owning a 
              private vehicle in Singapore and Malaysia is a huge incentive to jump on

              <h3>And so we did.</h3>
              <p>Being the environmentally-aware budget hunters we are, we were all 
              for the concept of splitting costs for a journey with the additional 
              bonus of it being for a good cause.</p>
              <p>While we understand that the app was initially intended for 
              long-distance travel, the main gripe we had for the the app was that 
              Singapore is too small an island to travel between cities. As a result, 
              all searches became arbitrary in that it would always churn out results 
              “from Singapore to Singapore”. The results may vary for app users in 
              Malaysia, given its much larger size. This little bug might however be 
              the least of its worries for now.</p>
              <p>Safety concerns still remain an issue for us, especially with newly 
              registered drivers with little or no reviews. We were also uncertain of 
              the degree by which Tripda would be able to scan drivers, especially on 
              more intangible aspects like character and credibility, given that they 
              are not liable to larger organisations (like cab drivers are). It would 
              help to make stringent scanning processes more transparent to potential 
              passengers.</p>
              <p>As a result, their marketing strategies might have to be more finely 
              tuned to the Asian consumer in these aspects, I would daresay, before 
              they will be able to gain considerable traction.</p>
              <p>That being said, Tripda provides an intuitive, hassle-free platform 
              for people to hitch a ride and make new friends along the way. It is 
              certainly a platform I wouldn’t mind trying out once in gains traction 
              in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But only if I have a friend with me.</p>

              Carpooling is not new, if it works....long long ago, it would had worked. 
                  
              Let them go pool lor...then see if they can tarhan each other or not, typical local resident car owner where got go and share his or her car with you...with the most expensive car price in the world , you think they will share with you for a pathetic few dollars...you think they will not mind the race, the smell, the instruction to turn left and turn right, the high ego strangers from other countries telling you to go straight, turn left, turn right??...
                  
              All this foreign business think everything can work in Singapore, but singapore is unique in a way of multi racial, conservatives and mind your own business people..not a homogenous one, nor a gracious one.

              <p>This one different from colleague car pooling where everyday you do the same thing with the same person.  This one machiam taxi..you car pool with the stranger maybe only once.</p>
              <p>Take car, reach destination, pay and f**k off. If like, tomorrow can do again.  If no like, no need to car pool tomorrow.</p>
