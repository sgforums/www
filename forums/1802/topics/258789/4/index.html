            <div class='col-md body'>For the technologically challenged at the bottom of the well:<br><br>"Europe : Orange Business Services launched a new GPS navigation application to be downloaded on to a range of mobile devices - including smartphones and PDAs from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, BlackBerryÂ™ and Orange - providing its business customers with a real-time, cost effective solution.<br><br>Powered by Webraska, a leading provider of GPS navigation solutions, Sat-Nav from Orange can be used when walking, cycling or driving. Rather than having a specific device just for this application, Sat-Nav from Orange works on a range of mobile devices making it a cost effective business investment. All maps and live traffic updates are held on a central server and are downloadable from the internet via Wifi, 3G, GPRS or the Orange EDGE network onto the mobile device. This saves precious memory space and ensures that maps and points of interest are always up to date.<br><br>Sat-Nav allows users to save time, fuel and money by working out the most efficient route to a destination. According to navigational analyst Canalys "The mobile GPS navigation market is doubling year on year in EMEA. By the end of the year 14 million Sat Nav units will have been sold in the UK of which around 1 million will be on smartphone devices." Sat-Nav on mobile devices means that users are free from the constraints of having a fixed device. Users can switch modes of transports, whether it is pool, hire or their own cars and can even get directions when walking.<br><br>"Using Sat-Nav on your mobile means businesses can save time and money. It is easy to use and enables businesses to streamline the number of devices they have to purchase and manage" said Gareth Williams, Group Manager Solution Products, Orange Business Services. "The location based service market is currently around Â£55m and estimated to double by 2009 according to the Yankee Group. Orange is well placed to capitalise on this opportunity through our brand, channel reach, customer service and understanding of how applications work in a mobile environment."<br><br>The application is quick and easy to install on a number of mobile devices and once installed, it is easy to download routes. The detailed maps from NAVTEQ are stored on Webraska's servers and hold information on hotels, restaurants, parking and other useful points of interest as well as speed cameras and live traffic information. The maps are updated every three months and therefore more up to date than standard Sat-Nav devices for which users need to buy new maps on an annual basis.<br><br>Once each route has been downloaded, Sat-Nav from Orange provides GPS-triggered real-time, turn by turn voice instructions, clear maps with road names and pictograms of turns, which provide accurate directions, even in the most built up areas. Favourite routes can be saved to mobile devices. The real-time road traffic information allows routes to be optimised according to traffic conditions and enables automatic re-routing should traffic conditions become challenging.<br><br>Jean-Michel Durocher, Founder and EVP of Webraska, said "Working together, Webraska and Orange have produced an application that can help you get to wherever you need to be, by the best possible route, whether you are in your car, walking or on a bike. It offers all the benefits of a traditional Sat-Nav unit with real-time access to new maps and the latest information whilst eliminating the need for expensive and bulky hardware equipment."<br><br>Pricing &amp; Availability<br>Sat Nav from Orange is priced at Â£150 excluding VAT. This includes the software license, a GPS receiver with in-car charger and a car windshield or fan grid for the mobile device. The download of journey routes will be charged at standard pay as you use data rates.<br><br>Real time traffic information is available for an additional annual charge of Â£27.59 excluding VAT. Maps for all of Europe are also available for an additional annual charge of Â£27.59 excluding VAT.<br><br>Sat Nav from Orange is available on a wide range of devices and five different operating systems . In terms of coverage the application includes mapping for the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and The Netherlands as standard, and easily extended to all of Europe. Service and availability are subject to terms and conditions. Further details can be viewed at www.orange.co.uk/business/satnav and the application is also available from Orange's SME applications showcase - an online portal that delivers easy-to-use business tools for small business customers to help them manage every element of their business - for further details visit www.orange-applications.com."<br><br>(http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/Nov2006/3983.htm)</div>

That payslip comes from the horses' mouth...Poolman will probably say it will be a very poor cabby who only earns 1,200 a month. Not a comfortable amount to get by? Plenty of foreign workers get by with half that amount....that's why if we allow foreign workers to drive cabs, we will solve the problem of driver shortage WITHOUT having to raise fares. Foreign cabbies are more hungry than local ones.<br><br>Local drivers will have to work harder not to be put out of a job. Everyone faces global competition...the local radiologist who cannot compete with the ones in Bangalore will lose his job..period. If you cannot compete, you are out. Too bad....<br><br>Taxi companies will not need to raise fares to attract drivers who want a higher monthly wage. If our foreign cabbies become spoilt like local ones and demand to earn at least 2k a month before they will drive, sack them! There are plenty more foreign drivers overseas all too willing to take their places. GPS is a one-time cost which is easily recovered. You can raise rental fees for cabbies and foreigners will still want to be cab drivers. Getting 1k a month in air-conditioned comfort is better than working for $600-800 a month in the sun. The higher the rental charges, the harder the cabbie must work to earn his monthly income. Local drivers refuse to drive in those circumstances...I am saying that foreigners who have a worse deal currently are more than willing to step in....let them!<br><br>Tired drivers being hazards? What about tired doctors and civil servants? If you cannot take the pressure, you are out. In any case, the shift system limits the number of hours a cab driver is on the road. I would require all cab drivers to go on shifts of 8 hours...everyone will have the same number of shifts during the peak hours and the midnight shift with few passengers. This will force them to get every single fare during their shift. If they don't succed, they canbnot compete and they are out. Let those who can remain.<br><br>With foreign cabbies, there is never a shortage of drivers. </div></blockquote></div>
