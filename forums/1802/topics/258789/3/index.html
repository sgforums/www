The problem is not the booking system. There is no rule that requires a cabbie to throw a passenger out to accept a booking when his taxi is occupied. Check your information and not just rely on old wives' tales.<br><br>Local cab drivers are just not hungry enough to work harder. People have some experience with gardening will know that many plants do not flower if you water them too well and give too much fertilizers. They will grow leaves but not flowers. You have to starve them a little..it's the stress that makes them flower. It's the same with local cab drivers...you've got to starve them a little.<br><br>Flood the market with foreign cab drivers. If this lot will not work harder for the current fare, there are plenty of bangladeshi, indian and chinese workers who would! </div></blockquote>If you say that first hand accounts from cabbies across all the major taxi ranks are BS, then I can tell you that whatever people fling into the ST forum can be construed as third hand information they glean from their experience as well.<br><br>ST forum is another place for consumers to simply bit<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ch about their problems. Any verification needed? Probably same as what you and I write on a web forum.<br><br>Use some intellect in your reasoning for once and stop thinking that you can get around arguments so speciously.<br><br>Your argument that our cabbies are too free, is simply an opinion, and frankly, I don't think you have any place nor credibility to claim more marginal accuracy than those who live and work in Singapore at the moment.<br><br>Like I said, care to address the fact that foreign cabbies won't operate the same way under current management policies?The only way that this might even remotely succeed is to allow greater private taxi ownership and reduce the industrial grip of the companies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Cut the night rental fees by 40-50% as well, to ensure that taxi drivers are not penalised and therefore need to accumulate booking fees to level out.<br><br>(Can someone clarify the proportion of the booking fee that goes to the driver?)<br><br>Secondly, raise the booking fee to $6 to ensure that people do not book on a whim and fancy. That should sieve out those who book out of convenience and those who can afford. The law of averages should straighten things out.<br><br>Instead of simply playing the salary game which will not enhance the profession, sort out the management first. Leave the workers alone. Bringing in a foreign player will not solve anything. What makes you think they won't play the same game? It is puerile and wishful thinking that they will play a wage game if there is no regulatory action. </div></blockquote>Actually , booking is meant for urgent cases for transport ..... but commuters , kiasu commuters set-up the trend , abuse the facility until the situation like that .....<br><br>True , raise the booking to $6 , i agree , but cannot take out the facility totally , must think consideration for those people who .... like those people staying like Sunset Way ... very deep in , where taxis never go in , to provide them with a facility .<br><br>Also like those staying at Coronation Road West , no buses , only cars and taxis as transport , they will need a cab when they go to the airport , so booking is a must .<br><br>When a pricing is set-up , taxi company also must consider this , whether the pricing will caused a set-back , like causing more drivers to quit . Which they can't afford ....<br><br>There must be a balance .<br><br>Every $4.00 booking , $0.70 goes to the company , for every $2.50 booking , $0.40 goes to the company .<br><br>Nothing is free .<br><br>Comfort Delgro generate 14.1 million of booking last year , each bookings they took $0.50 , imagine their revenue ? 7.05 million for the facility ..... tell them to take away the state-of-the-art award winning booking facility , like stealing away $5 million from them .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

There are plenty of bangladeshi and pakistani cab drivers here in an angmo country. There is no added charges for booking a cab and the fare is lower than the big london cabs operated by mainly local british drivers who are required to pass a difficult examination. London cabs are allowed to ply the streets. Small taxi cabs driven by mainly foreigners can only respond to booking. That is a better system for us.<br><br>Even doctors have to compete with doctors from Myanmar, India etc. and local radiologists have to compete with  those from Bangalore. Why not cabbies?
