            <div class='col-md body'>REPORTS on recent discussions of the Land Transport Authority (LTA) with the public on a review of land transport did not bring out any plausible solutions likely to be acceptable to the LTA or transport operators.<br>Bold steps are needed.<br><br>As a senior citizen who travels on a concession pass, I find our public transport system good, comparable to the First World.<br><br>The only thing I wish to see removed is restricted hours so the elderly do not have to watch the clock and remember the concession window.<br><br>I am sure more bus operators competing for the same customers will further improve the service level.<br><br>Taxi service is part and parcel of public transport in any city. It is not a private chauffeured service but rather a better version of the minibuses in Hong Kong.<br><br>Conveniences carry a premium, and the efficient management of the taxi fleet in the land transport system makes the difference.<br><br>To solve the perennial problem of taxi shortage requires political will from the LTA to try new approaches with boldness.<br><br>Fair benefits for cabbies, operators and commuters should be in the equation. Perhaps the following drastic changes will ease the problems:<br><br>Abolish all surcharges and make phone booking a means to direct cabs where they are needed most. This will eliminate negative incentives to cabbies and increase passenger-carrying capacity of every cab on the road.<br><br>Increasing surcharges will only exacerbate the problem. The recent increases did not improve the situation. The crux is imbalance of supply and demand due to unavailability of drivers and not cabs.<br><br>By all means increase the flag-down rate and charge more for extra distance travelled.<br><br><strong>Don't blame lack of cab drivers for inability to cope during peak hours. Allow foreign drivers to fill the gap. If Singaporeans don't want the job, let foreign workers keep the cabs moving and be productive. Don't let lack of cab drivers hold us hostage. </strong><br><br>Let cabbies earn more with higher productivity and hard work. Waiting for phone bookings for extra money is counter-productive and nurtures a bad work attitude.<br><br>If cabbies can earn decent fares without coerced incentives, why should they wait for phone bookings and resort to 'hiding'? Instead, they will be hunting passengers so they can earn more income.<br><br>Paul Chan Poh Hoi<br><br>(Straits Times 4 June 2007)</div>

Upping surcharges may work: Minister' (ST, May 31).<br>Minister of State for Transport, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, rightly pointed out that as the taxi service operates like a private, chauffeured service, more price differentiation is appropriate.<br><br>Demand for taxis in the city area is usually greater from Monday to Friday between 8pm and 11pm when most people rush home from work and shopping.<br><br>During this period, cabbies driving passengers from the city to the outskirts may find it is not financially viable to drive back to town. Instead, they prefer to cruise around the neighbourhood, even though the chances of picking up passengers are slim.<br><br>To encourage and compensate cabbies for the time and diesel lost driving to town, perhaps the Land Transport Authority could implement a CBD surcharge of $4 from Monday to Friday between 8pm and 11pm.<br><br>The $5 airport surcharge from Friday to Sunday from 5pm to midnight has seen long queues of taxis at both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. Because of the surcharge, I was told some cabbies even drive all the way from Jurong.<br><br>With the new surcharge, passengers need not call for taxis and the problem of cabbies going into 'hiding' to wait for calls will disappear. The surcharge should be implemented on a six-month trial basis and scrapped if it does not work.<br><br>Poh Soon Leong "<br><br>There is no need to increasing surcharge to solve the shortage of cab drivers if we bring in foreign drivers from the Philippines, Sri Lanka and China. The government has been protecting local cabbies for too long. It's time they face up to the pressures of competition from globalisation like everyone else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>getting foreigners to drive singapore cabs..i really don't think much people will be able to agree to this issue...when i take cabs..i often talk to the drivers and they would tell me that.. there are ALOT of taxi drivers on singapore road already..so earning money for them is a tough task..thus..i do not think that there is no shortage of drivers out there at the moment of time..well in the near future..if there is really a shortage of cab drivers..i dun mind foreigners driving cabs..</div>
