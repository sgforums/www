All this caused her mood to deteriorate rapidly.

In the end, the alternative taxi we arranged picked her up. All this caused our ceremony to be delayed longer and longer.<br><br>Luckily, at the Furama Riverfront Hotel, our event manager Jason Ang and staff were by now aware of what had happened. They reassured us everything would turn out just fine and not to worry.

It is hard to enjoy something this important when you are still getting over the close brush with disaster you have just had.<br><br>Only through prompt action by our friends and excellent service from Mr Ang and the staff at Furama Riverfront Hotel did our day proceed at all, and we gratefully acknowledge their special efforts for us.<br><br>So, all brides and grooms- to-be, ensure you not only book your taxi and confirm it, but also check again a couple of hours before it is due to ensure it will actually turn up.<br><br>John Tunstall<br><br>Queensland, Australia<br>(20 June, Straits Times)<br><br>The groundswell of discontent is rising....bring in foreign cabbies.

Cut the night rental fees by 40-50% as well, to ensure that taxi drivers are not penalised and therefore need to accumulate booking fees to level out.<br><br>(Can someone clarify the proportion of the booking fee that goes to the driver?)<br><br>Secondly, raise the booking fee to $6 to ensure that people do not book on a whim and fancy. That should sieve out those who book out of convenience and those who can afford. The law of averages should straighten things out.<br><br>Instead of simply playing the salary game which will not enhance the profession, sort out the management first. Leave the workers alone. Bringing in a foreign player will not solve anything. What makes you think they won't play the same game? It is puerile and wishful thinking that they will play a wage game if there is no regulatory action.</div>

There is no rule that requires a cabbie to throw a passenger out to accept a booking when his taxi is occupied. Check your information and not just rely on old wives' tales.<br><br>Local cab drivers are just not hungry enough to work harder. People have some experience with gardening will know that many plants do not flower if you water them too well and give too much fertilizers. They will grow leaves but not flowers. You have to starve them a little..it's the stress that makes them flower. It's the same with local cab drivers...you've got to starve them a little.<br><br>Flood the market with foreign cab drivers. If this lot will not work harder for the current fare, there are plenty of bangladeshi, indian and chinese workers who would!</div>
