              <p>Any taxi drivers on the graveyard shift face any scary encounters like ghosts pretending to be passengers asking you to go to the cemetery?</p>
              <p>My uncle who's a taxi driver faced an encounter where he picked up a passenger along Kiliney Road at 3am asking to go to the Japanese cemetary...Wah lau..can imagine his fear..3am going to the cemetary..some more, he mentioned that the "passenger" wasnt local and he talks like got water in the mouth..then when he arrived at the entrance of the cemetary...all he got was thank you and he disappeared..no doors were opened when "he" left..the back seat was all dirt,leaves and wet mud...the next night, he went back to the place at Kiliney and he found joss sticks and offerings at where he picked that "person" up...</p>
              <p>He still got alot of stories at more haunted places like ECP, Punggol, Buangkok...</p>

              <p>i was really really scared..i knew something was around me while i was waiting for a cab..u know that kind of feeling...the best part was when he ask me that...my friend also got kana before at ECP...but the taxi driver was his father...and he was waiting for his father to pick him up..he was at the bus stop when his father actually drove past him and made a full circle around him before picking him up...of course he was pissed off when his father did that..so when he went inside the taxi, he asked his father why he did that but his father was silent throughout the journey until they reached home where his father told him that while he was waiting at the bus stop..a small ghost was sitting on his shoulders playing with his hair while a woman in white with long hair was looking at him and holding his hand...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
