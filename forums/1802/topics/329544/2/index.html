              <p><br>I still remembered in sec 3.. I had this friend who has the third eye thing.</p>
              <p>And we had lunch at mac and were walking towards the bus stop...</p>
              <p>We walked under a building because it was sunny...</p>
              <p>And suddenly she stopped and said "I can feel it."</p>
              <p>I froze and was like, "What?!"</p>
              <p>She really creeped me out and I just had the feeling she was talking about that kinda 'thing'  and I just ran towards the sunny area. LOL.</p>
              <p>After that she followed me out and was asking me why I ran.. The 'uncle' went around her in circles touching her. She said that when I was beside her that 'uncle' could only touch her on one side.</p>
              <p>Freaked me out totally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>

              <p>I was an army driver in Kranji Camp. My unit often have our exercises in the Lim Chu Kang Traning area. There was one night, actually early morning, when I had to send some people back to camp during an exercise. Somehow, no specialist or officer actually went back with me to the training ground. Left Kranji Camp about 2am or so alone in my very slow Land Rover (max speed 50km/h) to go back to Lim Chu Kang.</p>
              <p>Like Poolman mentioned, driving along the well lit road beside the cemetery and Lim Chu Kang Camp isn't bad. The scary part comes when the four lanes merge to a single bending road flanked by trees all the way to the Jln Bahtera area (where there used to be a few HDB flats and a coffeshop). Over here, you seem to always expect something to be on the road at the next bend. And my Land Rover couldn't zoom past many hundred metres in a few seconds. :( </p>
              <p>Nothing actually happened, but I have to admit it was kinda scary. Second scariest drive I've ever had.</p>
              <p>The scariest has to be in Pulau Tekong where my unit were having our range. After the night shoot which finished after twelve, I have to ferry the men in the unit back to the camp where we were staying from the range.</p>
              <p>Again, I'd travel from the range to camp with a 3-tonner full of people, and return to the range for the subsequent trips all alone. It's even scarier driving a 3-tonner all alone with forest on your left and right in a place where you've heard so many stories about. Here, you expect something to just appear in your front passenger seat beside you! I kept my eyes on the lighted part of the road all through the 10-minute drive back to the range. No left or right or upward glances at all. I did 2 or 3 of these trips to complete the detail. Again, nothing happened. But that was arguably the scariest moments of my life.</p>
              <p>I think I OTed a little.</p>
