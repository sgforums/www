              There are many holding steering jobs, only different for taxi drivers, they hold much longer per day, boatmen are needed in SIngapore water,  they also hold steering, if you are willing, can go training and certify yourself, then can drive for companies like York, penguin and so on at Marina south n pasir panjang and west coast pier, just like taxis, but then, steering a boat is more excited and less holding, hopping from island to island, ship to ship. Per trip is at least $150, go hope still got fresh seafoods.
              
              Bus drivers also dun hold steering like taxi drivers, so are many others. 
              
              The key here is do not expect you life to change much as a taxi drivers, many are waiting for changes that will not come, for in life, u do not wait for changes to change, you must change yourself inorder to expect changes
