              <p>Taxi Drivers, don't worry. You won't lose your job. SMRT's condition for the deal is that all of its Taxi Drivers must get a job at Grab, otherwise SMRT won't sell their taxi business to Grab.</p>

              <p>Why would GRAB want to take over taxi business? So far till now it had the competitive advantages as an IT app company providing booking services to phv and taxi only, and not a transportation services provider so it does not fall under any LTA rules and regulations. Taking over taxi business means it'll be a game changer for GRAB with more liabilities, even phv the car also not directly under GRAB.</p>

              You think they want to take tax business??? they dun even want SMRT staffs not to mention the taxis.
              
              In 2013, grab and uber started, they promised this city, in a years time, we will all be using apps, but now is 2017, and taxi population only reduce the most 1000, est from 27000 to now 26000. And taxi drivers are still going strong, although some have thrown keys and move on, so are Uber and Grab drivers throwing key at apps rental companies and coming into taxi driving.
              
              So, do you think Grab and Uber is successful, did they uphold their promises, motto of taking over the market??? The answer is NO.
              
              And now, as the supply of cars and taxis is almost full or overly supplied that end up taxis long Q at taxi stand, Phv drivers parking along road, shopping, ap waiting for calls, and still Uber and Grab are chasing for drivers to suck more in, do you think they are able to sustain with taxis remaining strong and unwavering?
              
              The answer again is No.
              
              So, what do you think grab will do??? if I cannot beat you down, I might as well eat you, and that is why grab will do, killing off Taxis by buying over them, but not running it as taxi companies, but as grabtaxis or any other initialves. This will kill taxis faster, just buy over their shares, and off goes SMRT of 3400 taxis, that will reduce the taxi from 26,000 to 22600 in just a few months.

              <p>SMRT has longed to exit the bus operations years ago. It is not surprising and in fact better for SMRT to sell its loss making operations  like taxis and buses and put their primary focus in improving the rail operations instead.</p>
              <p>With the implementation of bus contracting model, it will be better for other operators to take over SMRT bus services, providing better bus services while better managed without being in the red all the time. And SMRT can fully committed it's resources to improve rail operations. It's a win win situation for both bus and rail system as a whole. </p>
              <p>It is also more logical for SMRT too if it wants to operate long term without continuing holding on loss making operations. Looking at the reasons on why wants to give up its taxi business, it's a matter of time they sell the cab and bus business, since improving rail operations and profitability is more important to them in the long-term. </p>

                              <p>You think they want to take tax business??? they dun even want
              <span class="">SMRT</span> staffs not to mention the taxis.</p>
              <p>In 2013, grab and uber started, they promised this city, in a
              years time, we will all be using apps, but now is 2017, and taxi
              population only reduce the most 1000, est from 27000 to now 26000.
              And taxi drivers are still going strong, although some have thrown
              keys and move on, so are Uber and Grab drivers throwing key at apps
              rental companies and coming into taxi driving.</p>
              <p>So, do you think Grab and Uber is successful, did they uphold
              their promises, motto of taking over the market??? The answer is
              NO.</p>
              <p>And now, as the supply of cars and taxis is almost full or
              overly supplied that end up taxis long Q at taxi stand, Phv drivers
              parking along road, shopping, ap waiting for calls, and still Uber
              and Grab are chasing for drivers to suck more in, do you think they
              are able to sustain with taxis remaining strong and unwavering?</p>
              <p>The answer again is No.</p>
              <p>So, what do you think grab will do??? if I cannot beat you down,
              I might as well eat you, and that is why grab will do, killing off
              Taxis by buying over them, but not running it as taxi companies,
              but as grabtaxis or any other initialves. This will kill taxis
              faster, just buy over their shares, and off goes <span class="">SMRT</span> of 3400 taxis, that will reduce the taxi from 26,000
              to 22600 in just a few months.</p>

                              <p>Taxi Drivers, don't worry. You won't lose your job. SMRT's
              condition for the deal is that all of its Taxi Drivers must get a

              Grab.</p>
              <p>I'm more concerned about the taxi fares. Hopefully, the increase
              in size would enable Grab to reap economies of scale and lower taxi
              fares, and not motivate Grab to take advantage of its size to
              increase taxi fares.</p>

              Grab is a tech coy, not taxi coy, in competitive industrial, the big fish will eat the smaller fish first, then become bigger, then will go find bigger fish to eat until they become the biggest.
              
              Grab will not go an run a taxi coy, which to them, is an old and out of date industrial, if I can kill off 3,400 taxis and covert them into car for drivers to rent and use my apps, why I need to do taxi business which is lan pa pa lan.
              
              And furthermore, the selling came to a standstill is because GRAB put it upfront that THEY DO NOT WISH TO EMPLOY THE SMRT STAFFs. Meaning, about few hundreds of SMRT taxi staff will hv to go, including their servicemen and repair centres..from director to cleaner...all gone. This is the cutting point to show you all that GRAB is a tech coy, not a taxi Coy, and that they will kill off SMRT taxis for good.

              Aiyo, you do business or not, if I cannot compete with you or that you are blocking my business, if I got $$, why not sit down and we discuss take over, I paid you, you happy become rich and offload all yr work, I take over, no more competition, or lesser, in the market, you see many companies are doing this, big fish eat small fish, and it is also an economic of scale to let one run the show than so many doing it.

              Singapore taxi business is a sunset business. 
              Phv is the alternate option with lower cost to operate. Buy taxi business, what do u gain? Grab cannot compete n smrt taxi is blocking grab business? U must be dreaming.
              Big fish eat small fish is when the small company got potential to become a threat. Buy over n kill them off.
              Where is the threat from smrt taxi? The threat is getting smaller as each day pass.

              Sunset??? no lah, cdg still come out with new Ionic Hyundai cab leh.
              
              Only a 1000 gone, no a big problem, and most of them are because of old age and health issue, if fact, with lesser cab, we get less competition, the youngs like UG, kenna chop with surge price, they also call, but remember, our old are more than the young, if not why school and JC hv to merge.
              
              Yesterday nite, one young sweet girl I pick from kallang bahru, destination Bukit Panjang, I asked her, why u, like all other youngsters use Grab or Uber, she said, those are blind rats following each other, in fact, why I flag for taxis is because JG, grabcar all surged, now flag down is the cheapest...so you think SUNSET??

              Because u r now the cheapest. How often when u r cheapest?  When other got left over. Your rental is no way cheapest.
