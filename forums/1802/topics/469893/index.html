              <p>Wow I never imgained last Sunday, when I exposed Bj for the fraud that he is, I would have so many laughs at his expense. And not only me, so many have been laughing too.</p>
              <p>Oh yes, what's score? I would say something like 18-3 to Uncle Joe. Oh dear BJ will say, I got banned. Well let's put it this way, if you offered BJ this choice last week, which would he have taken?</p>
              <p>a) Let my old account stay and not expose him as a cheating married homosexual, living a lie.</p>
              <p>Or</p>
              <p>b) Get me banned but exposed all his dirty deeds, like forcing himself on a poor China boy and his poor worker.</p>
              <p>I think the answer is obvious to everyone. For me I will take the ban anyday to expose a liar like him. Gosh ban me again also good, I had a super week, kena 4d and lots of laughs, plus now football season over, I also got less time for forumming. Unlike you BJ, I dont come online to find gay men, I come online for football.</p>
              <p>Btw do you have any more 'family advise' for me, Rbs or Jdil? How to become good fathers and husbands. Please do tell us, I just love to learn such things from a cheater like you. You're a pathetic hypocrite whose lies have been exposed again and again?</p>
              <p>Need some more evidence?</p>

              <p>What are the chances that the person junxiang would post a thread about shitting with a video on 30/8/2012 and bingjmames would make a similar post in sgforums, with the same video?</p>
              <p>Or bingjames would post his hp no in this forum while junxiang would post the same no in blowing wind?</p>

              <p>http://www.blowingwind.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=18476&amp;page=3</p>
              <p>Lol it's been real fun bj, junxiang or is it Michael Tan B Y? Many thanks for the entertainment. Btw we also talk about karma right?</p>
              <p>http://bukitpanjang.chaosads-singapore.com/item/115/</p>
              <p>How about  that for karma? Preying on your straight worker and the worker then selling your business info to your rival? Well I think that is karma.</p>
              <p>But yes, I'll admit Uncle Joe is not very clever, even I got fooled by your assault case, until I read some of the posts about you elsewhere. I actually thought you were an innocent victim and maybe Poolman too, arguing over this case, when in all likelihood you weren't telling the truth about the assault. I was stupid to believe that until 1 guy posted about recognising the assailant. Ya man, Chwee Chuan is such a small estate with rich people. Rich people will be the first to pass info to the police. They guy would have been caught within days, not go unidentified like this. Good stunt you pulled there playing an innocent victim!</p>
              <p>Anyway all the best to you. And also thanks for telling us exactly where cocunut tree is = Fort Canning eh? And all the drama in LV. I didn't realise you and 756 were such firm friends! Oh you think he's my source? Well think lor. To 756, I have this to say, we haven't met, talked or called each other or even shared a PM in here, but if you got more dirt on BJ, please go ahead share it everyone, it'll make all of us laugh even more!</p>
              <p>Ok I got to go. Don't worry Uncle Joe will 'disappear again', but who knows when he'll resurface with more juicy stories (or disgusting to many). Btw don't worry about me telling your wife, you can go live your miserable life of lies, I got better things in life to bother than be a filthy lying hypocrite like you.</p>
