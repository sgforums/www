              Then we also close one eye and use it lor, and btw, what is Cdg call today??? nearly 1/2 gone, so, have or dun have also LPPL. And nearly half of cdg drivers are now on grabtaxis, once grabtaxis give promotion only...ping ping non stop...ya, they take 50cts, cdg levy only 30 cents, but who care the fark abt that 20cts different. This autobid stuff had been around for many years liao, not new. And in fact, SMRT and other taxi companies MDT already got this feature in it, Cdg, knn...driver hv to go secretly buy themselves, and every month also hv to pay fees one hor.

              <p><br> Then we also close one eye and use it lor, and btw, what is Cdg
              call today??? nearly 1/2 gone, so, have or dun have also LPPL. And
              nearly half of cdg drivers are now on grabtaxis, once grabtaxis
              give promotion only...ping ping non stop...ya, they take 50cts, cdg
              levy only 30 cents, but who care the fark abt that 20cts different.
              This autobid stuff had been around for many years liao, not new.
              And in fact, SMRT and other taxi companies MDT already got this
              feature in it, Cdg, knn...driver hv to go secretly buy themselves,
              and every month also hv to pay fees one hor.</p>

              Not much calls still want to bid, in the meeting, I already told tammy and yang that cdg should abolish bidding call, the basic fundamental of coming out with bidding system was that it gives 2 cabbies instead of just one, that was when times were good, many cdg calls, today, 
                  
              nearly 60% taken over by grab and uber, still you want to autobid??? even grab and ber just assign job, if the driver do not take it, it will lock up and give it to the next available driver. Told them to go back to assign call, no more bidding
