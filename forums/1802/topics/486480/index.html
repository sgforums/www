              SINGAPORE - A 53-year-old man was killed after he lay down in the middle of a road and got hit by a taxi at Jalan Sultan. 
              
              The accident took place early Monday at around 3am. According to Lianhe Wanbao, the victim, Mr Zainudin was arguing with an unknown woman before the accident took place. Following the argument, he walked to the third lane of the road and proceeded to lie down. 
              
              A taxi that was driving on the same road then hit him and the body was dragged for 20m before the taxi came to a halt. Blood could be seen flowing out of the body. The cabby, known only as 60-year-old Mr Goh, was driving at around 60km/h and could not brake in time after seeing Mr Zainudin. 
              
              A passenger who was in the taxi did not know that the taxi had hit someone and asked why the taxi had to be stopped. Mr Goh called the police after seeing the Mr Zainudin's injuries. The cabby appeared to be calm when he was interviewed. 
              
              He told reporters that he had been driving a taxi for 21 years and this was the first time he was involved in such a major accident. He said he felt that his taxi licence will be revoked following the accident. Mr Goh added that he felt surprised that Mr Zainudin's companion left the scene of the accident even before the police arrived. When the cabby got down the taxi, he saw the woman crying beside the body. 
              
              However she was nowhere to be found after Mr Goh went back into his taxi to call the police. A witness who only wanted to be known as Ms Liu mentioned that Mr Zainudin and the woman had been arguing for 10 minutes before the accident. 
              
              The commotion can be heard by people at nearby shops. Another witness who wanted to be known as Mr Liang mentioned that the couple reeked of alcohol when the accident took place. The accident is currently under police investigation.

              Said Mr Goh: "I believe she must be his friend or relative. She knelt by his body and started crying and shouting. "It is odd that she didn't stay to help the police in their investigations." 
                  
              HOTEL A cleaner from a nearby hotel said the woman had run into the hotel and continued crying for around five minutes before leaving. The man was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics, said a police spokesman. 
                  
              Mr Goh, a cabby of 21 years, was arrested for causing death by a negligent act. He said he was worried about losing his taxi licence as a result of the accident. Before his arrest, Mr Goh, who had a passenger in the rear of his taxi at the time, told Chinese evening daily Shin Min Daily News that the passenger could testify for him. 
                  
              "The passenger did not even know that an accident had taken place. He even asked me why I had stopped the taxi suddenly," said Mr Goh. "He found out that something bad had happened only after he alighted."
              
              A receptionist who wanted to be known only as Miss Liu, 32, said Mr Zainudin and the woman had been arguing outside a row of shops just before the accident. "The man's voice was especially loud. The loudness alarmed some people in nearby shops," she said. Miss Liu added that she went back to her work after the couple quietened down 10 minutes later and left. 
                  
              Another witness, who wanted to be known only as Mr Liang, 36, told Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao that the couple had smelt of alcohol. Mr Zainudin and the woman had walked to the middle of Victoria Street, where he suddenly lay down on the road angrily. 
                  
              The woman ignored him and continued crossing the road, said Mr Liang. "I wasn't sure if he was planning to get up, but in any case, it was too late as the taxi ran over him. It was very shocking," he added.

              Arresting him is a protocol of Police rules, will release him. Case can be consider suicidal case, and if so, canning on the death shall proceed. Limpek as hearth operator, ever see dead body get canned one hor..like it or not, it is the protocol and laws of this country.
