                                                  USA chickens , airflown , and can pay by credit card , and still
                                                  got link points if pay by Link cards .</span></p>
              <p>Yes you are right on that.</p>
              <p>O...taxi now go to fresh usa chickens, airflown.</p>
              <p>So the only ones that got...the below stated.</p>
              <p>Till today no other taxis got that.</p>
              <p>Only the biggest taxi company, you take their taxi can pay by credit card, not only that all major bank cards by net, the own cabcharge card, the voucher, e-voucher for corporate.</p>
              <p>They are controlling this portion and we are still enjoying this pool of customers.</p>
              <p>And their calls. the island wide kiosks.</p>
              <p>This is their weapon.</p>
              <p>But over there the red... only one CNG and those incentives. and only 900 units too small...to the giant.</p>
              <p>This is their weapon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How ....the red ahTau must come up with something new. hope he can.</p>
              <p>So both must go into cockfight arena.</p>
              <p>So all taxi drivers get benefits...this is what we wanted.</p>
              <p>Luckily you still never signup..smart among all....as an hirer and now your position as mentioned (Relief hirer) the king (hirer listen to Relief)..good move.</p>
              <p>So our rental like sonata or wish will be heading south ...should be good.</p>
              <p>They are taking too much from us. like the mosquitoes.</p>
              <p>So are they not enjoying the goose laying golden egg. not only that paticular company as mentioned before. Both are the same.</p>
              <p>Why? now CNG prices as mentioned by you.</p>
              <div id="post-body-9358530" class="body">
              <p>Up to $1.36 per kg at Mandai ...</p>
              <p>And up to $1.46 at Serangoon North Ave 5 .</p>
              <p>CNG @ Toh Tuck same  , $1.32 per kg before discount
                                          .</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So again....who? will dislike not to take more in business</p>
              <p>sympathize to those poor cabbies struggle those 12 hours for only those  one hundred plus or sightly more take home pay...and the vehicle owners.</p>
              <p>Gimmick again right.</p>
