              <p>Yes...we know, we know  red rhino those red cabs those 900 units...many are talking now...those incentives. How? and where they got to give is a mystery.</p>
              <p>Talking about that $100 rental still some fishy over here.</p>
              <p>Actually prime their other petrol driven is still below $80 on their rental and those six dollars daily came up similar with your kind sum exactly around $11000, hehehe.</p>
              <p>Nobody is stopping for not to drink that cup of coffee. Since those 900 oredy commited. Here we are just discussing about this (bonus incentive) that they are now giving out like santa claus...  in this world where got such fat sheep... slaughter and shared the meat to every each and everyone who joined them without any sacrifice...even (koban) you need to pay for the sheep than the meat is distributed to the needy like what my kakis was telling a malay cabby....here nothing at all. yo</p>

              <p>of course when Union buy this Wish , they are there to market their product against Sonata , if Sonata , a cheaper Korean car can rent at $105 , a more expensive Wish can also rent at $100 , and for us , it's reasonable . Not i said , 900 or even more now , would agree with me .</p>
              <p>Not forgetting , A CNG car has got $8000 Government rebate , this is where they got their money from .</p>

              <p>i tell you what , the only way to lure back the drivers , is to revamp the whole fare structure again .</p>
