              <p>Hi, Callcabby, 2 things...</p>
              <p>1. If u still intend to drive nite, whybe a hirer?. Plenty of hirers looking for nite relief, unless you live in those few places where there are few hirers. (ex. Dover Cres.)</p>
              <p>2. 6 months flies past very quickly. i would go for the 6-month crown option and switch to sonata after that. my friend did that, just started with the crown 2 weeks ago. tahan only 6 months. i heard no need deposit? after that hit the ground running with a new sonata. got $$$ from comfort, take. now they're stuck with a lot of unhired crowns.</p>
              <p>hmmz, more and more competitors now. all the best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi Bro KCTK,</p>
              <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
              <p>Was trying out nite relief but realised not used to this lifestyle. More of a morning person. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>My concern is actually the reliability of the Crown that will be assigned to me. Dun want to get a lemon.</p>
              <p>Any tips to look out when taking vehicle?</p>
              <p>Thks!</p>

              <p>no prob bro. tips..no lah. jus the usual things...brakes (test it) , brake lights, lights, meter, mdt, tyres (bald?). other than that u dun have much choice, do you? jus check the things related to safety and rice bowl. maybe almost 99% are lemons and the rest salted prunes. jus hope that u get "the best among the worst" and pray that it doesn't break down too often.</p>
              <p>day shift, we can't hit the highs that nite shift drivers can ($300 is a dream, like a perfect game in bowling). we've got to work longer hours too in order to get the same collection. but the consistency of daily collection is there. ultimately, all things being equal, at the end of the month both get about the same income.</p>
              <p>did u check wif them still got the member-get-member scheme? if have, i introduce u, benefits all u take. a cup of kopi-ci will do. milk comfort for all they're worth mah.</p>

              <p>Hello..Callcabby as you know you already 1 mth on road,  the only good thing about comfort... they got islandwide diesel kioks, how convenient anytime you need to call-off, we just headed to the nearest kiosk..than back to base. Easy like abc.</p>
              <p>Only thing just can't understand when fuel is headed south diesel still the same now fuel headed north slightly still diesel is the same. But those days we got rebate on diesel purchase, today nothing at all.</p>
              <p>Without..still below market price. (actually those rebate or incentives are they not your own money). just like those vendors selling their mechandises... buy two get one free, actually you are not paying for the three.  Knn where got so good ones.</p>
              <p>About comfort...plenty of calls and advance,cashless not talking those major credit cards on market,  like cabcharge card their own... corporate clients plenty taking only comfort taxi during day shift did you notice.</p>
              <p>Basically still this is the best. sorry i am not canvassing for than IMO.</p>
