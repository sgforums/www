            <div class='col-md body'>That's what taxi was meant to be , taxi not really for middle working class citizens  , who is claiming the cost of living has rise .<br><br>Taxi are meant for tourist , foreigners in S'pore for businesses , and they are the one who is still the happy lot .<br><br>They willing to pay for luxury , and got a cab , with ease . That's it !<br><br>I always emphasis taxi is meant for luxury , privacy and rapid .<br><br>If u not willing to pay for those criterias , u are right to bracket yourself as "boycotters" .<br><br>That's my 3 cents worth of opinion .<br><br>I dunno .... i got less nasty customers nowadays .<br><br>My customers seemed to be more generous after the hike . Those nasty , more kiam siap ones took MRT and buses liao .<br><br>Peak hour or non peak hour , doesn't matter anymore , they just need a cab .<br><br>When u need a cab , u just need a cab .<br><br>If u need to think 3 times to take a cab , 4 times glancing at your wallet , 5 times to look at your watches , and waited 30 minutes after 7.30pm just to get by the peak hour , just to take a cab , go ahead take a bus , u should be home by then .<br><br>As for LTA to implement those policies on buses ..... Can they do wht taxi do ?<br><br>Buses is still on a fixed route , isn't it ?<br><br>Dunno la .... good luck to Singaporeans .<br><br>Go and fit yourself well into buses and MRT , it'll save u alot of money .<br><br>Taxi drivers too busy with tourists , expatriates ( who taxi fare can be re-imburse ) , and some rich Indonesians aunties at Orchard Road . And our multi-million MNC Corporate clients .<br><br>Ironically i hit another high after X/mas and New Year eve .... dunno how , just did well on a Friday evening , so-so only , very busy during peak hours .<br><br></div>
