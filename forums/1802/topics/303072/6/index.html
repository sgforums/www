              <p>Taxi drivers like Poolman have no respect for their own profession. They do not see themselves as providing a public service. If cab drivers can refuse to pick up passengers from a taxi stand to get a more lucrative fare, doctors can refuse to treat poor patients in hospital and see wealthy ones instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is the reason why we must open up to foreign competition. There are plenty of Indonesians and Malaysians waiting to drive our cabs for farlower fare. Let the likes of Poolman starve...teach them a lesson they won't forget.</p>

              <p>hey oxford, you are back... still at foreign taxi driver har? aiya, why u keep attacking a single cabby?.... u study so much... you should know if you want quantum change, attack the big fish like the legislators... if you dare write to ST forum....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, it seems like to message by the leaders here is that if you work hard, it is ok to be greedy and ask for more pay.... doesn't that sounds like a familiar scenario to you?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think Poolman only drive few hours on Thurs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I drove Wed, Fri and Sat pm shift... from my experience, no need any strategy... business is very good everywhere even after midnight mainly cos supply is much reduced...all over the island connection is good...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clark quay long q of pax with very few cabs.... some even on call at 3am at clark quay... amazing business for those who choose to drive through CNY... I earned enough to make up for poorer business after CNY liao... btw Tay, from your experience, taxi business will be bad from coming Mon onwards till end March issit?</p>

              <p>Hi ALN,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for sharing your experience.  I asked Poolman for his comment if he had any strategy for CNY as I learnt from his previous posts and deduced that he may be a person who tends to plan before executing.  Since CNY is not a typically day but a year to year affair, I would think he will still plan in this ever changing environment for this festive period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am glad to hear that your business was good over the CNY period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I havent had any taxi experience yet.  Last week, I have just received a letter from LTA for the approval to undergo a medical checkup and register for the taxi academy course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So there.. I still have a long way to go.  I would like to learn as much as possible prior to doing the real thing.  I guess nothing beats learning from real professionals like you and Poolman.</p>

              <p>Taxi drivers to starve ? The worst i ever earned as a taxi driver , since the fare hike ...$60 salary .</p>
              <p>I looking forward to the Youth Olympic , good luck to Singapore .</p>
              <p>I also looking forward to the 2 IRS ...</p>
              <p>I also looking forward to the F1 Night races ...</p>
              <p>I also looking for a few new daily flights from Scandinavia .</p>
              <p>I already enjoying those trips from T3 regularly ....</p>
              <p>I also looking forward to the good demand of AirAsia ....</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers to starve ?</p>
              <p>I still will say this , cabbies going to earn $4K a month , which foreigners and those FTs would only envy !! Cabbies does'nt need to work averagely 18 hours daily to earn that amount .</p>
              <p>Those Indian IT fellas earning only $3500 , they need to contribute 18 hours average daily .</p>
              <p>Cabbies are going big times !!!</p>
              <p>The fare hike really gave those people like those Mushroomhead a slap on their face , cos their dreams of cheap taxis will never come ! The dreams of bullying foreign drivers will never come . The dreams of living like a king will never come . The dreams of third world transport never will materialised .</p>
              <p>They forgotten , they're in Singapore .</p>
              <p>Or they can go back to their own country and enjoy those 3rd World transport , taxis driven by Mexican , Turkish , Columbians etc .....</p>
              <p>I will never starve , cabbies will never starve if they ever learn the trade with strategies , wits and hardwork . And keep healthy !!!</p>
              <p>Good luck to those people who wants foreign drivers , really good luck to them !!!</p>

              <p>oic you are still going thru training.... good luck... i need to 2 times to clear the module on location</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>me also a new part time cabby (5 mths)....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So far I would say it is very important that you have keen interest driving (long hours of driving can be tiring and frustrating) plus steady driving skills (accidents are very troublesome and expensive)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other things are ok to be picked up during taxi-ing such as road network, drivers' rules, pax demand etc</p>

              <p>Taxi drivers like Poolman have no respect for their own
              profession. They do not see themselves as providing a public
              service. If cab drivers can refuse to pick up passengers from a
              taxi stand to get a more lucrative fare, doctors can refuse to
              treat poor patients in hospital and see wealthy ones instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is the reason why we must open up to foreign competition.
              There are plenty of Indonesians and Malaysians waiting to drive our
              cabs for farlower fare. Let the likes of Poolman starve...teach
              them a lesson they won't forget.</p>

              <p><br>My wife came back from UK few months back. The taxis are not polite at all. And they asked her to stop just before the airport terminal in the middle of a drizzle and walk unsheltered for few hundred metres. And they only open boot for white pax. Asians and blacks are treated inferiorly even when they are paying pax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In when I was in a taxi in US, I told one cabbie that the traffic light just turned green. He replied that he was turning and asked me to leave the driving to professionals like him... knn so rude and still must give tips</p>

              <p>GPS devices are not that effective, especially in concrete jungle Singapore. I've personally seen 1 work in Germany, and buildings there are not as packed as in Singapore. In addition, the route may not be the most efficient. Weighted Dijikstra shortest path algorithm is effective, but there are just too many other factors that GPS cannot take into account of, that something an experienced human driver can make use of.</p>
              <p>And if the government does do what you suggested, it will be hard for them to explain why they get foreigners to work in this occupation when many Singaporeans do want to do them; their original basis was that low income foreign workers are doing jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the recruitment is by the companies. I believe I saw adverts that taxi companies only ask for citizens at the moment. Citizens will of course know Singapore way better than PRCs, who will need quite a number of years before knowing all the landmarks around; such things cannot be memorized.</p>
