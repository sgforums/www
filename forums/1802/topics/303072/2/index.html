They will just raise the rental charge and the taxi fares.<br>2. The worldwide economic crisis might cause a recession and maybe with many many losing their jobs and turning to driving taxis.<br>3.

The direct route is take CTE exit AMK ave 5.<br><br>Usually when pax tell me destination, i will quickly visualise the destination and my present location and think of all possible and smoothest routes.

Can you highlight us as we are all beginner should say green, hope you can share some of your knowledges over here.<br><br></div></blockquote>I always use my way of asking : "Is the CTE , alright ? "<br><br>Usually they'll asked : " Any jam now ?"<br><br>It's silly to me ( cos they stay AMK , usually they know the situation better ) , go by Thomson also not any good , so i'll replied : " Not as bad , cos now got ERP ! "<br><br>This is my way of tackling customers , i gave them no options really . Any other options can still be negotiate , but tat's to my style ....<br><br>It's CTE or CTE ....<br><br>Then i'll drive all the way CTE , exit AMK Ave 5 , upon reaching , even if i knew where's blk 608 , i'll still asked : "Go straight , sir ? " ..... Let them lead u to blk 608 , like that guarantee no wrong doings . If u anyhow humtum , sekali wrong , then u're inviting complaints for nothing , ask better !<br><br>I never like asking : "U want to go by which way ? "<br><br>when u ask this way , u gave them an option , his option can be more difficult route compare to my option .<br><br>This is what i call interaction skills .</div>
