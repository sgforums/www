              <p>foolsh_2000. This you are wrong liao. Some ppl got full time job sibei eng one. Especially if you know your job nature well, plus if it's relaxing sure find additional income to sustain.</p>
              <p>1 example, 8am to 5pm job. give you basic 3k. after 6pm can drive till 10pm. earn $50 nett. plus if hirer, take benefit and find day relief for weekdays. Drive sat and sun. No work life balance...</p>
              <p>But this kind of maths equation can sometimes backfire...hee. So dont ever do this kind of fomulating. Of course can if really gian $ but still....how long can u tahan? give you 1, 2 weeks...by the 2nd month you already half shag mentally and physically. If dont gana accident heng la. Taxi breakdown...or your main job got affected when the coy requested you to run shift...alot of things can happen.</p>
              <p>So what i say is sometimes ppl do take risks without calculating the end results but if you never try, you never know. There are some relief drivers out there like me hold a main job and drive as a relief. Still this formula of taking 2 jobs is manageable but on the long run, how long can you tahan? </p>

              <p>getcarter you are wrong liao. I am cash tight due to my debts of close to $20k. and my new BTO flat will be coming in 2 years' time. Need to save up for renovation. Will have to clear within a year or so and make sure my credit reputation is clean for the next 6 months.</p>
              <p>If you ask me why not chiong and relax?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got into 2 accidents recently when driving for 3 months liao. The accident not jialat one. all is kissing nia.</p>
              <p>1st is kiss backside, only drive 10km/h, damage $300. I see no damage but TD threaten to report to SMRT so lan lan pay lo.</p>
              <p>2nd is posh car front right side kiss taxi front. 50 - 50 case. Driver is valet but not sure the other party will claim CDG. So no claim, damage is $150 for my taxi's dent. If other party claim, at most excess 1K nia.</p>
              <p>I Drive 4 nights a week, start @ 630pm target hit $100 nett, keep car @ 1am with no 1/2 rest for kopi break somtimes really lugi.</p>
              <p>Just because to hit $100 nett can really go crazy plus still i new driver also, alot of road names not so good. Now i told myself liao. got $50 to $100 nett liao can liao. Dont hit also never mind. At least not so stress, and dont need to tolerate the fucking pax attitude. If i have a fucking pax in my car, i sure fark the pax upside down. Especially the ah-neh.</p>
              <p>So driving for 3 months liao, most important must have enough sleep / rest. Got hit - no hit dont think so much. But dont be lazy..hee.</p>

              <p>getcarter you are wrong liao. I am cash tight due to my debts of
              close to $20k. and my new BTO flat will be coming in 2 years' time.
              Need to save up for renovation. Will have to clear within a year or
              so and make sure my credit reputation is clean for the next 6
              months.</p>
              <p>If you ask me why not chiong and relax?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got into 2 accidents recently when driving for 3 months liao.
              The accident not jialat one. all is kissing nia.</p>
              <p>1st is kiss backside, only drive 10km/h, damage $300. I see no
              damage but TD threaten to report to SMRT so lan lan pay lo.</p>
              <p>2nd is posh car front right side kiss taxi front. 50 - 50 case.
              Driver is valet but not sure the other party will claim CDG. So no
              claim, damage is $150 for my taxi's dent. If other party claim, at
              most excess 1K nia.</p>
              <p>I Drive 4 nights a week, start @ 630pm target hit $100 nett,
              keep car @ 1am with no 1/2 rest for kopi break somtimes really
              lugi.</p>
              <p>Just because to hit $100 nett can really go crazy plus still i
              new driver also, alot of road names not so good. Now i told myself
              liao. got $50 to $100 nett liao can liao. Dont hit also never
              mind. At least not so stress, and dont need to tolerate the
              fucking pax attitude. If i have a fucking pax in my car, i sure
              fark the pax upside down. Especially the ah-neh.</p>
              <p>So driving for 3 months liao, most important must have enough
              sleep / rest. Got hit - no hit dont think so much. But dont be
              lazy..hee.</p>

              That is why I keep insisting, whatever happen in taxi driving, do not get into an accident, altho I know you can not avoid it, but try to minimise it, and to do that, you need a clear and physical mind, and to hv a clear mind, drive lesser, relax, and dun be stubborn or take short cut like illegal U turn, be steady, there is no such thing as chopping head in driving taxi
