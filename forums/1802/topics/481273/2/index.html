              The above regulation govt more on property of large entity, like warehouse or big factory space the one own and decided to rent out, there are many landed property owner living in private and landed house are not declaring their rental except if they rent out the whole house, and for goodness sake, HDB is not your property, it is leased for 99 years only, smlj property are you talking about when even private property owners are not declaring and HDB declaring??? siao bo.

              Once you declare, you will be under their radar, IRA work as the same principle as our govt, they like to induce fear, propagate news of those validating the income, which are mostly those doing business and rich. For mere pathetic rental of room, you go ahead and declare, reporting to HDB is a new rules, why, because of lots of illegal rental and immigrates, some end up with 10 in one room, the govt want to stop all these, but they are not going to clamp you down for INcome tax.

              Logically speaking, a smart person will not declare, until IRA come or asked you (which they will hardly do). then you act blur, oh really, these also must declare ar? so just declare lor, but for nothing go declare for what, as I said, declaring is easy, but the erase it, even when you no more renting, you might hv to go down to IRA and bang table, WHY YOU PUT RENTAL INCOME?
              
              When our govt said they give you a rod to fish, they never said they will teach you how to fish and what fish you are going to catch is no their problem, they just provide the rod, and if you are going to teach them how you fish and what fish you are fishing, then, they will gratefully welcome you.
              
              J007 is right, just declare your core income
