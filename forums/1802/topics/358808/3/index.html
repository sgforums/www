              <p>You know how many road are at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.</p>
              <p>Ha...try more above 90 than make more often. if by using my  sonata, the MDT with three red bars appear and continue often.</p>
              <p>I dun know but few of those night taxi drivers. are wondering.</p>
              <p>Why? letter coming from LTA with $150 and 6 demerits point, cannot appear at TP HQ. night nobody watching no white mouse on and above overhead bridges.</p>

              <p>driving night shift , it's all about friday night fever and holiday eve .</p>
              <p>Saturday wise . Saturday 5pm start , pace quite slow ... but until after 9pm , can be non-stop . Up to 5am in the morning .</p>
              <p>Saturday midnight ( sunday morning hours ), one must learn to cruise around housing estates before rushing into town .</p>
              <p>Got chance to connect another one to anywhere one .</p>
              <p>Day shift friday and holiday eve , their wages differences , day shift cannot match those from night shift .</p>

              <p>So really the effect is very great...( in america some bank share going for a burger price or slightly more this current situation).....do you still want to drive taxi?</p>
              <p>But maybe the next few days, will be better because many navies from various countries is here...RnR good for the nights perhap. But not for long.</p>
