              <p>usually i forecast myself 6 days , cos i don't work on Sunday .</p>
              <p>If Monday , i get only $145 out of $195 i need ....</p>
              <p>Then Tuesday i would strife for $195 + $50 = $245 .</p>
              <p>If Tuesday i did only $180 , i still lacking behind $65</p>
              <p>Then Wednesday i would go full speed for $270 .</p>

              <p>Hi bro newguy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so u drove 11hrs to collect $220?</p>
              <p>from poolman's comments its still a respectable amt of roughly $130. if i can have this on any mon to thurs nite, i would be satisfied....:)</p>
              <p>but then like what poolman said, sometime high sometime low, got to motivative ourselves for the next day if current day is low, that is sure a good way to keep the salary level where we wanted...</p>

              <p>if u calculate newguy average collection everyday , $220 .</p>
              <p>minus diesel say $40 , rental $50 ...</p>
              <p>His take home roughly nett $130</p>
              <p>A month solid $4030 without rest !! Solid 7 days per week work
                                      .</p>
              <p>So this is the data for a newbie on night shift taxi driver.</p>
              <p>Just another curiosity... for this amount how many sleeping nights are you going to sacrified and can  how long will you still go on as in this trade for your take home pay of $130 per night as example.</p>
              <p>Sorry to say.</p>
              <p>Those fast food chain helpers per hour is $4.50 an hour, if night shift taxi driver like example $200 for eleven hours, my calculation is an hour $11.82 per hour people are sleeping you are struggling on your steering. So now all newbies bo wah right...so think? interesting  as you thought, big bucks. easily 4 digits pay. try it than you know.</p>

              <p>hi guys back from my 5th night , and my first weekend/Holiday eve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so sorry for the netted and collection missed information, still not very familiar with the lingual. Ya, i collected 220 on Thursday</p>
              <p>started at 5pm as usual, i chiong all the way till 4am, its really a big difference compare to normal week days, so many pax, every where you go, no need queue one leh, picked, go, then picked again. <br><br>I discovered alot of ulu places where there is actually Pax waiting but no cabs....hehe..<br><br>ya, and i was driving all the way, and finally after the peak hours, i took my first rest, and go easy between 8-12 midnight. not too bad, every where got pax...so happy..</p>
              <p>but then end of the day, calculated, collection is $310. =( ..is it good ? i don't know man. but from what Bro Poolman had shared, i am still away from $360..<br>but its much better then weekdays. I am contented...<br><br>i drive like mad leh, speeding, cut lanes, chiong ..ahhahaha,.....but i gues its worth the hard work.</p>
              <p>Got some qns to ask my shifu here,</p>
              <p>the speed of driving , how will it affect the taxi fare ah ?if i drive 110 km/h is it cheaper from Point A to B compare to 80/90 km/h</p>
              <p>Yes,  i really agreed its sheer hard work , you think its easy? try it man...haha...you will know.Like Bro poolman and ALN first told me, Ask so much no use, hit the road, then you know..now i know...ahhaaa</p>
              <p>regarding the collections part,</p>
              <p>well, i think 190-200 is acheiveable ,but then really must pia one..cannot dilly dally..i don't queue when i see more then 10 cabs, i think its not worth it.just my views. i would rather go smewhere else.</p>
              <p>for that amount of work/ income, i think 7 days aweek will kill me, so i work 6 days, sunday is my off day...i need that to recharging ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bro jim, i think if u driving for 8 times a week , provided you can get a hirer who wants to let you drive on fri/Sat.  target 1500 is also cannot reach one la....why not target 800. then if u get more, you will be happy..If target too high, cannot reach, very demoralising i think. ya...so you still want to drive , from 2500-800</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bro kin</p>
              <p>regarding your calcuation on per hour pay structure, effective for a average weekday collection, of about 200. working for 10.5 hour  hours after minus rest  1 hour and pump petrol 30 mins . it works out to be about  $200- $90= 110 / 10.5= $10.50 per hour for me.</p>
              <p>but our weekend is double 50% more pay ...cos collect about 300. then per hour rate is $15 on week end</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not alot if you look at it this way, but i think its better then a average office worker, who say salary is $2600 on average ,working on 5.5 days work at 9 hours per day.  per hour is about $12</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so you still want to drive taxi !!</p>

I am contented...<br><br>i drive like mad leh, speeding, cut lanes, chiong ..ahhahaha,.....but i gues its worth the hard work.</p>
              <p>Got some qns to ask my shifu here,</p>
              <p>the speed of driving , how will it affect the taxi fare ah ?if i drive 110 km/h is it cheaper from Point A to B compare to 80/90 km/h</p>
              <p>Yes,  i really agreed its sheer hard work , you think its easy? try it man...haha...you will know.Like Bro poolman and ALN first told me, Ask so much no use, hit the road, then you know..now i know...ahhaaa</p>
              <p>regarding the collections part,</p>
              <p>well, i think 190-200 is acheiveable ,but then really must pia one..cannot dilly dally..i don't queue when i see more then 10 cabs, i think its not worth it.just my views. i would rather go smewhere else.</p>
              <p>for that amount of work/ income, i think 7 days aweek will kill me, so i work 6 days, sunday is my off day...i need that to recharging ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bro jim, i think if u driving for 8 times a week , provided you can get a hirer who wants to let you drive on fri/Sat.  target 1500 is also cannot reach one la....why not target 800. then if u get more, you will be happy..If target too high, cannot reach, very demoralising i think. ya...so you still want to drive , from 2500-800</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bro kin</p>
              <p>regarding your calcuation on per hour pay structure, effective for a average weekday collection, of about 200. working for 10.5 hour  hours after minus rest  1 hour and pump petrol 30 mins . it works out to be about  $200- $90= 110 / 10.5= $10.50 per hour for me.</p>
              <p>but our weekend is double 50% more pay ...cos collect about 300. then per hour rate is $15 on week end</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not alot if you look at it this way, but i think its better then a average office worker, who say salary is $2600 on average ,working on 5.5 days work at 9 hours per day.  per hour is about $12</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so you still want to drive taxi !!</p>

              crusing speed no impact at all to collection... only waiting time of traffic light.... so whether 120km/h or 60km/h all the same.... 
              
              but say from one traffic light to the next, first cab zoom there in 1 min and wait at traffic light for another 1 min to turn green... 2nd cab took 2 min to reach there and by then green liao.... the first cab will collect more.... haha.... but me not advising u to do that hor....

              <p>for me I don't really monitor my collection while driving felt really putting additional stress for myself</p>
              <p>I just make sure I fulfill these conditions</p>
              <p>1) Pax connection try not to break more than 10mins</p>
              <p>2) Be as fast pace as possible but safety always FIRST</p>
              <p>3) Suggest using expressway as much as I can to save time &amp; cut fuel usage</p>
              <p>4) When really can't get pax for very long,I just hit the expressway &amp; chiong to the next town &amp; change the "fengshui" it works for me:)</p>
              <p>By fulfilling these conditions I'm always pleased with my collection end of the day...Do my best and like what you guys said,let the sky decide for you:)</p>
              <p>Just a little update: I'm no longer a OMO horse already found 2 relief:) 1 driving 6days morning &amp; 1 driving Sunday/PH</p>
              <p>At least I can enjoy my life better now</p>

              <p>I think people usually don't expect young men to drive taxi due to the fact that many cabs are driven by uncles and those that have retired. You can't change stereotyping.</p>
              <p>And I would recommend getting a handphone with GPS capability? Not sure how much a GPS is, but for nokia phone, GPS is at $90/year. For e71 if i'm not wrong.</p>
