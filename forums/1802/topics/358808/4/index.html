              <p>Wow suprised! Received reply from TP today. Appeal successful..."In view of the circumstances, no further action will be taken against you"...Now registered as warning. So this one my second warning oredy. Probably no more pang chance next time. I guess maybe it's my first time appealing. Really must say a big THANK YOU to Ms. Winnie Wong of Drivers' Services. Really made my day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>2 ways of looking at this. Master degree can go 'down' to be a taxi driver when times are not so good. we as full time drivers with so much commitments per month have no where to go when passengers becomes scarce and also to put up with more taxis on the road.</p>
              <p>don't want to be pessimistic but this is it.</p>

              <p>to mr lion: one golden rule to follow - whatever we are doing now or later dont be complacent, think of new creative ways to do the same old thing :)</p>

              <p>Dun worry,</p>
              <p>As a politician  even our MM also kenna... those kind of remarks from the former Malaysia PM.</p>
              <p>Who care...as long as you are doing the right thing, why ?need him to comment about.</p>
              <p>If a man does its best, what else is there.</p>
              <p>So what wrong as a taxi driver.</p>
              <p>as long as we never put our  two hands without anything asking for money around.</p>
              <p>We need to go for test  and like you recently graduated from the taxi acadamy and pay rental on taxi and fuel and going around sending paxs to their destination, in-exchange with the dollar for that service.</p>
              <p>What wrong with it?</p>
              <p> As a taxi driver.</p>
