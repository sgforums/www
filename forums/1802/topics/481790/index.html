              <p>chewyl, you must go experience it. It's difficult to tell you how but it's still always best to experience OJT ( On Job Training ) practically.</p>
              <p>and 1 advice to you, dont set your expectation so high, you will feel pain when you cant hit it daily. You will be depressed.</p>
              <p>You must learn how to aim small, start small. Rather than, set so high. Unless you are like those old birds eg, Bro bowah, keepthechange, etc..so many to list.</p>
              <p>Start by taking baby steps, then adult steps.</p>
              <p>Anyway, enjoy your learning as TD on the road.</p>

              dun listen to the above TDs...:p
              Some ppl says out of 10 TDs 9 are xxxxxxxx
              Definitely as a TD, you need to set target and be discipline during your shit.
              But not monthly target.
              A daily target is a must. 
              Once you reach the target, can close shop and go hom to rest.
              Many ppl misunderstood target as stressful etc...target can be a low figure not necessary a high target. with a daily target, you will be able to finalize and estimate your monthly income as a TD....
              
              you may want to contact my ex-chief who is a master coach for newbies wanting to learn TD trade :p

              Aiyo, brother brother..I set up course, then those taxi lecturer income will go down, mai lah, leave a road for people to eat. Everyday on the road, there is at least a 1million paxs, and now there is about 27,150cabs.

              Logically speaking, the pie is 1 million divide by 27,150, each cab if equally share, will get 36paxs per day, cheapo or good paxs, nobody knows. 
                    
              And then this 36paxs is further divided by 2 shift, end up each driver get 18paxs or trips, good trips or bad trips depend on luck. 
                      
              Let say/taking each trips on average of $10, your target should be set at $180, take away rental, fuel, you should be able to get a net of $80 to $100 per day.

              $180 target per shift is achievable, relax relax, but must be discipline lah, not say go here talk one hour, go there eat, go here eat, meet here and there, then end up chionging the road due to short of time.
                  
              Some set $300 400 type...very fast up lorry one.
                  
              In life, there is 2 ways to our final destination, one is the fast way, the other is the slow way, either way, you will reach yr destination, however, the fastest way, will eventually end up reaching the destination and up the lorry faster, so, take your pick.
                  
              And finally, the most important thing of driving taxis or limo, whether huat or obk, please dun get into an accident, not only put you in trouble, but will also mentally demoralise you, but of course if people come and hit you, then, no choice, that is part of taxi driving hazard.

              <p>You must learn how to aim small, start small. Rather than, set
              so high. Unless you are like those old birds eg, Bro bowah,
              keepthechange, etc..so many to list.</p>
              <p>Start by taking baby steps, then adult steps.</p>
              <p>Anyway, enjoy your learning as TD on the road.</p>

              $1000 a day, still ask me $50??
              
              This is a normal target setting base on the demograhpic and situation of TD and paxs in Singapore, $180 is not a high setting, some cabbies I see, set at $400 per shift, siao liao si bo? Then drive until go law koon chu instead of buying ang mo chu. Hair drop, hands shaky, legs wobbling, skin wrinkled, ..everyday must take red bull and pills...haiz.
              
              Therefore, set a reasonable achieveable target, then if you get $200, huat liao lor, if get $1000, huat tua tua liao..

              My target during TD days is very simple
              
              Let's say my cost of driving (rental + petrol) is $X
              
              My take home income is minimum $2X
              
              To put it simply, income has to be 2/3 of the revenue 
              
              If not ...knnbccb .... taxi company earn all the money....
              
              some ppl make $30 nett.....petrol+rental says $70
              knn....bo hua like this.......slogging for the smlj company

              pick.</p>
              <p>And finally, the most important thing of driving taxis or limo,

              you in trouble, but will also mentally demoralise you, but of
