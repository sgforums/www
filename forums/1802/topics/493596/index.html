            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 31px; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #222222;">Where do you think the most haunted bus stop is? Well, you should have guessed it right: it’s near a cemetery, but not on the cemetery road itself.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 31px; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #222222;">Known fondly as the “Jalan Bahar bus stop” to ghost hunters, the bus stop is just a few stops away from Choa Chu Kang cemetery, with only one bus, 172, stopping there. Occasionally, during certain festive periods like Qingming Festival, a special extra bus, 405, would be activated, catering to the crowd.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 31px; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #222222;">The legend of this bus stop dated back to many years ago when taxi drivers circulated accounts of a long-haired woman in white dress flagging them down, and asking to go to the cemetery which is just a few bus stops away.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 31px; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #222222;">Initially, the taxi drivers just felt weird, but as more of them knew about it, they realise it could be more than just coincidence: that the white lady was a spirit that lived near there. After all, it doesn’t make sense for one to be there so often. Up till today, some taxi drivers would not stop when they see this figure there in the wee hours.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 31px; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #222222;">Because the bus stop is pretty near to an SCDF camp, there has also been a case whereby two of the recruits were possessed, saying scary stuff like “you can’t get me out…” The possessed recruit refused to tell his friend about what has happened during his “possessed” state.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 31px; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #222222;"> </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 31px; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #222222;">With so many tales about this haunted bus stop, the Singapore Ghost Hunting Club went to investigate it in 2009. They did not find the mysterious woman, but according to their video, they did smell frangipani in the air—and usually frangipani scent indicates that a Pontianak, a female ghost who died while pregnant, is nearby.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 31px; margin-bottom: 26px; color: #222222;">Also, if you watch the video that they’ve filmed, you’ll also realise the abnormal mist. No, it was not a haze as they had filmed it in April, and that was also many years back. Whatever could have caused the mist and smell have not been discovered—but what we know is that we’re convinced this is the most haunted bus stop in Singapore.</p>

              This 23 year-old youth took up a job as a Uber driver because wanted to earn enough to pay for his own school fees.
                  
              His journey ended tragically last Sunday at about 4AM when his vehicle skidded and turned turtle along Neo Tiew Lane 3, leaving him in a coma from which he never woke from. He was pronounced dead Friday morning at Khoo Teck Phuat hospital where he was warded. 
                  
              According to his 54 year-old father, Mr Li, the family received word of their son's accident from a friend at about 5AM on the date of the accident. Their son had already been in a coma when he came into to emergency ward of the hospital. After medical tests were done, doctors concluded that Mr Li's son had become brain dead.
                  
              At the time of the accident, the younger Mr Li was ferrying a 16 year old and a 18 year old passenger. Both passengers escaped without serious injuries.
