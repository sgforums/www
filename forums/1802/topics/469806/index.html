              <p>Then this cb kia go become taxi driver because got some other cb kia gay taxi driver, say can find boys for gay sex while driving taxi! Knn then tell story how he become taxi driver, how he will look at men and boys, with saliva drop! Ya man, fxxxking disgusting. People sit his taxi become his target! Then he go home pak choo cheng!

              <p>Wow this saga really got many stories. I also confused on how many gays there is now.</p>
              <p>But 1 thing confirm - Happycabby is Bingjames. I also when 1st read all this got doubt, really is Bingjames the gay. Then someone show me the connections, now 100% I sure its true. I really very disappointed in you lah BJ. You really play all of us out. Yes I'm the LV member also. Now dont say I 756 lah. He and you no need say, we all know you are enemies.</p>
              <p>But I am your friend at least until I read all the things, how you behave in here and with everyone also. How can you let Poolman and the whole of LV down? We all stand by you right? And you lie to us, even now also dont want to come clean. Still want to say this junxiang not you still? Please lah, give us some respect.</p>
              <p>Now why I choose different nick today, not because want to flame you, but because I give Poolman and Ang some respect. Why you like this one ah? Why you must always talk online very big, like you know everything, argue here and there. Argue with JR, Rbs and Jdil ok, maybe that 1 we can put aside, they also deserve it. But you argue with so many people already, still never change. Fark man even that day bro Bcl tell you off, you want to fark him back? He stop the 3 monkeys from disturb you after you kena hantam right, he expect you to keep quiet right? Who start all this again? You, yes you only.</p>
              <p>The farker JR and the other 2 maybe sabo the td forum right, anyway close liao right? Why you must go start another round with them. Dont say not you, I read everything from day 1 you spar with them. It si you who open this up again.  Chief already start a new one for us, we also happy, not need to have so many idiots come to the forum, now our own. Nobody disturb us. The 3 monkey want to tlak in here or limo cannot leave them ah? We also dont fark care them anymore. Why you must be a hero? Your English very good means you can suka suka post, never use your brains?</p>

              <p>You see for nothing your backside itchy make them go dig. Then they find you is gay. I not like them, I no need to go find which page this,and that and then show the proof. I read I see, I know is you. I dont need to embarass you after you embarass our LV group.</p>
              <p>Is not say I anti gay or what, but this kind of thing you must at least tell chief one before you join, or after you join. Then he roughly can no whether possible or not for you to stay or join. I can tell you sure got some maybe a lot also dont want you in, if you say is gay. Is just better this way, wait later sure got problems one and then the whole LV accused of bias anti gay. You want to be gay, your choice lah, but you cannot expect everyone must agree with your choice.</p>
              <p>Now you make it worse with 756. Knn why you post like that above? Must give his taxi/code no? We in LV got to do this kind of stunt or not? We got ever mention cocunut tree by name before? Where we meet? Phui lah you, do all this.</p>
              <p>Now I know what you will say, like you say where is the proof you is gay? Where is the proof that you are happycabby? Please la BJ, we all big already, we also got go for courses in the army, in real life, we also know how to put 2 and 2 = 4. Somemore you think you are so clever, you so stupid la, choose nick like happycabby. You think we all dont know English is it? Is not gay means happy? I primary school already learn this la, we got sing a song with the words happy and gay, our teacher also got teach it means the same.</p>
              <p>But even BJ, you choose any nick also cannot run. Your style of writing we all know, just look at your questions and answer, si your style right. Then for 1 year plus keep this nick aside, this saga start suddenly revive and the first thing what does he do? Talk about the gay saga. Really la you think you are clever, yes somethings maybe yes, but sometimes also you very stupid. And there is 1 more thing about your nick that confirm to me you are BJ. Like I said I dont want to cut,paste and show proof. I see, I read enough. I not small boy. Others later I will show what I mean and they will also confirm it. I already talk to 5 or 6 already, they also agree with everything. You is gay and happycabby is you.</p>
              <p>Now even your hantam case many got doubt also. Your story is not 100% one. But that one is your taichi. But what you did this few days, really make our LV brand go down. Chief I know is loyal one, he even let you in our forum let you read and see right? Even when some dont want you in, but we give him face, like I give him face use this nick. Chief will say never mind, but I know deep down he is disappointed also. Please lah Bj, enjoy your driving, go earn your money support your family, but please just leave LV. Is really the best thing you can do if you really respect our group and the friendship and help we have given you. That is what a man will do.</p>
              <p>And I dont know if you will listen to 1 more advise. Stop posting here also. Got other taxi forums, join down there, use different nick, dont argue with people. You can still be friends with our group, but not as a member. This forum is not good anymore and also not good for you. JR, Rbs and Jdil maybe are idiots, I want to use vulgar but never mind, but you mustn't think they are very stupid. Just leave them alone, wait really they go and dig some more and bring out more things how? You got think about your family, if really 1 day they really so cruel to do that how? Think lah, no need to fight, you withdraw is no shame one, but if you fight still, I think you asking for more trouble.</p>
              <p>You believe in karma right? take this as karma for you, for them tomorrow Vesak day, their karma also will come, why you must be the one to give them?</p>
              <p>Ok lah Italk so much already. You please think what i say. No need to think so many about whom am I? Maybe you even think I could be them? Also never mind, why bother right? is this really important. As I said maybe our friendship has to end, you may think I am a bad person etc. But let it end on a good note, not until the whole LV become a big mess because of you and all of us then hate you. Now we just embarass a bit and more disappointed, but we also will forget it, if you also can. Bye bye.</p>

              <p>Who is right, who is wrong, is not much of a matter, a man have to answer for his own deeds, that is call responsibility, as said, one man evil is the other man gain. Let us be more gracious, think maturely as we are so matured, forgive and if possible forget.</p>
              <p>I take grudges as something that if you keep it is like carrying a 20kg of groceries, and if you keep holding on to grudges and all these, it will just add up 20+20+20...and so on, so just imagine you are carrying 100kg around and unlike shopping bags, you are unable to offload, in a long run, you get tired easily and get into health problem.</p>
              <p>So, brothers, be it guy or gay, let us move on, offload all these grudges and you will move in a lighter way and happier without a blip of your health</p>
