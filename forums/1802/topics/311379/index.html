              <p>hello,</p>
              <p>fellow taxi drivers, what's your takes on call bookings that play you out. i have been getting such calls lately. very 'tu _an'. makes all kinds of illegal manouvres to reach pax in time and when i call, they don't answer phone or tell you they have taken another taxi already. call operator to cancel call but put on hold for ages. no choice but to wait until 'noshow' appears on screen and press. sure to spoil the mood and luck for the rest of the working hours.</p>

              <p>helo lion,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i sympathize with your plight. Me also very tu-lan with no show. My tactic is never go for call along main road unless very ulu road. Best is inside condo or minimum at void desk of HDB. If call is at taxi stand also ok - that means long q at taxi stand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So far the worst place to take call is serangoon road area. High chance of no show and very hard to find pick up place.</p>
              <p>And if you notice, there are some race who have no ethnic one...higher chance of no show or take own sweet time... not  trying to be racist here... but you observe lah... and ang moh usually wait... chinese usually very fast...malays usually dont call....</p>

              <p>No show ?</p>
              <p>Maybe i only stick around Shenton Way area  to take bookings , our Corporate Customers usually waited for me .... They first thing after gets on-board , they say : "Thank You for taking my call ! Very nice people "</p>
              <p>But if they late , i straight-away No-Show treat them . I don't wait after ETA .</p>
              <p>Depends on your call from where and time .</p>
              <p>My advice to u : " 5pm to 7.59pm , Don't take call !"</p>
              <p>Why ? Taxi everywhere , pax see long taxi Q , take and go liao ...still wait for u for what ? Pay more and still need to wait ?</p>
              <p>Take booking is a knowledge ...and experience .</p>
              <p>I also No-Show after my pax gets on-board , i save the $0.50 admin charge .</p>

              <p>Give you some tips la ....</p>
              <p>1st : Take booking and customer no-show is part and parcel of the job , u must take it like drink water . If u cannot take it , don't take booking .</p>
              <p>2nd : Be choosy to take  where  the booking from . Don't take booking from customers paying out from their own pocket !</p>
              <p>3rd : : Always head to area when booking and taxi fare can be reimburse by their respective customers  company .</p>
              <p>To point No.3 , customers who's taxi fare can be claim  , they never be bother to wait for a taxi in the Q , they will book a cab , they don't be bother to save that $3.50 for the company when he can made $Millions of dollars for the company .'</p>
              <p>All i can say , after 8pm , 98% of the people inside CBD taking taxis home , their fare can be reimburse ! After OT , if can reimburse , they will take a cab home .</p>

              <p>The Lion i don't think he's a Comfort or CityCab driver ...most likely a SMRT or TransCab .</p>
              <p>Cos normally , Comfort and CityCab dvrs quite experience at taking bookings smartly .</p>
              <p>becos we face alot of bookings each day .... we knew which area and locations customer will never run away /.</p>

              <p>$3 City charge</p>
              <p>$3.50 booking ....</p>
              <p>Cos when u're near Bras Basah Road , u will NOT get outside CBD booking , once a while , but 99% u'll kena within CBD one .</p>
              <p>From Bras Basah , i would "Guarantee" u , Suntec have calls , Raffles City have calls , Millenium Tower got call , Centennial Tower got call , One Raffles Link got call .... all this is Corporate Pax ....</p>
              <p>Raffles Link is Credit Suisse , Millenium is CitiBank NA . When Citibank booked a cab , oh dear , traffic jam at Millenium !</p>
              <p>If still cannot get .......  Head to Shenton Way , wait outside opposit Hitachi Tower , that area despatching point !</p>
              <p>Despatching jobs from Battery rd , Telok Ayer Street , Hitachi Tower , UOB Plaza ... </p>
              <p>This few places good enough liao la .....</p>
              <p>My advice , we must serve our Corporate Customers , they're our priorities , other non-booking customers , let them wait . Corporate customers are our rice bowl , we have give them priority service , cos they pay more . They pay more , they dun mind which way u go , they just need a cab home .</p>
              <p>5 years ago , i chose where i want to go , me NO Sengkang , No Punggol , No woodlands , NO Yishun  . No Sembawang , No Bt Panjang , No CCK , now with extra $3 , and call come fast , i wouldn't mind now .</p>
              <p>But still , if given a Operator Assist job , going to Sembwang for instance , i let go ... reject 1 only one .</p>

              <p>Once , 12am , i was at Jurong West St.93 , was given a job at Tiger Beer , Jln Ahmad Ibrahim , i reached Tiger Brewery about 6 minutes , i waited .... call sent out , still haven't come out , i call customer :</p>
              <p>" Boss , u on-call ? "</p>
              <p>"Yes ! Where are u ? " He asked !</p>
              <p>"Guard Room outside " i replied</p>
              <p>"Me at main road , why i cannot see u " he asked again .</p>
              <p>"Boss i waited about 10 minutes liao , are u at Tiger ? " I asked with anxious answer</p>
              <p>"No , i am at Penesula Hotel "</p>
              <p>KNN si liao ..... i replied to him : "Me now at Tiger , go down Peninsula Hotel about 30 minutes , u want to wait ? "</p>

              <p>anyway, I very seldom noshow a customer for no reason. the most recent one was for taxi stand at woodlands checkpoint.  forgot about "mas selamat" case. when I drive into woodlands, alamak, the jam so thick, u can see ants everywhere. luckily can make u-turn, tries kranji, the ants become cockroaches (lorries). 1 hour also cannot reach taxi stand. call pax but no reply. call operator but put on hold for so long. no choice but to drive off.</p>
