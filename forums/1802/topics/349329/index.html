              <p>A CABBY has been given the maximum fine of $1,000 for urinating in a public place.</p>
              <p>Yang Teck Huat admitted on Monday to urinating at Pasir Panjang Road on June 27 last year.</p>
              <p>He had alighted from his Comfort taxi that day and urinated behind an electrical box.</p>
              <p>A member of the public was passing by in a car with his wife and
                  two others when he and his uncle shouted at Yang. He ignored them and
                  continued peeing.</p>
              <p>The complainant took down the registration number and reported to
                  the Land Transport Authority three days later. The LTA referred the
                  complant to the National Environment Agency.</p>

              <p>I was not impressed with his position as an adviser on the fare
              overhaul last year as well as taxi rental , and also the current
              fare against the current economy . which must be look into
              seriously .</p>
              <p>If bus and MRT fare reduce a bit , why not the taxi fare ?</p>
              <p>Does his department taken a good look @ the situation ?</p>
              <p>I am not too impress , not upset .</p>

              <p><br>At that time when Comfort cum LTA implement the new overhaul price hike , the reason the public gets is that taxis is too little to fulfill the demand , and also due to the growing economy , time to change .</p>
              <p>As for me , i fully agree price has to be done , to balance the supply and demand , i still insist , 4 person taking a cab , cannot be cheaper than taking a bus , still is now . That was when the economy is doing good .</p>
              <p>Now we , not you alone , or me alone , the globe is facing The Worst Recession of All Time , and yet nothing has been done , all is Just talking , no actions . We want more actions , we are in terms with the public buses and MRT , as in the terms of public transport , if prices going down for MRT and buses , why not taxi ?</p>
