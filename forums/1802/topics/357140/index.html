              <p>hi poolman bro</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks for the reply..its really helpful ..at least i know what to look out for...<br>and your advice is straight to the point , practical..honestly if you didnt tell me here...i wouldnt think of those preparation.and probably will end up worst..like not enough change...overlook the condtion of car etc...<br>and ya.. i do agree that the best is to get on the road and whack and learn through expereience, different people have different threshold for being whacked! haha..<br><br>The routes, the attitude, the looks from the pax, all these is unavoidable i suppose...<br>but i think i can ride it over..i am just earnning a decent lviing...give me a chance right?</p>
              <p>then come to whether or not i can make it, looking at the number of empty cabs on the road, really make me abit worried. if i can make it..or if any seniors can share with me any tips etc.. to be on a effective optimal working schedule</p>
              <p>Regarding the Ghim Moh Kiosk, its for Comfort only right? </p>
              <p>thanks for your patience and guidance</p>

              <p>i understand that u have the initial choice of taxi company .... again , let me go thru with u the meaning of " Pool of players " .</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Comfort &amp; Citycab has a pool of at least 15,000 to 20,000 taxis on the road each day .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Silver only got 2,000 , under 4,000 i know .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">SMART under 2,000 i think . </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">SMRT got only about under 3,000 .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">TransCab is 3rd most , just under 8,000 .</span></p>
              <p>So .... go have a think , which pool gave you a better chance of getting a taxi ??</p>
              <p>Of course Comfort &amp; CityCab .</p>

              <p>For newbird .... Comfort is a good learning ladder for routes and landmarks .</p>
              <p>Until u familiarised with routes and landmark , then u switch also not too late .</p>
              <p>What's the diff ?</p>
              <p>Comfort got in-vehicle GPS ..... that map can actually help you to any destination . Although for me , not helpful , too slow ( cos i know Singapore well ) .</p>
              <p>Other companies , quite traditional , learn even the harder way . Street directory .</p>
              <p>With the Comfort's booking system , u learn quicker with routes and landmark .</p>

              me never worried about not able to find hirer.... unless u choosing only few good days a week to drive.... like me.... haha
              
              e.g. u want to drive only Sundays, hundreds of hirers will want you.... haha.... 
              
              but if you want to drive only Fri nite, they will ask you  go fly kite....haha 
              
              to me, most important asset is still steady driving skill.... next then come road knowledge.... if got good driving skill, half the battle won liao....
              
              good luck to all new cabbies.... i am sure after many moons, you will already pick up bad habits like cabby Vee liao.... haha

              To know which driving schedule suits you, you need to hit the road to find out.... then you know which day, which hour, which vehicle, how many hours you can tahan....
              
              i know some cabbies can't tahan the sun... some can't tahan jam... some can't tahan no surcharge....
              
              as a guide, most nite shifts is 5pm to 5am.... but cabbies will only drive 5pm to 1am.... unless eve/Fri/Sat or unless you beri hungry.... haha.... 
              
              Pool used to drive 445pm to 12am.... then he idle liao.... haha.....
              
              Me part time only.... Tue nite and Fri nite... me tue only 6pm to 10pm then koon liao....haha.... 
              
              but Fri me 6pm to 7am non stop.... don't try unless u really owe big money.... haha

              ya strange if got such ruling.... VL is issued by LTA.... dun think any taxi company can tie you down... esp if you are not even a hirer... 
              
              btw, u can be relief and hirer for all the taxi companies at the same time if you want... haha.... taxi companies will welcome u....

              ya changing shift is indeed a hassle... other hassles are the filling of diesel and washing arrangement.... how full is full? small rain must still wash?
              
              my current arrangement is pay fuel based on milege and pay $3 and dont wash.... shiok...
              
              
              
              
              some reliefs only get hirers within walking distance e.g. Moh
              
              some parked at hirer location and take cab home
              
              some wait at agreed timing and u send me and i send you e.g. KCTK and David Chong
              
              some rich reliefs drive own vehicle to collect taxi e.g. Kin...
              
              some cannot agree with hirer so they parted ways.... haha
              
              
              
              that's y for new cabbies, find one near your place which fits your initial schedule and whack for few weeks.... after that change or adjust to optimal arrangement... 
              
              e.g. Kin dun know sacked how many hirers liao.... haha..... David Cheong lagi solid.... dun know food tasted how many different taxi companies liao.... haha.... for me, i tried crown, sonata and merc....

              <p>new guy to be a hirer ?</p>
              <p>Wow , very encouraging ....</p>
              <p>Well well ..... ok , i started to think of being a cabby when i was a salesman , outdoor , i was then very familar with Spore roads , and here you go , i then started off as a relief for 2nd shift . I struggle a bit ... cos my ex-job is all about highways ...end to end . Being a cabby , we like highways , but not customers , customers like cheaper routes , not faster routes ! Of course some want fast and cheap .</p>
              <p>So i struggled , start from scratch , like any new bird , knowing Spore roads inside out doesn't mean it's a major advantage .... it does help abit .</p>
              <p>So i was relief i never signed up as a hirer when i was new in the trade .</p>
              <p>I will struggle even more .</p>
              <p>So i gave myself sometime to be better , then consider from there .</p>
              <p>Three years of experience , then i became a hirer . Still , i struggled a few months ...OMO .</p>
              <p>It's one of my life's biggest regret , a regretful decision .</p>
              <p>Cos OMO killed my lifestyle ....</p>
              <p>Being a hirer means nothing , only responsibilties , a burden .</p>
              <p>So i found a relief , driving back what i did best , 2nd shifts ...... to come to think of it , a hirer driving night shift , no diff to relief driving nighty shift .... so i quit last year .</p>
