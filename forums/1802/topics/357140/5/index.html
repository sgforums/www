              <p>So uncle day shift the pasture is not green either, circle links is our enemy, swine flu is another, and many loss their job became taxi drivers all taxis are out at anytime, so more taxis so more competition, many others.</p>
              <p>Anywhere you go... not pax but more empty cabs, for me PT not a big issue, no ikan besar. ikan billies pun boleh...haha.</p>
              <p>Those day when you started your engine just logged MDT...many ting ting  sound keep coming.</p>
              <p>But now not hectic and stressful like before.</p>
              <p>Street job... taxi beggars are more,  don't know what is catapult are for. here they wack there they wack, here they turn there they turn, all roads became a racing circuit for them to practise. For me take it easy your is your not your dun chase for it, like what you told safety are more inportant than those few singapore notes.</p>

If you decided to head  Taman Jurong not too happy also tuas industrial potential. So where, now Jurong west or Jurong east thinking maybe heading town than break free. This area also potential tuas you go, or the most  longer journey  they offer is to  MRT station. They will go MRT to town after alighted you cab maybe 1 or 2 will go by cab to town. stay tune on day shift.</p>

              <p>oi alvin, who say i no time to read forum. still follow. got nothing new to say so keep quiet. day shift strategy very simple. morning peak hours hdb towns for street hire, condo areas for bookings. after that go until where queue until where by finding nearest shopping centre/polyclinic/office/...actually cruise also can get pax. but must know which hdb town which street. as i mentioned some time ago, morning peak in the west, after 8.30am everywhere. after 9, north/northwest gold mine. anyway, what we know already all other uncles also know. it's how to get that competitive advantage. cos now it's 0.5sec between you and the next taxi. personally, i never queue at airport cos shift time is limited. 5km out from airport. sure got pax. within 15mins. airport queue at least 30mins. unless pick n go at airport. last time got, nowadays no more already.</p>
              <p>pool, omo can hit average 4.5k pm. my friend driving 15yrs this amount he says can get. he drives 6am-8pm 6 days. sunday off. got 2 relief, 1 daily nite shift 8pm-6am rental $20. sunday whole day 2nd relief. so his rental only $83, diesel about $50, running cost about $130-$140 per day. 6am-8pm can collect ave. $350. BUT NO LIFE!!!</p>

              <p>woodlands early morning no need think, checkpoint queue or mrt station queue. after 8am maybe ok. 9-11am gold mine. everywhere pax and not many cabs cos many already headed to town with pax. same situatution cck/yishun/semb. ave. 3 &amp; 7 don't need to see. woodlands ring/circle die earlier cos near admiralty mrt. go to the 'leng-meng' drs which are away from mrt. more pax take cab. actually it's the same in every hdb town. however all the old birds already know this, so it's 0.5sec timing again. afternoon, woodlands very quiet and many cabs already returned and just hoping to pick 1 or 2 more nearby destination b4 changing shift. very very slim chance going to town unless u head to park E or senoko and wait for call. goodluck</p>

              <p>street jobs i never choose, 5cents 10cents also take. u never know this pax bring u luck - arrive destination another pax waiting to take your cab, maybe solid one.</p>
              <p>cbd after someone brings u in, dun go out empty. can queue at offices or hotels, but i think at least from 9am onwards for offices cos pple just got to work, not many will leave immediately for meetings, etc. be prepared for long queues. lunchtime raffles place any taxi stand good. if u suay, one 5cent/10cent pax bring u out of cbd. ex. UE Square. LL</p>

              <p>JW if got booking (usually b4 7am) see male or female. Male very high chance Tuas/Jurong Island. knn. if female very high chance town. take your pick, cos 7am hit town also no pax. if i kena tuas, never go back to JW cos all the cabs sending pax to tuas will go there. i min. 10km away. better chance and less competitors.</p>

              <p>street jobs i never choose, 5cents 10cents also take. u never
              know this pax bring u luck - arrive destination another pax waiting
              to take your cab, maybe solid one.</p>
              <p>cbd after someone brings u in, dun go out empty. can queue at
              offices or hotels, but i think at least from 9am onwards for
              offices cos pple just got to work, not many will leave immediately
              for meetings, etc. be prepared for long queues. lunchtime raffles
              place any taxi stand good. if u suay, one 5cent/10cent pax
              bring u out of cbd. ex. UE Square. LL</p>
