              <p>Really needed an income back then. No time to dilly dally with hirer/relief problems. Signed with Comfort 6mths and bring taxi home. (Anyway they sponsored the course and paid for my time at the academy).</p>
              <p>6mths of doing both day and night shifts makes me learn faster.  The day shift can bring you to places you don't during the night shift and vice versa.</p>
              <p>Morning customers can be more critical as most will be rushing to work, you have to know traffic conditions and be in the correct lanes in traffic jams. Some lanes move and some don't. Many customers can guide you because they travel through the same jams regularly.</p>
              <p>'Going-home' passengers are more relaxed. They most probably won't be time constraint.  That's why evening jams are slower and takes longer to discisipate. Damn those drivers taking their own sweet time where we cabbies need to be fast to make the most of time left.</p>

              <p>hi bro teolk</p>
              <p>thanks for sharing your story...i understand what you meant here....<br>i will just try to do relief and see how things goes and adjust from there , i think it will be better that way..<br><br>bro poolman</p>
              <p>thanks for your info , for a veteran like you, what you think its a optimal schedule plan for a newbie like me driving from 5-5am? like a start out route plan or smething? where do you think i should start if i drive off from Ghim Moh at 5pm? how should the plan be bro<br><br>i aso agree with the burden of being a hirer, especially for a newbie , dun even know how to make a living liao, so blur, still must stress if can find a relief, weekends still must drive to cover cost etc..all in all..the stress of being a hirer is a bit too much for a newbie i think for the starting part..i will just be a relief first and see how things goes....</p>
              <p>bro ALN</p>
              <p>yup, i agree..just whack, not happy then change hirer...but my hirer say he dun mind sending me hme, but just the hassle of waiting i reckon, what if certain days i want to stop early etc...for 100-120, i think i will have to waste alot more time as a newbie, dun think i can make it by 1am la..</p>
              <p>i have been jobless for 4 months liao, this period of endless waiting in agony sucks man, no money to bring back, every day kena nag and nag, and the LTA works so slow to issue me the licence ,sigh.....<br>although i am not sure abt taxi driving as a means to livelihood , but it sure am better then doing nothing right ? i am also worried about routes and stuff, but what to do? just got to bite the bullets and try...</p>

              <p>i started Comfort without any distraction of MDT .</p>
              <p>Cos the old man ordered Comfort to dismantle the set .. no use to him .</p>
              <p>So i started off as a taxi stand cabby . Strictly street hire only .</p>
              <p>Mind you , i have to thank that old man , by taking out the MDT , it culitvate me to work hard on the road , not on the on-call .</p>
              <p>First 6 months only , after that , my hirer installed that time the trial set of the 2nd Generation MDT . From there i became a on-call man .</p>

              first day familarise vehicle... take pax but dont rush for biz...haha
              
              start reading HDB estate now in the street directory and major expressways exit... a bit per day...
              
              good that your driving is steady.... go town lots of things to be careful e.g. which alley short cut, less jam, bus lane, taxi pick up rule, taxi stand cannot too long q otherwise summon, cut lane here and there, ERP knowledge, fastest expressway entrance, office building pick up spot (dun go out then come in during certain times)...haha
              
              The other nightmare is geylang wkend nite.... pple anyhow cross, cars anyhow stop and cut, taxi suddenly stop, heavy traffic, u need to look out for pax and at same time traffic and pedestrian.... 
              
              once u master taxi-ing in geylang sat nite and evening peak townon, other places are chicken feet liao... haha

              after 12am? mon to thurs only town and some regional nite spots 
              
              e.g. if at west, me go towards hol V. If east go towards joo chiat-katong-geylang. if north, spit once then lan lan go town... haha... 
              
              anyway not say town very good... also must q for pax....
              
              Fri and Sat after 12am got more chance to pick up from ulu places like HDB estate... 
              
              remember this - after 12am every out of town connection is a BIG bonus. 
              
              My after 12am bonus category:
              
              A - HDB to town e.g. yishun to clark quay
              B - long HDB to HDB trip e.g. bedok to jurong east
              c - short HDB to HDB trip but towards town e.g. Wood to AMK
              D - short HDB to HDB trip away from town e.g. clementi to CCK
              E - within same HDB trip
              
              If one nite me get 1 A and 1 C, happy like bird liao... haha
              
              good luck!
