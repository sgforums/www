              <p>This one not determined by Transport Ministry one..... request for fare increase must be submitted by taxi companies.  In the past, Comfort was the one that would initiate it first then other taxi companies would one by one submit request to increase theirs.  </p>
              <p>I think now all taxi companies would have to discuss with each others to propose new taxi fares before submitting to LTA for approval.</p>
              <p>However I think taxi fare increase is unlikely to happen because of recent drop of fuel price.  Voters also definitely would KPKB if taxi fare increase at this point of time.</p>
              <p>Taking average of 3-5% pay increment for employees in Singapore, a few years later they may increase taxi-fare.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Heard that Uber and GrabCar will be commercialize soon and become legal. (Hearsay) If this ever happens means Singapore allows "Ba Wang Che" to happen and it will mean strong challenge to Taxi Drivers. Should this be allowed to happen then I believe it is good for Taxi Companies to revise their Taxi Rentals as private cars are <strong>MUCH MUCH MORE CHEAPER THAN TAXIS!<br></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">So Taxi Companies better wake up their ideas as this move of legalization sounds good too! All Taxi Drivers to get private cars with cheaper rentals or overhead and start ferrying passengers around in Singapore. <strong>NEED NOT RENEW OR OBTAIN ANY STUPID SHIT OF VL ANYMORE!</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">And also at the same time, benefit all nationalities as any Tom, Dick or Harry is able to register then drive and ferry people in any vehicles they want and deem fit to without having to pay tax. <strong>SHIOK!!!</strong></p>

              Gentlemen,
              A fair playing field imply, fair distribution of wealth and cost, it is not about you and me or drivers of uberX or grabcar. And bear in mind that Fair does not imply equality, just merely making it acceptable and balance, but to be totally fair..it will not be possible, so please, do not think that govt or that ah khaw is going change alot of thing.
              
              When legalisation take place, cost will go up, both the driver and the apps company will spent more on cost of operating, that alone will make Uber or grab drivers rethink for themselves to be a TD better or Private apps driver.
              
              There are many thing in this world that thru one innovation, it disrupt or kill off the old way of doing it. Eg, Internet shopping, from groupon to taobao to alibaba or mama...you name it, it disrupted lots of retail shops in Singapore that hv to pay rental, order goods, employ staffs, pay bills and so on. And so, over the net, they are able to sell cheaper, not only because of lower in cost of operation, but also in bulk or group purchase.
              
              And this retail shops, unable to match them, joined them.
              
              So, how are we going to take this new taxi call apps innovation against our die hard trade we are currently plying. Bearing in the mind that like it or not, this apps will innovate further, more advance, more easier, and more lucratives.

              Look, most of these UberX or grabcar are ex TDs, I would say, nearly 70%, the rest are young newbies, mostly our malayu friends who took up uber and grab because they also need car to bring family malaysia to visit kaka and neh neh. You must understand that rental per day is only $55 for a normal car. And today car is expensive, so why not take up Uber, got car, not need to pay car installment, insurance, road tax, and yet free maintenences.
              
              Since we knew the abt 70% are ex TD, if these 70% will to return back to Taxi driving, it will also be competing with us not only on call, but on Q, on street pax too. But today, they are at Uber, which can only take calls, therefore, to me, in actual fact, TDs is still competing with the same peoples who will once a TDs other than the newbies who might not last long.

              Paxs like us, will definitely seek the lowest cost, and the news will spread, so you will tends to see lower call volume, but on the street and at Q, is still the taxi driver playground. 
              
              But bearing in mind, paxs are also kiasee people, Uber and grab car do not have a full coverage of insurance, that will help Taxi drivers as most pax still prefer calling a cab.

But if everyone of us is like our ex chief with his 13 CBD's quaility pax mentality, which is what is happening, then we might lose the call market to UberX and Grabcar in no time.

              careless ah wood or ah shun, no reject, good service, the ball will
              be back to us. But if everyone of us is like our ex chief with his
              13 <span>CBD</span>’s quaility pax mentality, which is
              what is happening, then we might lose the call market to UberX and
              Grabcar in no time.</p>

              Sharing and Caring is good mah, you give a bit, I take a bit, end up, all share share, all happily go home.
              
              But somehow, life is not like this, it is alway I want to win you, you want to win me, so what if you win, so what if UberX wins, still hv to drive, still hv to find pax, still hv to pay rental, fuel, and so on. You move out of Asia square with a pax, you see UberX drivers all staring at you, you Q at MBS tower 1 and look at UberX driver picking up paxs to AP, it is the same dishes we are sharing, just that now got more chopsticks, but that is life, for without changes, we might as well be dead.

              Pa bao chia, grabtaxi and ubertaxi are for those who want the cheapest ride.
              
              What cabbies want are those chin chai pax who are used to normal taxis, cash payment and a lao ren driver. I am this type although I am very tech savvy.
              
              I will never take ubertaxi and grabtaxi for one simple problem. Their apps require registration and my personal details. I am those who insist on doing business only with those who do not ask me any question, no receipt, pure cash transaction and 100% no accountability.

              Brothers, sisters, in laws, neighbours.. ladies and gentlemen,
              
              The secret of Apps to be frank, is a SPY. 
              
              Uber, sponsored by Iphone and google belongs to USA, their purpose is to spy on all individual, your location, your particular so that in any one point of time, any terrorist who took Uber, or who used Uber, will be captured, they will be able to trace user from all around the world. 
              
              Secret services of all countries, from our CID to FBI to CIA, to Mi6 to SIS, are all connected to Uber, grab is more of a domestic connection for local police traceability.
              
              However, some countries rejected it, as like google was banned in China, uber is not much different there.
              
              Therefore, with such strong sponsorship, Uber is able to collect cheaper ride to compete with any local taxi drivers in any countries.

              He use heat seeking missle launcher lah (SAM), more powerful than my 155 howitzer and your M203 M16 grenade launcher.
              
              Arbo how he got his nick Chief of Staff.
              
              We first met some years ago, it was at his usual BBQ gathering, many attended, that time, he was consider one of the saviour of taxi drivers, like Pastor Kong of City of Light, he got top deputy assisting him, some selling pte to car insurance, some selling investment products,..about 3 to 4 all sat there like Chinese deities, then the rest of them, abt 30 to 40 open plates, drink, TCCS. 
              
              He was talking when I approached him, he saw me, then suddenly keep quiet, I believe he knows who I am, and choose to remain silent with just a smile. Meaning that when a chief met another chief, silent is golden
