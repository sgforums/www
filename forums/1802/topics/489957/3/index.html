              <p>I believe around 10% of the limo cabbies eventually found a way out back into the corporate world. Almost all is due to the back door route from someone they know. I was really envious and happy for them until my own opportunity came.</p>
              <p>Just like you, I left years ago into a job paying a high $6K plus on day one. However my personality is such that I cannot be an employee for long. I learn things very quickly and whatever job becomes boring very quickly. Along the way, I developed my own business which had nothing to do with my job. It was only covering costs initially, but never lost money. After 2 years, I got so bored with my work and lost all interest. So resigned and carried on my business full time until now. Made more money, and I already figured out how to solve most of the problems, so there was very little stress.</p>
              <p>Obviously I am now trying to think how to move on. As I said, I get bored very very quickly and nothing can hold my attention for long. Once I fully comprehend and solve the issues, its time to move on because it means I will start feeling bored already.</p>
              <p>The only thing I never got bored is with my family members. There are always growing, changing and alive. Never boring one. Always got something new to learn and solve.</p>

              If every stop also good, just drive to TC office, park inside, hand over the key, then just walk off, if they said these and that, tell them to talk to your lawyer, just walk off, they cannot do anything to you.
              
              But of course you must make sure you will not be driving taxi anymore, which is no more a big problem, becos now got UberX and grabcar mah, that is also how today, TC is facing an admin meltdown, their drivers just throw key at them and walk away.

              You go taxi companies, rent out a taxis, hv to sign here sign there, deposit here and there, photos of yr face shoot all over their computers and servers, like going into a jail procedure. Then hv to do a medical reports somemore...all at yr expense. Knn, customer become prisoner.
              
              Then those cdg or TC supermothers size, will pycho you all the way to the taxi, once you start the engine, good luck to you.

              Tio raid good mah, at least hotel very secure, got raid is good. Remember Singapore prostitution laws still stand hor.
              
              Prosititution is legal, soliciting is an offence.

              <p>Its not about professional farking at their base, its also not about the hotel coz its not mine. Its about the pro who is not supposed to do someone outside her chicken house. Just like a maid, they are supposed to work inside the house and nowhere else. But just like a maid, they are not in jail and can go outside. The trick is how to do them outside and never pay?</p>
              <p>Soliciting is legal in geylang. The OKT never call u when u walk pass them meh?</p>
