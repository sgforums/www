              <p>this is not calculative. If this the rule. the same apply like pax say where other taxi can stop at bus stop and do illegal U turn, why u cannot.</p>
              <p>Driving to basement car park and back for free is not about 5 cent.</p>
              <p>It is the rule that is the basis for everything, the same apply to the GST collection on the booking fee (7% on $0.30) Why not u tell the govenment not to be calculative?</p>

              Generally, human relationship works best work on the laws of reflection, if pax is good, naturally TD will be good in return, maybe a bit diverged, but still within the frameword of good. And in Singapore, most 80% paxs are ok and some are real good.
              
              However, in return, TD can be good, but pax are not good, or so called the 20% fark type one, laws of reflection stated that when light travelled from one medium to another type of medium, it changes course, the reflection will not be clear and way out of course. So for these type of pax, of course, you no give and take lah, just keep quiet and follow standard operating procedure tightly.

              <p>Generally, human relationship works best work on the laws of
              reflection, if pax is good, naturally TD will be good in return,
              maybe a bit diverged, but still within the frameword of good. And
              in Singapore, most 80% paxs are ok and some are real good.</p>
              <p>However, in return, TD can be good, but pax are not good, or so
              called the 20% fark type one, laws of reflection stated that when
              light travelled from one medium to another type of medium, it
              changes course, the reflection will not be clear and way out of
              course. So for these type of pax, of course, you no give and take
              lah, just keep quiet and follow standard operating procedure
              tightly.</p>

              <p>fare paid liao still can continue?</p>
              <p>My answer if this is meter stop, trip end. this is the standard rules and should be the basis.</p>
              <p>Your reply is give and take. this answer is neither here or there because it is upto individual not the standard practice. it is like some pax say why other taxi can stop at bus stop, do illegal U-turn but you cannot. clearly, many give n take make pax tink that it become the standard practice.</p>

              If you ask any politician, the like of PAP, even a minister will not give you a direct answer, the most they will said, let us move forward and see what we can do.
                  
              If you said you are a broker or an accountant/banker, of course figures cannot give and take, so they hv to check everything, audit these and that to make sure that everything is tally, balanced and factual.
               
              Even if needed to massage the figure, also hv to make it look perfect and digestable, of course, like this will not hv the flexibility of give and take, and that is why you see in town, 10-12midnite still got auditor, 
                  
              Financial pples struggling with their work, stress and pressure build up on their reports. And the reward is that they are much highly paid than most of us, because they need the knowledge, the thinking hat and more importantly, cannot give and take, cannot agar agar, cannot be flexible, which added stress to them, because seeking perfection is a stress. And this is only one industrial I quoted.
              
              But if you apply that into a TD who earn abt 3 to 4k per month (I only $900), why need to be so rigid in life, we are not paid that high to be perfect. Furthermore, driving already took up much of our physical stress...go give and take might help to release some of those stress and at the same time, relax and smile

              Not sure if you all kana this before.
              
              Once I went into Golden Agri Plaza at 108 Pasir Panjang Road. Not to drop pax hor. I drove my car there. That carpark is one way only, so must make one circle around the back of the building and exit. I lazy mah because no car at all. I park my car on the left side of the building, and exit from the left side lor. Then reach the gate, the Indian security asked me wind down window. He smile and ask why never follow direction.
              
              I say "Cannot ah?"
              
              Kek Ling guard say "Like that hor... I report you"
              
              knn until today still never receive summon. As far as I know, inside the building compound, is none of TP or LTA business. Not sure how they want to summon me for going against traffic. Like that if can summon, then places like Raffles Hotel drop off point, if I go anticlockwise will kana summon liao lor.
