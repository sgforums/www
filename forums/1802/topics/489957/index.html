              <p>When taxi companies bought insurrance that time, they sure got consider this factor one so sure cover taxi damage.  Otherwise means got accident taxi company "lugi" because taxi driver cannot afford to pay for full damage but can afford to pay up to $2000.</p>
              <p>The insurrance companies also would accept because their business is super large deal and most likely would be profitable.</p>
              <p>Only thing is if don't on meter and got into accident, passenger not covered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those kind of customers sure encountered before being unable to charge through cashless and the driver drove them out to charge resulting in them having to walk very far distance back.   So they learned from experience and requested to pay outside.    From taxi drivers perspective, at most lose 22 cents so "Chin Chai" (22 cents is not 1000 times playing like stock market which would be $220).</p>

              <p>There are many free things in Singapore.  For example, the Buddhist temple closest to Singapore Taxi Academy offers free vegetarian meals three times a day (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGAdTKRAbBc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGAdTKRAbBc </a>) to anyone including foreigners and other religion people.  There are at least ten religious organizations in Singapore that offers free food to people ( <a href="/forums/3515/topics/386398">http://sgforums.com/forums/3515/topics/386398</a> ).</p>
              <p>So next time if drive close enough to these places around meal time, can pop in and save $2-$5.</p>

              <p>This one Bo-Bian one, rule is must finished entertaining one customer before can pick up another......so the skill of quickly finding another customer is very important during off-peak hours when there are hardly any call-bookings.   This is where the more experienced drivers have an advantage over newbie drivers.</p>
              <p>I remember reading about that used to make $15000 per month PMET saying that he could only earn $50 despite working 14 hours OMO.   I assume he was a new driver then.   I am pretty sure the experienced driver would make more than that even if they OMO.</p>

              Pax wants to drop where is their choice, you can only stop them from doing it whenever there is a restriction to stop at certain places that is not permitted under the rules, like bus stop etc.
              Pax tulan or not tulan, you also hv to alight them at the preferred location, do not let them influence you driving mood, and try not to assume, dun play with emotion in driving, just drive, smile and collect fare.

              <p>This one drop at your own risk.....afterall fine also you self-employed one kena fined.    No one is our boss.  Full day bus lane I would not stop....but bus stop I often stop if no bus behind.... as encaved bus-stop cause less congession and is safer to stop despite the no stopping within 9 metres rule especially for 2 lane roads.   1 such stop to alight passengers would cause at least 30 seconds of congession affecting at least a few cars.</p>
              <p>The way I see it is the rule was made to ensure other vehicles would not delay buses and prevent accidents and I am not causing both from happening.</p>
              <p>I am sure you would encounter this kinds of situation at 5:15 got old people flag for taxi at bus-stop area when there was no bus behind.   Would you stop there?   My mentality if don't stop I !@#$%^&amp;* ....customer also !@#$%^&amp;*....but obviously I think no MATA or so-called camera man there before I stopped.   If you purposely stop 9 metres away, those people sure !@#$%^ and maybe scold you for purposely making life difficult for them.   </p>
              <p>Also got customer wait at bus stop thinking if bus come first I take bus, taxi come first I take taxi.......it is not they purposely want to make things difficult for us.   If only want to take taxi one would wait further away.</p>
              <p>But I heard LTA employs Malaysians to take photos of taxi drivers stopping at bus-stop yellow boxes so I try to avoid stopping within the bus stop yellow box.</p>
              <p>If don't stop at bus-stop, would end up with this situation : <a href="/forums/3426/topics/489367">http://sgforums.com/forums/3426/topics/489367</a> .</p>

              <p>Other places iike outside Fu Lu Shou very heavy traffic but no taxi stand but got bus-stop.  Old people always like to flag for taxis there.   No bus lane there but got LTA  camera there for catching illegal parking ($300 + 3 demerit points) which is more than just stopping.  There is no other places for them to flag a taxi as all taxis drivers would not want to pay $2 extra to enter CBD just to find customers at Queens Street or Bencoolen Street.  If don't pick them up they would wait there for hours without being able to board a taxi.</p>
              <p>One stopping to alight 9 metres away would affect at least 15 cars for 30 seconds.   </p>
              <p>I only once ever stopped for a customer who flagged 9 metres away.  Most of the times, the old people would flag at the bus-stop area.   Would you stop there?</p>
              <p>I stopped there once 2-3 months ago but have yet to receive LTA's ticket for stopping there.   So LTA also sometimes flexible and close one eye for not so serious offenses that do not cause accidents and congession.</p>

              Aiya, driving taxis is base on some basic instinct, if raining, of cos, bus stop also take lah, as long as not waiting like more than 1 to 2 minutes, ok one lah. If you really go follow the laws and regulations, all i can say is that you might end up with less pax.
              
              And for goodness sake, why go pick fu lu shou bus stop pax? that one no surcharges leh, you think old pax stupid..why not walk to waterloo TS? ERP $1, limpek also whack in and pick from Queen street bugis TS, still got $3 surcharge mah, still gain $2, and then, the pax usually travel not far and around CBD area, so still can earn mah, to achieve 13 quality paxs at CBD, you hv to invest a bit one hor...

              <p>If the ERP $2, then I don't go Bugis Junction to pick up.   If lower, I go for Bugis Junction.  Would not go all the way to Waterloo to fetch one.  Daytime no surcharge so must lugi $2.  Also those waiting at Waterloo sure "dan ku ku" until got people go Kuan Yin temple and alight there.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that is just me willing to take a risk to fetch old people at Fu Lu Shou pending Bugis Junction ERP rates.</p>
              <p>One thing I observed is then ERP in operation, a lot of customers waiting there.  When no ERP charges, taxis waiting for customers.</p>
