Not fair for him . He reached home bath ok liao , ready to sleep , sekali i call him , tell him to continue , not fair la .<br><br>I seldom do that .... usually $46 rental , i took about 2.5 hours can get , if can connect my business . So once the rental covered , pon-tan also no problem liao , only that ..... work for nothing , Comfort benefit all . No salary .<br><br>Usually , after soccer matches around 12am or 1am , i continue to work . Saturday night , can be quite busy . To continue work for another 5 hours or so , can fetch me another $100+ , easily i would say .<br><br>This applies to many cabbies , who like me , has a passion for soccer , ( or betting whatever can be said ) , they go to coffee shop , watch for 2 hours or so , and continue after that .<br><br>Work hard , Play hard , work Smart .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">First CNG station on S'pore mainland to open</span></strong><br>TODAYonline Â• November 22, 2007<br><br>THE green drive will get a boost early next year when the first compressed natural gas (CNG) retail station on the mainland opens to the public at Jalan Buroh.<br><br>The station, in the western part of Singapore, is a joint initiative between Singapore Petroleum Company and SembCorp Gas. The only other CNG refuelling station now is on Jurong Island.<br><br>Calling it a significant development, National Environment Agency chief executive officer Lee Yuen Hee said: "If more CNG retailing stations are set up across the island, it would help pave the way for more Singaporeans to opt for CNG-powered vehicles."<br><br>According to SembCorp Gas director Francis J Gomez, there are plans to build "three or four" more CNG stations in expectation of increased demand and going forward, there would be services to convert petrol-fuelled cars to CNG.<br><br>Also in the race to provide CNG is taxi operator Smart Automobile, which has plans to set up similar stations by next year. In September, its affiliate Â— Smart Energy Â— held a ground-breaking ceremony at the site of its station in Mandai, which is expected to be ready by February.<br><br>Another station at Serangoon North is scheduled to open later next year.<br><br>Smart Automobile operates the first and largest fleet of CNG-taxis here with more than 110 plying the roads.<br><br>As of September, there were about 240 privately-owned CNG-fuelled vehicles and 130 CNG-powered taxis on the Republic's roads.<br><br>Compared to diesel-fuelled vehicles, CNG-powered vehicles produce 76 per cent less carbon monoxide and about 99 per cent less of the cancer-causing chemical benzene.
