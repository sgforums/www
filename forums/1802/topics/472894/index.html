                                but I believe you can apply at local tourists board to become a guide. There is
                                a school in French Avenue
                                in Marrakech that provides training related to tourists trade.Ask the Moroccan

              <p>To start a forum there must be some characteristic within, one must be open, able to accept and take critics, one must allow and be motiveless, and finally one must have a reason to stop and more importantly, command a respect from others, just like my lau char bor mod, steady poo pee pee one, so many attacks and critics, also zai zai bo tai chi, these you all hv to learn hor.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, dun take this forum as like before, this is a much open and willing to accept forum, if JDIL feel that he want to close his forum and come over here, by all means, LIMO&lt; limbo are all welcome, even trishaw also welcome, there is more to share, gain and exchange than merely arguing for the sake of nothing.</p>
