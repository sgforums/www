              <p>When you are new, do a few things:</p>
              <p>1. Confirm destination by the location.  E.g pax say go Tanjong Rhu.  You confirm by saying, East Coast, Fort Rd area?</p>
              <p>2. Tell pax the route you will be taking.  E.g. I go by AYE, then ECP.  Don't ask them whether you should go by AYE.  TELL them.</p>
              <p>3. Tell them you are new.</p>
              <p>4. If you do take a wrong route as in this case, after ur shift, go home do homework and study map. Find out where u went wrong and find the best route.</p>

              <p>It is not easy to be sack..you get 24 points before your license is revoked.If you are talking abt sack from coy..I dun know..for me..it is 2 accidents and bye bye. If you drive with caution and followed directives like a robot..there is little chance of you getting pok.</p>
              <p>I'm a relatively new driver. I see my fair share of shit dished out by pax and I can feel your pain. When you are new, you aspired to be a nice driver and follow the book. Soon, you will realised that that is invidious to your mental well-being.</p>
              <p>Ang Moh are the worst pax for newbies driver. They expect you to know the route well. Telling them you are a new driver will not work.They will tell you this..YOU LIVE HERE ALL YOUR LIFE!!! A lot of the them have white supremacy issue which is evidence from the way their treat you and their soft, brown skined Asian partner(s). A lot of them do not or don't bother with the culture here and they love to think that all TD are out to cheat them.</p>
              <p>I avoid caucasion like a plague. I will not take their call booking or take any flag down from them. I'll grately leave and rejoin a Q should my pax be white. In fact, I derive pleasure from antagonizing them; I signal, slow down, turn on hazard, look them in the eyes, smiles, put busy and drove off - just to see them frustrated. Work well in morning, peak hrs traffic.</p>
              <p>You might think I am a bad driver..on the contrary, paxes thought I am too gentlemanly to be a TD and need to change my image....this, I did..with good result..so if you are getting too much junk from your paxes..you might want to take a good look at yourself and see if you are easy game for pax.</p>
              <p>And yes, AMG is heavy...if you take 4 AMG on your cab on short trip..the fare might not even pay for your petrol.</p>

              antagonizing them; I signal, slow down, turn on hazard, look them
              in the eyes, smiles, put busy and drove off - just to see them
              frustrated. Work well in morning, peak hrs traffic.</p>
              <p>You might think I am a bad driver..on the contrary, paxes
              thought I am too gentlemanly to be a TD and need to change my
              image....this, I did..with good result..so if you are getting too
              much junk from your paxes..you might want to take a good look at
              yourself and see if you are easy game for pax.</p>
              <p>And yes, AMG is heavy...if you take 4 AMG on your cab on short
              trip..the fare might not even pay for your petrol.</p>

              <p>Paxs behavorial is the same like you taking a taxis, if the driver asked and make provision to work hard to bring you to your destination, you will mostly appreciate it</p>
