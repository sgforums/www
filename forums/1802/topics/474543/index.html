              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">STOMPer <strong>Goh </strong>said that a taxi driver had refused to return her phone after she left it on his cab. He then offered to send her to her destination and give her phone back in return for $50.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">In her email, Goh wrote:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I wish to write in to complain about an incident on Friday night which really shocked me.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Me and my colleagues boarded a <strong>London cab, SHF425G from SMRT</strong> on Sep 13 at 6.13pm, which we called from our office at German Centre at International Business Park to the Swiss Club.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"About 15 minutes after we alighted at the Swiss Club, I noticed I had left my mobile phone in the cab. I contacted the driver immediately and he confirmed that my mobile phone was in his cab.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I requested for him to send my mobile phone back to me and offered to pay for his trip back. But the driver claimed that he already had another customer on board, so I said he could come back after dropping off the customer.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"He refused and told me to go to the SMRT office to collect my phone on either Monday or Tuesday. He then told me he did not want to talk to me and cut off my call.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"As I was travelling the next day, I needed my phone. So I sent him an SMS to plead with him to send back my phone to me when he dropped his customer off, to which he replied, "I will only see how, depends on my location."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"About half an hour later, he called back and made an offer, asking if I needed a cab back.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"When I told him yes, he offered to come back to return me my phone and at the same time pick me from the airport  at a transfer rate of S$50 to one location. He asked me where I stayed and I told him I was either going to City Square Residence or "Pasir Ris to which he said he would only send me to one location.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"At 10pm, the agreed time of pick-up, I was not ready to go back. My colleague was going back so I offered my colleague to take the cab back since I was already paying him the S$50 transfer fee.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"We waited about 20 to 30 minutes before the driver showed up. When my colleague boarded his taxi, he was surprised. I told him to return me my phone and fetch my colleague to Choa Chu Kang.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"He then refused as he claimed he would only drop me off at City Square Residence or Pasir Ris. I argued that his offer was to one location and not to these locations specifically.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"He then refused to return my phone back to me and said, "In that case you go back to my office to collect your phone."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I argued with him that he was unreasonable, as he came all the way and refused to return me my phone. I had already passed S$50 to him before he returned me my phone. I also said that I have never seen a driver like him and that I was going to make a complain.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"He literally threw the money back to me and said I was the unreasonable one, and that I had tricked him into coming all the way here (I presume he also saw a long queue for taxis).</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"About 10 minutes later, the driver called back and demanded S$30. He said he was coming back to collect S$30 from me, because I had tricked him into come all the way back.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Of course I refused, since he was the one who threw the S$50 back before. I told him that I had initially given him the S$50 but he gave it back to me. So if he wanted the S$30, he should ask his company to call me.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"He started to scold me and called me a 'bitch' and 'fat' numerous times! (I might not be slim, but clearly I do not appreciate the verbal abuse which I was subjected to from the cab driver!!!). I then cut off his call but he kept calling us back, harassing from 10.43PM till 12.40AM.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I am really very shocked to experience a premier cab driver reacting this way: Blackmailing, verbally abusing and harassing a customer. I hope SMRT and LTA would take serious action on such drivers and ensure that other taxi commuters will not be in my situation."</p>

              <p>First and foremost, for this lady, you lost a phone, whose fault? you? the driver? the taxi? the taxi company?  your colleague? your mother, your brother or father fault? no..or yes?</p>
              <p>It is entirely your fault.</p>
              <p>As for the taxi driver, once he decided not to return and pass it to office... his first reply to the pax was right, I have returned it to my taxi office at .......please go to lost and found counter..thank you miss.</p>
              <p>His later part of conversation with pax is not necessary at all, it only create further trouble for him, and then the money problem come into the picture, which can be detrimental to his reputation and company may take action.</p>
              <p>So brothers, be decisive in what you want, dun turn left then later turn right, and that is also why accident happen, dun make one decision and then switch your decision can make others see no credibility in us, be confident of yourself, your right and your way of earning a living on the road.</p>

              <p>Imagine you spent a lot of money to buy a Rolex watch.  You would be taking it out, cleaning it, polishing it and admiring it everyday.</p>
              <p>You spend a lot of time earning money on the roads so that your family can live comfortably and have a good life.  But, are you spending enough time with them, like you spent admiring your Rolex watch?</p>
              <p>Now, go pick up the phone today and call your wife and kids to say how much you love them.  Happy Children's Day.</p>
