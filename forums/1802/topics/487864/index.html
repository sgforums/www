              <p>Correct.</p>
              <p>1. Flag down fare to remain for now.  It will be left to taxi companies to "harmonise" them naturally over time based on their taxi models, cost and market conditions.</p>
              <p>2. Unit rates i.e. $0.22 per 400/350km will have to be standardised across all standard taxi models for each taxi company.  E.g. taxi company cannot set $0.30 for i40 and $0.28 for Sonatas.  It has to be either $0.30 or $0.28 for all the standard models.  However, each taxi company is free to set their own unit rates e.g. TransCab can be $0.35 if they want to.  Don't need to follow others.</p>
              <p>3. The four basic fare structures, i.e., flag down, unit rate, surcharges and booking fees will not be made any more complicated than it already is.  Therefore, the exisiting structure is expected to remain and there will not be any new changes.</p>

              It is hard to argue now as oil prices is low now, but when oil prices was super high, all tiam tiam...ti gong ti gong.
              
              Mr Bowah, unlike private kiosk, whereby petrol price taxation had went up..the current cdg diesel or diesel did not went up and in fact, went down as oil prices slide. So in a way, TDs have already gain from it.
              
              Then how about those running on petrol and CNG?
              
              Mr Bowah, CNG is going to be history soon, as for petrol driven cab, there will be rebate in road tax, which will be plough back to hirer, we did it once before.

              How can you justify to the public on the increase of unit rates when oil prices are low?
              
              To any layman in the public, you increase the flag down rate because of high COE, you increase the running rates (unit rates) when oil prices is high and TD have to recover, but now the oil price is down and you still dare to increase the running rates?? That will be a defying of Logic Math and Science.
              
              If you look closely at Govt talking abt TD, they emphasis on your health and stress, not your fare structure, they know the sensitive part and avoid it. 
              
              And when you talk abt health and stress issue in Singapore, in a TD context, what consitute a driver to be healthy and less stressful...answer to any TDs is, Drive less, and when you drive less...your income become less. You can go talk until the cow come home on TD health and stress issue, but the logic remain that if you drive less, you certainly will be less stressful and healthier but at the expense of earning less.

              3k per month is consider as low pay catergory, let take most bursary for kid application by his parent in Singapore, in order to qualify the criteria....net income of 3k per household or $750 per capital and you qualify for the bursary.
                  
              So the national average of a pay stand at 3k, and if TD average income is 3k++ in a family of 4, and wife not working to take care of kids + old parents, you think 3k++ can survive even, touch wood, that no one get sick or into trouble??
                  
              That is why you see TDs spending time on the road to earn more...and that is also why working peoples with TDVL are taking up partime relief taxi job...which translate to more stress and fatigue, and fast aging.
              
              In another word, we are living in  first world most expensive city, but a third world income

Taxi fare no need go up since there are many ways to make cabbies life easier. But our ministers have no interest in our welfare. CDG's welfare is more important, because many elites here have pumped millions into local shares such as CDG through a very select few private investment managers, one of whom is working as a CDG limo driver but knows many ministers personally.

              This meter...make in India lah..Rupees forget to change to sing dollars...lols
              
              Gentlemen,
              
              Many hirer or relief who started young as a TDs are now aging, because years of struggling have in a way weakened them fast and quick. Today, there are lots of them looking only for day driving, for the nite, due to aging, poor eyesight, most are looking for nite relief which is diminishing. And that is also why most find it hard to get a nite relief.
              
              Govt stands on taxi fare is still very much belong to the taxi companies decision, Companies on the other hand, are profit making organisation, they will alway decide on issue if there is profit to gain and hope to pour all cost of operating into cabbies, who will then hv to face the society and paxs at face value. 
              
              We urge the govt to relook on these issue of TD income thru the len of the society and cost of living in Singapore, not thru profit churning Taxi companies. We want govt intervention so as to improve the life of TDs and their families living in Singapore. So beside all these health and well being improvement, govt should do something to improve the income of TDs as a total household income. 
              
              A bowl of mee cost $2.50 is now $$3 to $4.50, that is a 20% to 75% increment. If taxi fares remain status quo, meaning no movement...inflation will be high for a TD to cope. This is not something that TD wants for the sake of enjoying better life, this is the facts of life, you got to intervene and not leave it to taxi companies to decide, you must seriously look into the high cost of living, which is a fact, to justify our TD income.
