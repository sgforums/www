              True, OMO can use taxis for personal use, buying and having a car in singapore is the most expensive in the world hor, so having a taxis, yet with cheap fuel, sound more logical, some use it to do other partime jobs.
              
              On the other hand, there is a group of OMO uncles like my bro KTC characteristics, seibei lau lan, stubborn and howlian, no relief can gum with them, and they also do not like to hv other touching their cab, because to them, any sharing with another human is a nightmare. And with their lanjiao character, most lan lan drive OMO lor.

              <p>OMO usually for people who want to have a car for personal use.
              Can make some money and have pte transport. If really just want to
              make money with taxi, then relief is a better option. Why go stress
              yourself with a higher rent and need to drive longer hours each
              day?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Agree wit the point of using cab for personal use but not for all la </p>
              <p>Most to most some use it for morning send kids/wife to sch/wrk then evening pick again n others might use for weekends for family outings </p>
              <p>But again some omo tds hardly got time for personal use </p>
              <p>Drive 12hrs or more then by the time come hm tired like hell liao</p>
              <p>Auto go sleep in order to be fit for next day</p>
              <p>That's y some say omo no life  </p>
              <p>Those not cash tight omo tds not counted hor they don't need drive for long hrs </p>
              <p>then got another type of omo tds who cannot afford to hv a relief bcoz single shift income not enough to cover their commitments </p>
              <p>Got bills loans high family expenses ah long chasing etc etc</p>
              <p>My close frn belongs to the 2nd type cannot afford relief bcoz got high family commitments</p>
              <p>Everyday drive 14-15hrs weekend fri sat drive nearly 22hrs then sun just go cover rental then rest </p>
              <p>True story la no joke he driving for a year liao </p>
              <p>Back to the point </p>
              <p>Like I say best is go n hands on see can or not if cannot change lor </p>
              <p>Wat wrks for me doesn't mean will wrk for u ma tio bo? </p>
              <p>Suddenly tis fella find omo better then being a relief </p>
              <p>U never know </p>
              <p>Here also got some omo bro maybe they would wana share too their experience </p>
              <p>For me I cannot be omo no way unless iam not cash tight then can </p>
              <p>Everyday drive for pocket money n sit kopi tiam or polish n modify taxi till swee swee lol</p>

              <p>I calculated already, Relief drivers really make more money as efficiency is highest at 12-hr level.   Even with cheapest Sonata, one still have to pay extra $56 for the other half of rental.   $56 is 2-3 hours extra of driving plus another 20 minutes to half an hour for dinner break.  So at least 2.5 more hours outside for no extra income not forgetting there is one more Sunday every week to consider so $460 more gone.  So it is:</p>
              <p>OMO:   2.5 more hours outside everyday without profit increase (or 14.5 hours without profit increase) + $460 more gone per month.</p>
              <p>Relief:  Maximum efficiency at 12-hours for day drivers and less hours for night drivers.</p>
              <p>Also OMO people age faster and would have more health problems come old age.  </p>
              <p>The only attractive part is can earn decent profit and got personal car to use.</p>

              Lj lah, some TD wife work quite high one hor, so they send wife to work, they do not mind earn less, cost wife earning mah, then send kids to school. 
              
              By do that, it also help to reduce the cost and family members also hv the luxury of not having to pay anything, no need to wait of bus/call or wave for cab.  Even raining also no scare.
              
              Thereafter, he just drive and hope to breakeven with the rental, earn about $70 net, go home liao.
              
              
              IMHO, there is one group of TDs earning the most, these are those who work from Mon to Friday as mid management, then chiong Sat or Sun or both, some prefer leave one day for family. And these pples usually got a lot of time to rest at work, all become tua ya pek aka lau bird of his or her dept liao. And in the weekend, when they take over the cab, full of energy...can chiong here and there...ending up with 2 good incomes

              I will take it as over spending and no saving for raining days, this is a problem with PMEs. I believe if this is real, it is a gambling debt case.

              What to do, many TDs still believe that they are still strong and able to drive long hours like when they were newbies, stronger and younger. But sad to say, we are getting old by the years, so if you think you can drive 12hrs during yr initial start to TD, you might not be able to do it now.

              <p>I think it is because rape rates would increase if no prostitutes in Singapore.</p>
              <p>However the ladies collectively drove the prostitutes out of Joo Chiat and neighbourhood districts.</p>
              <p>Many years ago when I was still a saleman who also visited shopping centres to sell products, I noticed the pretty PRC ladies were also operating openly in massage parlours wearing seductive cloths (<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px; line-height: 16.803150177002px;">Pearl centre</span>, texttile centre, penisular plaza etc) .  They also operate in HDB estates. Some of them were of potential girlfriend quality.   The Singaporean ladies felt threathened and complained to MP or police.  Regulations then changed such that massage parlour have to be viewable from outside and doors cannot be locked.</p>

              <p>I think the authorities made the regulations that way such that even the not so pretty maids cannot have sex with Singaporean guys otherwise must be sent back to own country.  This is to protect the interests of Singaporean ladies.  If don't have this rule, then those that like Singapore sure go and seduce Singaporean guys and get married this way.</p>
              <p>Some Singaporean ladies also like to push (sub-contract) things they don't like to do to others.  So the maids are doing some of the traditional jobs of the wives (cooking, cleaning and taking care of kids) and could become like <a style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; white-space: nowrap; line-height: 1.231; color: #660099; cursor: pointer;" href="http://dictionary.pinpinchinese.com/definitions/s/%E8%B4%A4%E5%A6%BB%E8%89%AF%E6%AF%8D-xianqiliangmu">è´¤å¦»è‰¯æ¯�</a><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #222222;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 22.1579990386963px; white-space: nowrap;"> </span></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">so some Singaporean guys may find them attractive.   Now the splitting of jobs is maid do cooking, cleaning and fetch kids from school and possibly going to market to buy food while the wife's job is earn money,  have sex and give birth.  Even teaching kids became tutor's job not wife's job.</span></p>
