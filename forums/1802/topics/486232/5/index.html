              <p>Metal rod too excessive and may render you wrong in court because you could be accused of harming others using a weapon.</p>
              <p>The Singapore law protects cabbies ( see <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nus-law-prof-who-attacked/1942554.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nus-law-prof-who-attacked/1942554.html </a>.  NUS also sacked him after that.  ).  So in the unfortunate event of an assault, the passenger would be at fault and would have to compensate you.</p>

              No show call is common in SIngapore, yet the authority is not doing anything about it, some apps call charges pax for no show, but that reduced the nos of call
              
              IMO, there must be a system of discipline put in place for both cabbies and paxs for pax no show and cab no show, this might help to negate such thing from happening and therefore, both side honoured the calls, it will help us to be more responsible and also make the society a more gracious one.
              
              Some called, but no show, then press no show, drive off only, someone wave yr cab....what the fark, these are the worst cheapo pax.
              
              And as long as no system is in place and that there is no protection for cabby, alway be prepare for 20% no show wherever you pick a call, be it going to yr preferred destination or a call that is going AP at the west.

              <p>Right, I also encountered this kind of customers before too..... Drove from far far away to entertain him or her....then almost reached there then suddenly cancelled.   Then got one customer already standing at the roadside flagging for taxi. Comfort and Grabtaxi system allows customers to monitor the called cab's location.   This is a loophole exploited by the most "Chao Kuan" customers to save the call-booking fee; fortunately most customers are not like that.</p>

              <p>Really tulan but told myself to cool down and forget it. No point letting this turkey get me down. Later, lao tian rewarded me with some good trips.</p>
              <p>Life is like that. The more frustrated you are, the more bad luck you get. So learn to let go and good luck will follow you. Life is short, don't ever waste it on such trivial matters.... no wonder EQ is so important, not just IQ.</p>

              <p>I met such people before and was really having lousy hour that day.   But I did not let it affect me and had good profit on a few of those few days.  Even had one of my most profitable days once despite having a not-so-nice customer that day.</p>
              <p>However on that particular day that I mentioned earlier, I fell below my daily average earnings.</p>

              Talk is of course free, not only cheap, teacher talk also free, but the key here is just move toward that direction so that whenever you met a fark up pax, apply theé�™ä»¥ä¿®èº«, for 30 years, I had met so many fark up peoples, but I can tell you, there are more good ones than those fark up ones, just like paxs, they also met up with fark up driver once a while.
