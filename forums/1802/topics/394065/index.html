              <p>Dear all brothers,</p>
              <p>I have officially return my transcab merc 368 and tore up my taxi licence on the last day.</p>
              <p>This is my sentiments on driving a taxi for half a year.</p>
              <p>When i first started , i was full of zest and enthusiam for my new found "career". However to be blunt , in my 38 years of life i have never found a job that i can meet so many UGLY singaporeans and those foreign talent included. They order u like DOGS , LEFT RIGHT . Come on passengers do i fxxx own u a living ? In my life i have never been rude to even the aunties that clear my plates at hawker centre , was asking myself what level of hell am i in to meet all these idiots.</p>
              <p>There are rude taxi drivers but most of us are just trying to make a living by giving you passengers a convenient ride home , when someone help you home with that peanuts money dont you think you should be appreciative? In case those frog in the well didnt know , taxi charges are the lowest amongst developed country and be thankful for that. It was not in my character to be revengful but i did in last sunday the last day of my driving , i drive pass passenger and purposely when close by switch to BUSY sign ; the notion never take things for granted. We are provider of service and not server and lord relationship.</p>
              <p>Another issue , do you passengers think taxi drivers are a bunch of uneducated fools. I have been insulted about wearing a fake rolex that cost me 30K to put on my wrist. To all those that have sat in my taxi namely SMRT azera 4773, Kia 6928 and transcab merc 368 ; i have finally found a job as a NYMEX oil trader and can well afford another watch with my one month pay so Fxxx yourself.</p>
              <p>Pardon me for all these have been pen up inside me for long.</p>
              <p>Also in appreciation got to thank poolman , patrick992 ( this idiot never help me when i got into an accident..lol ) , zeemax ,ken5048 and all these bros i forgot to mention in earning my dough. We share the same shit and that make me eternally grateful for your help. And to all those idiots trying to cut q etc.....uncles , we are all in the same trade please help each other ; the cake is big enough to share.</p>
              <p>The good thing that came out of me ; I have learned to value money a lot more. I have learned to put aside my ego( leo fxxxer) for the sake of my family to make a living and lastly i have found back GOD and return to church.</p>
              <p>Thank You lastly to all from the heart.</p>
