              Experiences will tell you, going to AP seldom board taxi at MRT one lah, most will be on calls, like those ang mo chu (pte housing), call most likely will go AP, because they got car why must call taxi, tio bo? sure going oversea mah, and mostly good pax, wu show one hor.
              
              Then again, luggage wise also must got some standard, the pax wearing is also more nicer, some with jackets, the moods are happier...limpek go tour or back to homeland not happy meh?? 
              
              Ask yourself, if you r going to A, would you drag yr luggage to MRT taxi stand??? Unless u cheapo pax, dun want to call taxi

              <p>i agree with diablo way of saying. You cannot assume all TDs are bad, just that when TD starts to interview, 9 out of 10 pax think TDs really lansai. But actual fact, display says everything.</p>

              That is why I said many time, changing shift using roof top is not the way to go, it is still green, in fact, using old method of red plate on window much better, paxs understand better...my suggestion to LTA and those knnccb taxi companies is for Changing Shift...roof top must not be green or red, should be another color, maybe Yellow or Orange, and plse plse educate the public, then you will not see such thing happening, to pax...anything green is for Hire..

              <p>Sometimes I put "busy", pax also flag....some just don't care lah...see taxi, just flag.  Even "hired" sign, they also flag.  Because they have experienced before.  TD put "busy", but still stop and pick them.</p>

              You must understand your Singapore paxs characters mah, like it or not, most hate taxi drivers but cannot live without taxi, understand bo? 
                  
              Actually I wanted to say, change shift, go change shift lah, pick smlj, but that might hurt you more, so I suggest a different type of changing shift and at the same time, the public paxs must be educated on it.
                  
              However, if you at changing shift  and yet wanted to pick some pax on the way, is also not bad, it help to clear pax in need and also help yourself in not wasting fuel and earning abit more....but you must be prepare for sarcastic remarks when you reject others....like me...whatever you f or poke at me...I dun give a damn and drive on...afterall, ...$15 still in pocket

              If I am in yr class, I will challenge that golden advise.
              
              1. why change shift cannot pick pax? 
              2. why is there trouble? and what big trouble beside getting criticised
              3. If putting up change shift with a destination, and advise not to pick anyone, then put change shift and location for fark,..might as well put BUSY

              It is not an abuse but rather a geniune case of smart driving, you cannot condemn TD for abusing a system not well set for them and pax. Just like many pax also abuse the call system, TD also lan lan..all because the farking system set up by those farking scholars are not anti abuse proof, blame who?? the most kan cheng hu lor
