              <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div>
              <span>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">When I took a cab from Taman something Melodies in JB, I allowed the cabby to quote me a price to take me to JB Sentral. The Malay man said, “10 Ringit,” and I hopped on.</div>
              </span>
              <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div>
              <span>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">After some silence in the cab I finally broke the silence and asked, “Abang, why sometimes I take cab $6, sometimes $7 sometimes $10?” My driver was visibly slightly taken aback by my sudden question, which seemed like challenging his professionalism. So he replied, “Ah…. I asked you if $10 is ok or not only. You can say no if you find it too high.” He seemed disturbed and showed it.</div>
              </span>
              <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div>
              <span>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">“Don’t worry ‘bang, I said $10, means $10. Just asking only.”</div>
              </span>
              <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div>
              <span>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Then he loosened up and began to fill me in with how hard life as a cabby was by throwing the statistics at me. I guessed there wasn’t much difference between Singapore and Malaysia cabbies in this aspect. Abang’s texsi rental was RM60 and his daily petrol cost was around RM100. I told him Singapore cabbies were not having it easier because their cab rental was an average of $110, though their daily petrol cost was significantly lower at around $40. They will both require about 10-12 passengers who pay about 10 bucks to break even for the day before any profit can be earned. At the Singapore side, cabbies rely on a complicated surcharge system make ends meet and at the Malaysia side, they cannot rely on the meter but their own haggling skills.</div>
              </span>
              <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div>
              <span>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Then coincidentally I read an update from a friend that her dad, who drives a taxi, will see his rental rates increase from S$103 to S$163 soon, if not already. Wow. That’s the 60% increase in rental. Seriously, I thought the housing rental rates in Western Australia has been rocketing through the roof at a ridiculous rate until this. If a Singapore cabby still clocks about 40 bucks on fuel per day, that will bring his total daily overheads to S$200. Since taxi drivers are not entitled annual or sick leave by their companies, they will be expected to pay rental every day whether they drive or not. That change makes the Singapore cabby worse off than their Malaysia counterpart for sure.</div>
              </span>
              <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div>
              <span>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">While that is a little better than slavery, the total outlay of S$6,000 per month in rental and fuel may offer Singapore cabbies better luck elsewhere if they bring that $S6,000 per month elsewhere to the regional countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia or the Philippines. One may even have a chance to own a humble fleet of taxis eventually. Even selling Char Kway Teow may have a lesser chance of getting bankrupted by your air-conditioned mobile money trap.</div>
              </span>
              <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br></span></div>
              <span>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Most of us Singaporeans are already resigned to our fates if our careers take a wrong turn at the wrong age at the wrong time. An unemployed Singaporean man can only turn to the Big Four sources for jobs. Namely Security guard, McDonald’s, Recycling scavengers and Taxi drivers or SMRT in short. Now, even the Big Four seems shaky and the feasibility or falling back on them is diminishing. Nothing, it seems, last forever. We gotta prepare ourselves and spend less on Hello Kitties.</div>

              Most people become taxi drivers are easy going people, people who
              because of these and that, from illness to stress to no job, and
              finally see open and become a taxi driver, I use to term it as
              enter shaolin temple and become a monk.</p>
              <p>So from that perspective, what you expect a taxi driver to earn
              base on a background of having to pay high rental, as easy as they
              are, since got no more hope nor ladder to climb for promotion and
              annual increment, they just see open everything, if today can earn
              another $30 more than yesterday, this will be define as tua tua tan
              tan.</p>
              <p>But to a working class or executive in the workforce, what is
              $30 extra? If got 6 months bonus, then maybe consider huat,
              otherwise, huat ki lan.</p>
              <p>So you must take taxi driver words as relax and simple as
              possible, because most are happy go lucky brothers. We know that
              today tua tua tan tan can also be tomorrow tua tua OBK, so we just
              take it as a pinch of salt.</p>
