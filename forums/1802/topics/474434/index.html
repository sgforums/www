              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">At 6 a.m. one weekday morning, 64-year-old taxi driver Koh Chia Hock set out to ply Singapore’s roads when it started raining. So he turned around and went home.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">“If I go and fetch a customer, it’s very risky,” said Koh, as the heavy traffic raises the chance of an accident that could leave him without earnings while the car is repaired. “I don’t have the stomach for it. I don’t want to drive when it rains.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Cab drivers like Koh are avoiding the traffic jams that have become a hallmark of Singapore’s tropical rainstorms after a jump in the city’s population and a surge in vehicles clogged roads. As the government shuts the center of the city this weekend for the annual Formula One street race, residents are bracing for even more delays.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">“This is a problem that has been accumulated over many years — infrastructure investment has not kept pace with the demand,” said Irvin Seah, a senior economist at DBS Group Holdings in Singapore who was part of the nation’s economic review committee in the early 2000s. “With the congestion, time will be lost in traffic jams and that’s essentially money.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Singapore’s roads are trying to cope with a population that has jumped by more than 1.1 million since mid-2004 to 5.3 million. Taxi waiting times of an hour or more are tarnishing the city-state’s reputation for efficiency as the government works to turn the island into a regional center for industries such as biotechnology and wealth management.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The 1996 transport system white paper planned for a population of 4 million by 2030. A government report this year said the number of people on the island that’s less than a third of the size of Luxembourg may grow to 6.9 million by then.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Building railways</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Singapore closed roads on Wednesday in the city center for six days for the Formula One night race and related activities, according to the Land Transport Authority. The closures add to the congestion downtown, said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Group Holdings in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">“It is an annual inconvenience,” said Song.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Singapore is spending S$60 billion ($48 billion) on new subway lines and at least another S$12 billion on buses and highways to try to rein in the congestion and allow for future growth. While those projects will roll out over the next 17 years, overcrowding and delays are beginning to affect the image of a city often considered a model in the world.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Singapore’s place on the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking has fallen to fifth in 2013 since topping the list in 2010, as its marks for basic infrastructure and business productivity and efficiency fell. Singapore ranked below Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi in a survey of commuters’ experience based on speed, cost of travel and overall comfort, released in 2011 by Frost &amp; Sullivan.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><strong style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">More railways</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">“New rail lines typically require a long lead time,” said Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew in e-mailed answers to questions. “As a result, we are experiencing overcrowding at the moment in our public transport network.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">To try to curb the increase in traffic, the government has cut the growth in licenses for new cars to 0.5 percent, from 3 percent annually between 1990 and 2008. The number of licensed vehicles on the roads increased 35 percent from 2001 to 2011.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Simon Yeo, a business development consultant, now wakes up at 6 a.m., two hours earlier than he used to, in order to beat the traffic on his 21-kilometer commute.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">“I lose a lot of sleep, but I still don’t feel as tired in terms of how strenuous it is getting stuck in major traffic,” said Yeo, 32.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">“Reputational damage will come when it seeps into the minds of visitors, that they see better infrastructure elsewhere and they don’t see the same in Singapore,” said Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based economist at Barclays who helped analyze the city’s tourism projects when he worked at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. “I think it’s slowly seeping in.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">That’s the case for Hong Kong-based Tsang Hin Cheng, a senior executive at a US bank who visits Singapore once a month.</span></p>

Remind me never to move here.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The government’s Land Transport Authority says the average waiting time for a taxi in the city center during peak hours in March was 4.1 minutes and average traffic speed in the central business district in 2012 was 28.6 kilometers per hour.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Paul Barter, an adjunct professor of urban transport policy at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore who has advised city governments in China, Indonesia and Columbia on transport policy, says the figures don’t tell the real picture.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">ComfortDelGro Corp, Singapore’s biggest cab operator, estimates that almost 95 percent of its 16,300 fleet is in service during wet weather, the company said in an e-mail. Many taxis are caught in traffic jams when it rains, it said. The island has about 137 rain days a year, according to government data.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The figures are little consolation for office workers waiting hours to get a taxi.</span></p>

It’s impossible. I don’t know where all the cabs disappear to.”</span></p>

              <p>The key to all this is between a same word know as  conditioning or being conditioned.</p>
              <p>Conditioning imply what you are doing shall result in being what you get or become which is conditioned.</p>
              <p>Some of these TD are being conditioned to get a packet of rice from you is because of the conditioning they act upon themselves.</p>
              <p>For eg, if you gamble, you are conditioning. End up you borrow money which is conditoned</p>
              <p>So to get a good conditioned, take care of your conditioning.</p>
              <p>Help is good, but too much help depress self effort, for eg, everyday I buy food for you, in long run, you get pampered and believe that it is a norm and thereby continue to stay in such condition.</p>

Sweep and take calls. Accept cash, nets, cards, flashplay etc. Pax give $50 for change oso can. Rain or shine, oso drive. </p>
              <p>On average, I take 20 pax per 12 hr shift. If disciplined, can get by, won't be cham one, but won't be rich either.  </p>
              <p>If so cham, then drive longer hrs lor. Work harder. </p>

              <p>1 of my good kakis, his daughter got 2nd stage of cancer, medical fee is killing him, but my friend a tough man, å’¬ç´§ç‰™å…³ just keep plying the road.....</p>
              <p>There's totally no target to hit everyday, every fare collected is a life saver.....</p>
              <p>Of course we do help him to get various authority for assistance.....</p>
              <p>But that's how much we can help also.....</p>
              <p>Experience in taxi driving? He also not a new bird.....</p>
              <p>Please, don't just look at a normal angle for taxi driving.....</p>

              <p>Real cham people alot in singapore, not just from TD, infact, there are more earning less than a 1000 per month, having to feed a sickened son, a bedridden wife, or some older ones having to work as cleaner to survive for 2 of them, cos sons and daughters also cannot support them, and they also do not wish to burden them.</p>
              <p>Typically speaking, helping other is good, and not necessary just TD, infact, there are abt 20% Singaporeans earning less than a taxi driver income.</p>
