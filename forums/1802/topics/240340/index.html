Driving sense ?<br><br>Drving sense as in u sense visually there would be a hazard or obstacle on-coming ur way , u must avoid the hazard , right ?<br><br>That cabby also one kind , wanna parked like that also must see timing la , midnight no problem , no bus ma , day time ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there's a few passengers at this bus-stop flaging for this bus, so the Bus Captain  got no choice but to enter the bus bay, or else he's likely to be complained by the passengers! as i think many passengers regard crossing the bus-bay to board the bus stopping outside the bus-stop as dangerous (esp kids &amp; elderly).</div>
