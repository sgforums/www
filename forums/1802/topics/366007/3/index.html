              <p>Kin don't see the diff , evening shift do have more extras , and
                                      the peak hours surcharge now create a stop-go-stop-go rhythm , we
                                      used to enjoy smooth cruising rhythm before the fare hike .</p>
              <p>Yes Poolie...evening shift do have more extra...only inside CBD coming out, that is the only extra. The rest is the same.</p>
              <p>Some say... must kenna long ones than good. neh.</p>
              <p>Example, what long what short...aiya this morning wow during peak hours very good my collection, like one of my kaki... during coffee break was sharing... peak hours kenna one booking CALL... long one..... see beh song.</p>
              <p>From shufu to sungei gedong camp, fare $27...peak hours  $9.45...booking $3.50. total $39.95.</p>
              <p>...only the collection looked good.</p>
              <p>But like my kind three shorts...$12.15 for the 10.1km also near to that kind of collection $36.45.</p>
              <p>If i got 1 booking during this slot still the same like his. with $3.50.</p>
              <p>What will be the collection.. guess.</p>
              <p>That why? many taxi drivers still never understand...what is 35% surcharges. LPPL formula. don't get fool by this greed extras is a gimmick.</p>

              <p>I was so amazed with some cabby at T3 around 620am,the queue is very short maybe just have to wait 10mins but they chose to drink coffee at canteen &amp; wait till 7am just to collect extra 35%</p>

              <p>Day shift every hdb area got chance , night shift only town , or
                                      near town .</p>
              <p>Poolie...now come back to the evening peak...ok happy with the extra $3 out from town to hdb.</p>
              <p>So ...how much  can you run  in and out from town with the 3 hours peak collection.  Once out ....are you going to run back to town for the extra $3 and the rest the same as day shift peak hour.</p>
              <p>For day from hdb to town potential, from town to hdb also possible for the 12 hours shift day.</p>
              <p>Night..can.... but chances is slim.</p>
              <p>So...how much the evening peak really contribute...btw.</p>

              <p>why? waited and wait, than some paxs jumped in tampines. knn for what... just the airport charges...you know how much the times wasted nobody know.  How much rally can generate, you think? the airport charges.  I ...rather headed to the nearest hdb estate capture 2 or 3 still better than waiting there.</p>

                                      as a weekday, collection is about the same (or sometimes slightly
                                      more), despite not having the 35% surcharge on saturday
                                      mornings.</p>
              <p>Yo...lion.</p>
              <p>I,  came across sometime saturday or sunday...even still better than those weekdays my collection...example weekday  click 280 km to 300km. sometime my collection on weekend click lower than 260 km my collection is more than what i collected on weekdays...cos weekend more peoples not working more outing more crowd..35% nothing great.</p>

              <p>this is part of e reply I got from LTA over ERP</p>
              <p>Taxi and SBS bus commuter (indirectly) gotta pay ERP because they take up road space, more so for taxi as they're inefficient form of transport</p>
              <p>I think soon it's going to be disaster, say want to reduce car yet restrict SBS bus population using ERP. For taxi lagi worst, ad hoc events like F1 say they're impt, 300 days out of 365 days they're inefficient</p>

              <p>Night shift , unlike Day shift , night shift connection time is short , after midnight esp ..</p>
              <p>Day shift can connect paxes in every part of Singapore housing estates . And in town .</p>
              <p>Night shift once hit HDB , unless lucky , if not , will be heading town for next paxes .</p>
              <p>If evening shift those demands can be as powerful as day shifts , then day shift no match for evening shift , cos basically we car one up one down , non-stop .</p>
              <p>If one evening one can pick a pax down to town , his night will be a good one , unfortnately not the case , HDB lots of vacant cabs .</p>
              <p>Tactically is different from day shifts ....</p>
              <p>We need a good peak hour . Usually if can get $25 per hour , than not bad .</p>
              <p>Without peak hours and those jams at PIE , 2nd shift is dead .</p>
              <p>With 35% peak hour also dead .</p>
              <p>Witout peak hours , drivers take their time .</p>
              <p>With peak hour , they do it fast .</p>

              <p>Anyway , Airport surcharge was there long since before i join this line , there must be a reason why it stayed for so long after implementing it , even Limo fleets has increased to the thousands .</p>

              <p>So ...how much  can you run  in and out from town with the 3 hours peak collection.  Once out ....are you going to run back to town for the extra $3 and the rest the same as day shift peak hour.</p>
              <p>For day from hdb to town potential, from town to hdb also possible for the 12 hours shift day.</p>
              <p>Night..can.... but chances is slim.</p>
              <p>So...how much the evening peak really contribute...btw.</p>

              <p><br>No , for evening shifts , the nearer to town , the more demands it gets .</p>
              <p>we dun intentional go into CBD to get $3 .</p>
              <p>But if we can get a pax that drive me into CBD , if i can get another 3 short ones , 3 hours , anytime by 5pm to 8pm , $90 easily .</p>
              <p>True or not u can asked those 2nd shift drivers .</p>
              <p>My standard , by 8pm to get $90 to $100 ( my record 5pm to 8pm was $145 ) is good , if by 12am , i should be anytime get another $22-$25 an hour without peak , then i am safe at $170 at least ,plus a another couple of midnights , should be ok at near $200 .</p>
              <p>Now to get $70 for peak hour is quite normal for most caabies according to my taxi kakis .</p>
              <p>With the old fare , my intake of peak hours was averagely between $90 to $110 .</p>
              <p>If lucky , within CBD , plus a few bookings , i would get $10 to $20 more each .</p>
              <p>Not now with 35% .</p>
              <p>Now everything gone , demand gone , booking gone , taxi rush gone , etc .... all of the 35% charge .</p>
              <p>35% is nothing , it only deprive commuters from taking cab , without peak hour , it will caused drivers to delay start working between 5pm to 6pm , where working class people knock off at Shenton Ways area .</p>

              <p>weekend can be better because of no traffic jams, km covered but more takings can be because of more short trips.</p>
              <p>during weekdays, especially fridays, between 5 to 8pm, I can problably make 4 to 5 trips because of heavy traffic. where during weekends during the same hours 7 to 10 trips is no problem.</p>

              <p>Looks like Poolie is right, all other surcharges stays. Except $3CBD should go back to $1 and peak hour can be reduced to 20% or back to the old $2. But maybe tweak the waiting time and distance travelled slightly higher.</p>
              <p>Waiting time = 45secs, 20cents.</p>
              <p>Distance 225m,20cents. Travelling at 100km/hr, for 45secs meter jump $1.10. (is my calculations correct?)</p>
              <p>Every day traffic jam waste time waste money. So we need peak hour surcharge to cover loss time (earnings).</p>
              <p>Sundays and holidays no need because no jams and on major holidays there's a $1 holiday surchage to cover increased traffic.</p>
