              <p>Yes!!! Integrate into the fare system.</p>
              <p>Yes, there will always be commuters who wants taxis over buses and mrts, but at what ratio. Encourage ppl to ditch cars for cabs, increase the service standards and balance the economics for owning a car and taking cabs. Taxi ride from west to east or vice versa per working day can costs more than instalment payments for a car. People will buy car. </p>
              <p>Go back to the PARF system instead of COEs and have better control of car population? Lower taxi rentals so everyone can afford taxi rides. Man, we are retrogressing, we need something forward to solve this problem....................</p>

              <p>why taxi demand low ? Why isn't there a problem before they implement the new fare structure ?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>there was a problem, that's why the implementation of the new fare structure. taxi drivers had not have a pay raise for umpteen years. but the re-adjustment was okay until these crises. tweakings of timings and surcharges are needed to balance fares. peak hours, people siam, non peak hours taxi drivers make too little. BALANCE is needed.</p>

              <p>well at e end of e day, it's control over price of ownership of cars as well. you make it expensive to own a car at e start, it'll help as well being a deter factor (Of course at e same time, possibly encourage OPC more since ppl would or might need a car for leisure i.e. going to M'sia)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i think poolie's got a point. now if the 35% surcharge is reduced to 15%-20%, i think the impact on cabbies is not that great but is likely to draw more people to take taxis. and the increased number of trips should be able to make up for the reduction in surcharge. my own experience...working the same hours on a saturday as a weekday, collection is about the same (or sometimes slightly more), despite not having the 35% surcharge on saturday mornings.</p></div>

              <p><br>Then if no surcharge motivation , why should i rush to Airport from Tampines ?</p>
              <p>Why should i reach the button for bookings ?</p>
              <p>Why should i rush into IR resort ?</p>
              <p>Why should i support the rush period from 9pm to 10.30pm ?</p>
              <p>What will u do if you are a guest in Sentosa , any hotel , and u need to go home , but no buses available , but u got lot of cash ..... can afford take cab , so u ring for a cab , 6552-1111 , which cab driver would want to dash from say Harbourtfront into Sentosa , to serve you , FOR FREE ????</p>
              <p>Especially Harbourfront Centre and Vivo City has got ready commuters at taxi stand ??? Pick and Go , not trouble ?</p>
              <p>Go think about it .</p>

              <p>sincerely...till today.</p>
              <p>never encounter any probelm with the 35% surcharges with paxs.</p>
              <p>so far so good...if going back to 20% surcharges, will there be an increase of ridership.</p>
              <p>Look ...like those ERPs at CTE morning peak, in the morning you can paid as much as $6.50 for the 2 gantries. Still many are using it. Can say peoples over here just KPKB than they forget it.</p>
              <p>Just an example during morning peak this pax from hougang ave 7 to changi general hospital.</p>
              <p>distance 10.1km.  7.32am to 7.49am</p>
              <p>fare 9.00. peak hour 35% ...$3.15. total $12.15.</p>
              <p>If 20% surcharges  he can  save only $1.80.</p>
              <p>My question.</p>
              <p>Like this pax heading for medical checkup...so the other mean of transport will be MRT or Bus, could he reached the hospital within this short times and to the doorstep.</p>
              <p>Taxi can...so i think for $1.80 he is still willing to pay for it.</p>
              <p>So bo pian you must pay for your own convenient.</p>
              <p>So peak hours is not a big issue.</p>

              <p>day shift no diff , u try night shift .</p>
              <p>Ok...Poolie.</p>
              <p>During day only 2 and the half hour peak hours to run.</p>
              <p>If today.... like me example, i got five of those above paxs distances like 10.1km.</p>
              <p>Just only five of them...peak hours  already completed...collection extra $3.15X5= $15.75. on peak hour.</p>
              <p>So my question $15.75 not a big deal, what 35% contributing as i mention before.</p>
              <p>Current situation are not as like last time...getting five short also a probelm... you know how many limousine are joining us on the road rounding for pax and at taxi stands in the morning, those days hardly see them... all are at hotels and airports, how... they like rounding the streets. time changes.</p>

              <p>maybe day shift and evening shift makes a big diff , in terms of the hours of surcharges round the clock .</p>
              <p>Day shift is jam jam jam ... peak hour and no peak hour , i guess , don't make a big deal for day drivers .</p>
              <p>Evening shift .... u got no idea if i pick a few extra within the CBD from 5.00pm to 8pm , i can make connect of $30-$40 extra compared to those at HBD area cruising for paxes .</p>
              <p>Kin don't see the diff , evening shift do have more extras , and the peak hours surcharge now create a stop-go-stop-go rhythm , we used to enjoy smooth cruising rhythm before the fare hike .</p>
              <p>We used to enjoy regular booking from 5.00pm t0 6.30pm inside cbd before the price hike .</p>
              <p>Flag down $2.80 .</p>
              <p>Peak hour surcharge $1</p>
              <p>City Surcharge $2</p>
              <p>Booking fee $3.50</p>
              <p>From Suntec tower 5 to Ritz Carlton , pax open the door , closed , meter already $9.30 !!!!!</p>
              <p>Where got such good lobang from Suntec to Ritz Carlton $10 , 5 minutes job ???</p>
              <p>Day shift just don't have those luxuries .</p>
              <p>Then those bastards start off this nonsense peak hour 35% surcharge .</p>
