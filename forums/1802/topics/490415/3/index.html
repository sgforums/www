              <p>Chin swee road actually got many many funerals. Almost 10 years ago, I had a shop there, same block as sheng shiong. Farking hell, almost every week there is a funeral tentage being set up in the central area. Those old folks staying there, it seems they are queuing up for that space to conduct their last rites.</p>
              <p>After one ritual, tentage gone, then immediately another hdb funeral starts.</p>
