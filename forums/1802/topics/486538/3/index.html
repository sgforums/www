              Many who are make rich by our govt is sure to vote for them lah, govt strategy of getting vote is alway targetting the oldies, the grandpa and grandma group, because they understand that once the leader/elder of the family vote them, the rest, from son to daughter to grand children to great grand childrens will vote for them.
              
              And then, the question of many are asking will be, after all the govt had given us more or less a peace and harmony place to live in, can other party, like the oppostion parties hold fort and continue this legacy if they are voted in as the ruling party

              Rich is subjectives, if one think he is rich, he is naturally rich even with $30net, if one think that he is poor, even with $300 net per day and an income of 7k per month, he is still poor.

              November is also students take O and A levels, so, travelling for family might be on hold if big sister or brother are taking examination. University are also having examination before their big break, so are some polytechnic courses.
              
              But of course, the begining of the month is also lucrative, people got pay mah, in mid november, there will be travelling, the usual locals hobbies. However, the current economy, which is very stale, might prevent many from spending including spending on taxi fares.
              
              Singapore, tho is better than other in economy, about 2 to 3% growth, but it is still affected by the slow global grow and demand, slowing of domestic property market, and at the same time, a human resource restructuring.
              
              Last year alone 17000 SME were closed, and this year, an estimate of 20,000 might be on the card, it is not because of no business, but because lower or no quotas in employing cheap labour as our govt is trying to reduce foreign cheap labour dependency. Other are no more younger people taking over, like the case of char siew chain which was sold for 4 millions
              
              MAS, our central bank is sayin that this condition will go on for a few years, and they are not willing to agitate/nor stimulate the property market and also other intervention, sing dollars will still appreciate, but at a slower rate. 
              
              Against such backdrop, taxi driving earning will still increase as population is still expanding, but it will not be drastic, you will get more cheapo pax instead of those tipping pax, you might see more joining taxi driving trade from the manufacturing sector due to robotism concept of high end production/manufacturing leading to more retrenchment. 
              
              The year 2015 will be a very cruel year for taxi driver, because some Mrt lines will be running, more buses will be in place, at the same time, companies will be having lesser job, and therefore, less overtime for all collars of workers/staffs, leading to night shift losing night pax at CBD. And with bicycle track on it vision, and also high cost of living and taxi fares, most might opts for other means of transport.
              
              Nevertheless, taxi is still and alway a need in any society, as simple as we are, got grab, just grab, got easy, just go easy, got calls, just take, got waving, just stop. As as you Just Drive It, you can alway make a living out of taxi driving by staying happy and healthy

              <p>You are right lah. Hard to get motivated driving a taxi. Boring long hours and pay so litte. Actually the fares look like a lot (epecially when you are a paying pax, lol) but after deducting expenses, very little left. Don't want to mention actual figures wait got IRAS spies here.</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for all the tips, bros here. I still think we need to have at least some strategy and not drive blindly if we want to maximise profits. Ok, maybe strategy is the wrong word but we need to have a method of driving - the worst part is kena ulu ulu places like Sembawang, Woodlands, etc, at night. Day time not so bad though.</p>
              <p>What to do? Drive back to town is my best option but time consuming and waste fuel. But bo pian, if not, got to queue and depend on luck at mrt, shopping mall, etc.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving can feed us but cannot free us. Bros, think of this as a means to help you with other income generating activity on the side. Don't be a robot and blindly drive day in, day out, night in, night out...... till one day, you find that you are already 70 years old and still queueing at the taxi stand waiting for pax.</p>
              <p>Set aside some time each day to reflect on how to create another income stream and then act on it. That's an advice I am giving myself also....cheers :)</p>
