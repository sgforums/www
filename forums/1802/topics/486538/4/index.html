              Ah di, once you are inside a taxi, take yourself as å‡ºå®¶äºº (monk), no more questioning on other people problems, just drive with what you are good at, a monk must hv a open mind and thinking, you must not be feeling like a trap when driving taxis, it must be a free and willing concept, than you can be a happy driver. 
              
              If you are too calculative, you will not drive happily, which is essential and a critical in taxi driving inorder to sustain this trade and get better enlightened. There are times, we have to go ah wang or ah wood or even ah Sungei G and so on. But there are also time where we go AP from tuas, Ap from ah wood, or GBTB from ah wang,...give and take, it is part and parcel of taxi driving, like it or not, you hv to adhere to provide people the transportation, otherwise, wherever someone said woodlands drive 14, you start to curse and swear inside, that will be very unhealthy.
              
              In any trade that we undertook, we must be enlightened in it, if taxi driving can only feed us, what about cleaner, security guards and gardener in horticulture jobs. And you will be surprise to see all these low end job that people undertook, their kids are uni graduates, and as taxi drivers, with bare hands on steering wheels, I also bring up 3 kids to university, steering wheels include casket driving.
              
              So, to conclude, to be a taxi driver, you must be contended, you should not be people who are craving silver platter trips or one that want to be the best, it must be make to be enjoyable and happy, earning more or less is subject to environment and luck, you can only control about 25% of it. But most importantly is, at the end of the day or night shift, you count your money alone, makes some or more profits, tell yourself, you do an honest living and an honest job like a monk, go home happily be with family, and occasionally, buy some good foods for them

              Ah di, we are actually on the same page but different front cover only, we are taxi drivers of Singapore, you turn left page or right page, we still are, it is a matter of time when one would start to realise that taxi driving is more physical strain than mental, if you use mental too much on taxi driving, it will strain you both mentally and physically, and for that matter, it is better to work for job that need lots of mental and hopefully higher remuneration than taxi driving.
              
              As some drive till live in jia hong chu, some drive till end up in lor koon chu.

              You need proper financial planning, as most of us are unable to hold money too long. Money is a 2 edge knife, it can bring about joy and happiness, but it can also bring about the end of a man's family life and even his own life.
              
              Not many people can hold riches, because it will kill them than safe them, like my lau char bor use to say, you poor man is good for you, if you rich, I think you will sex all day with those sluts, eat all kinds of medication and end your life faster...

              <p>Uncle Bowah, I really appreciate your inputs in this forum, great posts that help newbies.</p>
              <p>When I say we may be on a different page, I really meant, in a way, a different page in the book of life. For me, taxi driving is a temporary thingy, something to help keep me and my family alive while I work on something else that is more suitable for our financial needs. Specifically a side business that can free us financially so that I don't have to dirve day and night like a zombie, lol.</p>
              <p>You can say I am not your typical "tharn chiak" TD lah in that I don't intend to keep driving until I go into the incinerator at Mount Vernon or somewhere similar.</p>
              <p>Maybe I don't quite belong to this forum.</p>
              <p>But don't get me wrong, I am not against a "regular" TD (or tharn chiak TD like in army, tharn chiak peng). I have seen many TDs bring up children who later became very successful in life. One good eg is one top professor in NUS (a friend of mine) whose father was a humble TD. Just that it is not suitable for everyone.</p>
              <p>For someone like me, who is looking at this on a short term basis, time is money. We must get the best yield out of our time. That will require some mental work and discipline -  and not mindless driving around hoping for the best.</p>
              <p>That's all I have to say. This is a great community here. I learned a lot of things here so I am grateful.</p>
              <p>Keep posting, uncle, You are appreciated :)</p>

              Not cannon lah...wah lau... so long already you dunno me meh...Cannon is not me...I only Bullshit lah!
              
              Anyway, it is nice to see young TD gracefulness and respect for the older ones, because most youngs today are those si ginas drive like F1 with no respect for others, and also at times, seibei how lian. Most only hor, not all.
              
              It is not about different pages, but different way we move on with our life, we are actually all the same from the start, born from a hole, and then we move on with out life which also depend on our environment, eg, if you born a rich man's son, ho say liao.
              
              But whether you are rich or poor, sick or healthy, OBK or Huat, at the end of the day, we still meet our end together, could be in a hospital, home or old folks home. That's a fact of life.

              There are many reason people drive taxis, can be kiam ah longs, kiam credit cards, or kiam friends and relatives, need fast cash, or simply to bring about better life to his or her family, it can also be a longlife job for some, a passion for some, or simply, a road for some who hate corporate life or get retrenched with a huge sum of money, and thereby, just drive taxis, and also for some like my bro CT..to past time.
              
              There are people who work and drive taxis as partime, and in reverse, there are also people who are hirer and still work partime job. So, peoples come to drive taxis from all walks of life and with all kinds of reason.
              
              But preferrably, in any trade that we choose to adopt, it is better that we have certain passion in it and also in a way, enjoy it, that will make our driving more colorful and less boring, so that at the end of the day, whether you go on and drive or stop driving altogether, you can truly tell yourself, I enjoyed taxi driving and its experiences help me to see better in life.
              
              Even if you kiam credit or ah long and managed to pay finish, it is also good for you to reflect on how hard you have worked to remove all these debts, and take it as a lesson and punishment given to you, and hopefully you can become more financial prudent and spent your hard earn money well.

              <p>Uncle Bowah, I really appreciate your inputs in this forum,
              great posts that help newbies.</p>
              <p>When I say we may be on a different page, I really meant, in a
              way, a different page in the book of life. For me, taxi driving is
              a temporary thingy, something to help keep me and my family alive
              while I work on something else that is more suitable for our
              financial needs. Specifically a side business that can free us
              financially so that I don't have to dirve day and night like a
              zombie, lol.</p>
              <p>You can say I am not your typical "tharn chiak" TD lah in that I
              don't intend to keep driving until I go into the incinerator at
              Mount Vernon or somewhere similar.</p>
              <p>Maybe I don't quite belong to this forum.</p>
              <p>But don't get me wrong, I am not against a "regular" TD (or
              tharn chiak TD like in army, tharn chiak peng). I have seen many
              TDs bring up children who later became very successful in life. One
              good eg is one top professor in NUS (a friend of mine) whose father
              was a humble TD. Just that it is not suitable for everyone.</p>
              <p>For someone like me, who is looking at this on a short term
              basis, time is money. We must get the best yield out of our time.
              That will require some mental work and discipline -  and not
              mindless driving around hoping for the best.</p>
              <p>That's all I have to say. This is a great community here. I
              learned a lot of things here so I am grateful.</p>
              <p>Keep posting, uncle, You are appreciated :)</p>
