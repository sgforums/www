              Aiya, huat or OBK, just drive lah...since already a TD, which is a fact and not an illusion, just drive lor, whether you make or not just remember my advices
              
              1. Never get into a knock (touch wood), careless if you right or wrong, avoid at all cost, dun be too stubborn or high ego, other can be wrong, but just hold your temper, and you can go home safely instead of ending up with lots of arguements and time wastage for nothing.
              
              2. Never drive with tired mind, stomach hungry still can tarhan, but a tired mind is the worst, you cannot concentrate, temper hot, body also hot, end up blur blur and everything looks hot to you
              
              3. Never involve in drinking and gambling during the driving period, and for drinking, even off period if you are still using the cab

              <p>I think need strategy leh. I tested, anyhow dirve randomly vs strategy (go where during certain time, etc), strategy wins most of the time.</p>
              <p>I think the key consideration is time &amp; potentially higher yield, not distance. If I can get to town in 10 mins via expressway, it will be better than to get into a nearby neighbourhood MRT/ shopping mall in 10/12 min or even slight less time via normal road. Distance to town may be more, but time saved, city charge and potentially longer trip all make it worthwhile.</p>
              <p>But if can get an immediate pax in the heart land or where you are currently, then of course, take first lah. Time is the major consideration, not fuel cost.</p>
              <p>I am speaking of night drivng only where the "golden window" is tight - 6pm to 11pm. During that time, little or no rest, cheong all the way. Because after that, things slow down and after 12am, ghosts only.</p>
              <p>Deepavali strategy need to think deep deep in the valley.... thanks for the Rangoon Rd thingy but can't really fully understand why Rangoon, not Serangoon??</p>

              <p>The real OBK is when (during golden period for night shift) Vivo, Serangoon (just to name 2 places) have more taxis than paxs... Therefore, if HDB or town no paxs, just go there loh...</p>
              <p>Deepavali, if you get paxs going there and if you really go by Serangoon Rd.. Good luck...</p>
              <p>If possible, tell paxs go by Ragoon Rd to Race Course Rd (not west coast rd hor), and drop them along there.. Tell them really jam and it's better to walk a short distance..

              Strategy is good in a way of planing your targets, as you drive along, you will naturally create a pattern of driving, by then, at what time, at what place, you know the likelihood of where the paxs are..to Q or not to Q, it is an individual instinct after years of driving.

              But if you are talk about your road of the day strategy, out of carpark, one pax said go airport, your whole strategy become stresstegy, so, dun need to stress yourself with strategy, taxi drivers is not a football game or running a dept business, you might not know where is your next movement, even if you had planned to eat and rest at a particular time, you might not even stick to it when there are pax up and down.
              Like prositute, we also dunno who is our next customers.
                  
              So, all I can say is, Taxi driving is job that changes constantly, the driver must have good instinct and in time, turn to experiences and wisdom, you can hardly pre plan a strategy except your profit goal and when to siew chia.

              <p>Aiya, huat or <span>OBK</span>, just drive lah…since
              already a TD, which is a fact and not an illusion, just drive lor,
              whether you make or not just remember my advices</p>
              <p>1. Never get into a knock (touch wood), careless if you right or
              wrong, avoid at all cost, dun be too stubborn or high ego, other
              can be wrong, but just hold your temper, and you can go home safely
              instead of ending up with lots of arguements and time wastage for
              nothing.</p>
              <p>2. Never drive with tired mind, stomach hungry still can tarhan,
              but a tired mind is the worst, you cannot concentrate, temper hot,
              body also hot, end up blur blur and everything looks hot to you</p>
              <p>3. Never involve in drinking and gambling during the driving
              period, and for drinking, even off period if you are still using
              the cab</p>

              <p>I think need strategy leh. I tested, anyhow dirve randomly vs
              strategy (go where during certain time, etc), strategy wins most of
              the time.</p>
              <p>I think the key consideration is time &amp; potentially higher
              yield, not distance. If I can get to town in 10 mins via
              expressway, it will be better than to get into a nearby
              neighbourhood MRT/ shopping mall in 10/12 min or even slight less
              time via normal road. Distance to town may be more, but time saved,
              city charge and potentially longer trip all make it worthwhile.</p>
              <p>But if can get an immediate pax in the heart land or where you
              are currently, then of course, take first lah. Time is the major

              <p>Sometime, I would use "gut feel"... and go against where most of the taxis would go</p>
              <p>Eg..</p>
              <p>From Upper Serangoon rd towards Bendemeer Rd ard 2am (weekend)... Most taxis would chiong toward Bendemeer Rd/Jalan Besar...But I go to Macpherson Rd...towards upper Aljunied Rd and to Gelyang... I did that a few times and got paxs (not on every ocassions)...surprisingly some just after work...</p>
              <p>Strategy or not... the one and most important thing is... You must have the mood to drive before you start the engine...cause it will affect the way you drive and for the whole shift...</p>
              <p>Just drive and take what comes along.. You might kena 1 to Sungei Gedong (book in army paxs) and if you are damn lucky... you may get 1 who happened to fall sick and decided to go back to his house at Bedok..... Who knows what actually lay down for your shift.... So to conclude... Just do it...Drive...</p>

              <p>Ok, so OBK is a subjective term lah. Don't know about you lah but I am trying to make as much as possible to raise some funds in the shortest possible time and then start doing something later. Something that does not need so much physical or manual involvement, something that can be leveraged to give me financial freedom, lol. That means, when you are not physically working, there is still income - passive income.</p>
              <p>$30 nett per shift, I sure die early lah...</p>
              <p>Can't imagine lau kok kok still got to Q at AP late late and fight for pax in town after midnight. Sorry, no offence but driving taxi is not a long term solution for a good retirement, IMHO.</p>
              <p>Just my 2cts worth of thoughts. May not be for everyone here so feel free to criticise.....</p>

              Depend on individuals lah, on one end of the extreme, usually the younger ones...some kiam ah longs, some kiam Credit cards, some kiam cheng hu, some because never save, 
                      
              then all of a sudden need lot so money, die die must drive on lor, typically, most youngs I see is kiam money due to gambling or spent too lavishly with poor financial control and planing.
                          
              Then on the other end of the extreme, the lau kok kok type, whereby most of you are not in that stage, wouldn't understand. Lau kok kok can also kiam money due to late marriage or kena conned by People Republic of China Con women. 
                      
              And also those seibei stubborn type, altho his childrens had more than enough for him, he die die still want to drive on, 
                      
              why, because of Men ego and pride mah, afterall, our President Toony Tan said, can drive till 73yo mah. So you must understand old man behavorial inorder to perfect understand why they still drive at such old age.
                          
                      
              Like me, lau gui, not so old, but act seibei old, AP passenger see me only, said..
                      
              Sir, no need to carry the bags for us, we put ourselves, and when you act old, the society pity you more, most will give tips and care for you,
                      
              even go wrong also nevermind, will never tell you to drive faster and nice to you..so who gain? Lau gui lor.
