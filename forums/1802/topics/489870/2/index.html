              <p>Peak periods even locals complain not enough taxis....off peak periods, locals are the taxi riders as foreigners mostly working other than tourists who really depend on taxis to go to airports and tourist attractions.</p>
              <p>Weekends at shopping malls more passengers than taxis, that would be the time where there would be more foreigners and locals taking.   Even at low business shopping malls where during weekday no customers queueing ones, there would be minimum 6-8 customers waiting.</p>
              <p>Voters are not saying totally no foreigners, they are saying too many foreigners at close to 1/3 level.   Which country allows 1/3 foreigners into their country?</p>
              <p>Also without so many foreigners, there would be less PMETs driving taxis so less taxis roaming around "empty car".</p>

              PAP will of course still be the govt, even if WP, the best opposite is to win all their seats, it is only 28 seats. 
              
              However, with more opposition in the parliament, PAP ministers and MPs like our DPM Teo CH, cannot anyhow sleep or doze off in parliament liao. They will hv to be on the ball, their policies will be challenged and their ruling questioned.
              
              Pioneer package arises from losing 1 GRC, reducing of foreigner quotas arises from losing 1 GRC, give out more scholarship to locals also arises from losing 1 GRC, and so on. Therefore, you see what 1 GRC gone can do for us, if another one gone, would not it be better.
              
              There are certain policies that govt make is good for us, but there are also some that is not related to us and yet we get into it,
              
              the likes of foreign riots and bus strike by PRC had led us into policies like drinking baning places and period got nothing to do with us, but we get involved for nothing, so, many good drinkers like me get a bit fedup. 
              
              And because of bus strike, now govt take care of PRC and foreigner more than locals in a way of trying to make foreigners more satisfy and happy while ignoring local plight of high cost of living on a background of stagnate wages

              <p>I see it as if it is total dominance, the government would do anything it wishes even though it knows ordinary voters do not like it.".....even if we do this, what could they do about it ?  " .    </p>
              <p>If it is not so good results like total 55% support, they would think this way ".....we cannot do it this way otherwise next election we would be kicked out .... they already indicated to us their unhappiness in the election."  </p>
              <p>One example is raising GST to 10%.   Civil servants dont care because the government would give them 3 months bonus which is more than enough to cover the GST increase.  But other ordinary Singaporeans do not have such luxury  and also face additional competition from foreign workers.  </p>
              <p>People with more than 1 property like foreigners because they earn a lot more renting their properties out to them but the bulk of the people do not benefit from it.  Property agents like foreigners because they get more business from them.  Property prices goes up as a result of too many of them.   This benefits people with more than 1 piece of property but make people with 0 property unhappy.  It does not benefit people with 1 piece of property other than make them feel happy about something which they cannot cash out on (except for people in Tanjang Pagar GRC who could shift to non-matured HDB estates and make a good profit).   I also believe that most of the PAP MPs have more than 1 piece of property.</p>
              <p>Ordinary employees without cars that face additional competition from them and have to suffer more in buses and MRTs do not like them.</p>
              <p>9 years ago I already heard about them driving down the pays of Singaporeans when I was working in another industry.</p>
              <p>If GST is raised to 10%, inflation would become very high and everything would become more expensive.</p>

              <p>When property prices goes up, rental prices at shopping malls goes up too.   Many many years ago, the rental price for 150 sq ft area was already $6000 plus 10% of sales turnover.   So business operators cannot survive by employing locals because of high overheads and retorted to hiring foreigners.</p>
              <p>Once other reason for this is because of dominance of CapitalLand and CapitalMall Trust over shopping malls and their policies of renovating once every 5 years ( I heard this from one of my passengers ) .   I have seen how food prices went up at foodcourts after such renovation when such renovation could have been avoided.    Also they stopped employing locals and you see food courts stores now mostly served by foreigners unlike before.</p>

              As TD, if want to talk abt politics, also need to talk from taxi driver point of view mah, like summon, LTA or TP knnccb never give chance one, must understand that we are also public transport mah, bound to make mistake, so give one or 2 chances lah, furthermore, we are the one spending the most time on the road than another transport provider like bus, just to make an honest decent living, like this also never one to let go.
              
              Then come the GST, why charge us GST on rental, at least, absorb it lah, knnccb, there are 28,000 cabs on the road, take $7 each per day, CB govt take in $196,000 oer day, such amount govt can ask taxi companies to absorb it as a shown of appreciation for Singapore taxi uncles mah.
              
              Then come competition like grabcar and uberx, knnccb, never do proper control, end up taxi drivers hv to work/drive harder for their bread and butter. Govt tiam tiam, and in fact, the minister run road liao, at least settle the TDs issue then run road mah..phua CB
              
              Then come the fare cheat issue, every month, there are report on pax run fares, but authority never do anything nor increase penalty on all these farker, end up, most uncles kenna cheat also tiam tiam let go..knn
              
              Then what abt no show issue, all these hv to come to a stop or at least become lesser thru setting up a structure to tackle it, but the knnccb NTA only know how to give out NTUC voucher and ask people to join them and pay $9 monthly fee..
              
              If any opposition can do or even address some of the issues above, I bet you that all TDs in Singapore will vote for you
