              Taxis is still viable in Singapore, I everyday drive one, also same same mah, in fact, PHv help to filter cheapo away,..smlj Meyer, tanjong rhu ah nehs, all they bao liao...
              
              Taxi companies no matter how, also cannot compete with Phv one lah
              
              How can you compete with someone who dun care about profit and can withstand to lose money? I not businessman also know, why taxi companies dunno??
              
              To compete, taxi companies must first, willing to let go profit, or set their profit KPI lower by lowering the rental without any string attached, then taxi drivers will be willing to accept lower fares, especially midnight fares.

                              <p>All uber n grab trips are done via apps. I.e booking. There are
              still ppl relies on flag down taxi. Eg. Tourist, ppl dont trust phv
              and dont want to wait. There is no good reason to reduce the
              flagged down fares. The competition is all about booking apps and
              price. Cdg needs to invest on apps, even if they dont know what to
              do, by now should already know what others are offering. Next is
              the cost of rental. They need to bite the bullet and directly
              reduce the rental not do lppl scheme like 25cj, ask sonata hirer
              change used i40. Telling hirer give them $10 discount each day then
              increase the rental 20%. Obviously, taxi campany still living in
              the old days mindset on the rental charge. Look at smrt taxi share
              scheme. They offer good rates at off peak hours so many takers but
              for peak and midnight rates just dont make sense and few taker.
              Something is seriously wrong, when there is riders demand for taxi,
              taxi still idle in car park not rented out. Iâ€™m sure they would
              soon realise the situation and revised the rates for peak hours and
              midnight rates. It is time to face the real world and take serious
              action to address them. Not make decision based on imagination.</p>

              All jobs in Singapore, earning had in a way, increased to curb inflation, only lose out are TDs, from whatever angles you look at it, taxi drivers are getting poorer and will be more poorer as cost of living start to increase and earning start to decrease, a double whammy.
                  
              You look at Car parking alone, car park coupon had increased 20%, former $1, now $1.20. Water bill, pub bills, more ERP, price of kopi and food going up..school expenses, ....and so forth
                  
              Taxi income in general had dropped 20 to 30%, in total, with added inflation, that is a total of approx. 30 to 40% off your pre 2013 income whereas people pays had increased by 20 to 30%, even casket driving are paying higher to curb inflation like carparking, so in a nut shell, is it wise to drive on/ or join Taxi driving?? 
                  
              But of of course long hours and burnt weekend for taxi driver, can do to make for the lost, but how long can you go on?? wasting yr lifetime instead of with family and enjoying personal lifestyle, and at the end of the day, when you died, the hell judge look at your life...will shake head,..knn,..whole life in a cubicle..WTF, how to judge you??

                      Surge. I.e. chop carrot head when high demand is not something new. Many industry are doing it when got chance.  Td long long time ago already doing it but illegal. Using private car as taxi also long long time ago has already happen. Again it is illegal. 
                      Now foreign companies do it on apps become creative and acceptable.
                  Sharing cab in a single trip is not new too. Many taxi in 3rd world countries doing it. But it is not happen here. Again, it is illegal.
                  Again foreigner companies put this on apps become creative and good good good.
                      All copy from others. Grab copy from uber. Uber just trying their luck as these private car as taxi, over charging and sharing has been there long long time but illegal for taxi.
              Why local ppl cannot come out with this because all å¥‰å…¬å®ˆæ³•ã€‚
                      To copy. U also need to know what is good to copy. Also need to market is like something new and creative.

              <p>It is a question of who can tarhan longer lor.. PHVs still got money to burn.  CDG waiting for them to burn out their money.</p>
              <p>Certain surcharges should be reviewed like location surcharge.  They are to be activated only when there is a surge e.g. Gardens by the Bay during Christmas, New Year etc when there are events or during peak like Saturdays/Sundays 3pm to 9pm etc. No point having $3 surcharge 24/7 even when there are very little ppl taking taxis there at 8am..</p>
              <p>CBD surcharge can be removed after 8pm to encourage ppl to take cabs. But they can be activated when there is a surge e.g. during CNY in Chinatown, Christmas at Taka etc.</p>
              <p>Last Sat night, Guns &amp; Roses concert at CEC, made two trips there.  Took about 2 hours. Total fare $100 cos of $10 location surcharge.  Shiok.</p>

              Just take note that in UG, when they promote or remove something for cheaper fares, they bear the cost and plough back the differences to the driver.
              
              If Taxi is going to remove surcharges at the expense of TD income, eg, remove surcharges but dun want to lower rental and cost to compensate the driver, then it will not work.

              <p>$10 surcharge where got last minute one? The concert website got put. Taxi companies got inform drivers. I believe the taxi stand there oso got put notice.</p>
              <p>But the pax I took all dunno got $10 surcharge.  When I told them, they all okay one.  Cos getting out of that messy place is most important to them.</p>
