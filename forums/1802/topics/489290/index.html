              <p>Many cusomer don't know about "on-call".  See got taxi just flag even if red color.  Especially angry if taxi no customer inside but don't stop.  But most people would not be able to read the plate number fast enough and remember it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this case he complained but could not harm you.</p>
              <p>Most taxi drivers with green top would stop for any customer that flags unless dangerous to stop, did not see, travelled at right-most lane or forgot to switch to Busy when needed to go toilet or go for meal-break or change-shift.</p>

              <p>Then this one depends on whether you took the call before customer boarded the taxi or after the taxi.  I also rejected one before as I bided and succeeeded in bidding before the customer boarded.  </p>
              <p>But come to think about it, who got customer boarded already still reject and go for on-call?  Extra on-call charges also not a lot more and must waste another 10-15 minutes for nothing (drive there, reach there, call them, wait for them to take own sweet time to come down).</p>

              <p>I heard from one CISCO officier before that quite a number of them got rejected by cabbies before.  They were being told at PL CISCO location very difficult to turn out after dropping them (because traffic heavy and no property U-turn, must 3-pt turn in narrow and quite congested conditions ). </p>

              Today On Call is not like last time, there are biddings.
              
              So at the Q, a call come in just a few block away, you press, you hv to wait for few seconds, you dun dare to move out because if the call not confirmed yours, you lan lan Q for nothing. 
              
              Then by the time the confirmation come in, you press OK,  taxi top change to OC red sign, a pax gum gum boarded. You are right.
              
              Such cases I met many times....I will just turn around, look at the pax angrily and said "Get Out"

              <p>I think the TD who Q and then got call must be queueing outside &amp; waiting for calls from MBFC lah. Saw a few cabs there Q outsside before the turn into the taxi std. Last time I gong gong join in, thought that's the official Q. Later then realise this Q is for those waiting for calls from MBFC! This is ridiculous lah.</p>
              <p>Like that, the TD will surely kena warning if pax jump in (because no cabs at taxi std) and then a call came (of course TD wants the extra $3 just a few metres away).</p>
              <p>Why wait for extra $3 when there are so many ready pax just a few metres away? Don't understand these guys lah. I don't talk calls when I am near the top of the Q even if the call is from that location.</p>
              <p>LTA is not strict in checking on TD rejecting pax. They can't be bothered. By right,  cannot reject but TDs are doing it openly. Go Pasir Ris likely get rejected, don't say Woodlands, CCK, etc. I came across a lady kena rejected by 8 cabs before mine because she was in Serangoon Rd and going to Jln Membina!!</p>
              <p>Actually, it is not fair to other TDs like us, who kena take taiko rides. But what to do? If I take cab and kena rejected, I surely complain &amp; do something for other honest TDs....</p>

              <p>Time at just past 8pm, place just before Serangoon Plaza. Reason could be they want pax going to town. Damn choosy because at that time biz must be very good. Now, see if they choose or not. But to my advantage, i don't care too much.</p>
              <p>Once I took a pax from lucky plaza. He asked if can go pasir ris or not? I said why not? He said many cabbies rejected him. Huh?</p>
