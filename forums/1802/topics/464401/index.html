              Hi, i am a guy waiting to enter ns soon with a father working as a relief taxi driver.Just today he recieved a letter that states that his license is cancelled,the word is cancelled not even suspended due to "repeated warnings about complaints"
                  However, the case is that some of the complaints are true and i do feel that my dad is a bit too overboard sometimes,most of the times the complaints are merely one sided and my dad was not given a chance to explain his side.I am enlisting soon and with the little pay and since my sister is still schooling,i think it would be  hard to maintain the level of living till my father can find another job or something else.
                  This is the thing, i need cases of successful appeals or similar cases of when complaints of the taxi drivers themselves were ignored.In fact, if you think annything can help please comment so i can complile a file to appeal to Comfort.
                  Thanks in advance
              One more thing,i felt that it was kind of ruthless for comfort to give only a week notice in advance.Is the case normallyï¼ˆcancellation,not suspension)

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>It seems your father only cannot drive with Comfort. He can still drive with other taxi companies. Only his Comfort driving days are over and not his TVL. Ask your father to kow tow a bit when facing customers after with other cab companies.</p>

              Hi again.Look like the appeal was unsuccessful.However,one thing that pisses me off is that when my father called to appeal,the guy did told him to go down and meet him. However when my father went down immediately,the guy then said he wasnt free and told another of his men to meet my father.According to my father the meeting was over in 5 min and the person seem to "ah ah ah" at everyhing and then told him to wait for the results.About two weeks later he got back the appeal results via mail that just stated that the appeal was unsuccessful based on previous records.However, i find it frustating that comfort delgro seem to just give a sloppy reply and as chinese sayæ•·è¡�.So i am going to step in to let everyone see my feedback to delgro openly.But comfort is too much of a coward to have a social networking page to let people feedback about them,and they dont give a shit about the  drivers point of view.So does anyone know if comfort do have a facebook or twitter or similar page where i can post this there to let everyone see this and make comfort give a reasonable reply and take the drivers more seriously?
              
              And thanks for the reply so far appreciate it.

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Meet-the-People Session (MPS)</strong></span></p>
              <p>A feedback/redress system developed in <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> for citizens to meet their <a class="mw-redirect" title="Members of the Singapore Parliament" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_Singapore_Parliament">member of parliament</a>.
                   The MPS are usually held once a week. Many citizens see the MPS as an 
                  opportunity to resolve problems that they are having with the 
                  bureaucracy.The MP will write a petition letter to the relevant <a title="Ministry (government department)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_%28government_department%29">ministry</a>, <a class="new" title="Statutory board (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Statutory_board&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">statutory board</a> or any concerned parties to appeal on behalf of the resident. The 
                  letters are accorded a higher priority by the Civil Service as they come
                   from elected representatives.</p>
              <p>Cases deal with a wide range of problems. These include, but are not 
                  limited to, family financial problems (e.g. health-cost issues, jobs, 
                  financial assistance), <a title="Central Provident Fund" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Provident_Fund">CPF</a> matters, various licenses, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Housing Development Board" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Development_Board">HDB</a> related problems (e.g. subsidized rental housing, obtaining a subsidized HDB flat), immigration issues, and appeals for <a title="Education in Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Singapore">school admissions</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Tuition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuition">school fee</a> subsidy.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-the-People_Sessions#cite_note-1"></a></sup></p>
              <p>Most sessions last past midnight, and are staffed by volunteers.</p>
              <p>The establishment of these sessions can be traced back to <a title="David Marshall (Singaporean politician)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marshall_%28Singaporean_politician%29">David Marshall</a> of the <a title="Labour Front" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Front">Labour Front</a> in the 1950s.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-the-People_Sessions#cite_note-2"></a></sup></p>
              <p>The rationale for the MPS is so that Members of Parliament can get a 
                  feel of the ground. Even cabinet Ministers are required to go to their 
                  weekly MPS, although sometimes they may seek help from another MP when 
                  they have ministerial duties to attend to.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-the-People_Sessions#cite_note-3"></a></sup></p>
              <p>The 1966 Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission had recommended an 
                  Ombudsman to deal with complaints against the bureaucracy, but 
                  Parliament rejected that idea and preferred if such cases were handled 
                  by the Members of Parliament or the Feedback Unit.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-the-People_Sessions#cite_note-4"></a></sup> This need to perform an Ombudsman function is probably another rationale for having the MPS.</p>
              <p>The process of meeting the MP or Ministers varies from constituency to constituency, but they follow a general pattern:</p>
              <p>1) Registration and take queue number</p>
              <p>2) Constituent meets the petition writer who pens the letter (either hand-written or via PC) on behalf of the MP</p>
              <p>3) Wait and queue to meet the MP</p>
              <p>4) Meet the MP in a separate room, constituent informs the MP of his/her problems one-to-one.</p>
              <p>5) MP assures the constituent that they will look into the case and 
                  send the letter. For urgent cases, the letter will be typed out, sign by
                   the MP and hands it to the constituent immediately. For normal cases, 
                  the letter will be vetted through by the MP’s or Minister’s Personal 
                  Secretary and sent out within three working days.</p>
