              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://news.omy.sg/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/201502/20150204/MY_20150204_TNPTAXI04_P_1037677.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="420"></p>
              <p>An SMRT taxi driver has been sacked for allegedly terrorising another motorist along the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) on Sunday, tailgating, swerving in and out of lanes, and hurling vulgarities and objects - including a drink can - at the motorist.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The road bully's dangerous antics were caught by the in-car cameras at the front and rear of his victim's car.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The victim, using the moniker Bee Pok, posted 23 video clips of the incident on YouTube. Each clip lasts about a minute.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bee Pok gave a vivid description in the captions for the video clips of his harrowing encounter in the ordeal, which began at around 5.40pm and lasted about 10 minutes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The first clips from both the front and rear perspectives show Bee Pok's car in the right most lane and overtaking the taxi, a Ssangyong Rodius, in the middle lane as they approached the KPE.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The taxi then switched lanes and speeded up behind Bee Pok's car.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">There is no indication from the clips of any obvious incident between them that might have triggered the cabby's behaviour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">He tried to cut back into the middle lane ahead of Bee Pok, but failed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Just before Bee Pok entered the KPE, the cabby sped up and cut into the middle lane, and went dangerously close to hitting a motorcyclist before swerving back behind Bee Pok.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When Bee Pok switched to the middle lane to let the taxi pass, it speeded up and moved out of range of the cameras.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The cabby then slowed down, returned to the middle lane and tailgated Bee Pok again in a cat-and-mouse game.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bee Pok wrote: "At 17:42.01 (5.42pm), he tried to cause a side collision by squeezing in between the car in front of me, swerving in and out...</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"He then purposely slowed down on the first lane and cut to the second lane, coming to a halt at 17:42.47, causing a black Toyota to stop behind him, taunting me to overtake him."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bee Pok refused to take the bait and the cabby later swerved into his lane, almost hitting his car and causing Bee Pok to swerve to avoid him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">His action almost led to a silver car hitting the rear of his vehicle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"(The cabby) then took out a can and threw it at my car...I sped up to avoid him and any confrontation, as I feared for my safety, but he sped up and continued to follow me."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At one point, the cabby wound down his window while driving beside Bee Pok.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"I wound down my window to ask him why he was driving in this manner. He retorted with threatening words and vulgarities, and asked me to get out of the car to fight him," Bee Pok wrote.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"I could see from his red face that he looked intoxicated."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bee Pok then called the police for help, even as loud thuds were heard from objects being thrown at his car.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In one of the clips, Bee Pok can be heard telling a police officer over the phone: "He's a crazy person. He's throwing things at me for no reason."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The cabby continued to drive alongside Bee Pok's car, blaring his horn continuously while swerving left and right.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">He resumed throwing objects at Bee Pok's car, then drove towards the exit to East Coast Parkway, before swerving back dangerously to the KPE and almost hitting the divider.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bee Pok, who said that he made three calls to the police, wrote: "He kept signalling me to stop the car. I feared for my safety."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">He ignored the cabby, and the ordeal finally ended when the driver took the Marina Bay exit along the Marina Coastal Expressway.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">A police spokesman confirmed on Monday that they received a call at around 5.55pm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Investigations are ongoing into the case, which has been classified as a rash act.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Patrick Nathan, vice-president of corporate information and communications at SMRT, said investigations showed that the taxi was driven by a relief driver who had no prior accident record.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">SMRT terminated his contract on Monday, he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"The incident is regrettable. SMRT takes a serious view on any incident that may compromise the safety of our passengers, as well as fellow road users," Mr Nathan said.</span></p>

              Basically, most TDs do not know how to express themselve well, and at the same time, there is little or no avenue for taxi drivers to sound their complain and hardship on the road.
              
              Not saying that TD is right or wrong, but public views are alway toward public user than TDs, for one to do such dangerous stuff, the TD must had been agitated by the motorist in the early part which we do not know nor get to know. That Motorist might had scolded vulgar at TD or cut his lane, or tail gated him,...so it is very much a one sided stories, coupled with video taken by motorist, TD gets the punishment.
              
              Moverover, a public motorist will tends to take video that he is right and TD is mad or dangerous, as chinese saying if there is no wind, there will be no waves. 
              
              And as many TD do not know how to express themselve, anger and frustration translate onto the road raging is common, so brother, keep cool, there are lots of stupid public motorists in Singapore who like to agitate you, then take video of you doing yr stunts

              Right, as I said, the taxi driver should had been more steady and compose, perhap TD was sleepy, and that led to the swifting.
              
              That is why I said, enough rest is important, a office staff can sleep on his job, a guard can also doze off, even a boss can sleep on his chair, the most is get a wake up call, but as a TD.....please dun doze off, I know there are a lots of ai koon ai koon pui pui drivers, but please, if time to sleep, go to some place to sleep first after dropping the pax

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">SINGAPORE - A former relief taxi driver who terrorised a motorist on the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) tunnel last month was jailed for four weeks on Wednesday for the rash act.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">The Feb 1 incident saw the SMRT driver tailgating, swerving in and out of lanes, and hurling vulgarities and objects at the white Toyota car. It was caught by the 36-year-old victim's in-car cameras. He posted 23 clips on YouTube.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Car salesman Wayne Lim Yen Yew, 32, had pleaded guilty to hurling a Coke can and coins at Mr Shaun Lim Chin Seng's car at about 5.40pm that day. He had also admitted to causing hurt to a 17-year-old in a 2012 carpark incident.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">The court heard that while the two vehicles were on the KPE at about 5.40pm, Lim cut into the second lane behind the victim's car and tailgated him.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Lim then cut into the first lane and travelled alongside the Toyota, sped up and swerved his taxi slightly, causing a near collision.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">The victim then drove to the first lane behind the SMRT taxi and switched his high beam lights on.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">While the victim was driving behind the taxi, Lim began slowing down and filtered into the second lane and almost came to a complete stop, causing a car behind to brake abruptly to prevent a collision</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Deputy Public Prosecutor Claire Poh said Lim went to the third lane and stopped his car. He wound down his window.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">The victim drove past Lim's taxi to avoid any confrontation with him, but Lim started to follow the Toyota.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Lim drove past it and flung a Coke can, which hit the bumper of the Toyota.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">When the victim asked why he did that, Lim responded with Hokkien vulgarities.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Subsequently, Lim thew one coin after another at the Toyota, which cost about $700 to repair and spray paint.</span></span></p>

              <p>Basically, most TDs do not know how to express themselve well,
              and at the same time, there is little or no avenue for taxi drivers
              to sound their complain and hardship on the road.</p>
              <p>Not saying that TD is right or wrong, but public views are alway
              toward public user than TDs, for one to do such dangerous stuff,
              the TD must had been agitated by the motorist in the early part
              which we do not know nor get to know. That Motorist might had
              scolded vulgar at TD or cut his lane, or tail gated him,...so it is
              very much a one sided stories, coupled with video taken by
              motorist, TD gets the punishment.</p>
              <p>Moverover, a public motorist will tends to take video that he is
              right and TD is mad or dangerous, as chinese saying if there is no
              wind, there will be no waves.</p>
              <p>And as many TD do not know how to express themselve, anger and
              frustration translate onto the road raging is common, so brother,
              keep cool, there are lots of stupid public motorists in Singapore
              who like to agitate you, then take video of you doing yr stunts</p>

              So what standard do you want, ISO14000 or API certification?
              
              As a taxi cum casket driver, like this standard..seibei ho liao.
              
              And it is on this kind of standard, the forum strive on...of cos you can go look for higher standard, those that strive on ego, face and pride more than a layman taxi driver standard. 
              
              There is another taxi forum also in sgforum with only one poster...abt japan, really got standard and unique
