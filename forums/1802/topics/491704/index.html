              If your Ba Zi shows you are not in the transportation industry them please go analyse and avoid this career.

              <p>Don't quit yet....Bazi has some limitations and does not reveal all things...  You may want to check your Zi Wei Dou Shu chart too.</p>
              <p>You may be born with certain unfavourable elements but things would change with time.  Every ten years, things change.   So unfavourable things may change to favourable things.    You may have wealth elements in your Travelling Palace.  Travelling Palace does not necessarilly means going overseas, it could mean doing sales in Singapore and taxi driving is legitimate "doing sales in Travelling Palace" (we know when we are out there we sure make money unless kena ticket or accident or drive too short hours).</p>
              <p>So wiser to consult a good Destiny Chart reader before you make your career switching decision.   Good diviners charge anywhere from $100+ to more than $500 in Singapore.</p>

              <p>There is not fixed industry....some day masters are the flexibly type who could fit into any industry.  </p>
              <p>Take for instance if I purely use my Day Master type, then I should be in construction / renovation.  But I did not study civil engineering and both my Bazi (too much Earth elements) and Zi Wei Dou Shu charts (it is <a style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; white-space: nowrap; line-height: 1.231; color: #660099; cursor: pointer;" href="http://dictionary.pinpinchinese.com/definitions/s/%E5%A4%A9%E7%BD%97%E5%9C%B0%E7%BD%91-tianluodiwang">å¤©ç½—åœ°ç½‘</a><span style="line-height: 1.231;">) reveal that sector is bad for me.   So I go for any industry other than construction / renovation.  å¥½å‘½ä¸�å¦‚å¥½è¿�</span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> so good decade is more important for me.</span></p>
              <p>10 years cycle by ZWDS definition is can stretch into next 5 years.  By the time you are 15 years in that industry, you would continue on usless you somehow strike Toto or managed to get rich by some means (shares investment, inherited your parent's HDB flat which gives you additional cash flow (sell or rent out) to do other things).</p>
              <p>The only thing is you may not have as much energy to "Chong" as before and therefore may scale back on driving time (instead of driving 12 hours, you drive 8-10 hours and call it a day).   It is also possible that you could become Singapore Taxi Academy instructor or work in Comfort's admin office doing something.</p>
              <p>If you keep making mid-career switches, then you would discover that you wasted a lot of time and money doing that and lost out a lot.</p>

              <p>New Mercs rental $180 per day or $5400 per month.   $7000 - $5400 = $2600.  This $2600 is without CPF one, without 1 month's holiday one, without 3 months bonus one and most likely long hours one.   What is there to brag about?   </p>
              <p>However if it is net $7K, then it is a lot.   But I seriously doubt so as one is unable to sustan at that pace unless one has a few good long-term Lobangs.</p>
              <p>I have never been in their shoes but I was thinking their pattern is go to hotel, pick up customers who are going to airport, drop them at airport, join the 30 minutes queue at airport (or drive 20-30 minutes back to town), drive foreigners to hotel (locals would not take white or black).   Queue at same hotel or go to another hotel.</p>
              <p>During non-peak hours, Marina Bay Sands to airport only make around $17-$18 (Sonata around $13.30).  Come back that time add $3 but must wait for average of 30 minutes.  Waiting time also longer than others because locals avoid them.  If waiting time at airport long, cannot suka su ka switch to Tanah Marah, Tampines, Pasir Ris or Bedok and definitely must waste at least 20-30 minutes driving back to town.</p>

              <p>New Mercs rental $180 per day or $5400 per month.   $7000 -
              $5400 = $2600.  This $2600 is without CPF one, without 1
              month's holiday one, without 3 months bonus one and most likely
              long hours one.   What is there to brag about?
                </p>
              <p>However if it is net $7K, then it is a lot.   But I
              seriously doubt so as one is unable to sustan at that pace unless
              one has a few good long-term Lobangs.</p>
              <p>I have never been in their shoes but I was thinking their
              pattern is go to hotel, pick up customers who are going to airport,
              drop them at airport, join the 30 minutes queue at airport (or
              drive 20-30 minutes back to town), drive foreigners to hotel
              (locals would not take white or black).   Queue at same hotel
              or go to another hotel.</p>
              <p>During non-peak hours, Marina Bay Sands to airport only make
              around $17-$18 (Sonata around $13.30).  Come back that time
              add $3 but must wait for average of 30 minutes.  Waiting time
              also longer than others because locals avoid them.  If waiting
              time at airport long, cannot suka su ka switch to Tanah Marah,
              Tampines, Pasir Ris or Bedok and definitely must waste at least
              20-30 minutes driving back to town.</p>
