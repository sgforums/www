            <div class='col-md body'>Just now around 5pm(25th Nov 2006), we were waiting for cab at Sentosa to leave that place. I was carrying my girlfriend's dog(silky terrier) in a carrier bag with only dog's head exposed. After waiting for 5 minutes, two Caucasians came along. One of them asked us if we are waiting for taxi and we replied yes so they just stood near and behind us.<br><br>After a while, a Mercedes cab slowed down and we thought he is stopping for us but it actually drove past us and stopped directly in front of the two Caucasians which is 3-5 meters away from us. The two Caucasians talked to the taxi driver for a while and one of them gestured us to walk over to hop in because they knew we reached there earlier (appreciate them for this). My girlfriend walked over first and the taxi driver straightaway showed a very rude shoo-shoo hand signal either telling us to shoo off or he don't want to pick us, which i happened to see too. I guess the two Caucasians saw it too.<br><br>Then he continued on discussing with the two Caucasians sort of like asking them if they still wanna board the taxi. However, the two Caucasians never board the taxi. For what reasons, i don't know. I hope it's not because the two Caucasians looked down on that taxi driver?<br><br>This is really a disgrace to other good Singapore Taxi drivers. And to think he's a Mercedes cab driver. I don't even know how this guy was selected to drive the Mercedes cab in the first place. I thought Mercedes cab drivers are carefully selected by the taxi companies?<br><br>He can give a hundred reasons for rejecting us such as pet phobia or whatever reasons but he's definitely not right to give us a shoo off hand signal without even taking a second look at us or speak to us politely. Imagine we are just another pair of tourists and this kind of service will definitely leave a very bad impression. So what's all the big deal about claiming Singapore has one of the best public transport infrastructure/service around the world?<br><br>Anyway, thinking to write a complaint letter but we only got the car plate number SHB6636X and don't know what company that cab is from. So i can only share with you guys here.</div>

I hope most people do not have the same mindset as you or else the service level here will deteriorates a lot . No offences too but you are taking it too lightly.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I tend to agree that arrogant, dishonest, rude and ill-mannered drivers should be taken off the street. One idiot Confort cab dida left turn and i was turning right .The lane we both were turning had two lanes he had to turn into my lane and after that stare at me. Come on two lanes of cos i would turn into the extreme right lane and would not have expected an idiot on the road to do a two lane left turn.<br><br>Fine with that ,after i drove by him he gave me the middle finger... how impossible can it be man. He was lucky i was in a hurry or I'll stop in front of him and ask him to get out of his car and take down him number plate and report him to Comfort.<br><br>Do you think i care if his children and wife have to eat plain rice or bread every meal.<br><br>These taxi drivers think just because they need to earn a living of the road they own it.<br><br>The next taxi idiot that does something idiotic would suffer man i bought a digital video feed camera and it takes down all the wrong doing like cutting lane suddenly and cutting without signalling type of offence and I'll send it to TP and their company.<br><br>I'm pure evil<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Really , u guys think that this Merc driver are going to lose his job ?<br><br>If i'm the Merc driver , i'll be A okay .<br><br>No way this chap is going to lose his job , as long as he can give our enforcement officer a good explanation , most likely he'll keep his job .<br><br>And now this cabby has a case here , he has the right to reject customers with dogs .<br><br>wanna bet ?<br><br>Anyway .... one of our company ruling , cabby has the right to reject customer who has a pet due to whatever reason , nose senstive la , religion la .... Cabbies is protected with this reason .<br><br>So our company come out with a sloution , no fuss sloution ! Customer can call for a cab , and the special instruction to cabby is <strong>customer has a "dog with leash" ,  </strong>those cabbies who bid for this job has to oblige to take the customers and their dog .<br><br>I had to say this SHB 6636 is a Sovereign , which belongs to Comfort .<br><br>Go on and complaint .... no use one .<br><br>How i know ? I am just one of those cabbies who rejected customers multiple times with dogs , and not a single time customer can make me lose my job .</div>
