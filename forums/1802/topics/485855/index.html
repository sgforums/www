              Stay at home also can fell down and died, in fact, accordingly to our company casket death statistic, 70% people died at their home, and that is also similar to our national statistic of 65%. 
              
              Therefore at times, the most safest place, can be the most dangerous

              The truth is taxi drivers pre mature death is lower than white collar workers, in fact, pre mature death (meaning die out of a sudden like cardio arrest or full stroke) highest are those business peoples, from bankers to traders to towkays.
              
              Because for them is 24hrs stress, and on top of that, lead an unhealthy lifestyle, here eat there eat, here sex there sex, here fly there fly..boom!
              
              So, dun worry, taxi drivers is just as normal as any workers in term of pre mature death.

              Aiyo ah Lim, u talking abt income or medical problem, if u mix them up, as TD, u sure to get emotional, to be frank, those who sit at home and do nothing are the highest risk to hit diabetic and dementia, Taxi driving is good in both motto and brain skill, but just dun over cook it, that is why, at times, $30 net ok liao, there are 100,000 executives working in financial centres, 54,000 full cum relief taxi drivers.

              Taxi drivers death I pick is abt 1 is to 50 others, and executives form the big bulk, and our public hospital like NUH, SGH ..TTSH extra serve the public including taxi drivers, however, private hospital like glenneagle, Mt E, raffles etc etc serve almost all executives, and it is full, so you can image, how many are sick in comparing to TD.
              
              But I usually hate to pick dead TD, cos they know the road well, if me go wrong way, scare kenna fark by them..seibei sway
