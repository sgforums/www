              If you know that accident with own fault, income gone..then try to be careful lah, once you are careful, the probability of your own fault is greatly reduced, but of course there will be accident, because on the road, lots of kuku, high ego, humsup aunties and hp/tab addicted drivers, sure to knock into something, but it is not yr fault mah.
              
              If you study A math, you will understand what is probability, I have been trying to apply it to toto and 4D, but knn, so far, no luck

              Aiya, all TD got different pattern of driving, the place you live, the place you start yr shift, the place you put fuel and so on do affect a driving pattern of a TD, some like to grab calls, some like to take calls, some like sweeping like me, some like Q, some heading to nowhere, some drive with a heading....as long as end of the day, you can make a net profit with the target set, so be it, even a bit lower also nevermind, there will be another day to grab and pick again.

              I tell from my own experience mah...
              I same age as ex-chief ...:p
              after 40 can still work for others but body cannot cheong sama sama as when you are 20s or 30s... so if you are getting a high pay + cannot cheong sama as the youngsters.
              Boss will find ways to kick you out and replace you with a younger chap or worst FT.
              
              During my younger days, I can work for a company for 8 years. Nowadays, cannot plan too far. No Iron rice bowl unless you work for the govt.  
              
              Therefore, setting up a biz is still the best way to control your own destiny. 
              
              Now I read a lot of youngster coming out to be hawker. They may not be earing as much as a TD during the first year. But if they can be successful and open a few branches after a few years ... their earning will be more than a TD. 
              
              Of course, biz got risk....you may lose out your capital.... but no risk no gain....plan carefully first before you start......

              <p>HA HA HA...
                          
                          Bro, my advice to you is to consider your options before committing to Full time TD. I quit my job few years back, having the same thinking as you, tired of the trade that I am in, wanting to do something that have no restrictions of time and need not report to anyone, during then I am about your age. 
                          
                          But guess what, after 1 and a half year of driving taxi, I had learn to treasure any job that comes by and becomes more down to earth. As TD is not an easy job, to be good at it, everything come into play, which makes me ponder about my past jobs that I had thrown away. Luckily, I manage to come back to the trade I was previously in and you know what, after the things that I learned in TD, I am more focus and because of all this various reasons mention above, I was promoted soon after.
                          
                          Now although things have its up and down, I still stay positive no matter what, that is what I have learned and till now cherish this lesson.
                          
                          I will definitely go back to TD, but not at my current age, maybe another 10 to 15 years down the road.
                          
                          Hope this will help you decide which roads to chose. See you around mate.</p>
