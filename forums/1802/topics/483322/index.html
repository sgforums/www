              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16.803150177001953px;">Newbie here but have been following your post for a while. Was thinking whether should i quit my current job to drive taxi. I am 38 Years old this year and hold a TVL since 2010. I have no yet driven any taxi before. I work in a small local company, (own by relative)  for 7 years who bao ka liao from sales to service to admin, my company only 3 people. My pay was $1200 from 2007 to $2300 now and drives a company car. I get to travel to S.E.A about 4 times a year and as and when machine is sold or breakdown with no travel allowance. i am expected to work on some weekends without any off day especially went oversea come back, next day carry on working. Reason for wanting to quit is sick and tired of job and travelling and i believe i can earn more. My wife who earns more than me is supportive of me driving taxi. Advise anyone? Appreciated.</p>

              As you are coming from SME, I suggest you try bigger companies, my advice to you is to see advice at Devan Nair Insitute of Empolyment and Employability at Jurong East (beside IMM). They will match yr skill and experience and preferrences with over 100,000 companies that registered with them.
              
              Taxi driving is a stagnation trade, if you do not mind that by 50++ yo and still driving taxi and earning more or less the same amount of money with relation to the future inflation. Then you can consider driving a taxi.
              
              But if you are looking forward to a more challenging job that propel you to higher position and responsibility with a good remuneration that can bring better life to your family, then it is better you seek job matching at e2i.
              
              With the current tight job labour market, you should be able to get a better income and job other than taxi driving, which can do with short term, but not long term.
              
              However, it all still lies within you, yr attitude and committment is yours to decide, but in whatever endeavour you under took, if your attitude is not there, it is a waste of time and effort. 
              
              Finally, TD is not say no good, unless you can forgo the future expects of better life, you can drive taxi. But in our life, at times, we might do one day mistake and suffered for 30 years or for the rest of our life.

Place a deposit with any taxi company you like and then discuss this with your wifey. If you think you like the life then dun look back.

I did wanted to try out as super relief first however although my job is 5 &amp; 1/2 day week, some time it will drag to 6 days week. So it is quite difficult for me to find a hirer to drive on sun as I might go oversea also. Becoming a hirer never cross my mind yet, I wanted to be a relief as I have seen all the previous advise by all the bros here. Newbie OMO is a killer!! i never think that Taxi driving is easy, in fact nothing is easy. Ideal situation for me now is to find a 5 day week job so I can be a relief for sat or sun. If I stick to current job, I never have the chance to try out. Working for relative is not easy when it comes to MC, on leave. MC also must settle outstanding work first, block leave can only during on CNY period as customer are all closed. Rest of the year, want to on leave must have valid reason....sigh..</p></div>

              <p>TS, u are at the critical age of 38. If u become a full time TD now and after 5 years, you get tired liao and want to go back to working life, you will be past 40 and it will be very difficult to find a decent job at that age.  This is the reality of life in Singapore.  You may also lose touch with ur current industry after 5 years to make a comeback.  So, think carefully.</p>
              <p>I guess ur company sells machinery and provides the after sales service locally and in the region. I am not sure why u lose interest after 7 years. Maybe it's ä¸ƒå¹´ä¹‹ç—’.  Haha.</p>
              <p>From what I read, ur relative seems to be taking advantage of u, being his/her relative. </p>
              <p>You said u believe u can earn more. So, u are rather ambitious. Then u shouldn't be a full time TD now, because ur earnings will stagnate with inflation and u may be unhappy again <span style="line-height: 1.231;">after a few years.</span></p>
              <p>Discuss ur quitting with ur relative and see what he/she says or can do for u. You have to ask urself whether u will reconsider if ur relative offered u another $500 more in salary. Or better still, ask for a salary of $3,500 at least.  No need to be shy one since u are bao kah liao. If not happy, look for another job.  If cannot find, then become a full time TD. Not sure if u have considered starting out on ur own in the same industry since u can do the sales, service and admin..</p>
              <p>I am a part time TD, drive Saturdays only.  Quite tired of my job also, but cannot quit cos got family commitments...</p>

              <p>Thks Bro Bowah for your insight advice. However, if i move on to
              bigger companies, most likely i have to do the same trade again
              which i have started to lose interest in. When i come into this
              trade, i know nuts about machine. Now the longer i involved in this
              trade, the more i hate it. i like to try out something different
              but have no other skills which is why i took up TVL in 2010. I do
              enjoy driving though.</p>

              <p>Ts, if you thinking of coming in for a better income.......$2300 + Employer CPF contribution + one free car + annual leave + medical leave/expenses </p>
              <p>consider again. </p>
              <p>as a taxi driver to earn that amount, is not going to be easy.</p>
              <p>You get sick of it when you got to work after travel........</p>
              <p>will you get sick if you got to pay rental + no income when you travel?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You got sick when you got to work on some weekend</p>
              <p>will you get sick when you got to work on every weekend ?</p>
              <p>In Taxi driving, your off day is not only a no pay day, there is a rental to pay and that eat into your working days income</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It take you seven years to lost interest in your present trade</p>
              <p>How long will you take to lost interest in....... facing our road, traffic jam, summon, rude customer...etc</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, your present job is not fantastic</p>
              <p>do you think as a taxi driver is gonna be glamorous</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you still positive after deeper consideration, and ready to face the consequences </p>
              <p>then........just do it</p>

His reply was to sell more machine so i can earn more. However, if i sell more, i will do more aftersales service also and i only got 2 hands. How to sell? Singapore market is diminishing so easy to sell? Can you imagine after CPF deduction, my take home is $1840 as good as my FT colleague here. Yes i have company car to drive home but with condition that when oversea supplier/ trainer is here, i'm expected to fetch them from airport to anywhere as long as they are here. When car breakdown, will kpkb how i drive till like that. it is a 5 yr old car for god sake. anyway, you are right bro, relative tends to take advantage, thats all i can say.

              <p>The taxi bros here are just highlighting what to expect if you become a TD. Once you have decided with your eyes and ears open, then just go ahead lah..</p>
