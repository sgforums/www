              <p>Actually sex is also good, it help both in physical and mental alertness and evade all stress. Under the kamasutra, Sex is consider a universal exercise, from cycling to swimming to hip, belly and buttock thrusting and so on. It is an all rounder.</p>
              <p>But of cos too much sex is no good, and for that matter, anything too much is also no good, keep going swimming also is no good due to chloride leading to skin problem, bald head and also water entering ear, nose and mouth in a long run can create sinustatis.</p>
              <p>Badminton is good, but too much can lead to knee and neck problem, so are jogging and many other sports and games. Remember what I said, seek the middle way</p>
