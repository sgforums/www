              <p>No lah, it's relief who hold the better cards. Hirer terminate you, he gotta find another. You relief can find many hirers until the one you can get along with.</p>
              <p>Both also can be done, but hirer you must be more disciplined, because once you hold the keys (from the company), it becomes your baby more or less.</p>
              <p>But hirer if drive in the morning is better, healthier for sure. Night driving takes a toll on your body.</p>

              <p>So it is much depend on individual discipline and his ability to hold fort. If so, be a hirer is of no problem,</p>
              <p>But if individual himself is not so discipline and knowing his weakness of likely to hop around with less stress on having to attach to a contract, then maybe he can choose to be a relief.</p>
              <p>So, the personality do play a critical roles, and also for some like my bro, smlj people also cannot get along, then better be OMO.</p>
              <p>Lastly, as we are know that Hotels are booming here and there, if one can step into restuarants, food and beverage, hotel and motel lines, it can be more lucrative than TD. The business and labour market is shifting itself toward a service and financial orientated business and technology is also shifting toward higher tech such as biotech and pharmacy.</p>
              <p>Sometime it is no that there is no job for you, it is because you are structurally unable to take up some job, or in another word, not qualify or trained, therefore, govt with WDA had put in millions to upgrade locals in train and place employment, however, individual need to be discipline and like all job including TD, work hard.</p>

              attach to a contract, then maybe he can choose to be a relief.</p>
              <p>So, the personality do play a critical roles, and also for some
              like my bro, smlj people also cannot get along, then better be
              OMO.</p>
              <p>Lastly, as we are know that Hotels are booming here and there,
              if one can step into restuarants, food and beverage, hotel and
              motel lines, it can be more lucrative than TD. The business and
              labour market is shifting itself toward a service and
              financial orientated business and technology is also shifting
              toward higher tech such as biotech and pharmacy.</p>
              <p>Sometime it is no that there is no job for you, it is because
              you are structurally unable to take up some job, or in another
              word, not qualify or trained, therefore, govt with WDA had put in
              millions to upgrade locals in train and place employment, however,
              individual need to be discipline and like all job including TD,
              work hard.</p>

              <p>i know of omo can cope with day and night, but in the pm, go
              back and rest few hours, around 4pm come out again</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>omo and night relief got better $$ to make during peak hours,
              day relief, peak hours so short only</p>

              <p>No, I'm not talking about those split shift OMOes...</p>
              <p>Anyway, day shift drivers only can hope between 5-11am soon soon kia chun....</p>
              <p>If those 5am-5pm day shift drivers, between this time, cannot make, that's it for the day...</p>
              <p>Season drivers will know, afternoon is mostly serving charity time....</p>
              <p>So in other word, comparing between OMOes and day shift drivers, longer hour for OMO definitely will see more profit than day shift drivers....</p>

              <p>OMO on the other hand, got benefit and in some companies like TC, some rebates per month which is also getting lesser by newer cabs. It is also good for OMO in a sense that you can carry on own time own target. And also avoid the hassle of cleaning, washing and time wastage in handling over.</p>
              <p>Relief, if not full week, may not be able to enjoy the perks given to hirer, furthermore, the time factor of returning can take some time off, and also a stressful one if are late in returning due to a last minute airport trip cannot let go, then you see yourself zooming like no govt down the expressway..lols</p>
