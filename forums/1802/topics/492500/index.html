              There was once Najib, LHL, Aquino taking a trip in a small plane somewhere in Cebu, Najib bought along his grandson who was carrying a school bag.
              
              The pilot said, plane can take only 3 paxs, LHL said, can lah, one small paxs why cannot, so the pilot said ok, up to you all.
              
              Once lifted off, not long the plane got problem, the pilot said, there are only 4 parachutes in this plane, sorry gentlemen, I take one first, so he took one and jumped out
              
              LHL said, oh, I take the 2nd parachute and said goodbye guys, and he jumped
              
              Next Aquino also take the 3rd parachute and jumped
              
              Now left with one parachute for Najib and his grandson
              
              How?
              
              Najib told his grandson, you are young, I am already old, you take the last parachute, remember when you are back home, go draw out all my money, let me died with the plane, so he gives his grandson his 1 MB account numbers.
              
              His grandson told Najib, Kong kong, no worries, Just now I saw Uncle Lee took my school bag and jumped, we still got 2 parachutes...

              Only our lau charbor mod like to share ride with others, how to success, it is a suck business model, basically, if people want to take a cab or private ride, they will like to have privacy and that is why it is call private ride.
              
              If she likes to share share so much, go take bus and mrt lah, so many to share with.

              Speaking from an old man perspectives, it is better to trust a snake than an old man like me.

              <p>Your dad drives for which company?  If it is Comfort/Citycab, he can call them to help do the match up. Or log in to driver portal to look for hirer or register his interest to be relief.  Better chance this way.</p>
