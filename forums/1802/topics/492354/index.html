            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I have mentioned before. The minister is not aware of what is going on.  Picture this scenario.</p>
              <p>Minister: May I see the reports on the Taxi Availability standards?<br>Perm Sec: I'm sorry sir, but it will take 2 man years to gather that information.</p>
              <p>Now if this can be done to the president, how much more the minister? I don't think LTA has been very honest in their feedback to the minister. Let me tell you why I think so. I remember when the TA standardspercentage was raised, I received a letter which showed a formula calculating our days off each month. You see LTA is ver sly. They tell us we have to drive 28 days a mointh. But yet they come up with some fancy formula to show that we are getting 5 of days a month.</p>
              <p>Now, if we are getting 5 off days a month, and there are 30 days a month even a primary school kid can tell you that you have to drive 25 days. You see how sly they are? Why must use smlj formula to tell us we get smlj days off? So they also tell the minister that TD are getting 5 off days a month</p>
              <p>Also every now and then, they get ST to publish that taxi waiting times are improving every month. If that was true, why did they suddenly and urgently allow PH cars to ferry passengers? It is obvious their reports were just tales of fiction, because they don't want to admit the failure of the TA standards, that it cause many TDs to throw key and it resulted in an acute shortage of taxis.</p>
              <p>If the minister really wants to look at the true impactthe TA standards has on TDs, don't need to take smlj man years. Some TCs send a monthly sto their TDs about their monthly performance regarding the TA. SMRT is one of them. All the minister has to do, is get their representative to go down to SMRT, request for the names of hirers, and then randomly pick a few hundred names. There should be a mix of the different types of TD, those with relief, OMO amd Limo drivers. Then they should take a look at these reports and see for  themselves how exactly TDs are being treated. Especially they should request for the reports for the month of February. Then see if this is what LTA has been telling them. And, after examining these reports, if they still approve, then there can be no doubt that they want us to up lorry.</p>

              <p>You must understand that as a politician, they got many conflicting interests. It is fair to say our ministers are very intelligent people. It should be fair to say they are more intelligent than me and many of us.</p>
              <p>So with many responsibilites and conflicting interests to care about, they frequently have to turn a blind eye. They know where to dig, and how to get an honest feedback of the citizens problems. But they choose to act blur, teh gong and shut their ears. Why they do this? Only they know. There could be difficulties. Maybe pink panther has guidelines for them.</p>
              <p>Just know they mean well. Maybe their policies affected you. Hey I farking lost my job years ago and became a cabby because of their terrible FT polices you know??!! </p>

              <p>I have no doubt about their intelligenceand capability. That is why I said they are either misinformed or not given the full picture of the situation. That is the reason their answers are based on the information they receive.</p>

              Still can come back as driver lah, but not those alive passenger driver, can be goods drivers, casket drivers, food panda driver...
                      
              As for Intelligent, study had shown that any average person is intelligent, it is how the person is nurtured and exposed that bring out the intelligent in them, taxi drivers are also intelligent peoples, 
              
              so are cleaners and casket drivers, just that we are not well nurtured and supported, and more importantly given that opportunity and luck.
                      
              Most ministers are inter connected aka relationship in progress, most are from army and police force, as young as primary 3, they are noted and nurtured,
                      
              I remember when ai koon Teo was a captain in the navy, the colonel told us, this man is special, and he even respect him even tho he is his superior, 
                  
              because they knew they are going to be some top Minister...and is he intelligent and capable??? you go judge yourself.
                      
              Finally, I leave one quote by my primary 5 chio bu teacher, she wrote in my report book, that up till now, I still admit it is true.

               "Student Bowah is very intelligent, but super lazy."
