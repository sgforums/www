Koh was drinking beer with his friend, chef Toh Meng Teck, 40, and his friend's girlfriend. Mr Toh had brought along his pet chihuahua, Lucky. The couple and Koh left separately at 1am. Mr Toh raised his hand as the couple crossed the road, and Mr Ling slowed down.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 13px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">But he did not see the chihuahua, which was not leashed and had run under the taxi, the court heard. The aggrieved Mr Toh started shouting vulgarities, attracting the attention of Koh, who then rushed over. Koh, who is married, heard the taxi driver comment in Hokkien that "it was just a dog".</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 13px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In mitigation, defence counsel S S Dhillon argued that the animal lover was provoked by the "casual" comment, and the attack was "most unfortunate and totally out of line with his character". In sentencing Koh to eight months' jail, District Judge Lee Poh Choo found that Koh's reaction "far exceeded the circumstances", and that the dog owner was not blameless as he had failed to leash the chihuahua. She also agreed with the prosecution that Mr Ling was "not reckless", because he had slowed down to let Mr Toh cross the road.</p>

              <p>District Judge Lee Poh Choo.  She was the same judge that sentenced the Ang Mo to 6 weeks jail for hitting a Transcab TD with an umbrella...</p>
              <p>The comment by the TD that it was just a dog is unnecessary.  To some people, their dogs are like their own family..But then, if you love your dog like your child, you should carry it or leash it when you cross the road..</p>
              <p>Looking at the TD's injuries, it appears to be multiple punches, not two.</p>

              <p>It is this kind of thinking and posting that can get ppl in trouble for contempt of court. I doubt you are really the victim.</p>
              <p>The difference in sentence has Nothing to do with nationality. It has to do with Law. In Case 1 it was Sec 323 Cap 224 in case it was 326 - voluntarily causing grievious hurt - a fracture. Fracture usually starts at 5-6 months, here the victim had multiple fracture and a public transport worker.</p>
              <p>To infer the Court passes sentence based on a person's nationality infers the Court is biased and very likely persons doing this will be charged for contempt.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately 4 men still cannot be classified as rioting. To commit rioting you must be a member of an unlawful assembly. An unlawful assembly comprises a minimum of 5 persons. So if the others kena it will be 323 or maybe if more jialat 326 with common intention</p>
              <p>As for this case, so far we only know of 1 kena jailed, dunno what happen to the others. Whether they also charged and their case still pending, they not involved or this guy take the rap for all 4, even maybe the evidence not strong to link all the others.</p>
