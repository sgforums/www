              Actually you are late by a minute, with that reasoning, pax can
              take any cab, and I believe it is a good pax to alight and took yr
              cab, or that the cabby infront might had felt something wrong and
              told the pax to abide the call so as to show brotherhood among TDs.
              No matter what, you should be grateful to the pax. As for Huat and
              calls...tiam tiam tio ho hor. If not later many job Taxi trade,
              then again, too many taxi on the road</p>

              Strictly speaking pax notification is 5 to 7 minutes. CDG side I am late. Pax side within time frame.

              Press 10 minutes best, responsible pax will wait for you. 
                      
              In taking call, you must know the location of pick up, as everyone knows that main road, bus stop or taxi stand hv high no show situation, try to avoid, unless you know it is in high demand like Vivo or after some holiday eve events.
                      
              Let talk about Condo, when pax call for cab, she is in her house, if you said 10 minutes, she can wait awhile, do some make up or other house hold, if you said 3 minutes, she hv to rush, if you said 7 minutes, she also hv to rush abit, then after rushing down cannot find the cab, naturally, will get a bit frustrated, then gum gum one cab just drop a pax, and her time might be a minute faster, so, off she goes.
                      
              In servicing industry which we TD are in, Taxis should be waiting for pax in an On call situation, that is service, but many TDs hv a wrong concept, they expect the pax to wait for them so as to achieve a pick and go situation.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>@tcsaaa this kind of pattern is really jin jia lat. Think cabbies owe them a living? Treat cabbies as their maid? Cumfuk want us wait 10 mins at our cost. LTA also dont allow us to start meter early. CDG and LTA expect good service but in the end it is at the cabbies expense. CDG taxi company should be removed from parent company and delisted. Every year they have to report increased earnings due to larger taxi fleet and higher rentals. Very scary leh.... How long can this continue?</p></div>

              Call is to make sure correct nos, then later when I do night shift, at 3 am, limpek go to public phone to call them to wake up to go toilet.
              
              Aiya, no shows is part and parcel of our taxi industrial business, same goes to hijack, cancel and so on. Just take it as a hazard like all other industrials, then as you drive, you will learn on where can take call, where cannot take, and you must also admit that once you take, your also take the risk of it no show, we are alway at the expense of the public, LTA,  TP and taxi companies
              
              For me now is ...sweep and sweep lor...
              
              so Brothers, take it easy, it is CNY time, hope all HUAT Big big...kenna toto, pick n go non stop.

              This is their mentality. 
              So far encounter these type:
              1. Go coffee shop tabao. Knn must wait 15 to 20 mins.
              2. Go atm. ...very common encounter. 
              3. Ask me to go against traffic direction. 
              4. Ask me to stop double yellow zig zag line....think baffolo market. 
              5. Give money very fast to me and then alight. Then realised erp I pay.
              6. And many more.....knnn
