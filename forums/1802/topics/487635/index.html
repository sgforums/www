              Not a good move.
              1. Waste your time to call her.
              2. You gain nothing 
              
              You already arrive and the other taxi is still there. 
              
              Must do something lah

              Furthermore. ..the lobby is quite far from the condo main gate....ccb

              This post is about what we should do.
              
              I was there to witness pax board the 1st taxi.
              so have to do something. 
              
              If no show then swallow n move on lor.
              
              ok back to my part....Call cancelled liao.
              so  I drove in front of the lobby driveway  exit.
              Call cancel mah so I need to exit the condo.
              The other taxi still in lobby driveway. 
              Road so narrow so I make a 3 point turn to return back to condo gate.
              Take my time slow turn.
              hazard light on.
              took few minutes. 
              Jap pax took the hint.....quickly run to my taxi.
              then sent her loh. 
              During the journey lecture  her.
              
              reach liao told her to pay peak hour call surcharge. 
              
              I am prepared to quit  CDG if she lodge  a compliant.  Knn  my right I have to stand strong.

              Aiya, TDs where got old or new bird, as long as can get paxs, smlj birds also good.
              
              TDs just hv to bear with certain hazards that is beyong your scope of control, you might not know that one of your pax is also one that called but jumped into your cab, Taxis rules are make for TDs to follow strictly, but it system is make for the public, not for TDs.
              
              If the system is make to be abusing, as per yr case, then do you think a cab driver will ever ask the pax in a condo, "ARE YOU ON CALL SIR&lt; IF SO&lt; PLEASE WAIT FOR YOUR CAB"...if a cabbie is to do that in a pick and go situation, I think that cabbies cannot make it as a TD.
              
              So, learn to give and take, as the system provide more avenue for paxs and calls, TD must change to adapt, to be faster, more nimble and smarter, for all you know, a pick and go pax to AP could be one who had booked an advance call.

              Actually you are late by a minute, with that reasoning, pax can take any cab, and I believe it is a good pax to alight and took yr cab, or that the cabby infront might had felt something wrong and told the pax to abide the call so as to show brotherhood among TDs. No matter what, you should be grateful to the pax.
