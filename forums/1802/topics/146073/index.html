            <div class='col-md body'>SMART automobile has recently included 5 brand new SKODAs into its modest fleet of 500 vehicles, bucking an industry of Toyota Crowns, Nissan Cedrics, and Mercedes.<br><br>the 5 new vehicles, Skoda da Superbs, took delivery yesterday from the local agent for the Volkswagen-owned brand, which is Czech Auto.<br><br>Said Mr Johnny Harjantho, managing director of SMART Automobiles:<br>"The Superbs will be marketed as a premium service, such as Airport Limousine.<br><br>The Superbs, which boosts lots of legroom can also be flagged down at a rate of $3.00 (a premium of 60 cents over the normal cabs).<br><br>We will start with 5 (Superbs), and if they prove to be reliabvle and popular, we will buy more."<br><br>Cabbies who drives the Skodas will pay a daily rental fee of $98 (10% more than their toyota counterparts).<br>The Skodas are equipped with Euro-IV emmission standards, which qualifies from a sizeable tax break. The 5 Superbs has a 2.5 Litre turbo diesel V6 engine and costs more than $70,000 (marginally more than the 3L toyota crown). Mercedes Benz cabs costs around $110,000.<br><br>SMART will also start to try out a Mercedes-Benz bi-fuel. This merc is capable of using petrol and CNG..<br><br>the 5 new Skoda da Superbs reg. no. range:<br>SHB9002E, SHB9003C, SHB9004A, SHB9005K, SHB9006U. all uses the electronic front display (found on Comfort cabs as well).<br>The 5 Skoda Superbs are registered on <strong>04/08/2005</strong> and will retire on <strong>03/08/2013</strong><br><br><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y297/105090/Skoda.jpg"><br><br><span class="small">(05 August 2005 The Straits Times HOME page H6)</span><br><br>MORE information of Skoda Superbs can be found <a href="http://www.skoda-auto.com/global/showroom/superb/" rel="nofollow">HERE</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I looked the info up from the Skoda website...if im right then the Skoda Superb have 160 horsepower.Part taken from the website which is related to the Skoda Superb<br><br>"....The offer consists of a modern and dynamic 6-cylinder, 2.5TDI, 120 kW engine...."<br><br>There is many varients of the Superb..<br><br>Full passage<br><br>We offer you a selection of six modern engines for the Superb, which will surprise you in terms of fuel economy and extended service intervals.<br><br>Three of them are petrol engines: The 6-cylinder V6 2.8 30V is the most powerful engine, which ÂŠkoda Auto has manufactured in the last sixty years Â– it has a power of 142 kW (193 bhp). The next are the 24V, 4-cylinder, 1.8T/110 kW and the 2.0/85 kW engines. All the spark-ignition engines meet the EU4 standards.<br><br>Three TDI engines uphold the extraordinary reputation and popularity of diesel engines. It still applies that a vehicle with this marking has minimum fuel consumption, is reliable and at the same time adequately dynamic. The offer consists of a modern and dynamic 6-cylinder, 2.5TDI, 120 kW engine and two 1.9TDI engines using pump-nozzle technology. The pump is integrated in the cylinder head where it injects fuel under high pressure. The result is, among other things, increase in the performance parameters of the engine and lower fuel consumption.<br><br>All the Superb engines have EOBD. This checks the equipment that has an influence on the content of the exhaust gases. If the values are out of tolerance, the light on the dashboard warns the driver and informs him that he must visit a service centre.

            <div class='col-md body'>What makes you think Mercedes is losing market share ??<br><br>For the latest generation Euro-4 diesel taxis, both E-Class passenger car &amp; Vito mini-bus taxis combined, they are known to have total around 700 units on firm order. More orders not ruled out as the newer 3-litre V6 cDi charged-cooled diesel model doesn't seem yet available in RHD form.<br><br>Lexus ?? No big deal about this brand because it's essentially a Toyota, only re-badged !! In Japanese market, you find so-called Lexus labelled (righfully so) as Toyotas.<br><br>M-B remains THE reference standard for taxis, whether in Germany, much of Europe etc. Problem is not many places seem to have them because the local population have not 'arrived' to pay the price for them !<br><br>Anyway, these new Skoda taxis should be most interesting to try out !<br>I'm curious to see how far they advanced in their diesel engine technology not only from performance aspect, but equally important in their noise, vibration &amp; harshness levels as these very directly affect passenger comfort, areas where even the latest Japanese taxis here are very lousy in !! Also how good the suspension ride comfort is ? The Skoda's wheelbase seem impressively long but space alone is no assurance of comfort as the dynamical aspect plays just as important as role in ensuring overall satisfactory level of comfort in a vehicle.<br><br>Does the Skoda have any engine &amp; gearbox encapsulation ??<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AF2005:</div><div class="quote_body">taxi company should try different models and not stick to just toyota.<br><br>maybe lexus 300GS or 400.<br><br>afterall, mercedes is losing mkt shr.<br><br>and maybe have auto , more smoother.<br></div></blockquote></div>
