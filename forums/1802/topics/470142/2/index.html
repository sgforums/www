              <p><br>No lah, last week, i took a heart surgeon home from NUH, he lives in Serangoon Garden, on the way, I asked him about exercises for middle age people, (since free consultation mah). He said, the heart is a beautiful organ, it actually do not like sedantry stuffs, (meaning stationary or doing the same old stuff), at time, it need some stimulation to get it working more powerful and happier.</p>
              <p>Our mood do play a critical part, and therefore, staying happy is important, secondly, when exercise, do try different type or change once a while, once the heart get use to a certain exercise that you keep doing everyday, it got no feeling and therefore, will not give you much effect. That is why people sometime play badminton, sometime jog, sometime carry weight, and sometime do different kind of bicycling...eh..</p>
              <p>Then on work, or for our case driving, he said monotonous action lead to heart failure, because the heart get so relax and easy that it simply or suddenly stop when you exert pressure, so by changing the way we drive once a while help in a way to stimulate our heart and make it know that hey, dun sleep please, therefore, taking calls is ok, sweeping is also ok, but if you have both of it in a moderate way, it should be better for your Heart.</p>

              <p><br> No lah, last week, i took a heart surgeon home from NUH, he lives
              in Serangoon Garden, on the way, I asked him about exercises for
              middle age people, (since free consultation mah). He said, the
              heart is a beautiful organ, it actually do not like sedantry
              stuffs, (meaning stationary or doing the same old stuff), at time,
              it need some stimulation to get it working more powerful and
              happier.</p>
              <p>Our mood do play a critical part, and therefore, staying happy
              is important, secondly, when exercise, do try different type or
              change once a while, once the heart get use to a certain exercise
              that you keep doing everyday, it got no feeling and therefore, will
              not give you much effect. That is why people sometime play
              badminton, sometime jog, sometime carry weight, and sometime do
              different kind of bicycling...eh..</p>
              <p>Then on work, or for our case driving, he said monotonous action
              lead to heart failure, because the heart get so relax and easy that
              it simply or suddenly stop when you exert pressure, so by changing
              the way we drive once a while help in a way to stimulate our heart
              and make it know that hey, dun sleep please, therefore, taking
              calls is ok, sweeping is also ok, but if you have both of it in a
              moderate way, it should be better for your Heart.</p>

              <p><br>Not only yr driving pattern, as said, human are by nature like to do similar easier thing, and that is why some just love to go AP, because no need to think so much mah, and from AP, it either PIE, TPE or ECP..or sway sway, flora road..hehehe.</p>
              <p>It like eating, you everyday like my chief eat fish porridge, the character and body will not change, there will be more mercury and fish nutrients in you than any other vitamins etc etc..when such daily action keep repeating itself, our body will deterioriate faster, because you allow it to relax and worn faster.</p>
              <p>By changing once a while the lifestyle, way of driving and way of exercises or even way of eating and our leisure events, so to speak, we wake the body again, and anything that is awaken, start to regenerate and thereby creating new cells and open up veins and arteries, it is like reborn, and as time goes by, it become a norm, then you hv to start to change again. That is what use to say "My body is not use to it..blah blah"</p>
              <p>If you take an eg, you play badmination everytime, like my chief, play and play until kneecap also no more fluid, still put plaster and support and play on, end up, he only feel the sweat, but not the gain, because the body had already adapted to his style, so you dun really burnt much calories, cholestrol and not built any muscle and bone mass.</p>
              <p>But if you one day ask him to play softball or basket ball, the first day only, he will feel here pain, there stress pain, this strained, there muscle building..and that is what I mean by change. And if you will to measure his calories burnt, it will be much much more than his usual one badminton session.</p>
