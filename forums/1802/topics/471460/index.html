              <p><br>That I hv to agree, and they are able to provide each and everyone of us a job, which is the most important in every social aspect, without jobs, chaos happen.</p>
              <p>However, no govt is perfect, so is our govt who due to low birthrate, had make a drastic mistake in explosion of foreign intake due to their desparation. And poor judgement had seen infrastructural nearly coming into a standstill, and with it, come the foreign rich that jack up the cost of living beyong a layman job salary, which include basic necessities like housing, food and daily essential goods.</p>
              <p>With it, come the ever higher and higher disparity of the rich and poor, which is detrimental to the society as a whole. The social dimension thereby see a different stroke that further weaken the approach for the youngs to mate and produce.</p>
              <p>And if the projection by the govt still keep on dwelling it policies on economy and business more than it people, then peoples shall feel the heat and changes shall happen, there is sense of not belonging by it people.</p>

              <p>everyone has a role to play in this society....even the baddies....else why need policemen?</p>
              <p>the problem comes when the rich and powerful dictates the pay of those who are working for them gets. whenever a rich says something is cheap (service or goods), it means the rich is taking advantage of the poor.</p>
              <p>how can the poor take advantage of the rich? never. riot, kena charged.</p>
              <p>can the rich live without a maid, public tpt svc, cabbies, service staff, ppl who assembled their expensive cars??? no....but why are they the ones who dictates your pay? the income gap will just grow wider.</p>

              <p>Sure, life is a movie, each act on their own, some act as rich, some act as poor, some rich act poor, and worst is those poor acting rich..some born rich, some born poor..and some from rich to rag.. and some from rag to rich..lols</p>
              <p>Men quest for glory is a never ending hierrachy, when one reach a platform that he dreamed and succeed, he shall thereby climb the next ladder and so on. And that is why men can never be satisfy, which in turn, translate to suffering. From born till death, men struggled all his life, struggle to have more milk, more sweet, more money, more powerful, more able to stand and have more sex with young....so on..lols.</p>
              <p>And that struggling is alway in material, not internal happiness, which needs an enlightened person, be he be rich or poor to appreciate, and for that, not much people can attain such a realm of happiness, if not, this world would had been a better place to live in.</p>
              <p>However, there are few who knows that men need to be tame and control, thereby they set the system and rules to tame and control other men, as such, it bring along wealth and power to these few men who had initial good intention in civilising men, but as time goes by, greed took over them, and that is why they start to dictates and die die never want to give up their powerful even to the extend of having to destroy many other peoples life.</p>
              <p>But if you are enlightened person like me, you will laugh over all these, because ultimately, life have to end. Born, struggle , suffer, sick and die is a must, if you perfectly understand this phrase, life will be a bliss, and all those rich, powerful or poor is nothing but a mere illusion of a movie</p>

              <p>Happiness is H A P P I N E S S, to attain it, it is much difficult then wanting to be rich.</p>
              <p>Take the example of driving taxis, you find the fares giving to you is part of your work, you have to work for it, nothing much to happy about, a day to day basic programmed tasks, but if someone appreciate your work and give you some tips, that can brighten your day and bring much happiness to you throughout the day. It indirectly motivate you to smile, be happy and drive happily, greeting many other paxs with a happy mood.</p>
              <p>WIth it, you might earn more income, and that also why people said, be happy, cos happpy bring lucky too.</p>
              <p>Beside thinking theoretically about happiness within, action is also a must to bring happiness in one daily life, not just go meditate at temple or hall and expect to be happy, that is only relaxation, not happiness.</p>
              <p>You just try to give a seat to a elderly or someone who need a seat at the MRT or bus, you will find the happiness within you throughout the day, it instrinsic in nature, and do you need a single cent to be happy, NO..</p>

              <p>That is basic neccessities, just like you need washing powder, coffee, rice, electricity and water, and to have it, you need to work for it, however, your work can only keep you on the brink of having all these neccessites, any luxuries might be far fetch to you.</p>
              <p>But then, ask yourself throughly, you work for it with your bare hands and brain, you do not cheat on others, you do not, unlike our govt and some people, uses unethical method to take money by destroying other people life, you do a honest living with a honest life, no guilty within, and once your conscience is clear, you are a happy man.</p>
              <p>Of course there are many things that we are not satisfy with it, but a man hav to swallow his own saliva to say, yes, I am a taxi driver, I am poor, I am honest, and I should be happy. You cannot go on and get angry with thing you are not satisfy, because you know you cannot change it alone, so might as well let the fate decide</p>

              <p>bowah, absolutely right. honest is key to happiness too.</p>
              <p>i don't even like to give tuition at market rates unless the parents are damn rich.</p>
              <p>to me, students should not need tuition if their teachers have done a good enough job. sad enough. many are not. and some poor parents are either struggling to earn enough for their kids tuition or the kids are left on their own. the poverty cycle continues.</p>
              <p>Saddest thing....MOE "do not object" to teachers giving tuition outside and in fact set a guideline to it.... That is the damnest thing i have seen.</p>
              <p>Teachers' pay too low? or teachers are too free?? haha</p>
