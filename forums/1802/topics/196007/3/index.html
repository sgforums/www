Or do you think if you change job, there will be a different set of problems? in which case, it may not be the job's problem, it could be due to individual's character that creates the problems, when maybe there isn't much problems at all in the first place. I do find it interesting though, to understand how cab drivers think/feel.<br><br>As for the taxi fare hike, it's quite expected bah. And it's also expected that Singaporeans complain will fall on deaf ears anyway, coz history tell us government don't give a damn what we think, they want to add tax, they add, they want to build new buildings, they build, who cares what we think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Overall ...... cabby's life is good la , no doubt about that .<br><br>Because i played punk  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> , like some had said , i earn enough for myself than some decent drivers .<br><br>I work short hours ... from 5pm to 1am maximum .<br><br>Average drivers earns $80-$120 on weekday's evening , minus my over heads .<br><br>One can earn up to $150-$200 on Friday's evening , a good night .<br><br>We can only fetch this sort of salaries if my job is un-disrupted , soon-soon type , disrupted in a sense , customers ka chiao ka chiao , vomit inside my cab la , go 4 places la , call and cancell booking la , peak period "wait for me , i go coffee-shop buy dinner la " all those nonsense .<br><br>I can watch UCL on Wednesday and Thurday morning , and watch EPL on Satutrday and Sunday evening , and my family is okay with the salary , what else i want in life ?<br><br>And now , i can watch World Cup and my take-home is only less by 10% ..... what else i want .<br><br>Now , our cabby's problem , to curb the rising cost of diesel , which apparently Singaporean thinks it's not their probem to pay , cabby has to pay .<br><br>Singaporean want this , want that ... and don't want to pay .<br><br>That's IMHO ......<br></div>
