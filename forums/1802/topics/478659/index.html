              <p>Received a very interesting call this morning from an associate:</p>
              <p>Call went like this: A is him, M is me.</p>
              <p>A: Hey JR, remember the taxi assault case last year.</p>
              <p>M: Hmm, which one?</p>
              <p>A: The one that came out in the newpaper. About some big Indian guy bashing a TD up!</p>
              <p>M: Ah yes, of course, I also told you about the interesting thing about this driver I discovered later (This is of course our champion BJ)</p>
              <p>A; Well guess, what? I might have discovered him - the assailant that is.</p>
              <p>M: Really? But I also told you there was some discrepancies in his story.</p>
              <p>A: Ya, but the assault definitely took place right?</p>
              <p>M: By the looks of it, yes.</p>
              <p>M: Well what did you find out?</p>
              <p>A: If his storyline is correct about where the assailant lives or where he was supposed to be sent to, some place in Pasir Panajang right?</p>
              <p>M: Yeah, Chwee Chuan Road or something.</p>
              <p>A: Well, I think I've identified the potential assailant - that is I have a name. And also his profile kinda fits your guy's description - violent temper.</p>
              <p>M: Aha, interesting.</p>
              <p>A; Well you want it or not? (A provides name and some other details)</p>
              <p>M: Well ok, I'll take note, but I doubt I'll be passing this on to Clementi or to the TD.</p>
              <p>A: Why?</p>
              <p>M: Because the victim is an asshole. Talk big online, unappreciative yaya type of guy.</p>
              <p>A: Oh ok, just for your info then and whatever action you deem fit.</p>
              <p>M: Thanks.</p>
              <p>So that was it. Of course it's not 100% that this is the assailant, but there's an easy way to find this out. Unfortunately our clever little BJ, thinks so highly of himself and is forever arguing with people online like some super know it all. Had he learnt to be nice, I'm sure I won't be hesitating to pass this info on to either CDG or Clementi Police.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story, why act tough online? Why make enemies with those you don't need to make enemies with?</p>
              <p>Yeah he says Uncle Joe is a CMI policeman. But CMI Uncle Joe was the one who exposed him as a fraud and CMI Uncle Joe now is the one, who might be able to get justice for him.</p>
              <p>Who knows for the rest of you, maybe in future even CMI Uncle Joe might prove useful when you need some help, advise or assistance. Just dont make CMI Uncle Joe angry already, can?</p>

              That's right, for a person who do not know and appreciate networking is ok, we can alway be a normal contented person and life goes on. But with not knowing, yet no facts and base, start to insult others and make a mess of himself who is already in a mess, that is really insensible.
              
              We can be wary of every individual on the streets because of the need for a living, so are all others wary of you, so to speak. But in the midst of all these wary, we use to find some good and trusted buddies who give sound advices, that should be taken as a bonus and sincerely thanks them, that is networking.
              
              Because in life, you might no know that the person you hate now might end up being the person who will help you in near future when you are in trouble, like my bro keepthechange, of course now we seem to hate and argue each with each other, but one fine day, when we coincidentally come to know and meet each other on the street, I might be able to borrow $100 from him.

              <p>Bro JR,,, I had been reading all the saga even before I joined and start posting.. I understand and can relate to your disappointment of the saga.. and I take no stand in whatever decision u made...</p>
              <p>However, in my opinion...I hope u can forward the info to the relevant parties not becuase u want to help him.. but to rid of 1 road bully (or danger to TD) from the road.. and keep the rest of the TDs safe from this guy..</p>
              <p>Also, if really that guy is apprehended and punished hard..it may also send a signal to the rest who think TD are good punching bags that law is always there...</p>

              <p>To wrap up (since some of you saying this is a show, got popcorn etc),</p>
              <p>I decided on this:</p>
              <p>Since this is basically BJ's matter, it's up to him to come here and ask for the assistance. He comes, asks nicely and maybe even apologises, I'm happy to let bygones be bygones.</p>
              <p>Moreover it's definitely up to him, only he can identify the assailant (unless the police have the passer-by's (who witnessed the attack) particulars as well.</p>
              <p>All I hv been provided is a possible name and a few pertinent details. This may or may not be the assailant, but the coincidence is quite interesting - in that, this person is an Indian, is known to have a temper and lives in the area. There surely cannot be that many Indian Singaporeans in that area. As such his photo can be easily retrieved by the police and presented in a line-up for BJ to verify. (This person's photo is available on record since he's been arrested for another crime)</p>
              <p>I accept that nothing may come of it, this person might not be one. However if you look at the progress of the case - it's stalled for almost 10 months already, this is definitely the closest or best possible new clue that has emerged. It's definitely worth a shot looking into.</p>
              <p>Therefore the decision is BJ's to make, one way or another. He can agree to what I asked, he can ignore or he can do what he does best and come here and start pontificating like he's prone to do.</p>
              <p>Or simply, he's buried his bridges with this forum and no longer even bothers to come here, that would effectively close this matter, unless 1 of his friends or chiefs, notices this thread and alerts him.</p>
