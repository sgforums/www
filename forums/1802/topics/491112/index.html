              <p>I got called to Comfort Office due to 3 complains.  All happened during the first 6 months probation periods.  One complained to me too, one silent and one due to MDT problem (that time did not show screen for accepting evoucher so difficult to claim back customer not happy and complained).   Luckily Comfort officer said you still on probation and reaons why you received complain is because you are still new and not too familiar with the routes .  Drafted an appeal letter with his help including promising to put in effort to improve my knowledge of the routes in Singapore .  He told me if I do receive Comfort's termination of contract letter ignore it.   I received one a month later which I obviously ignored.</p>

              <p>True, now more unused taxis in companies....but GC/Uber also caused customers to be lost.   Last time got a lot of mid to long distance customers now a lot of them went to GC and Uber that offers lower rates to them.</p>
              <p>One cabby who was interviewed by asiaone.com described Grabtaxi as <a style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; white-space: nowrap; line-height: 1.231; color: #660099; cursor: pointer;" href="http://www.eudict.com/?lang=chipol&amp;word=%E5%BF%98%E6%81%A9%E8%B2%A0%E7%BE%A9%20%5Bwang-en-fu-yi%5D">å¿˜æ�©è² ç¾©</a> saying they helped Grabtaxi build up customerbase to where it is right now only to be betrayed by them when they started GrabCar to compete with us.</p>
              <p>Grabtaxi is good as they help the taxi drivers who rented from the other 4 taxi companies form a big enough alliance for customers to want to use them to call for taxi.</p>

              <p>Grabtaxi was not very profitable to begin with. It is why they started grabcar. But the business has sufficient potential to get a series C funding in Oct 2014.</p>
              <p>From seed funding to series C, which is about 4 rounds of funding, the original founders are left with around 10% of company shares.</p>

              <p>quite true, nowadays to make a living from driving, need not be a cabby or with any particular company. gone are the days where cuntfuck leads in calls.</p>
              <p>when pax do not have any route in mind, suggest your best route based on experience, but of course, we can control if there's a sudden accident or traffic jam </p>

              Actually we are know the roads very well, you can master all roads, but the problem is the WAY...from the pick up position. Yes, from AP position, we know nearly all places in Singapore and the way, that is why some TDs only ply from AP. No need to think so much mah.
              
              The worst are those living inside those lanjiao small lanes, even HDB now also got so many turn and twist to the block, you can go in...but knn, exit also dunno where liao, then the farking pax living there can somemore fark at you..knn, limpek fark back lor,..you live here, can guide mah, how I know.
