              Gentlemen,
              In every system, there are loopholes, it is just a matter of how many and big the holes are, and there will be abusers, and that is why laws and regulations come into the picture, it is to provide the cane and whip and instill fear factor into those thinking of abusing it. This is enforcement inorder to hold the system in place and tweet it as time changes.
                  
              If you see or being taught of the loopholes within that system that can be exploited, by all means, but dun get caught. For years, there are many system getting exploited because system are created by human, not foolproof.
                  
              And the true here is, many cabbies exploited the system that the enforcer failed to close it or lazy to go and notice it. But A SMART CABBY will never expose how he goes around and beat the system in the public, so if you are a Q cutter in the AP, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
              
              Or better still, stop cut Q, think of all yr other brothers in the Q waiting under the hot sun or on the road. If you want to cheat, try cheat the rich and the govt, but not on yr own brotherhood

              Different school of though lah, if you think you want to be a dog and need fares to survive, then go ahead, chiong all the way.

              <p>Yup. Agreed with getcarter. No need give face to other TDs la. What brotherhood? Talk cock only. I have family to feed and bills to pay. To a TD,  their first enemy when starting shift are other TDs. Second is LTA and lastly are other motorists. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So no need care about how other TDs feel. They wont care about you also. A TD's mentally is that they can makan you they wont hesitate to do so. Try getting into an accident with a TD and clearly your fault and you see how he eat you alive. Cut queue?  Common and least harmful trick in the TD book la. Some TDs can even interview pax at airport and pass the undesired location ones to you. Or cut few lanes in front of you to pick a street pax or horn and flashbeam you like crazy when you drop pax and count change on a one-way road. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So final conclusion,  every man for himself and just do what is advantage to you. You give way or wanna be soft you get eaten only. Thats why i wonder why need make friends with other TDs. At airport i just shut myself in the car listen to music or surf net and wait for my turn to take pax only. Talk so much for what, later they come borrow money from you as you know most TDs la. All the cannon fairy talk only listen also sian. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I disagree that you should behave like other bad TDs. There are more good TDs than bad ones. This is life, it is the same in every industry, bad hats are always there but they are the minority. I have experienced many kind acts from fellow TDs on the road too, this is human nature.</p>
              <p>Don't let the bad minority get you down. Don't degrade yourself and sink to their level lah. I will not do what they do just to get that pax.</p>
              <p>If you do good, good luck will follow you like a shadow. Those who do bad, cut queues, pick pax, etc, may get the short term benefits. But are they any better financially? I dount so.</p>
