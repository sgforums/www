              <p>How to deal with queue cutters in T2? While the rest of us spend time going thru the winding carpark and reach either 1st or 2nd pick up points, there still are some who put on BUSY and u-turn direct to 2nd pick up point. Not talking about the super packed times when marshals will wave u in direct.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Caught one fkr td on video u-turning in with BUSY sign on as I was coming out from sheltered carpark.

              Nabey, that is why I use to say, some TDs mentality are ready Zero up there, want to cheat, be like Najib or pastor Kong Hee, cheat millions... Taxi driving cheat for that little $$, cheat for fark? and when get caught,...no worthy.
                  
              But then, we hv to admit that in any industrial, there will be corruption and cheaters, no matter how you look at it, giving a present is also corruption, offering a free lunch is consider cheating and corruption. But many are talking abt big $$.
                  
              Finding an easy way out is not wrong, it is actually smart people with good EQ and IQ, so if a TD cut Q at AP, he is actually a smart person but used that smart brain in a wrong way, which is typically TDs mentality.

I thought he also like me or have private pickup at he have the busy sign on, NO!! he jump queue straight into the second pickup point to do pickup. Timing very nice. If I didn't follow him at the back, no one in the world would know.</p></div>

              As said, there are cheaters in all role of the society. It is does a matter of whether you want to shame him or not, you can choose to STOMP him, you can choose to report him to his company, you can even complain to the warden on the spot, therefore, it is up to individual to decide, but I believe most of us will just let it go and go on with our life.
              
              If that is so, then these cheating TDs will continue to cheat, cheat and cheat. So, who care? Warden, as long as got cab for pax, wouldn't want to fark care. Govt, as long as no complain, smooth and steady, nothing to worry, to them is like ...aiya, TDs only, care so much for what, let them rot lah. Taxi companies, very simple, their interest is as long as your pay rental on time, arbo..take back the cab.
              
              Therefore, we are very much on our own, so the best way to reduce such cheater is to expose them thru net or whatever social media, then they will come to understand the power of social media, and with TAxi companies name n reputation at stake, with tarnished image of singapore thru TD cheating, with the warden getting warning from the top...u think they will not take action?

              <p>A few days ago, my wife took a 'taxi' to chinatown with my son. Then later my son commented the 'taxi' was a LEXUS. Knn ccb i tio stunned. Where got lexus taxi one? I asked him what color and he said silver!! Wtf got silver lexus taxi one ah?? Then the taxi driver even dare to push card some more. Dare to interview and ask for destination some more!! I asked wife car top got anything? She said no.</p>
              <p>So those bastard ba wan chia better be careful. Limpek will ask my wife to stand roadside and i hide further away. Hopefully one of these private 'taxi' will stop and interview her again. Limpek sure come from nowhere, video him and call LTA.</p>
              <p>LTA if u are reading this, there are many private cars doing this around bukit merah, redhill, outram, cantonment road, eu tong sen and up to middle road.</p>

              Many a time, chow kuan driver also being taught by chow kuan sifu, driver boasting that he go AP no need to Q one, he only ply CBD and AP...so the tu di follow lor, end up, monekey do, monkey see, monkey follow. Then sifu go lim kopi at LTA office, he never tell you one lah, arbo how to be sifu, seibei lau kwee one.

              If pax insist arrival hall, can go and drop him lah, maybe he work at AP as arrival hall security guard or cleaner. But thereafter, TD must automatically drive out to join the Q like all those sending pax at departure hall.
              
              If pax so important, i rather send him or her to T2 ot T3 canteen, send him to first class kamlan

              <p>I avoid AP at all times. Even if send a pax there, will drive to CBP or Tampines or Pasir Ris,etc. No point getting stucked there.</p>
