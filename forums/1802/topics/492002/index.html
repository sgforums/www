              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shorter vocational training hours, lower course fees for taxi drivers</span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Training hours for applicants for the Taxi Driver's Vocational License (TDVL) and the TDVL refresher course will be shortened starting next Monday (May 30), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Singapore Taxi Academy (STA) announced in a joint press release on Friday. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The changes, which were first announced by Senior Minister of State for Transport Ng Chee Meng in Parliament in April, mean that the TDVL will be shortened from 60 hours to 25 hours for new applicants. For taxi drivers undergoing the compulsory refresher TDVL courses every six years, the hours will be reduced from six to three for active drivers and from nine to five for non-active drivers. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The TDVL has also been re-designed to facilitate self-study and classroom coaching within a structured learning framework, the agencies said. For example, trainees are expected to study on their own for at least nine hours, and the course materials will complement the classroom training with the assumption that trainees will revise and practice at their own pace and time. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>STA is also exploring how the self-study parts of the revised TDVL can be conducted through e-learning to allow more structured and convenient training outside of the classroom. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite the shorter classroom time, those that require more help in preparing for their tests can also opt for additional tutorial classes, they added. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>COURSE, TEST FEES TO BE REDUCED</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The number of tests will be reduced from four theory tests and one practical test to only three theory tests. Test fees remain the same at S$5 per test, with a registration fee of S$10, the agencies said in the release. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In addition, the TDVL course fees will also be reduced from S$250 to S$200 for the initial course, and from S$45 to S$40 for active drivers on the refresher course. The course fee for non-active drivers going through the five-hour refresher course will go down from S$50 to S$45. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Additionally, drivers with no vocational license demerit points and who are nominated for good conduct by taxi companies will be exempt from the refresher course. This exemption will take effect for eligible drivers from Aug 1 onwards.</p>

              Ani kuan kong, got rebate those old bird like us who, years ago,  paid a high price for the course and for some, taken a tough test.
              
              I understand where this is coming from, 
              
              1st, to tame taxi drivers against apps ride short course duration of only 10 hrs
              
              2nd, to reduce those taxis not taken having sunbathing with occasionally free rain washing at those taxi companies car parks. One on the road viable taxi end up no taker and not on the road is a huge cost to taxi companies and their shareholders. Not only no rental, but also the cost of space and depreciation can become a triple whammy on the cost.
              
              3rd, hope more gong kia will take up taxi driving.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Those chio taxis that are sunbathing is not because of the course. It is because of the TA standards. Before it was enforced, anyone who wants to be hirer had to wait more than 2 months for a taxi. I remember after I had stroke and wanted to drive again, had to wait that long. But because of the TA many older drivers can't take it and forced to throw key.</p></div>
