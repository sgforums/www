              <div>A technical manager was jailed for two weeks on Thursday for pushing a taxi driver on the head in a road rage incident.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Christopher Gordon Sang, 43, a Briton, pleaded guilty to causing hurt to Mr Liu San <span>Chuang</span>, 65, outside the entrance of Dahlia Park condominium along Flora Drive in Upper <span>Changi</span> on July 19 last year.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Sang has paid $5,000 compensation and <span>apologised</span> to the victim who suffered neck pain and muscle strain as a result of the incident.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The court heard that Mr Liu picked up a passenger outside the condominium at about 8.10pm that day.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mr Liu later stopped his taxi and turned on his hazard lights. He waited along the two-way carriageway to allow vehicles to overtake him before intending to make a three-point turn to head out of Flora Drive.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Sang drove up and stopped a few car lengths behind the victim's taxi and flashed his headlights and horned. The victim drove forward to the left to let Sang overtake him but Sang stopped behind the cab, flashed his headlights and horned again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mr Liu wound down his window and used his right hand to signal Sang to overtake him.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Sang got down from his Audi sports car and walked towards <span>the taxi</span>. He opened the right rear passenger door and pushed the victim's head forward while mumbling some words, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Terence <span>Szetoh</span>.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Sang then returned to his car, overtook the taxi and drove off to his home at <span>Ferraria</span> Park condominium along the same road.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>His lawyer Eugene <span>Thuraisingam</span> said in mitigation that his client was very remorseful and regretted the <span>offence</span> which was "completely out of character".</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong>District Judge Eddy <span>Tham</span> said there is a strong public interest when it comes to road rage cases, even more so when it involved a criminal assault on a public transport worker as in the present case.</strong></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Sang could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined up to $5,000 for causing hurt.</div>

              <p>actually these FT, be it angmoh or ah nehs..usually like that one. Last night i picked a couple ..halfway jam like f, in the taxi whispering say must well take train, i keep quiet. Open mouth, close mouth all the unpleasant words..i almost want to drive them back to the original destination liao.</p>
              <p>the only consolation is that the remaining pax i pick are mostly locals, so their atttudes are better alot.</p>
              <p>is true that my temper is bad, sometimes cannot control but if kana f for nothing, ill become evil akuma for sure.</p>
              <p>actually as TD, must learn to be patience and soft spoken...but is usually vice versa.</p>

              <p>This case is not pax attack TD. It is road rage. But because involved a TD (whom the judge considered a public transport worker), kena jail. If ordinary driver, think at most kena fine nia. So, I think the judge is sending a message. </p>
              <p>Dun think TD is some low life slave that you can look down on and suka suka whack. Too many such cases liao. </p>
              <p>This is a precedent judgement.  Next time if another road rage case and TD kena whack, the bully can go to jail. </p>
              <p>Because TDs are out on the roads to do a public service and make a living, they are more vulnerable than anyone else and must be protected. </p>
              <p>We are so successful in maintaining racial harmony amongst Singaporeans, but failed miserably when it comes to integrating different nationalities.</p>

              Ah Lim ah lim, when good thing happened...govt said taxi drivers are self employ, boss, businessmen, entrepreneurs, towkays and director of themselves, 
              
              Companies said, taxi drivers are their hirers, customers, business partners and even one dro said, upfront ambassador of the company.
              
              Then now the judge said TD are public transport worker? very vague leh.
              
              You see, in laws of our so called meritocracy society, the keys is not about just wining a case, the keys is once a court had judged that you are the innocent party and the other one is wrong, they will impose a penalty on him base on precedent and the max sentencing allowed under our laws.
              
              With it, you can alway take it to a higher court to undermine the sentencing you felt that is not fair to you, you can engage civil lawyers and challenge the sentencing, not the judgement, because they already judge that he is wrong, just to increase the penalty.
              
              However, sad to say that we are still very much living in a one judge, all agreed culture, could be that we are breed that way, but as we go along this line, our afluent youngs will not be thinking like what we do, make police report, go court, wait for judgement day, the end. Our afluent young being expose to much liberal western culture, may, in near future make the high court work harder. 
              
              The west take a court as people court, and they get millions out of a lawsuit, we get only 5k, no wonder ang mo whack lah.
