              <p>Cab operator ComfortDelGro will roll out the country's most environmentally-friendly taxis on Wednesday. They will also be the costliest for cabbies to rent.<br><br>The 50 Mercedes-Benz E220 BlueTec taxis use around 4 per cent less fuel than the last model, and produce less carbon dioxide.<br><br>They will be the first cabs here to meet the strictest Euro 6 emission standard - which will only become compulsory for new diesel vehicles here in 2018.<br><br>The new cabs will also be the first to use a urea-based solution called AdBlue that is injected into the exhaust system to chemically transform up to 90 per cent of nitrogen oxide into harmless nitrogen and water vapour.<br><br>Fares will be similar to ComfortDelGro's other limousine cabs, with a flag-down charge of $3.90 and a metered rate of 30 cents for every 400m up to 10km.<br><br>ComfortDelGro is expected to add another 100 of these new cabs, bringing its total Mercedes fleet size to over 800.<br><br>The company owns around 16,800 of the 28,500 taxis plying the roads here, making it the largest operator.<br><br>But the greener drive may be a bumpier one for taxi drivers.<br><br>According to sources, the daily cost of rental for the new cab will start from $175, reputedly the highest in the business.<br><br>This works out to about $5,250 a month.<br><br>In comparison, the average daily rental for a new saloon taxi falls in the region of $130, or about $3,900 a month.<br><br>For the new Mercedes cabs, drivers will also have to pay for the AdBlue solution.<br><br>The chemical's 251/2-litre tank - located in the recesses of the trunk - will need to be topped up about once a week, going by a daily mileage of about 500km.<br><br>With one litre costing $1, this translates to an additional $25 a week for cabbies.<br><br>The AdBlue is required as part of the BlueTec technology, which while using a high combustion temperature to vaporise particulates, also creates a higher amount of nitrogen oxide.<br><br>When the AdBlue tank is empty, drivers will not be able to start their cars. One cabby, who signed up to drive the new Mercedes taxi to replace his current one that is being scrapped, says that by splitting the higher rental with a relief driver, he can still make about $90 a day.<br><br>"I have my regular customers, and I would like to continue offering my services to them by getting a new Mercedes cab," he said.<br><br>"We have to put down a deposit of about $2,000 and drive the cab for at least one year. I'll try it out and see if it's feasible."<br><br>Another ComfortDelGro cabby said he was offered the new cab, but decided to stick with his current Mercedes, which is due to be scrapped in five years.<br><br>"I pay about $160 in rental now. The new (rental) pricing is too high," he added.<br><br>National Taxi Association executive adviser Ang Hin Kee said: "As rentals get higher, cabbies will have to drive longer hours. In time, it may also translate to commuters having to bear the costs in higher fares."<br><br>He also noted that while Mercedes taxi drivers serve a premium clientele, they also face more competition from private car hire apps, such as GrabCar, which also offer limousine-type services.</p>

              <p>Its not so simple. Cab company cannot impose working hours on cabbies. But they can increase the rent in jumps of $15 everytime a new model launches. If they jack up the rent to $200 suddenly, people will make loud noise. By increasing the rent slowly, there comes a time when cabbies are forced to keep running around fetching people. The high rents also means people will be deterred from using the cab as their private car. The taxi company is not going let cabbies huat too much.</p>

              Adblue is still a diesel fuel aka Diesel Exhaust fluid, and it is not enviromental friendly, in fact, the exhaust is still chemical toxic to people, but lower than diesel. It is the SCR aka selective catalytic reduction (exhaust piple below) that filter out the particles. However, with adblue the utilisation rate of fuel will be less as such fuel are optimised to full usage.
              
              The problem with Singapore govt is that, whether you drive a hybrid or gas or reduced toxic emission vehicle, there is no reduction on road tax and cost of the vehicle, this directly put the cost into driver, who have to bear high cost due to cost of this type of engine, if govt is really to promote green enviroment, they should rebate road tax and car prices to people who buy it, and reduce rental for TD who choose to take enviroment friendly vehicle.
              
              Simply put it, cost of taxis + road tax + insurance = price of taxi rental 
              
              if cost is down, road tax is down, insurance is down...price of rental should be down.

              Drive taxi cannot talk about mindset strong or weak, because in driving taxi, condition and enviroment change very fast, today you can throw key, tomorrow you drive for another companies, few minutes ago, you get a nice polite chio bu, the next minute you end up quarrelling with a ah neh...
              
              so in taxi driving, your mind must be flexible, cannot be set, if you just follow a mindset, be it strong or weak, you can hardly pass your day in taxi driving or limo driving, so to speak
