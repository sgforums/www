              <p>This kind of private limo too hot headed. Too easy to get angry. Its good you fark him and fark loudly. Angry people just add more oil and make them burn up. Tickle them until they explode on youtube is best.</p>
              <p>I last time as a student was riding a bike - Yamaha SDR200, still no taxi license. Kena bully by car driver. They think their car very big try to squeeze me out of my lane. I young man no scared to die. Faster went up to driver side. Fuck him and ask him wind down window. Fuck him some more, green light PUI his face, went in front of his car and ride slowly, force him overtake. That time I one leg can break his body, he challenge me to fight is sure mati unless got gun. I everyday train kungfu type. Now married man cannot do this sort of nonsense anymore. Body not fit as before.</p>
