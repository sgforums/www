Just go to your bro insurance company and claim him , and let them investigate .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On 3rd March 2006, SHC2036Z (Toyota Crown) collided with SCR69**M (Honda Civic) at Bukit Batok East Ave 6 and street 23. I was walking along street 23, saw the taxi coming at around 50-60km/h along East Ave 6 towards Ave 1, and the Civic on the opposite direction, waiting to turn into street 23. Perhaps it was jutting too far out, and the taxi was on the right lane overtaking a car turning left into street 23, and when the taxi driver found that SCR69**M was too far out, he jammed the brakes, causing the front wheels to lock up, lots of smoke produced, but could not stop in time and they hit, luckily it was only lightly...<br>The drivers got out and negotiated for a while, after which they drove towards Ave 1, possibly to report on the case to the police.<br>A very typical accident, but luckily, no injuries and no vehicles in the close proximity of SHC2036Z, or else there will be an added rear collision.<br><br>Numbers censored for privacy, sorry for inconvenience...</div>
