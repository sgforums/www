              <p>ComfortDelGro has joined the likes of coffee joints and supermarkets in offering a rewards scheme for passengers. From Monday, commuters will get "rewards points" for every cashless payment they make on board a ComforDelGro taxi. They may use these to redeem gifts including taxi vouchers and free airport transfers.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The CabRewards Programme is the transport operator's first-ever rewards programme for cashless-paying commuters and aims to encourage more taxi commuters to use cashless payments, which are becoming more popular with both passengers and drivers for their convenience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Passengers first have to open an account on ComfortDelGro's Cab Rewards website http://cabrewards.cdgtaxi.com.sg. They may then register up to two ez-link cards, which will double as their 'loyalty cards'. All payments by credit cards, Nets, Nets FlashPay, EPin, or non-concession ez-link cards will qualify for rewards points.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Each reward point is equivalent to $1, and cab points are valid till end-January of the following year. Passengers who register from now till May 31 will get 500 free points.</span></p>
