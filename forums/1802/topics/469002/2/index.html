              I think paxs shud know cashless payments is not 100% fail safe, so be prepared to have cash option available cos ultimately you have the responsibility to pay after consuming a product/service. If after a dinner at a restruarant and the restruarant say cashless payment down/not av you still have draw cash or call a friend to pay. 
              
              In the above case, didnâ€™t see any video but from wats written, think itâ€™s a case of poor handling on the part of the TD. If you do not put a sign that your cashless payment machine is down, then be prepared have such situations arising cos more and more paxs go for this option in keeping with Sgp service industry. How to survive in the service industry when you get agitated and throw vulgarities on such a common incident. No use going to police cos not a case of cheating or run fare. 
               
              Using isolated cases to draw conclusion on taxi service standards carries little weight ..rather shallow. Need to grade based on statistics/surveys/comparisions etcâ€¦

              <p><br>Well, brother, I can said you are right from the perspective of a service provider, but from a consumer views, taxis are displayed with decals on the fares, surcharges..and at the same time, the acceptance of cards from JCD to Dinner to JDI to Visa to Nets to master to Amex..JDI?</p>
              <p>So, let put us, as the consumer, I do not even need to ask whether you accept this or not when I read what was pasted on the window screen,</p>
              <p>Same goes to restuarant, once I saw they accept cards. I do not even need to ask the waiter if they accept this or not, if they end up with IT hard or soft ware problem, that is not my problem, that is you, the service provider problem.</p>
              <p>Under the CASE section 4, para 2(ii) clause of consumer Rights, anything that a service provider displayed must be adhered, discrepancies from the original displayed services or products shall then be compensated by the service provider or the seller.</p>

              <p>I hope taxi drivers need to know these and more importantly, what they are providing or selling, if a TD do not even know what his taxis is capable of providing, then I think he needs to talk to his DRO or me.

              <p>Never pay police cannot do anything but record your particulars. You have to lodeg a report at LTA who will then contact the party from the police records.</p>
              <p>This is not a seizable offence. Those who charged in court were fare evaders. Here is not evading.</p>
              <p>I got 1 friend very kwai lan type. 1 day he take cab go Whampoa area. Reach he take out $50 to pay, he really got no change, The TD f him. My friend f him back, say my problem ar, I dont want to pay you is it? The taxi driver LL, say go change money and want to drive my friend there. My friend f him, you got no change right, why must I follow you. You go and change and come back here collect from me, why must I follow you?</p>
              <p>Td LL go change and come back. I dont agree with what my friend did was right as a taxi driver, but as a normal person, if kena f for nothing, sure hot what.</p>
              <p>Simple rule? Talk nicely, can settle in many ways. Once I drive 1 lady reach she wanna pay by card, my machine spoilt. I ask her got this bank account online or not, she said got. I said ok you transfer to my account, call my hp this no, so I have your number. I give you until tomorrow night settle if you're too tired now. Within 15 mins, she sms me, say transferred liao. I check also got.</p>
              <p>Use brains a bit, all can settle want, open your mouth.</p>

              <p>But this is not a matter i run fare, it is a matter of inconvienences, I agree that both can settle amicably, if restuarant line spoilt, fine with me, talk nicely, maybe give a bit of discount, I can go ATM and withdrawn to pay them, but if they fark up, then call police, that is the best, because both are not wrong, nor right, so let police come to be the judge and ensure honestly.</p>
              <p>However, it will protray a negative image on the restuarant, same goes to TD, police come, ask what is the problem, TD said, girl wants to pay by card, but my machine spoilt, police can check it out, or that police can ask the girl, you got any friend, please call them, or use your credit card to withdraw, girl said, ok, but please ask him the Driver not to shout and scold me, I am not running away from fare, I saw the outside displayed can accept this and that, that is why I took the cab.</p>
              <p>Police replied it ok, call your friend, we wait. Now who suffered more, of course the TD lah, waste time and now with police around, how to get noisy?</p>
              <p>But of course like what you said, if both can talk nicely, what is the problem, like taxi driver tell girl, sorry miss, my card machine down, girl said, oh, i no cash, can you wait, I ask my friend to come down and pay you, taxi driver replied, ok, but meter still on until your friend arrived. Girl said thank you...bo tai ji lor</p>

              <p>Ah Fat boy,</p>
              <p>I am speaking from a TD perspective hor, so you think i will take a lose stand if I am the TD??</p>
              <p>You call yr friend, seat inside my taxi and enjoy aircon, music and peace of mind, I paid for you?? in front got one luggage going to airport and I cannot take because of you??</p>
              <p>Restuarant on the other hand got other customer, whether I stay or leave, they still can get customer, and I hv to make a walk to an ATM, draw money and get back to you, did I enjoy my stay in your restuarant, take yr aircon, occupy your seat??? that result in you having to reject customer because no more seat?? And the key word here is Maybe...if that resturant is customer orientated, they may give me a 10% discount which is the usual case.</p>
              <p>But for a TD, you seat in my cab, I am losing time and pax, and all these incur cost to me, yet at the same time, my fuel is running on idle mode, you think if I tell pax, meter still on, will he or she agree?</p>
              <p>Yes, I would agree that machine not workable is of nobody fault, and also agree that there is no issue of not paying for both cases, both the consumer and service provider do play a part here, hand in hand to settle the matter amicably with an understand of each other position, I wait for yr friend, I am losing, be it meter running or not, because I would prefer a flag down fare. As for restuarant, you wait for me, you do not lose anything, restuarant is still open for business</p>

              <p>Sure.. I understand your pt. But I tot you were trying to show two sided. if only TD's, then, it would be biased.</p>
              <p>So i am the customer, I tell you I wait outside the taxi. U can off your taxi. U total your bill. I go and get your fare as per the customer in the restaurant, would you agree??  U would be having a smoke, having peace of mind.. and even listening to music if U want, right?</p>
              <p>Surely not.. what if I run? so if the restaurant asks you for some things as warranty, I bet your first answer would be "ur machine spoilt le.. I doing you favor", right?  <span style="line-height: 1.231;">See..</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Yes, if restaurant waits for you to get your money, restaurant is still open. but the key is there is a total already.  So I go and get my fare for you. U can total the fare.. technically, you are open for business, right?  </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I don't understand the need to let the meter running.. given in this case, the machine is spoilt is no one fault, so why should TD be the one to profit?  And I am very sure, most TDs will wait inside the taxi, with the air con, music and peace of mind with the consumer.. right?</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Just for discussion sake, no offense. </span></p>
