              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://static.stomp.com.sg/site/servlet/linkableblob/stomp/1771608/thumbnail/cabby_turns_aggressive_after_korean-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p>A cabby turned aggressive after a Korean passenger asked if she could pay the fare with her credit card and threatened to bring her to the Police station, prompting her to call her friend, STOMPer C, to come to her aid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The cabby, however, also yelled at C and accused him of using vulgarities, while he himself was hurling obscenities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said the STOMPer:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I am terribly disappointed with this cab driver's attitude. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"My Korean friend took his cab and only had her credit card to make payment with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"However, he said his machine was spoilt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"My Korean friend asked how, at which point this cab driver surprisingly threatened to send her to the police station and confiscated her credit card.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Frightened and scared, she called me and a few of her local friends to 'rescue' her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"She was totally terrified when I arrived, and was crying badly and shivering.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"So I took a picture of his car plate and approached him. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Noticing the cab driver shouting while I took his cab plate, I quickly took a video as evidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"As you can see, I haven't started talking and he kept pointing at me and accused me of saying a vulgar word.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It happened at outside the 7eleven outlet near the Marina Square taxi stand at 6:44pm on April 24.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Even the two Malay security guards came down. Honestly, I wanted to follow the cab driver to the Police station but my friend was devastated by the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"After the end of the video, the cab driver charged towards me, right in front of my face, and said 'I am a high class gentleman, if you think I think bully your friend, slap my face!"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Totally shocking. Anyway, I believe Marina Square has security cameras - another solid evidence. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I couldn't take a video of him provoking me as he had became very aggressive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I took a few days thinking whether to bring this thing up, however, the more I look at the video the more I feel disappointed by the whole incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I strongly believe that all our current cab service standards need to be upgraded and I am not targeting only one company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I read many news reports before that people beat up our cab drivers, but I believe its not always 100% the passengers fault.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I firmly believe somehow the cab driver also provoked the passenger. Why do such cases seldom happen in Japan, where a taxi driver gets beaten up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I am a car driver myself and I very seldom take cabs, but this incident has confirmed my thoughts that our taxis need proper higher service standards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They are the first service line tourists meet when they arrive at Changi Airport."</p>

              <p>As in any case, we need to get the full picture, stomp are alway good at onesided story and that is why they called themselve stomper.</p>
              <p>I believe that as TD tirelessly plying the road for a living, we are unlikely to restort to such an act given if we are not agitated by others. But as Uncles, we are prone to forgive and forget, and most do not even know about the net, therefore, we and most of us can become a prawn for these stomper to vent their disappointment and anger.</p>
              <p>As such, the society had changed into a I stomp you then you know kind of revenageful action rather than talk it over and settle the issue amicably, which is a skill that most lack and chose to use net to complain about others.</p>

              <p>He did not threaten to beat her up or something wat. Only wanted to bring her to the Police Station.  That one called threat meh? Our Police such bad name meh?</p>
              <p>So you see the kind of words this farker used.. like "threatened to send her to the police station" etc.</p>
              <p>But, yes.. saying that he would confiscate her card could constitute some kind of a threat, but it is not a serious one.</p>
              <p>Taking pictures can be provocative depending on the situation.  Next time, if some road rage cuts into your lane, you stop at traffic light, come out, take picture of him and his car..see what will happen lor...</p>
              <p>I screwed the coward doesn't mean I condone the TD's behaviour.  I don't.  I was trying to point out that it takes two hands to clap.</p>
              <p>There is no need to be aggressive and I agree with you that such  behaviour damages the profession's image.</p>
