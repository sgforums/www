              Hello, if you think you want to declare all your income, go ahead, IRA will happily hug you, sometime I think you must be working for IRA.
              
              For me, just one income, my regular income, the rest are my hard work and sweat it out income that went beyong the normal rules of working life, I drive casket when people are sleeping, I downloand cars when taxi driver are changing shift, I go shipyard on voyage repair at international water, everyone of you are enjoying apple and orange the ship bring to our shore...and all these are my resting hours,...what the fark they want to tax??
              
              The rich are infact the biggest tax underdeclare peoples, but our govt loves the rich mah, some dun even dare to touch them due to insufficient evidences, later kenna sue back, job gone, somemore hv to go to jail and pay heavy fine. 
              
              Our Govt IRA is like TP on the road, most of the time, they like to catch the commerical vehicle, trailer, lorry, van, motorcyclist and taxi...why??? because they know these are the poor ones, cannot get lawyer one, cannot run away one, can scare them one. IRA do the same, keep hammering and checking on the poor income group like us, why, because ho jiak mah.
              
              To me is KNNCCB, if you want to tax, lai lai, i wait for you

              Army took the most budget out of the country income, about 1/3 of our GDP will go into total defence, knn, you know how expensive is one fighter or not?? and you know why USA are so interested in war, to market their weapons mah, after that, jap, korea, singapore and so on will buy. Army indentation is the most expensive in the world, army is like small country within a country and it eat what the big country provide, it is not a profitable organisation but rather a social responsibility issue.
              
              USA is the world biggest economy is not because of their GM car, computer, iphone, or software and macdonald, german and jap car can alway beat them, so are korean electronic like samsung and LG, the biggest trade beside Boeing is Weapons, from fighter to submarine to warships..
