            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Channel NewsAsia - Monday, July 9</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Getting a cab? Easy, say 3 in 4 tourists</span></strong><br><br>Despite the brickbats from locals and the occasional foreign letter-writer for their alleged disappearing acts during peak hours, Singapore's taxi drivers didn't fare too badly in a Today poll of 100 tourists.<br><br>About 74 per cent of them gave the thumbs-up for the taxi system here where waiting time is concerned, saying they found it "easy" or "very easy" to get a taxi here.<br><br>The street poll was conducted last month in various locations including Orchard, City Hall, Harbourfront, Chinatown and Clarke Quay during peak and off-peak hours.<br><br>In recent weeks, tourists have joined locals in griping about the taxi system here, with most pointing to the city's peculiar cab-booking system and endless queues at taxi stands.<br><br>However, our poll showed that over half the tourists surveyed &amp; or 54 per cent did not have to wait longer than five minutes for a taxi. Ten tourists endured waits of more than half an hour before they finally got a taxi, while 36 tourists reported average waiting times of about 10 minutes or more.<br><br>"I think it's very easy getting a taxi here compared to in New Zealand," said Madam Rose Lavery, who was in Singapore for five days. "In fact, I've always managed to get a cab immediately, or probably in less than five minutes!"<br><br>Still, one in five respondents found waiting times which varied from 10 minutes to 45 minutes unacceptable.<br><br>Said Mr Shi Hong Bing, who is from China: "Back home, you can get a taxi immediately."<br><br>Others like Ireland's Mr Shawn MacDonald said the expectations of a world-class shopping belt like Orchard Road should come complete with top-notch taxi services. "A couple of times, I've waited for a cab for more than 20 minutes. That is just not acceptable."<br><br>Some also compared the wait for cabs here with other shopping destinations.<br><br>American visitor Megan Jackson said: "In Hong Kong, the taxis queue for customers, in Singapore, it is the other way round."<br><br>Many tourists even those who rated Singapore positively noticed that it was tough getting taxis during peak hours.<br><br>Mr Peter McNaughton from Australia said: "I see a lot of empty taxis during peak hours but they're mostly booked! I see people calling for cabs along taxi stands &amp; what is the use of the stands, then?"<br><br>Also, despite the phone numbers for taxi companies painted on the taxis, seven in 10 tourists had no idea what to do if they were unable to find a taxi.<br><br>Most polled agree that cab information could be more conspicuous.<br><br>"If you are a tourist, it's not easy to know where you can get a taxi from, because the stands are hidden (in some places), and it's not clear where you are allowed to flag from the street," said Mr John Dickinson from the United Kingdom.<br><br>In October and November last year, the Land Transport Authority conducted a survey of waiting times at 30 major taxi stands in Singapore.<br><br>The results released in February this year revealed that on average, most commuters take from two to 14 minutes to get a taxi in the city area, even during the evening peak hours. But some taxi stands in the Orchard area such as at Ngee Ann City and Paragon were problem areas, with waiting times stretching to 45 minutes.<br><br>The situation improved in November, and collaborations with the Ngee Ann City management to improve traffic conditions in the area have yielded results, it said.<br><br>Service is also an important part of the tourist's experience.<br><br>"The drivers here seem more honest. In Thailand (for example), you don't feel so safe. But the Singaporean cabbies drive too fast, like maniacs. They could work on that," said Mr Scott Williams, an American here on a two-week holiday.<br><br>What 100 tourists surveyed thought of Singapore's taxi situation<br><br>Very easy: 13%<br><br>Easy: 61%<br><br>Difficult: 26%<br><br>Less than 5 minutes: 54%.<br><br>More than 10 minutes: 36%<br><br>More than 30 minutes: 10%<br><br>Yes: 78%<br><br>No: 22%<br><br>Yes: 27%<br><br>No: 73%</div>
