              <p>Hey all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently waiting for LTA to approve my TDVL. I've a friend who's in SMRT, says that his cab company is fairly good. But I'm kinda drawn to Comfort for its i40 taxis and that the location of the hq is fairly central. I believe that finding relief drivers wont be too tough too aint it?</p>
              <p>Factors I would consider joining SMRT would be that their Prius is a hybrid, and i intend to do cover heartlands ferrying(maybe CBD area at peak hours) where I can save on fuel.</p>
              <p>Really really in need of advise from the seniors out there, should I go with SMRT? I read up the post where Poolman responded, but that post was like many years back. Has there been much changes since then though?</p>

              <p>Hello!...I only drives part-time on weekends and if I drove 12 hours shift @ 420km (Premier/Silver Cab-Optima)...the cost of the diesel is approximately less than $30-$35/-. The price of Petrol is always higher compared to diesel. To capatalized on discounts for petrol, use POSB Everydat card at SPC gave the highest discount rates...if you need better milage for any vehicle...make sure the tires are highly inflated so that you have more rolling motion and less drag (needs to have safe defensive driving habits...good tired thread)...Prius is good but it has low undercarridge, not very big booth space but less hectic when driving due to low noise and handling.All The BEst!</p>

              Cheap petrol does not imply long lasting, you can try 98, smooth and last longer.
              No you know why many still never want to pump at SPC, inflating tire will cause longer distance to brake, if not careful, will roll into the car infront, and tire will have less contact on the road leading to slippery and less traction.

              Every taxis you take, no matter how you calculate it, it is a zero sum game, meaning all the same same...you dun think cab companies are stupid hor...they also consult each other, meet each other once a month to talk about rental and new cab prices,..altho they are competitors, they are also friends and colleagues. So, in a oligarchy position, they will control the rental to almost same same...and they are more united now, why? to compete with apps mah.
              
              SMRT going into grab is a double sword game hor.
              
              So, at the end of the day, it is not much abt which companies you want to rent out a cab, it is more about, GOT PAX OR NOT.

He claims it is easy for him to earn that within 3-5 hours in the morning, and shares the rental with a friend, who takes the night shift. Weekly, they had fun playing with guitars, their hobby. With so many drivers in Comfort, it should be easier for you to find someone who shares your hobby, and this makes a better work-life balance, to reduce stress from your work life. My friend used to quit smoking, but started back due to stress. It would be even worse for him if there is noone with the same interest to share the cab with. Therefore, I suggest Comfort.</p></div>

              <p> Prius good for airport because can reject all the cheapo Indian or local paxs that has 4 people and lots of luggage. Mostly give you quality town angmo paxs with 1 luggage. Those cheapo paxs with lots of luggage just wave them on to next cab.</p>

              kinda drawn to Comfort for its i40 taxis and that the location of
              the hq is fairly central. I believe that finding relief drivers
              wont be too tough too aint it?</p>
              <p>Factors I would consider joining SMRT would be that their Prius
              is a hybrid, and i intend to do cover heartlands ferrying(maybe CBD
              area at peak hours) where I can save on fuel.</p>
              <p>Really really in need of advise from the seniors out there,
              should I go with SMRT? I read up the post where Poolman responded,
              but that post was like many years back. Has there been much changes
              since then though?</p>
