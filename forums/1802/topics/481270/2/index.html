              <p>that time, i really tried all different days. no matter how chiong im, i always tell myself to keep car @ most 1am or 1.30am cause next day have to start work @ 8am. At that time, 1st week manageable....slowly 2nd week, 3rd week....starting to CMI.</p>
              <p>i chiong for 2 months, before CNY...until that time, coy want me to run 12 hours shift...so bo bian, want to switch to super relief, but my hirer say cannot. So i told him no choice lo. Anyway, i found a new hirer, way better than my previous one.</p>

              Point are point, it is your expectation, and your expectation might end up unable to meet, and that turn to frustration and anger leading to unpleasant partnership.
              
              We therefore must set tolerance of flexibility in our life, not only in Taxi driving, and that must be communicated, be it your family, work or driving, people, your wife, your childrens, your colleague, your partner must at least know your limitation, so do you, you need to understand their limitation, however, all these take times, and times will decide the partnership.
              
              So if one day, your relief accidentally counted $10 less in the rental? how? cut the partnership, start to distrust your relief which eventually lead to no flexibility in life expectation

              Weekend most hirer might throw rental, or some just drive a few hrs to break even, lost a bit nevermind. Otherwise, no only cannot get relief, if got, give those half fark type relief, more worst, so, most of them just relax and enjoy the weekend.

              <p><br>hmm actually depends on timing la. $5 bucks around 9-10pm, but have to camp for 1 hour, mai la. actually have to see the Q also, is also heng suay. usually camp at least 1/2 hour, but go Pasir Ris. really can drop tear...especially around 11pm...odd hour some more.</p>
              <p>so that 1 hour, you earn at most less than $20. or abit more...worst case scenario. haha.</p>
