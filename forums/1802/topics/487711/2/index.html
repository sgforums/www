              <p>Straightaway I apologised and said that I should have asked.  Anyway, the ECP route also longer. Pax then also said sorry, it's her fault she never tell me.  Then everything okay liao.  End of trip got tip some more.</p>
              <p>She said I very nice taxi driver..Other taxi drivers will kan her and blame her for not saying earlier.</p>
              <p>So sometimes, I must thank all the egoistic kuai lan taxi bros because my job becomes easier as pax expectation of taxi driver service is very low.</p>

              Gentlemen,
              
              As a cabbies, as i said many times, there are lot of hazards in your job, from no show to safety to summons to accidents to lousy pax..you name it, you got it. When we had decided to be a cabbie, these are things you will met in and out of your trade, touch wood on accident. However, it happened only once a while, if too often, no one would drive a taxis in Singapore.
              
              Next, in any job or business, nothing is gain or done until the job is done, so as a cabbie, bearing in mind that a call does not represent a good income until the journey is completed or that a customer who board you cab by the street is not a business until the journey end, transaction take place and then you can rightly said, business is done, profit gained. 
              
              That is how the system works, for a pax can just end up quarrelling with you and walk off without paying. Such are the hazards that we must get enlightened, and when you understand this farking system, you might get angry over a call cancelled, but then realized, that is how it works, at least, it cancel the call, worst are some dun even bother to cancel and off their phone. 
              
              But no matter what happened, we, as matured men and women, must remain calm and steady in any situation, this can help to enhance our thinking and making decision, it will also help to maintain our health and happily carry on with our work.
              
              Lastly, there are alway claim of wrongly orderd foods by customer in any restaurant kitchen, but that does not prevent the cooks and the waiters from getting angry and frustration and thus serve customer badly, life just hv to move on.

              <p>Pressed no show and move on. Although fed up, I told myself this is part &amp; parcel of doing business, what to do?

              Gentlemen, 
              
              One of the main reason of accident (touch wood) is ON CALL, be it MDT or apps Call. Some cabbies swtiched off their safety mode on the road so as to reach the on call location, bearing in mind that today, with so many apps + companies' call, pax calling few apps is common, and taxi drivers, being exploited by the pax thru the call systems, are moving in faster to the call location.
              
              Another situation is summons, because of Calls, many cabbies do illegal U turn here and there, some beat redlights, some, can even do stunt by doing 3 points turn at traffic light junction with no division.
              
              Driving on the road is already stressful enough, some road hv so many traffic lights that you might see the other traffic lights green instead of the one nearer to you which is red, and with a call in hands, you might lose concentration in a split of a second. 
              
              Therefore, I urge all to remain calm, take a call that you know the place well, or that just a lane down the road, dun over commit yourself simply you want to be there earlier. Nobody take pity on us when we get into trouble..just for that few dollars extra.

              wherever pax wants to go lor..</p>
              <p>Toa Payoh Lor 7 got two ways to go..PIE/Kim Keat Link or
              Braddell/Lor 6. You can also ask what...</p>
              <p>Last Sat, I got one pax go Siglap Rd from Yio Chu Kang. 
              Naturally, I go CTE-PIE-Jln Eunos-Kembangan-Siglap Rd.  After
              I passed the KPE exit along PIE, pax ask why I never go by
              KPE-ECP-Siglap Rd.</p>
              <p>Straightaway I apologised and said that I should have
              asked.  Anyway, the ECP route also longer. Pax then also said
              sorry, it's her fault she never tell me.  Then everything okay
              liao.  End of trip got tip some more.</p>
              <p>She said I very nice taxi driver..Other taxi drivers will kan
              her and blame her for not saying earlier.</p>
              <p>So sometimes, I must thank all the egoistic kuai lan taxi bros
              because my job becomes easier as pax expectation of taxi driver
              service is very low.</p>

              <p>I always begin the trip with a smile/greeting/ask prefered route. Therefore if the pax want to act yaya or guai lan with me then too bad sure tio kan. But most pax is ok one. Only kanna nasty pax once a while lah not everyday affair.</p>
              <p>So I dun see the point apologising to the pax if in the first place he tell me which way to go and I followed his/her instructions. Why I kan him because he is not sure of the way he want to go and still want to act yaya and guai lan with me. So in this case I dun see the problem with kanning him and chase the whole family down. </p>
              <p>Now is CNY so in the first place why he want to yell at me? This kind of pax I dun give chance one. He thinks his fare damn big and can abuse taxi driver as though we owe him a living. Sorry he had bark at the wrong TD.</p>
              <p>Maybe you are driving a CDG so have this CDG mentality I dun blame you. Because to me CDG TD are mostly doggies. No offense but I myself also drove for CDG before and I feel that way. We pay rental to the taxi companies so by right we are the master but in CDG it is the other way round. Whenever got any complains master is angry and the doggies will surely kanna. When tio pok by masters , like my ex neighbour, most doggies will still appeal to the master and beg them not to terminate them. </p>

              <p>Aiyah bro, the next pax who takes your cab dun know your caller fly aeroplane wat...not his or her fault, so why pull long face on him or her?</p>
              <p>Many taxi drivers seem so unhappy, kpkb, anyhow kan pax, a little bit also become hot...in the end...still peng steering wat..</p>
              <p>As TDs, there are job hazards.  Either you accept that fact and continue to drive happily or throw key.  Why torture yourself?</p>
