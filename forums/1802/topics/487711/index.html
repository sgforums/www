              <p>But sad thing is, TDs can only make so little because of the time required to do a job - one trip at a time. We are not like bak kwa sellers, can sell so many at one time and huat big.</p>

              Huat also must work and drive harder mah, unlike others, can just relax at home during the holiday, money still flow in.
              
              Like Tonite, can huat until ki siao, but more importantly, if you are celebrating CNY, hv a dinner and time with your family then go out and drive. 
              
              Wishing all a happy CNY. If you cannot drive tonite, also good, less taxi on the road, limpek become king

              Aiya, chinese new year, dun curse others lah, like it or not, all these are our foods, and as you hv rightly shown, you all can ask them to drop off.
              
              We must see thing from different angles to appreciate a situation, there are positive and negative ways of viewing, but most of the time, we failed to look at the positive side and concentrated more on the negative side.
              
              Like bro hammer said, the whole family coming into his taxis as he put on Busy, postively, there are many poor or average singaporeans who only take taxis on a new year whereby they might spent abit more, and also they might be having a difficult time in getting a taxi, not even call can get, lastly, they might be late for a visiting or shows.
              
              Let think in such situation and put ourselve in their shoe, then we said, sorry, sir/miss, I am busy unable to ferry you, sorry. But if you want to add more, then you might said, I am going to XXXX, if on the way, then can, if not, sorry.
              
              And like our bro getcarter (Jimmy Carter?), most people like to be together, we might think that they are cheapo, but the reason could be they all want to travel together as a family, but of course, that is not possible, just tell them nicely, that insurance is at stake and it is a traffic offence, please call another taxis, otherwise I am unable to ferry you guys.
              
              As for quarreling and fighting, see many liao..go once, while travelling, gf and bf quarrel and fighting, bf open door at expressway, limpek immediately stop and ask them to go down, so dangerous.

              At this time, we all can sing song and laughed at smelly pax, after CNY, smelly pax may laugh at us as when he or she wave, 2 to 3 cabs chiong toward him.
                  
              As I said, some poorer family with childrens only got a time to have the luxury to take a singapore taxis, parent would had saved for this moment and grandparents need a visit to relatives...we should serve them better than serving those at CQ or BQ, because they are like us, earning a hard living in Singapore. You can notice it by the kids looking inside your taxis, the mdt, the view, and so on. And it is alway my greatest pleasure to serve them so as to bring happiness in them.

              Maybe someone wants you to enjoy a Happy Chinese New Year, my mother use to tell me...bowah...unless you are very poor, then no choice, hv to drive on 1st adn 2nd day of chinese new years, if not better dun drive lah, ah bu paid the rental for you, because once you drive, you forever hv to slog in your life. 
              
              I told her, ah bu, it is not about money or slogging, it is abt people on the road bo taxis, i am just helping them.

              <p>Maybe your ah bu is right after all. Why don't post earlier before CNY so more of us don't drive on day 1 &amp; 2? Now too late, luckily I did not drive on day 1 and drove a bit on day 2 to cover day 1 loss.</p>
              <p>Anyway, appreciate your thoughts on looking from the other side. Thanks. You are spot on, of coruse. I never refused any pax (unless already on call or urgent matter on busy) because I always assume they need the service. Even if go Woodlands or Sungei Kadut late late at night, also zhai.</p>

              You happy go lucky type, happy new year to you!!
              
              To be frank, CNY is a time we truly pick up local Singaporeans family more than those chao ang moh and kwan lan ah neh neh. As a TDs from the 90s, I can feel the difference of pax, previously, paxs are mostly locals, things are cheaper, today, nearly 1/2 are foreigners, so called Foreign trashes, locals hv slowly subsided, maybe due to high cost of living, left only those ah lian and ah bengs from night spots.
              
              Singaporeans are thrifty or cheapo at times is not they want to be like this, it is because living is getting expensive here, I believe we and our family at times also practice thrifty in order to save for rainy days
