              <p>Maybe I'm "unlucky", I have gone through every possible "route" of a taxi drivers cycle.....</p>
              <p>And I'm talking about at least for the last 10 years, not 60s or 70s or even 80s.....</p>
              <p>Very difficult to explain what I had gone through and I believe currently at least 70% of TD are like me last time.....</p>
              <p>And I only hit my lady luck 2,3 years back, and after that than I realised why some TD can be so "ya ya papaya" in taxi driving.....</p>
              <p>But my thinking is very different from many people, given me a chance to get out of TD life, I will sure get out, I will never be a sucker for the taxi coy.....</p>
              <p>I did say before, when I law lan, lan lan got to peng steering, lan lan got to see taxi coy face, arbo how? knn everyday pay rental, pay diesel, bill come, don't know which holes to cover.....</p>
              <p>And I'm a very hardworking TD hor.....</p>
              <p>But given a chance, still be a sucker?....</p>
              <p>My friend ask me, why don't drive taxi relax relax? and do other thing at the same time like some others.....</p>
              <p>My thinking, Lj than I will pay rental for nothing to feed taxi coy.....<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
