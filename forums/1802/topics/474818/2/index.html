              <p>Unlike Taiwan, japan, korean..instead of dependency on MNC, they created their own MNC to exploit others, like samsung, sony, acer...till now, what the fark we have?? NTUC fairprice ar??</p>

              <p>Unlike Taiwan, japan, korean..instead of dependency on MNC, they
              created their own MNC to exploit others, like samsung, sony,
              acer...till now, what the fark we have?? NTUC fairprice ar??</p>

              <p>Brother brother, you must understand what govt said when they mention essential protection, what are our basic essential?</p>
              <p>It is the basic neccessities for a nation to operate in time of  peace and also unforseen circumstances like wars, strikes, protest or Foreigner attack locals..lols</p>
              <p>Food, electricity, oil, transport, gas, water, rice and many other daily needs are essential to any nation survivor, as such, govt must hv a hand on it, they are entrusted by the people who voted for them to take care of at least our basic needs, they can involve directly or indirectly, but they must hold responsibility.</p>
              <p>To cut it short instead of having to bear my lor sor...What is tiong woon? crane for fark? NTUC fairprice, cdg is not just there to do business hor, in time of trouble, like the recent exercise of cdg on community awareness which they closed their main office, for fark? all because of the need to be wary of when thing goes wrong, govt take over.</p>
              <p>So if hyflux that deal with water decided to stop all operation in singapore, pack and leave this country in time of war? singapore water resources become a problem, if Power supply decided being private.. pack up and off all generators in senoko and jurong, leave this country..how?  limpeh fark half way all black out...lols..joke aside..The key word here is again, CONTROL</p>
