              Well, some relationship can last for years and some just 3 days, that's life.
              
              Whatever happen, do not be too emotional afterall, it is just driving for a living. 
              
              At any one time, anyone involved in an accident, be it  minor dents or big ones (touch wood), the mood will be bad, some are able to control their emotion due to experiences or genetically born with it, but most, will eventually, produce a negative mood, and if hirer keep pressuring down on him, it is going to make matter worst, so at times, we also must understand others and know when is the right time to speak out, how to express it out and finally, how to make him really understand. Humans inter relationship are alway bound by miscommunication and moods including ego and pride. 
              
              We need to give them some space especially when there our hirer or relief had a bad day driving.
              
              Some hirers I met told me so many negative stories abt their relief, and in reverse, reliefs also do the same, that's life, because people tends to talk about their colleagues, everyone of us can be friends and even brothers, but when it come to working together, it can become enemy, even son and father also cannot get along in business, dun talk about relief and hirer partnership. 
              
              However, most importantly, from a hirer perspectives, you weight the differences, you proclaimed that yr relief have no responsible, black face and so on. Tell me, in your mind, do you really want him to continue as your relief, or you want to end the relationship and start all over again to find another relief that may or MAY NOT be better than him. 
              
              To hirer,  relief is consider a relief for them to take a nice rest, that is why it is call relief, not nos 2 driver or 2nd driver, so, therefore depend on how much you want to give and take, you need a relief, but of course you need to set regulation and rules, and allow certain reasoning if these rules were broken, there must be a threshold that one can take, if relief exceed that threshold, then, it is better to end the relationship.
              
              At the end of the day, as said above, relief is to help  the hirer in a way for him to rest and yet help to recuperate the rentals, if the relief is cause headache, heart pain and sour mood, then that is not a relief

              <p>well, as what my hirer says when i used to get the dents from my
              previous accident. Company will hold him liability if he returns
              the car, and he's not sure whether when will he returns the key. It
              can be any time. that's how he told me this in the face, of course
              no hard feelings but that's life.</p>
              <p>When the taxi company loans you the car in one good shape or at
              least maintains what it's, it's best when you throw the keys back,
              the car still retains the shape what it was before.</p>
              <p>so most of time, when out driving, please be vigilant. but as

              driver, so, therefore depend on how much you want to give and take,
              you need a relief, but of course you need to set regulation and
              rules, and allow certain reasoning if these rules were broken,
              there must be a threshold that one can take, if relief exceed that
              threshold, then, it is better to end the relationship.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, as said above, relief is to help the
              hirer in a way for him to rest and yet help to recuperate the
              rentals, if the relief is cause headache, heart pain and sour mood,
              then that is not a relief</p>

              <p>When you return taxi, (I'm talking about CDG nia hor).....</p>
              <p>Scratches is subjective, most time, they can close 2 eyes, especially those kanna stone hit scratches.....</p>
              <p>Of course if you scare, than go do up your vehicles first outside before hand over lor, those "specialist" workshop usually charge 100-200 to touch up all the 5cent 10 cent.....</p>
              <p>As for damages, remember, when workshop take over taxi, they calculate part by part 1 hor.....</p>
              <p>For example, you got 1 big hole at the bumper, workshop will charge the whole bumper hor, they don't do patching 1, they change the whole bumper 1.....</p>
              <p>As for dent, consider minor, unless is very big surface, or else for every dent, they will charge certain amount lor.....</p>
              <p>But if your taxi with advertisement, than they won't go tear out and check lor, but the advertisement sticker must be in good condition hor, not cheap if they decided to penalise you for damage advertisement.....</p>
              <p>Overall, not that scary la, when returning taxi, we should know ourself what's wrong with our taxi mah, than try to hide lor.....</p>
              <p>And only exterior nia, interior no penalized.....</p>

              <p>So TS can make sure his relief will pay for the damage if 1 day he decided to return taxi, not insist he go repair lor.....</p>
              <p>Like what I say, most time, we TD only waiting nia, waiting for what? Touch wood lor, 1 big accident bang from behind or side or sway sway we go bang infront, than while claiming, coy will change everything new part for you lor......</p>

              Aiyo, why go teach people go wait for banging...these are old bird thinking, dun teach the newer one lah, that is why you never get promoted to taxi lecturer like by former chief. diam diam teach people this type of idea...mai lah. 
              
              Every hirers must know that they are responsible for the whole taxi, being responsible also include risk if they decided to engage a relief. Currently, there are no laws non rules by companies or LTA that relief are also responsible for the cab, just like the recent lemon laws protecting 2nd car buyers. This is sad.
              
              Without any protection, the hirer is solely responsible no matter what happen, for companies, it is easier to pin point one guy than many. but relief are also registered under them, so there should be a rules to said that, 
              
              ALL drivers regardless of hirer or relief, once log in to the MDT,  shall be make responsible for any damage to the cab, he shall record, report and paid for the damage if it was deemed to be his fault, and that he shall also compensate his partner with a reasonable sum of money.
              
              And please do take note that external and internal damages is chargeable, got some cab with crack panels are also charged

              Be simple, dun play emotion or body language, just spell out the regulation, negiotiate, both come into term, just do it. Anything wrong, open your mouth and revisit what was agreed, if gum, carry on, if not, let separate, that $50 still in yr pocket.

              <p>I just curious on 1 point, if taxi in workshop why must he pay rental or half rental? The rental deduction the company should deduct from the hirer account. And since he not driving, why or how is he gonna pay rental, never driver because no cab to drive must pay rental? Cannot be right?</p>
