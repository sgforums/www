              <p>Oh ok, my bad. Like that of course must pay la. Morning can go and cover rental first before handing to workshop. 6-9am cannot cover rental meh?</p>
              <p>This kind of ppl why you bother for so long. Give him an ang pow la (red card not packet).</p>
              <p>Some of these old timers think they know everything abt taxi driving. Some think just becuase before the pattern like that means now must also be the same.</p>
              <p>Pity you never drive for my ex-hirer. That guys is really such a gentleman. Knn no need to say one, he auto will do. Drive half-way break down, he auto will deduct rental, and not say $5, like $15. Like 1 time I start very late 0001hrs, on Saturday, after watch football mah. Knn start the engne battery die. By the time call towing etc, only start at 1am, thought really jialat. Faster go find rental.</p>
              <p>Next day, he come and say, why you give full rental, here i return $15. He go holiday auto can deduct for you $25 for full day or $15 for half day. CNY got ang pow for you ( i used to only drive for him Sat/Sun).</p>
              <p>Another hirer I drive also gentleman, langgar a bit got scratches, I offer to send for repair. We go see workshop quote nearly $200. He say nvm, he will buy putty and sandpaper and paint. He say small thing no need pay so much. Next time he would put advertisement.</p>

              Of course there are good hirer, but good hirer also anticipate good relief, and when a good hirer get a good relief, it is of course the best of all.
              
              A good relief like me, pump fuel until full, wash at kiosk every day including interior, report all incident to hirer, if get knock, ownself go find my buddy to repair, also inform hirer, ask hirer if he want advance job and give hamper to hirer during CNY for giving me an opportunity to earn a living.

              <p>Well, some relationship can last for years and some just 3 days,
              that’s life.</p>
              <p>Whatever happen, do not be too emotional afterall, it is just
              driving for a living.</p>
              <p>At any one time, anyone involved in an accident, be it minor
              dents or big ones (touch wood), the mood will be bad, some are able
              to control their emotion due to experiences or genetically born
              with it, but most, will eventually, produce a negative mood, and if
              hirer keep pressuring down on him, it is going to make matter
              worst, so at times, we also must understand others and know when is
              the right time to speak out, how to express it out and finally, how
              to make him really understand. Humans inter relationship are alway
              bound by miscommunication and moods including ego and pride.</p>
              <p>We need to give them some space especially when there our hirer
              or relief had a bad day driving.</p>
              <p>Some hirers I met told me so many negative stories abt their
              relief, and in reverse, reliefs also do the same, that’s life,
              because people tends to talk about their colleagues, everyone of us
              can be friends and even brothers, but when it come to working
              together, it can become enemy, even son and father also cannot get
              along in business, dun talk about relief and hirer partnership.</p>
              <p>However, most importantly, from a hirer perspectives, you weight
              the differences, you proclaimed that yr relief have no responsible,
              black face and so on. Tell me, in your mind, do you really want him
              to continue as your relief, or you want to end the relationship and
              start all over again to find another relief that may or
              <span>MAY NOT</span> be better than him.</p>
              <p>To hirer, relief is consider a relief for them to take a nice
              rest, that is why it is call relief, not nos 2 driver or 2nd
              driver, so, therefore depend on how much you want to give and take,
              you need a relief, but of course you need to set regulation and
              rules, and allow certain reasoning if these rules were broken,
              there must be a threshold that one can take, if relief exceed that
              threshold, then, it is better to end the relationship.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, as said above, relief is to help the
              hirer in a way for him to rest and yet help to recuperate the
              rentals, if the relief is cause headache, heart pain and sour mood,
              then that is not a relief</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Don't quite agree that relief is to help hirer.</p>
              <p>i see it as a joint partnership, each renting the vehicle to make a living.</p>

              people this type of idea…mai lah.</p>
              <p>Every hirers must know that they are responsible for the whole
              taxi, being responsible also include risk if they decided to engage
              a relief. Currently, there are no laws non rules by companies or
              <span>LTA</span> that relief are also responsible for the
              cab, just like the recent lemon laws protecting 2nd car buyers.
              This is sad.</p>
              <p>Without any protection, the hirer is solely responsible no
              matter what happen, for companies, it is easier to pin point one
              guy than many. but relief are also registered under them, so there
              should be a rules to said that,</p>
              <p><span>ALL</span> drivers regardless of hirer or relief,
              once log in to the <span>MDT</span>, shall be make
              responsible for any damage to the cab, he shall record, report and
              paid for the damage if it was deemed to be his fault, and that he
              shall also compensate his partner with a reasonable sum of
              money.</p>
              <p>And please do take note that external and internal damages is
              chargeable, got some cab with crack panels are also charged</p>

              <p>Yah loh.</p>
              <p>hirer got heavier responsibility than a relief.</p>
              <p>relief throw key can be instant, hirer throw key must give notice, 7 working days for cdg.</p>
              <p>my hirer friend gets fucking pissed with the consistent change of relief, all drive a month or so, say body can't take it, throw key. Some relief still can choose only drive 5 days, hirer, cannot, salve to coy.</p>
              <p>can request cdg shorten the 7days? Take their little incentive, binded by so much rules &amp; regulations </p>

              Aiya, there are pros and cons as hirer and also as relief, it is up to individual to weight the differences, if you think, hirer better, got benefits and more in control, can go OMO, then be hirer lah, nobody is going to touch your cab, nobody is going to change and nobody is going to give you trouble.
              
              But if you think relief is better, can throw key anytime, can suka suka dun drive, not much responsible on the vehicle, and so on, then be relief lor.
