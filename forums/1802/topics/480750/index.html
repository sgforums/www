              It is not about being too nice or not, but as mature peoples, we need to reason out the issue, nice or not nice is more of an emotion and one sided expression.
              Long ago, I already gives lecture on partnership and human relationship, that time, my ex chief said I write too long, lor sor...man.
              
              In short, in any relationship, there will be a starting follow by a storming, normaly and then spring again. First, very friendly, then thing start to brew and screw up, the storm arrived, and depend on how you tackle it, somehow it will normalise itself and then Spring arrive no matter whether you sack him or he is still with you.
              
              You should therefore reason things out with him like a man, not a nice or agressive man, but as a man you use to be, speak out your mind of what you want, if relief decided to throw key, so be it, but if you keep quiet and expect relief to perform ideally to your style and believe in the word (ze tong) "automatic" that relief should do these and that, or that due to years of his experience, he should know what to do, then I can say that you are just guessing, hallucinating and blinding believe that he will do automatically, which if he did, then is fine, 
              
              But in this case, he did not, so it is better you talk, open your mouth and speak ur heart out, nice or not is another issue.

              <p>Actually for this case, you shldnt charge him the whole rental. $130 for repairing the dent is cheaper than mine. I paid $150 because of the stupid valet driving the kuku porsche out and hit my left side light. In the end i got dent, but the porsche right bummer gone....i see liao. Dont know want to laugh or feel pain. Haha. I got ask around for my case, mostly is 50-50. What to do? At that time i also ask myself why must pay the damage? In the end pay 150 to fix the dent. Told myself money still can earn back, dont brood over it. Most impt is must have good relationship or partnership with hirer or relief. Like what bowah says... my hirer even charlie makan me..i see a few dollars, less than 10 dollars i just let go. </p>
              <p>As for your case, just sms him to update the logbook. As for the rental, is up to u. The daily rental minus ( the rental divide 12 hours x The hours in the workshop) will do. I think is fair but its my own opinion.</p>

              <p>Actually for this case, you shldnt charge him the whole rental.
              $130 for repairing the dent is cheaper than mine. I paid $150
              because of the stupid valet driving the kuku porsche out and hit my
              left side light. In the end i got dent, but the porsche right
              bummer gone....i see liao. Dont know want to laugh or feel pain.
              Haha. I got ask around for my case, mostly is 50-50. What to do? At
              that time i also ask myself why must pay the damage? In the end pay
              150 to fix the dent. Told myself money still can earn back, dont
              brood over it. Most impt is must have good relationship or
              partnership with hirer or relief. Like what bowah says... my hirer
              even charlie makan me..i see a few dollars, less than 10 dollars i
              just let go. </p>
              <p>As for your case, just sms him to update the logbook. As for the
              rental, is up to u. The daily rental minus ( the rental divide 12
              hours x The hours in the workshop) will do. I think is fair but its
              my own opinion.</p>

              <p>tks for ur points bro</p>
              <p>i agree with the rental part but at least he should hv the decency to collect the veh fm wrkshop n park at carpark</p>
              <p>he just dump veh at wrkshop n ask me to pick up,never bother to pump full tank b4 sending to wrkshop </p>
              <p>Its not abt the money but it's abt his attitude </p>
              <p>i think he didn't expected tat I'll tell him to repair he thought I'll close eye tis time also</p>
              <p>all I wanted is u damage the veh so u repair n send bk to me swee swee</p>

              <p>i wont say hirer / relief got any pros/cons. just that have partnership, hirer stands to gain due to the rebates...what will the relief get? some view hirer is better, but on the other hand, relief has no liability. so no end to this debate ... haha. of course there are other sources of income...</p>
              <p>if really one day, taxi companies really pay cpf to drivers,......i cfm throw letter. They should pay taxi drivers based according their daily earnings and pay the percentage rather than the mileage covered.</p>

              <p>well, as what my hirer says when i used to get the dents from my previous accident. Company will hold him liability if he returns the car, and he's not sure whether when will he returns the key. It can be any time. that's how he told me this in the face, of course no hard feelings but that's life.</p>
              <p>When the taxi company loans you the car in one good shape or at least maintains what it's, it's best when you throw the keys back, the car still retains the shape what it was before.</p>
              <p>so most of time, when out driving, please be vigilant. but as time goes by, all drivers tend to be more slacked and relaxed....that's where things happen.</p>
              <p>if partnership cannot carry on, best look for new hirer/relief.</p>
