              <p>My blog (www.cabby65.blogspot.com) is about my life and experiences as a cabby in Singapore. 
              Hopefully, my today's posting about my observations and experiences of a few 
              things uniquely Singapore will be helpful in widening my readers' 
              perspectives of taxi drivers here. I hope you're not tired of the banality of my posts. <br> <br> Now, I'm thinking frivolously of the word -"rank", which has all sorts 
              of meanings. Rank could mean a position in an army or a taxi rank could 
              mean a taxi queue or taxi stand. You could also use rank to emphasize 
              something that's is terribly smelly.<br> <br> For me, taxi rank is closest to my heart. You see, whenever I see an 
              empty taxi rank, I can't resist the temptation to get in quickly and be 
              the 
              first in the rank instantly. But usually ranks have taxis on them and 
              when you join one, you have to wait until you progress to the front 
              before getting a customer. Believe me, more often than not. you have to 
              usually make a long, 
              long wait before you get a customer, especially at airport taxi rank. 
              Frequently, it takes about an hour of waiting in an airport rank before a
               customer jumps in. So you can imagine when the customer wants to drop 
              off just a few kilometers from the airport. like Simei or Pasir Ris, 
              your heart shattered when the taxi fare is less than $10 (inclusive of 
              $3 airport surcharge) and 
              that's for an hour of frustrating wait in the airport rank. <em>Well, just curse your dammed luck, buddy!</em><br> <br> At the same time, 
              you can also imagine the attraction when a taxi driver sees an rank 
              empty. But buddies, don't be too happy. Why a taxi rank is empty?. 
              Usually, it's because there are no people around. I usually give myself ten 
              minutes in an empty taxi rank. If no customers approaches by then, I 
              would quickly move off to ply the road elsewhere.<br> <br> Now, in uniquely Singapore, we have the ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) system,
               which is an electronic system of road pricing based on a pay-as-you-use
               principle. Adopted in 1998. Singapore was the first city in the world 
              to implement an electronic toll road collection system with flexible 
              pricing to control traffic congestion.<br> <br> ERP gantries are placed around the CBD (Central Business District  - city areas), major expressways and heavily used roads. If a
               customer board a cab inside the CBD from 5pm to midnight at every day of the week, they have to 
              pay a surcharge of $3. Most cabbies are seduced by this surcharge and 
              converge into CBD like bees to honey. All ranks inside the CBD at 
              popular shopping malls, like Lucky Plaza and office buildings in Suntec 
              are lined with <em>many, many taxis </em>with ready customers. Whereas, just outside the CBD, around 
              the fringes taxi ranks at Far East Plaza, Orchard Tower, Vivo City, etc..etc.., the ranks are <em>empty
               of taxis</em> but with many angry customers. This is what I call "the CBD 
              Dilemma". This is indeed a problem that has plagued the taxi business 
              here for a long time and nobody seems to have a solution for it.<br> <br> It's natural for cabbies to prefer picking customers inside CBD to earn 
              the $3 surcharge. They are ply the streets for the money not for 
              pleasure. Perhaps, LTA should designate some "popular fringes CBD taxi 
              stands" with 
              location surcharge of $2 like the Singapore Expo Center in Changi. I 
              think it's worth paying an extra $2 than endure a frustrating half an 
              hour wait at taxi ranks. By the way, taxi is not a public transport 
              service like buses or MRT trains but a premium transport service run by 
              self-employed drivers and private companies. <em>I can hear screams of protests from taxi commuters, liao!. </em>But in today's ST forum, someone suggested starting the $3 CBD surcharge earlier from 2pm instead of 5pm. <em>Sure or not?</em><br> <br> Anyway, when it's midnight without the $3 surcharge but instead the 50% 
              midnight surcharge rolls in, it
               seems that all the taxis in Singapore (about 28,000) are out and 
              everywhere looking for business. They would come like army of termites 
              and cleared all the once-angry customers within minutes and soon, the 
              streets are filled with hundreds of empty taxis hunting for the few 
              customers left...it's a pathetic sight. Each will try to out race 
              the other as soon as the traffic light turn green. Most of the time, 
              they race for nothing.<br> <br> There are so many  things I love about being a cabbie, mainly, the 
              people and the  adventure and the unpredictability of each shift. And of
               course, the flexible working hours. You're your own boss, with nobody 
              breathing down your neck. But there are also a  few things that I 
              dislike, like traffic jams and accidents  and all the abuses that some 
              difficult customers heaped on cabbies. <em>Well, take the heat or get out of
               the kitchen.</em><br> <br> "After all being said, I now recall a Malay family of a mother and two 
              teenage daughters in my cab last night. On the way, they were talking in
               Malay, which I don't understand. They talked and laughed, laughed and 
              talked, for the whole journey. Nothing in this world seemed to be able 
              to spoil their high spirit. And that's the spirit I like to adopt." ....by Dr.Cai Mingjie.. a PhD taxi driver.</p>

              <p>Very true, tell you honestly I dont have the ability to be chief of anything in any field even. I can be an advisor to chief, maybe tell my boss or leader what is a good approach but myself I cannot do the leading sure will cock up one. Like I tell my friends, if I join the army I sure become a major! A Major cock up!</p>
