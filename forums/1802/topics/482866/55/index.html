              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ryde to launch new private-hire car service in Singapore</strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Homegrown carpooling app Ryde announced it will be launching RydeX, its new private-hire car service, as part of its growth expansion strategy. <br><br>The announcement on Wednesday (Mar 28) comes hot on the heels of Grab's takeover of Uber's Southeast Asian business, which includes operations in Singapore. <br><br>Ryde said it has already started accepting sign-ups of drivers via the Ryde app, and aim to have 5,000 full-time drivers. It currently has a combined fleet of more than 55,000 drivers - both private cars and taxis - that serve 300,000 passengers a day.<br><br>“Offering private-hire car services would complete our mobility suite to serve our users better," said founder and CEO of Ryde Technologies Terence Zou. <br><br>“We’ve always been planning to enter into the private hire space to complete our mobility suite, but right now I think is also an opportune time, I think the market needs more competition and that’s where we can provide consumers and drivers with an alternative platform and way to get around,” he said.<br><br>He added the move is a "natural extension" of the business, and not a response to Uber exiting the marketing here.<br><br>RydeX, which is an on-demand ride-hailing service, promises to be competitive. <br><br>In a press release, the company said the driver’s commission rate will be lowered to 10 per cent, adding the savings will be passed on to commuters in the form of lower fares and to drivers in the form of higher earnings.<br><br>“We have been receiving positive feedback to launch RydeX as a new private-hire service," said Mr Zou<br><br>"We hope to provide commuters a cheaper alternative to get around and drivers a way to make a decent living. Ultimately, our mission is to make a positive social impact in people’s lives."<br><br>But one expert Channel NewsAsia spoke to said Ryde will need to work hard to differentiate itself.<br><br>Dr Park Byung Joon from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said: “They will have great difficulty in terms of the driver availability, because Grab has far more vehicles under them. So if they are simply seen as another app, then of course Singaporeans will not use them that well, so it really depends on what kind of service they can provide for commuters.”     <br><br>Dr Park added that Grab’s takeover of Uber does little to alter the saturation of the private hire car market here, and he believes Ryde would have entered the market regardless. <br><br>Mr Zou said that being the smaller player has its advantages.<br><br>“Having run our carpooling business for close to three years, we also understand what the riders and the drivers want, what features they would like, what are the things that work for them, so we have been collating feedback all this while, and definitely putting the consumer first, listening to what they want, giving them a good fare option, that would be our core focus.”</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">If you find it hard to keep up with developments from Grab, we feel you. After all, they’ve been<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="http://sg.asia-city.com/city-living/news/you-can-now-pay-favorite-bike-sharing-service-through-grab"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">busy releasing things like GrabCycle</strong></a><span> </span>just slightly over two weeks ago, even amidst speculation of their impending buyout of Uber’s Southeast Asian operations—which we all now know<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/business/grab-merges-with-uber-in-southeast-asia/"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">to be reality</strong></a>.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">As part of that deal, Grab will absorb Uber’s operations here while Uber’s services will exit the market in stages. It’s bad news for those who rely on Uber’s ride hailing services, including their<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="http://sg.asia-city.com/city-living/news/amidst-rumors-of-acquisition-uber-launches-new-service-singapore"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">recently-launched Uber Commute</strong></a>, as both drivers and riders have only two more weeks to choose to migrate to Grab (or not), since the Uber app will cease to function in Southeast Asia from Apr 8. Your Uber account will remain intact for use in other markets.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">For those using Uber Eats (not that we lack food delivery options anyway), it’ll work until end-May, just as GrabFood expands around the region, including being introduced here in Singapore. With all that happening, here’s the quick and easy guide to help you keep track of what functions are available on Grab, both now and in the forseeable future.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">GrabFood</strong><br style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The biggest new service we’ll soon get is GrabFood. Those who’ve already tried using it in Thailand and Indonesia will know what to expect when it lands in Singapore by mid-2018. All of Uber Eats’ merchants will migrate to the GrabFood platform, including everyone’s go-to fast food option, McDonald’s.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">GrabCycle</strong><br style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The aforementioned GrabCycle is actually an ongoing development, so expect changes. But as of now, it’s already a solid bicycle marketplace that allows you to grab bikes and other personal mobility devices from vendors like oBike, GBikes, Anywheel and Popscoot on a single app.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">GrabPay</strong><br style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">If all goes according to their plan, this is probably the service that’s gonna bind us all to Grab. The mobile e-wallet allows Grab users to pay for all Grab rides and a growing number of other products and services (from hawker food to dental surgery) using their app. Looks like Grab is shaping up to be the WeChat of Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">GrabRewards</strong><br style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Essentially their loyalty program, GrabRewards keep us customers within the Grab ecosystem by offering us the incentive to keep spending on Grab and through Grab, and get a free ride now and then in return. Spend using GrabPay and earn even more points—just the way they like it.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">GrabShuttle</strong><br style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Available on the separate GrabShuttle app are the GrabShuttle and GrabShuttle Plus services that offers bus rides on-demand. While GrabShuttle operates on fixed routes, the Plus service plies routes dynamically based on user demand, just like their carpooling service GrabShare, except you’re sharing the ride with many more others.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">Grab rides</strong><br style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Remember the good ol’ days when Grab was just a ride hailing service? Well, back then, even services like GrabHitch was innovative. All there was were GrabTaxi for hailing taxis, GrabCar for hailing private hire cars, and JustGrab for either. Throw in a plethora of other services like GrabShare, GrabHitch, GrabCoach, GrabFamily and GrabNow, and there’s an option for getting a ride in any form or fashion you deem fit.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">GrabGrab</strong><br style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">If you’ve not heard of this one yet, it’s because it doesn’t exist, although<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="http://sg.asia-city.com/city-living/news/6-services-wed-grab-introduce"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">we think</strong></a><span> </span>they should definitely work on it. With all the services that Grab offers these days, it’s getting tricky to know what to Grab and when to Grab it. GrabGrab will let you pair yourself with a Grabber who’ll make sure you Grab the Grab service that’s right for you.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">In all seriousness though, while Grab monopolising the market means less app clutter on our smartphones, it means there’s no longer any competition here. That means we can expect fewer discounted rides and throwaway freebies. And while<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.grab.com/sg/comingtogether-passenger/"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">they’ve promised</strong></a><span> </span>to keep rates unchanged, that means little in the face of a dynamic fare structure for many of their ride services.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">If Uber’s exit from China thanks to local rival Didi Chuxing is any indication, in time, less competition only results in less benefits for us consumers.</p>

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>"It is all about the incentives. When Uber and Grab came, people signed up (as drivers) for the incentives," said the 37-year-old, who has been driving for more than a year.</p>

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>As part of the deal, Uber will take a 27.5 per cent stake in Grab, while Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will join Grab's board.</p>

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Separately, The Straits Times reported yesterday that Indonesian start-up Go-Jek plans to launch its private-hire car service Go-Car in Singapore, as part of its regional expansion plans.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Since last week, Uber drivers have been flocking to sign up with Grab, ahead of Uber ending its services here on Sunday. Grab has erected a large air-conditioned tent - measuring about 20m by 8m - at the open-air carpark of Midview City in Sin Ming, where its driver centre is located.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Though Grab declined to say how many Uber drivers have signed up so far, there were more than 400 drivers gathered at the premises when The Straits Times visited yesterday.</p>

Uber will cease operations on <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/grab-uber-southeast-asia-things-you-need-to-know-10077382">Apr 8</a></span>, while Uber Eats will run till the end of May, after which their partners will shift to a new platform called GrabFood. Uber staff are now on <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/everyone-was-total-shock-uber-singapore-contract-staff-left-hanging-after-grab-acquisition">garden leave</a></span> and are waiting for a call from Grab, who promised <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/grab-buys-ubers-south-east-asia-business-uber-gets-275-stake-in-grab">no lay-offs</a></span> as part of their deal with Uber. Singapore competition watchdog Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) has laid out <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/grab-uber-deal-faces-interim-action-to-ensure-competition">interim measures</a></span> as investigation is ongoing on <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/grab-uber-merger-may-have-infringed-competition-act-ccs-10090032">possible infringement</a></span> of the Competition Act.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Phew, that’s pretty much it. Of course, this was met with fears of a price increase when using Grab because, well, if they’re the only ones in the game, everybody’s going to be fighting for a car from the same company which means there’ll be an increase in demand, ergo—let’s say it together—surge pricing. The regular discounts that were often doled out would possibly come to a halt, only because these were just tactics to woo consumers to their side when there was competition. Then again, that’s just a privilege, not a right. And it’s bound to discontinue anyway, with or without the merger, because it doesn't make business sense for Grab.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Change is always scary, especially if you're one of the many loyal users of Uber. If for some reason—perhaps you don't like the UI/UX of Grab, or otherwise—can’t wrap your head around using Grab, there are two new players who are about to enter the market for your ride-hailing and -sharing needs. Enter <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">Ryde</span>—a local startup providing p2p carpooling in Singapore since 2015. Hot on the heels of the Uber-Grab acquisition, they announced that they’ll be launching a new private-hire car service called <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ryde-to-launch-rydex-private-hire-car-service-in-singapore-10083132">RydeX</a></span>, a move they call a “natural extension of its growing business”. It's not currently available on the app, but the startup has stated that they've <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="http://www.rydesharing.com/ryde-launches-new-private-hire-car-services/">already begun accepting</a></span> driver sign-ups right now. We have reached out to their representatives on when it will roll out, but details are still in the works.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">And then there’s <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="https://www.go-jek.com/">Go-Jek</a></span>, the Indonesian ride-hailing app that started out offering rides on motorcycle taxis in 2010. There’s still <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/south-east-asian-rivals-go-jek-and-grab-to-face-off-in-singapore-as-uber-exits">no clear indication</a></span> of whether it’ll make its way into Singapore, but there have been <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/go-jek-latest-enter-singapores-ride-hailing-war">speculation</a></span> of expansion to our sunny island, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. They’ve also had a quiet presence in Singapore since last year in the form of a <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/go-jek-rides-into-singapore-with-data-science-office">data science office</a></span>. However, if they are indeed going to roll out their services to Singapore, they won’t be able to launch their main service here as "motorcycles are not allowed to be used for point-to-point transport services, unlike taxis and private hire cars," according to a <span style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; background-color: transparent; color: #2b79a9;" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/go-jek-rides-into-singapore-with-data-science-office">statement</a></span> by the Land Transport Authority last year.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">If all else fails, there's the option of going back to buses and the very trusty SMRT.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Local users of the Uber app can continue using it until April 15, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) said on Friday (April 6) as it continued its investigation into the merger between the US ride-hailing pioneer and Grab, its Singapore-based rival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Uber’s app was initially due to be shut here on April 8, as part of changes triggered by Grab’s acquisition of Uber’s South-east Asia operations. However, news of the deal prompted the commission to launch an investigation, as well as to issue a set of proposed interim directives to both companies to “preserve and/or restore competition and market conditions”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This meant that both parties would have to maintain their pre-transaction pricing, pricing policies and product options for their services in Singapore. Under the proposed directives, Grab and Uber would not be able to obtain any confidential information from the other party, including information related to pricing, formulas, customers and drivers, said the commission. Grab would also ensure that Uber drivers joining Grab’s ride-hailing platform of their own accord are not subject to any exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The commission said on Friday that both companies had agreed to extend the deadline for the shutdown of Uber’s app by one week in order to facilitate the investigation of the merger. The extension is limited to the Singapore market, according to a Grab spokesperson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In its statement, the CCCS also disclosed that both ride-hailing companies had written to the commission to offer alternatives to the interim arrangement introduced by the commission. TODAY understands that Uber and Grab submitted separate proposals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The CCCS said it was reviewing the proposals, but gave no details on what they entailed. Asked how long its investigation would take, the commission told TODAY that it would depend on the “facts and circumstances of the case”, and the “level of co-operation” by Uber, Grab and relevant third-parties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“CCCS is aware of the need to expedite investigations in this case,” the commission added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grab declined to discuss the proposals, saying that they were still being reviewed by the commission. Uber declined to comment and said TODAY’s queries should be referred to Grab.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grab’s spokeperson expressed optimism that the alternative interim measures submitted to the commission would “ease concerns around the contestability of the dynamic point-to-point transport market”. The firm also said its alternative proposals will allow it to “run a competitive business and remain agile and flexible so that we can innovate and deliver better services.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“We hope the CCCS will complete its review in an expeditious manner, so that we can continue competing with incumbent transport companies and with new entrants,” the spokesperson added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>News of the extension of the Uber app came hours after Grab’s version suffered its second outage in a week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grab’s ride-hailing app was down around lunchtime on Friday, with an error message warning users that the service was experiencing a “technical issue”. Regular services resumed around 12.40pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grab suffered a more extensive outage on Tuesday night that affected its customers and drivers across several South-east Asian countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. The company blamed its “underlying infrastructure” for the outage, but did not give specific details.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The merger between Grab and Uber has stalled again, as the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS), which is still investigating the deal, ordered a set of enhanced interim measures to take immediate effect on Friday (April 13).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These measures, which are meant to keep the ride-hailing market “open and contestable”, also include those to further protect drivers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For instance, apart from making sure that Uber or new drivers who are joining Grab’s platform of their own accord are not subject to any exclusivity obligations, lock-in periods and/or termination fees, Grab also has to ensure that these drivers are not penalised, directly or indirectly, as a result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A new directive was also placed addressing drivers who rent vehicles from Uber’s vehicle rental subsidiary Lion City Rentals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grab and Uber must ensure that these drivers will be free to drive for any ride-hailing platform and shall not be subject to any hindrance such as higher rental rates and the lack of insurance coverage that will limit the drivers’ ability to drive for any platform. Both firms are expected to inform drivers of this through an email.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They also have to clearly communicate through an email to drivers and riders in Singapore who were on the Uber platform that migration to the Grab platform is purely optional.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This expanded set of measures come on the back of an earlier one proposed on March 30, which stipulated that to “preserve and/or restore competition and market conditions”, both ride-hailing firms would have to maintain their pre-transaction pricing, pricing policies and product options for their services in Singapore. They were also told not to obtain any confidential information from each other, including information related to pricing, formulas, customers and drivers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In its statement on Friday, the CCCS also said that the Uber mobile application in Singapore should continue to run until May 7, “with necessary customer support to handle contractual and payment issues”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the second time the shutdown of the app has been put off, the first being on April 6. The app was due to stop running on April 8, after Grab announced its takeover of Uber’s South-east Asian operations on March 26.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>News of the deal prompted the CCCS to launch an investigation on March 27, into what it described as an “unnotified transaction” between the two companies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The competition watchdog said on Friday that the latest interim measures will stay in effect until its investigation into the merger is completed, and/or until any competition concerns that may arise from the deal are resolved, or until it revokes them due to “material changes in market conditions”. It did not give a date for when its investigations will be done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During this time, as part of the added measures, Grab and Uber have to maintain their pricing and product options for riders and drivers, including the levels of base fares, surge factor and driver commission rates — as they were before the sale.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grab will also not be able to take over operational data such as trip history data from Uber to enhance its market position, though the CCCS noted that Grab will be able to receive personal data of drivers, riders and merchants who have opted to move from Uber to the Grab platform.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Introduced on Friday is also an order for Grab to stop its exclusivity arrangements with all taxi fleets in Singapore. This is provided that there are no exclusivity arrangements between any taxi fleet and any third-party ride-hailing platform in Singapore other than Grab, and that all taxi operators permit their respective taxi drivers to drive for any third-party ride-hailing platform for metered and fixed fare jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To see that all parties comply with the latest interim measures, the CCCS said that an independent monitoring trustee shall be appointed for this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘WORK WITHIN SET CONSTRAINTS’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In response to the announcement, Grab said that it will “work within the set constraints”, but pointed out that the review by the commission will hopefully take into account “a dynamic industry that is constantly evolving, highly competitive, and being disrupted by technology and new services”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, also voiced concern over the possible “unintended effects of the interim measures”, that they should not be “hampering competition and restricting businesses that have already been investing in the country over the years”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the company recognised CCCS’ commitment to preserving competition, Mr Lim said that “all companies — no matter big or small, digital or traditional — are capable of innovation in a free market”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Grab entered Singapore five years ago with minimal resources and the goal of enabling all taxi drivers to earn a better living using our platform,” he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“We’re proud to be headquartered in Singapore, where the country’s free market economy and policies enable businesses to compete and innovate vigorously to solve customer needs. We trust the Government will continue to be pro-business in providing a path for start-ups to flourish and become sustainable businesses.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Lim also said that the company will continue to focus on building better products to compete, ensuring fairness for passengers and drivers, and to cultivate the tech talent pool here through its regional research and development centre in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for its alliance with taxi operators, Grab is “fully supportive” of extending its platform to all taxi drivers, including ComfortDelGro drivers who are still constrained from picking up JustGrab jobs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TODAY understands that that Grab has no plans to stop its partnership with taxi operators such as Trans-cab, HDT Taxi, Premier Taxi, Prime Taxi, and SMRT Taxi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Separately on Friday, the Land Transport Authority expressed its support for the interim measures issued by the CCCS. “In particular, we note that the measures pertaining to the removal of exclusivity obligations and impediments to market contestability will further promote market competition in the point-to-point (P2P) transport sector.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The authority is reviewing the broader regulatory framework for this sector, including studying how to structure the sector and license private-hire car booking service operators.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“This is to ensure the sector remains open and contestable and no single operator dominates the market to the detriment of commuters and drivers. Where necessary, we will work with CCCS, taxi companies, and private-hire car booking service operators to operationalise CCCS’s interim measures directions requirements,” it added.</p>

Go-Jek is already looking to step into the void by expanding its Indonesia-based service into Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, but now a source tells TechCrunch that the ambitious startup has held early-stage talks with Comfort that could see it enter Singapore as ride-hailing partner for its 15,000 drivers.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style='color: #26282a; font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;'>Comfort did not reply to a request for comment.

The company started life as a motorbike taxi-hailing app, but it has since expanded into four-wheeled taxis, services on-demand and payments in Indonesia where it is considered the market leader.</p>

Moves into Vietnam, Thailand and Philippines -- which sources told TechCrunch are underway with local teams already hired -- make sense since these are markets where Go-Jek can roll out its flagship bike service and potentially others, but Singapore is trickier since motorbike taxis are outlawed.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style='color: #26282a; font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;'>Go-Jek opened a Singapore office for business development last year, and it believes that there is demand for its services there. Rather than launching from scratch -- which a host of smaller services including Ryde and India's Jugnoo are planning -- it is eying a tie-up with Comfort that would give it access to its fleet.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style='color: #26282a; font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;'>There may be demand driver-side, too. <a style="background-color: transparent; color: #2d90ff;" rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/comfortdelgro-tells-its-cabbies-to-delete-uber-app">Comfort told its drivers to delete Uber</a> in the wake of the merger deal with Grab, but many of the fleet are reportedly uneasy about <a class="crunchbase-link" style="background-color: transparent; color: #2d90ff;" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grabtaxi/">Grab</a>being their only ride-hailing option. That's an angle that Go-Jek could leverage in its talks with Comfort, which are initially exploratory in nature, we understand.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>JUST when Uber's exit appears to have left Singapore's ride-hailing field wide open for Grab, new players are preparing to enter the turf.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Five new and diverse players - two of which use blockchain and cryptocurrency - are entering the fray, The Business Times has learnt. Go-Jek, Dacsee, Jugnoo, Ryde and MVL are set to reinstate competition in the ride-hailing sector, and put to rest fears of a Grab monopoly by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS).</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Hugh Mason, chief of corporate innovation firm JFDI, told BT that the dynamism in Singapore's ride-hailing market is "fantastic". "Just within a few years, the disruptors are being disrupted themselves."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Isaac Ho, a Singapore-based venture capitalist, added: "Even with the Grab-Uber merger, the ride-hailing space still presents a lot of opportunities, one of which is managing the supply side. Some Uber drivers were reportedly reluctant to join Grab's platform, over concerns that drivers' fees may increase, which means that ultimately, commuters will pay higher fares." He added: "Non-traditional players such as blockchain-based tech players may see this as an opportunity to disrupt the traditional commission-based model and reduce the fees imposed on drivers."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Singapore-based MVL, for instance, said it is a not-for-profit firm, and wants to revolutionise the mobility industry by enabling the transparent sharing of all data related to driving, accidents, repairs and other mobility-related transactions.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>It plans to charge zero commission on all rides and only a negligible transaction fee for the maintenance of its platform.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Its blockchain platform will track and gather data on vehicle activity. Participants who provide data will be rewarded with MVL Points, which can be converted into MVL Coins (the cryptocurrency used in MVL's ecosystem), and eventually exchanged for fiat money on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Riders will be rewarded for rating and reviewing their drivers, while drivers will be rewarded for driving safely and recording driving data.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>MVL founder Kay Woo said: "The recent consolidation of the two major ride-hailing players and rapid advancement of the distributed ledger technology make it possible for us to offer our platform to create a transparent and accountable mobility ecosystem that rewards all participants."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'><img style="box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/image/2018/04/27/BT_20180427_JQRIDE_3415126-page-001.jpg" alt="New entrants" width="500"></p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Dacsee, a Malaysia-headquartered blockchain player, will launch in Singapore in the second quarter of 2019, BT has learnt. Dacsee wants to reduce the commission charged to drivers to between 1 and 2 per cent, down from the current market rate of 25 per cent.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>It said that while current ride-hailing platforms use their commission to pay for overheads or shareholders, Dacsee's blockchain system will redistribute its commission to the drivers, commuters and the local authorities on its platform.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>To date, it has amassed over 30,000 drivers across Asia on its platform, and raised over US$25 million in funding.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Kenneth Tan, co-founder of Singapore-based cryptocurrency crowdfunding platform FundYourselfNow, told BT that the benefits of using blockchain in ride-hailing are clear: "It removes the middleman, allows for lower costs, and provides a platform to encourage good behaviour in all participants and distribute rewards to them in a fair manner."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Mr Tan said a key challenge will be user adoption, as drivers and commuters will need to understand and accept cryptocurrency, and learn how to cash out and manage cryptocurrency safely. "It's going to take a while."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Meanwhile, Go-Jek - Indonesia's first unicorn startup that popularised motorcycle taxis - will launch here in the "next few months", a source close to Go-Jek told BT. At launch, Go-Jek will offer only car-hailing services; motorcycles are barred from providing point-to-point transport services in Singapore. Go-Jek also plans to launch other services such as food delivery later, the source added.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Go-Jek is also in talks with taxi giant ComfortDelGro to explore a potential partnership, the source confirmed to BT.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Go-Jek, which has raised at least US$2.1 billion since its 2010 founding, is backed by investors including Temasek, Tencent and Sequoia Capital.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Jugnoo, believed to be India's third largest ride-hailing player after Uber and ola, will launch here on May 1 with a target of 500 drivers. It will debut in Singapore a "reverse bidding" model, in which drivers bid a price for each ride, and riders choose a driver based on price, driver rating and the time taken for the driver to reach them.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Jugnoo chief Samar Singla said: "We are very excited about our launch in Singapore. We saw a vacuum and analysed the issues currently being faced in the ride-hailing market of Singapore. We believe that an open driver-commuter network is a need of the hour."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>He told BT that Jugnoo is in talks with private agencies to recruit private-hire car drivers, and has signed up about 50 thus far. Jugnoo has not engaged taxi operators as taxi drivers work on metered fares and are not allowed to dictate prices, he said. But he is hoping that this will change after a consultation with the Land Transport Authority.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>On Thursday, homegrown firm Ryde announced that its private-hire car service, RydeX, will launch here on May 2. For a start, RydeX will offer two options - RydeX Scheduled, which lets commuters book a ride between 10 minutes and seven days in advance, and RydeEXEC, which is for booking luxury cars.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Ryde chief Terence Zou said the company will launch an "on-demand" ride-hailing service when it attains a critical mass of 10,000 to 15,000 private-hire car drivers.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>The startup, which began as a carpooling service in 2015, has more than 5,000 private-hire cars on its platform. Through a "technical integration" with ComfortDelGro, commuters can also book a ride from over 15,000 ComfortDelGro taxis through the Ryde app.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>CCCS, when asked if it was aware that competition in the ride-hailing sector is on its way, said: "We note that there is some news on potential new entrants. Entry of players into the market is a factor for consideration in our assessment."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>But it noted that "for new entrants (actual or threatened) to be considered as a sufficient competitive constraint", three conditions must be satisfied, that is the entry must be "likely", "sufficient in extent" and "timely".</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>"We will determine if there is substantial lessening of competition in this case when we complete our assessment of the investigation, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #333333; font-family: "open sans", sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Grab on Thursday declined to comment on the new competition.</p>
