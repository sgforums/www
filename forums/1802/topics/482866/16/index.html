              <p>What do you mean by kena? You mean kena from CDG? Unless pax complain to CDG, if not, I think CDG won't be do free to check every trip. Imagine so many trips per day alone, to check every one to see if they misuse the keys will be a real waste of resources.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I lazy go RWS, use city key (press once) instead of using Location, need to press so many. So far so safe. Which means they don't do a system check, only if complaint case lah.</p>

              Pax asking is not consider as nao, it is right to ask, as long as you charge correctly, why you scare complain...RWS is under surcharge mah, unless you did something wrong, so full of guilt and worry, then I am sorry for it, for extra $3 only, worry for a week..phuixx.
                  
              One hirer came to me, he took paxs (PRC couple) from festive hotel to W hotel (sentosa Cove), he put $3 surcharge, pax questioned him, he explained. Reached W hotel, he pick another family (local Singaporean family with 2 kids), again he put $3 surcharge, this time to henderson only.
                  
              Few days later, call up to lim kopi, due to his previous complains (including condo security guard also complain abt him), he was ask to look for another taxi company.
                  
              His fark up defence was he dunno W got no surcharges..and still thot it is part of RWS because got W mah.
              
              My advice to him is dunno, dun add surcharges...go back then read and learn.

              <p>Can explain that is not CBD surcharge but location surcharge for RWS. Same amount, no additional amount. Don't think there is any issue.</p>
              <p>Of course, if you put both city surcharge and location surcharge, then sure kena lim kopi lah. But this is not what I am doing or talking about. I am doing it for convenience and safety since it is quite hard to drive and key the surcharges so many times.</p>

              <p>Yah lah, actually not that difficult. But sometimes in a rush, when you press f2, the first one you see is city mah. Press one time f3 is definitely easier than pressing many times to search for loc key and then press another 3 times while driving, right?</p>

              When we paid for our food in a restuarant, we also may ask about this and that charges/bills. The cashier, waiter or captain will tell us nicely, same goes to pax in a taxi, they hv the right to ask too, but unfortunately, many Cabbies take it like a insult or offend and put up a sour face in replying or some even choose to keep quiet.

              I think as a TD for cdg currently, best is still stick to cdg and also Grab, these 2 are the highest volume.
              
              But if you want to go for benefits like smlj hp, LCDTV lah, better rebates or so on, then, that will be a different never ending stories altogether, because it will often keep changing, like flipping pratas here and there,

              <p>Lol, not pathetic lah, can be quite good. For example, I made almost $300 in incentives in a week doing one app solely. Not bad what.

                              <p>still i gotta agree with bro bowah,the purpose of the apps is to
              earn more money fr calls not the incentive.and to force big bro to
              improve their calls and take better care of TD instead of always
              siding with paxs about complaints.</p>

              Yalor, just drive with one or two apps is enough already, beside, too many apps also headache, then press 10 times, only get one, end up no show..puixxx

              <p>Sorry lah, it is almost 2 weeks incentives lah. Can't fight your chief or your casket moving skills lah. If you drive LKY, can retire liao.</p>
              <p>Apps are good for helping you cut wastage of time, epecially when stucked in ulu ulu places like wu ren. The more the merrier, it is a matter of how you manage them. Plus they have incentives so why not?</p>
              <p>Heard a lot of lao jiao TDs complain biz no good these few days, so long taxi Q at malls, airport, etc. The traditional way of driving taxi will be less and less lucrative as more retrenched workers become TDs and most will do the traditional way of sweeping and queueing at malls, airport, etc.</p>
              <p>The Golden Period of apps is here but later Uber-like "pah hong chia" will change the landscape once more. Enjoy it while it lasts....</p>

              <p>Yah, but sometimes CDG can be very good, siao siao one.</p>
              <p>GT is very hard to get because of  the competition. Unless you are the nearest one, hard lah.</p>
              <p>I turn on all 4 apps + CDG in not so hot places. Definitely improve earnings.</p>
