              You think what, GT, hailo, Uber and so on are charity organisation for cabbies ar? these are all business organisation, die die must make money one, if not, heads will roll.
                  
              The sum is easy, let take GT, levy at 40cts, let say...beside those GT call elites and superman like my bro CT and ex chief... each cab take 10 GT per day, 20,000 cab on average will churn an income of $4 x 20000 =$80,000 per day, per month 80,000x30= 2.4 millions, per year 2.4 x 12= 28.8millions per year EBT (earning before taxation), if more cabbies joined, more income, if increase another 10 cts, more income.
                  
              It is time for these apps players to sit back, earning big buck and see people like me, my bro CT, ex chief and his gangs slogging all day with their calls from their well set up server system, with 28.8 millions per annum, what is $300 reward for them, what is giving out smartphone to them? chicken feet, because the more you take calls, the more gain for them.
                  
              Not to forget people like my bro CT, he can take more than 10 calls per shift one hor, then other business like grabcar and advance booking levies...sometime, i just wonder how on earth does a person without a TVDL earn so much from taxi drivers who indirectly work for them in term of levy

              That's why I keep saying must have a sideline that can grow and help you get out of driving teksi. If not, you be their slave for life lah.
              
              You should be on the other side but you keep saying no need sideline, people drive for so many years also can raise children who go university, lol.

              I rather call it Capitalism base on meritocracy, since he can (qualification), he able (work hard), he dare (to take risk), he venture (business mind), he succeeded, we also lan lan hv to accept the fate. But no matter how, he still loose to our govt, just set up gantry only, tons of money flow in liao

              <p>Nowadays, only use them for ulu places &amp; past midnight. Don't waste time &amp; other opportunities pressing their stupig app during peak hours.</p>

              <p>Three weeks ago,went to sign up with GT. During this three weeks,i do a experiment on GT to determine how good the app is. I purposely put cdg mdt to busy and solely relied on GT and street pick. Quite disappointed, my income dropped significantly.</p>
              <p>I noticed that GT has alot of taiko calls. Some pick up point they just stated codo name,postal code,and taxi stand code etc. Like some bros mentioned here,very difficult to get job. Even u are just beside the building.</p>
              <p>Their job are not extremely good and bak bak, why make Td like a beggar has to bid until finger is swollen before their give u the job.</p>
              <p>I uninstalled the app. Yesterday n today, my earning back to normal with the aid of cdg calls. I still prefer to be cdg ranger driver as they offer me a more stable income.</p>

              <p>Agreed, bro. CDG is better. When you see taxi std no, just ignore lah. Very good chance get cancelled one.</p>
              <p>Why waste time pressing on their sh^tty app only to be rejected time &amp; again? Also you will sometimes lose street pax or other calls when they all come at the same time &amp; you go choose GT.</p>
              <p>I am really sick &amp; tired of them but will not unistall just yet. Sometimes, they can save you from ulu places or at way off peak hours. So just turn them on when in ulu places or after 11pm.</p>
