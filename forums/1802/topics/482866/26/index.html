              <p>I was thinking $5000 less 20% becomes $4000.  Fuel per 12 hours should be between $30 to $50, take it at $40 so 26*$40=$1040.   Rental for 30 days should be at the minimum for $50 per day car $1500.   So $4000-$1040-$1500=$1460 for 12-hour job 6 days a week.....that is very little....and this job is without CPF, without paid holidays, without medical leaves, without bonuses, without paternal/maternal leaves and without other benefits . It is unlike other Uber employees that enjoy those benefits.  So better off as a security guard earning $2200 per month + other benefits  or working as food store assistant earning $2600 per month ( <a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/soshiok/locals-dont-want-be-stall-helpers">http://news.asiaone.com/news/soshiok/locals-dont-want-be-stall-helpers</a> ).</p>

              <p>But then come to think about it, Uber is for less serious drivers who would not consider taxi-driving as a profession or for ex-taxi-drivers who lost their taxi-vocational license.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans seriously considering taxi-driving would attempt to get their taxi-license even if it takes up to 80 attempts to get it ( like our ex-aircon repairing business uncle ).</p>

              Team? So far, i never heard of Team in Taxi driving leh, or is it just a label, otherwise Taxi driving is very individualistic in term of Singapore.
              
              Now, tia kong Govt is exploring into employing Taxi drivers, so instead of you being a hirer, you become a staff or employed as a driver for taxi company, as such, you will get all the benefits of what an employee get, from CPF to medisave contribution, from medical insurance to care, from annual leave to hospitalisation leave and all other perks, how they are going to work it out or will it work, let see lor.

              <p>Some things i don't understand. They should treat each driver equally. I tested the GT system. I search for taxi using the app at 6am and there is 1 0.2km away but they assign one TD for me which is 1.6km away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once i switched on my driver app and used my wife phone to test the system in the same condo building. I bidded for the job in the building but i lost to a TD whom is 0.9km away. </p>

              <p>I am using Galaxy S6 Edge+ which is the latest and one of the fastest phone in the market for these app jobs. And still, jobs are lost even when i am the nearest bidding. Tested with friends and wife phones during peak hours. Just beside them also lost. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If these guys so good at networking still go and drive what bloody taxi. Sell insurance and property or even MLM can earn tons more and lifestyle much healthier. These jobs no age limit also. These taxi drivers mostly are cock talkers and 2-3 drivers share 1 app profile and reg number and name. </p>

              Wha, u so rich, can afford S6 edge+, ani kuan kong, still drive smlj taxis.
              
              Aiya, networking got no limitation one mah, depend on which trade are you in, u also need to network mah, unless you like to operate alone, then dun expect good information and tips on the trade mah, because if you no network, then how to get info? Search with yr S6 edge+ ah? 
              
              So, job like taxi, forum moderators, radio DJ, and so on, tends to create lots of self thinking in their job/trade, and that is why you see many cabbies like to talk to themselves, desparately press here and there, and not long, most, like me and forum mod here, got psycho problem liao...

              Call centre word can listen....pig also can climb up the tree liao.
              
              No lah, call centre do not know anything, any call from cdg thru apps aka auto booking, call centre bo yew lan one. The call software take over, what happen is cdg apps call is now cdg main priorty (bo bian, got grab and uber to compete mah)
              
              So, the managemet told the cdg's ah neh programmers (software contractor at CBP) to repeat those auto call to cabbies twice,
              
              If the first 2 cabbies got no bid, the second 2 cabbies might bid, but if the first one got bid, the second one will just appear and disappear...it is a safety net to get pax  a cab, at the same time, prevent pax from choosing grab or uber if cdg got no one bid.
              
              And for why it close so fast, it is to prevent cabby from bidding and start drive to the direction of call but then MDT half way appear call cancelled. So, now it is faster so that you can go on and sweep the road or wait for durian to drop
