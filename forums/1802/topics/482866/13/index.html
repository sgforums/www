              <p>https://sg.news.yahoo.com/grabtaxi-singapore-launches-2-8m-081726128.html?linkId=11907656</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1422056033531_1244" style="margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #3f3f3f; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><a style="color: #324fe4; outline: none;" href="https://www.techinasia.com/tag/grabtaxi/">GrabTaxi</a> Singapore announced today the launch of its Provident Fund (GPF), a S$3.5 million (US$2.79 million) welfare fund set up for taxi drivers who are active and have maintained high service standards. The fund comes directly out of the investments that GrabTaxi received in the last 14 months, totaling US$340 million. It also confirms <a id="yui_3_9_1_1_1422056033531_1243" style="color: #324fe4; outline: none; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;" href="https://www.techinasia.com/grabtaxi-brings-fight-uber-additional-funding-65-million/">past claims</a> made by the company’s Malaysia general manager Adelene Foo that the firm would earmark funds for driver welfare.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #3f3f3f; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">“Driver welfare has always been a key focus for us and we understand what our drivers truly need,” says Lim Kell Jay, general manager for GrabTaxi Singapore. “The GrabTaxi Provident Fund allows us to set aside enough money to support our drivers […] The fund covers medical costs, accident cover[age], and crisis support to give our drivers peace of mind and reaffirm our commitment to their well-being.”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: center; color: #3f3f3f; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>See: <a style="color: #324fe4; outline: none;" href="https://www.techinasia.com/grabtaxi-raises-250m/">GrabTaxi raises a record-breaking $250M to dominate Southeast Asia</a></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #3f3f3f; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">GrabTaxi will deposit S$300 (US$240) into the fund every month for each driver that fulfills the service and usage criteria. This amounts to a total of S$3,600 (US$2,879) per driver that GrabTaxi sets aside every year for their use. Drivers just need to provide the relevant receipts and documents to GrabTaxi to make the claim except in the case of crisis support, when no documentation is required.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #3f3f3f; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Launched in October 2013 in Singapore, GrabTaxi is one of the largest third-party booking apps in Singapore. The mobile app offers taxi drivers an efficient method to get passengers and reduce empty cruising, which enables taxi drivers to increase their income. With over 60,000 drivers across the region, GrabTaxi says it plans to expand its driver network with the goal of becoming the largest consolidated taxi fleet in Singapore this year. There are currently six GrabTaxi bookings per second throughout the region, according to the firm. GrabTaxi claims more than 620,000 people use the app at least once a month in Southeast Asia.</p>

              <p>The Taxi Community had comes along way since the 70s to what they are
               today. Contributing for years, be it directly or indirectly to nation 
              building, yet many of times, not being well taken care of. From a small 
              island to a first class nation today, we cannot forsake their effort in 
              tourism industries and transportation! We cannot forsake the service of 
              these road warriors that have been serving us for years! We should come 
              together, to motivate and show our appreciation.</p>
              <p>Being an Ambassador of Singapore, they are also father, family, husband and friend to many of us.</p>

              10 cdg calls, can take, why not, but 5 calls surely very far away from yr current location, you want to take ar??
              
              I think if Cdg calls can provide matching like Grabtaxis, whereby the caller is near, it can be good. But then, at the end of the day, from a busines perspective, both call system serve the same boss. They will not go bother so much.

              Of course taking calls will up your income, but it is a stress too, so it is up to individual to ply their business, and in taxi driving, there is actually no such thing as SIFU, it is more of a lau jiao (some are lan jiao hor) and newbies. 
                  
              Each driver have it own way of driving, no wrong, no right, as long as he or she can make a living out of it, stay healthy and able to have time with family or friends, how he or she drive, is pefectly ok, after 3 months on the road, most are already Sifu, which apply in china and hk, only Singapore call TD.. Uncle.
                  
              Some takes calls all the way, applied STC, Some sweep all the way, and some have both side of the world on whoever come first, 
              
              The keys and skill in taxi driving is not about calls and sweep when there are paxs, it is about what to do and where to go when there are no pax, no calls and no morale to drive further.
