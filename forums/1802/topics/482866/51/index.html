              Simply put it, 
              
              TDVL is A level
              PHV is O level

              No feedback means the scheme did not take off well, smlj hourly rental, pples can just walk in to rent a day car and do grabcar or uber liao, somemore a good car, not those smelly old taxis.
              
              What you should do is therefore, set priority 
              Try to get a job out there,
              If cannot match, go to e2i at Jurong east and train yourself up, estimated everyday a thousand jobs there waiting for grab.
              Finally, when all avenues are exhausted, then you come and think of driving, which is the last resort.
              
              
              Get going..dun be lazy..

              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>The decals – which are to be affixed at the top right corner of the front windscreen and top left corner of the rear windscreen – will allow for the easier identification of registered private hire cars, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in a press release on Thursday (April 13).</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>The decals will also help facilitate enforcement against offences such as unregistered cars providing chauffeured services, or private hire cars picking up passengers by street-hail.</p>

              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>The decals will be available from next Monday (April 17) and can get them affixed at the following locations:</p>

Those who registered their cars after Feb 28 this year will have to visit a Viacom/JIC or STA inspection centre.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>LTA noted that failure to affix these decals will be an offence under the Road Traffic Act. More details on the penalties will be made known at a later date.</p>

Owners of private hire cars that fail these inspections will not be allowed to renew their road tax, LTA said, adding that letters have been mailed to all registered private hire car owners to inform them of the requirement and the steps they need to take.</p>

              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>According to Grab, more than five million JustGrab bookings were made one month after its launch — for both taxis and private hire cars.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>In a press release, GrabTaxi Singapore chief Melvin Vu said that taxi drivers on JustGrab have already reported a 30 per cent increase in ride bookings, and S$220 more earnings per week, since the introduction of JustGrab.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“We want to continue innovating to better serve driver-partners and passengers, and contributing to Singapore’s world-class transport network,” said Mr Vu.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Grab says that taxi drivers on GrabShare can expect to boost their earnings by up to 40 per cent from completing more jobs at a given time. Passengers will benefit too as GrabShare fares are up to 30 percent cheaper than individual rides.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>As a special incentive, Grab says it is offering taxi drivers a 1.5 times fare top-up on all shared bookings during the month of May. No levy will be imposed on shared bookings for taxis this month. </p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“Since launching GrabShare in December, we have been studying trip data and refining our matching algorithm to better match passengers with similar routes to the nearest available driver,” said Mr Vu. </p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“We are confident that the combined strengths of taxis and cars will result in greater transport efficiency while creating more income opportunities for driver-partners.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Taxi-sharing was first introduced in Singapore in 1997 via the “Share-a-cab” initiative, which allowed commuters to request for shared taxis through information panels located at selected taxi stands. In 2015, an app called Pair Taxi, also attempted to introduce taxi sharing for commuters in the Central Business District however the Land Transport Authority (LTA) later rejected Pair Taxi’s registration application as “its fare model did not meet the fare-charging conditions stipulated in the regulatory framework”.</p>

The company did not say how much it paid, but Reuters had earlier reported that it had expected to pay US$100 million (S$140.85 million).</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>"We're always on the lookout, whether it's for public partners, private partners, inorganic partnership and growth or organic growth," Mr Hoo Ling Tan, told Reuters in Phnom Penh on Thursday (May 11).</p>

She saw the market size for payments in Southeast Asia as US$500 billion a year, compared to US$25 billion for transport.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>That made it just as important for Grab as transport said Mr Tan, who co-founded Grab with fellow Harvard Business School graduate Anthony Tan five years ago.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Grab did not immediately need to seek funds immediately for expansion, Mr Tan said, adding that the company had raised US$1.45 billion to date. "We still have a lot of it left," she said.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Last month, Singapore's Straits Times reported that public transport operator SMRT Corp was in talks to sell Grab its taxi business, which according to its website has a fleet of more than 3,500 cars.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Mr Tan called the report speculation, but added that Grab was "constantly on the lookout for good partners". Grab's app allows users to summon taxis, private cars and motorbikes. REUTERS</p>

              GIC lost again,
              
              GIC has sold just under half of its stake in Swiss bank UBS Group for a loss, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund announced on Tuesday.
              
              GIC has reduced its stake to 2.7 per cent from 5.1 per cent, selling about 93 million shares of UBS worth about US$1.6 billion as at Monday's close.
              
              "GIC made the UBS sale despite the loss because conditions have changed fundamentally since GIC invested in UBS in February 2008, as have UBS' strategy and business. It makes sense now for GIC to reduce its ownership of UBS and to redeploy these resources elsewhere," GIC chief executive Lim Chow Kiat said in a statement.
              
              GIC took stakes in UBS and Citigroup early in the financial crisis as part of a tactical move into a beleaguered financial sector. While the UBS investment has not panned out - GIC said it was "disappointed" in the loss - the Citi investment has generated enough returns for the strategy to have positive overall returns on marked-to-market terms so far, GIC said.

              <h1>Private hire cars to display decals from July
                      1</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.todayonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/photo_gallery_image/public/photos/43_images/29351912.JPG?itok=SxDUa-vD" alt="" width="560" height="420"></p>
              <p>Identifying private hire cars will be made easier from
                      July 1 when all private hire cars used for chauffeured services -
                      like GrabCar and Uber - will have to display a pair of decals on
                      their car.</p>
              <p>The decals – which are to be affixed at the top right
                      corner of the front windscreen and top left corner of the rear
                      windscreen – will allow for the easier identification of registered
                      private hire cars, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in a
                      press release on Thursday (April 13).</p>
              <p>The decals will also help facilitate enforcement
                      against offences such as unregistered cars providing chauffeured
                      services, or private hire cars picking up passengers by
                      street-hail.</p>
              <p>The decals are tamper-evident, which means they cannot
                      be re-used once removed, and any tampering made to the decal will
                      be evident, LTA said.</p>
              <p>Owners of private hire cars that were registered with
                      the LTA on or before Feb 28 this year will have their pair of
                      decals affixed at no cost, whereas owners who registered after Feb
                      28 will have to bear the S$20 (including GST) fee of obtaining and
                      affixing the decals.</p>
              <p>The decals will be available from next Monday (April
                      17) and can get them affixed at the following locations:</p>
              <p>• VICOM/JIC inspection centres;</p>
              <p>• STA inspection centres</p>
              <p>• Uber and Grab affixing centres</p>
              <p>Uber and Grab affixing centres will only be available
                      until June 30 and are meant to facilitate the affixing for private
                      hire cars registered on or before Feb 28. Those who registered
                      their cars after Feb 28 this year will have to visit a Viacom/JIC
                      or STA inspection centre.</p>
              <p>LTA noted that failure to affix these decals will be an
                      offence under the Road Traffic Act. More details on the penalties
                      will be made known at a later date.</p>
              <p>The tamper-evident decals will be inspected when
                      private hire cars undergo regular vehicle inspections. Owners of
                      private hire cars that fail these inspections will not be allowed
                      to renew their road tax, LTA said, adding that letters have been
                      mailed to all registered private hire car owners to inform them of
                      the requirement and the steps they need to take.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, new to forum. Just started driving with Uber. </p>
              <p>Noticed a tint sticker for covering PDVL licenses being sold online</p>
              <p>Was thinking of purchasing one, but not sure if it's considered tampering?</p>
              <p>Any thoughts and advice from fellow forum members?</p>

              Why not you ask your Uber DSO, driver service officer,  if it is legal or not, I guess that is the best and qualified people to ask.
              
              From a layman perspectives, if I cannot see your label clearly, I cannot identify you, it will be as though you never put any decal there, then, from  transport authority institution like TP and LTA officer perspectives, how do I identify you? If you cannot be identified, they will stop and question you, then issue this and that, if you not happy, can appeal, or can end up in court. (legal court, not furniture court)

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Some 90 per cent of ride-hailing company Uber's drivers have already signed up for a programme which helps them get a mandatory license that private-hire drivers need to apply for.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Called the FastLane programme, it was rolled out by Uber in March to expedite the process of drivers obtaining the Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL), which was made a requirement for all private-hire drivers by the Government.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>These drivers have to apply for the licence by June 30, after which they will be given up to a year to complete and pass a 10-hour PDVL course. Those who miss the deadline will have to stop driving private-hire cars until they obtain the licence.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Within the first week of the programme's launch, 50 per cent of its drivers had applied through FastLane, said Uber in a media conference on Tuesday (June 6).</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>For drivers to begin applying for the vocational license, a medical check-up is required. To help its drivers, Uber has introduced a mobile clinic at its Paya Lebar headquarters that provides fully-subsidised medical check-ups to drivers applying for the license.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>The mobile clinic began operations on Monday and is able to carry out more than 200 check-ups a day. Three nurses are on-site to conduct blood pressure, X-rays and eyesight tests for drivers.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Drivers are already able to settle paperwork for their licenses and make a deposit for their rental vehicles at the UberHub in Paya Lebar.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>"What this does is reduce friction and help our driver-partners get their PDVL as quickly and easily as possible," said Uber Singapore's Head of Operations Mr Jonathan Wong.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Drivers who apply for their license via FastLane before June 30 can receive a free extension of their license until June 30, 2018.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>The company has cooperated with its fleet partners to help drivers who are permanent residents (PRs) continue driving for Uber past the June 30 deadline.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>As PRs need to have an employment letter from their companies before they can apply for a PDVL, Uber has partnered with several chauffeur service companies to offer employment to PR drivers.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Some five companies have booths on-site at the UberHub in Paya Lebar to discuss employment options with drivers</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>The company is hoping to partner with more chauffeur service companies in the future. "We're always looking at expanding our set of options for drivers," said Mr Leigh Wong, Uber Singapore and Malaysia's Head of Communications.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style='margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Grab, Uber Technologies Inc's biggest ride-hailing competitor in South-east Asia, is likely to kick off a fresh round of fundraising "in the near future" as it seeks to develop offerings such as financial services, its head said on Tuesday (June 6).</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Building on soaring user numbers of its Grab ride-hailing app and GrabPay function, the five-year-old start-up aims to transform into a consumer technology firm that also offers loans, electronic money transfer and money-market funds.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>"These are all things under consideration for sure," Mr Anthony Tan, Grab's 35-year-old co-founder and group chief executive officer, said in an interview. "Whether we are to execute any anytime soon, I can't share that off the top of my head."</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Grab facilitates as many as 2.5 million rides each day, making it the largest ride-hailing platform in Southeast Asia with over 930,000 drivers in 55 cities and seven countries. In the past six months alone, daily rides have more than doubled.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>It also provides micro finance to help drivers buy phones and has helped two-thirds open their first bank accounts - practices it said it aims to expand as it seeks to broaden its financial services and build a consumer brand.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>NO NEED TO LIST</p>

Its current investors include Chinese peer Didi Chuxing, China Investment Corp, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Vertex Ventures Holdings - a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>"I can't specifically give a time line but I can imagine somewhere in the near future, there probably could be more money coming in. That's probably quite likely," Mr Tan said.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>The company is not profitable overall but is profitable in some markets, said Mr Tan, who founded Grab with former McKinsey &amp; Co consultant Tan Hooi Ling when they were at Harvard Business School in the United States.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>"We have been very blessed with capital. There is really no need to (list on the stock exchange) this year, next year," he said.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>SPENDING LESS</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Mr Tan said Grab is spending less on promotions and incentives for drivers to log more rides, even as competition with Uber increased after the US firm exited China market last year.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>"Market share clearly shows that today we have something like 70 per cent across the region," Mr Tan said, attributing the figure to localising its services and investing in technology.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Grab recently launched JustGrab which pools taxis and private cars together to help passengers book a vehicle quicker. It also offers GrabHitch and GrabShare car-pooling and shuttle services.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Grab bought Indonesian payment service Kudo earlier this year, and Mr Tan said Grab is seeking more acquisitions to support rapid growth.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>"You will see more happening across the region with GrabPay. The first big thing was obviously the Kudo acquisition, the second one is building an engineering centre dedicated to payments," he said. REUTERS</p>
