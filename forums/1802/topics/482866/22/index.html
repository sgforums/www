              If you notice all posting are about HUAT, all kopitiam talk are about elite, rangers and airborne heroes, but the true of it, you know I know lah, have to work hard for it one hor, not given free. And when you work hard, you stress more and yr heart beat a bit higher hor.
              
              So when young newbies who wish to join as TD asked me, Uncle, you one day earn how much? I told them $30...you can see their disappointment faces. In my heart, I do not wish to see a young man or woman become a TD, save one is better than none, at least do some good deed.
              
              And then on the other hand, less competitor for us too.

              <p>Ha ha. Good trick by GT. Not difficult to guess why they are doing this. Grabcar is definitely more lucrative for them. Don't ever be loyal to them or any other company for that matter. They will play your backside when it comes to making money.</p>

              <p>We
               refer to the report on Uber's surge pricing during July 7's disruption 
              on the North-South and East-West MRT lines ("MRT disruption puts strain 
              on buses, taxis"; July 8).</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority has followed up with Uber and confirmed 
              that surge pricing was used only for its chauffeured vehicle booking 
              services (Uber Executive and uberX), and not its taxi booking service 
              (uberTaxi).</p>
              <p>Under the Third-Party Taxi Booking Service Providers Act, which is 
              expected to come into effect soon after being passed in Parliament in 
              May, taxi-booking fees charged by service providers cannot exceed those 
              charged by taxi companies. Third-party taxi service providers which do 
              not comply with the regulatory framework are liable to penalties of up 
              to $100,000 per contravention.</p>

              </div>

              <p>The existing third-party taxi booking service providers are already 
              complying with this requirement, even ahead of the regulations coming 
              into effect.</p>
              <p>In addition, the service standards of taxi drivers are regulated via 
              the Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence (TDVL) framework, and these apply 
              regardless of whether the taxi is hailed on the street or booked through
               a taxi company or a third-party taxi booking service.</p>
              <p>The TDVL framework provides for sanctions for overcharging, as well 
              as other inappropriate behaviour, such as verbally insulting, 
              intimidating or harassing a commuter.</p>
              <p>Chauffeured vehicle services can only be pre-booked. Commuters should
               find out the fares and conditions that they will be subjected to before
               they agree to accept the chauffeured service.</p>
              <p>With a range of service providers offering different booking and fare
               options, commuters can choose what they are comfortable with.</p>

              <p>That means Uber did no wrong with surge pricing for UberX and above class.</p>
              <p>We all know this what. How can UberTaxi have surge pricing when they use the taxi meter in the taxi itself?</p>
              <p>Price surge was made known to pax before they book so later kena, don't kpkb. It is up to Uber to give goodwill and cancel the surge pricing.</p>

              <p>Car-hire
               app GrabCar Singapore has ramped up its fight with rival Uber by 
              dangling its biggest cash reward yet to prospective drivers, The Straits
               Times has learnt.</p>
              <p>On Monday, it launched an incentive programme promising $1,550 a week
               on top of their fare earnings - the most since the service was launched
               a year ago.</p>
              <p>To earn this, a driver must pick up 100 different passengers a week 
              and make 60 trips during peak hours. The reward comprises $1,200 in cash
               and $350 in "credit".</p>
              <div class="ads clearleft">
              <div id="dfp-ad-imu1-wrapper" class="dfp-tag-wrapper">
              <div id="dfp-ad-imu1" class="dfp-tag-wrapper"></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Drivers must top up credits in their GrabCar accounts to use the app, from which the company deducts commission.</p>
              <p>GrabTaxi, which is based in Singapore and runs the GrabCar service, 
              has raised more than US$340 million (S$464 million) in investment in the
               last year.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim Kell Jay, head of GrabCar Singapore, declined to reveal how 
              much money it has paid in incentives so far but said it has helped to 
              build the firm's network of drivers.</p>
              <p>He said: "All start-ups go through a phase of market development and 
              growth... We are blessed to have received funding that provides us with 
              more options and means to accelerate our growth. These incentives will 
              not last forever but they will remain for as long as is necessary. "</p>
              <p>GrabCar's bid to grow its market share has met with competition from 
              San Francisco-based Uber, which set up here in 2013 and launched a 
              guaranteed earnings scheme a few months ago.</p>
              <p>If an Uber driver makes less than the guaranteed amount in fares 
              during peak hours, the company tops up the difference - provided a 
              driver fulfils conditions like staying online during peak hours and 
              accepting almost all bookings. The guaranteed amount ranges from $27 to 
              $32.</p>
              <p>But while drivers are benefiting from the fight between Uber and 
              GrabCar, some said that should the incentives end, they may not be able 
              to sustain their livelihood.</p>
              <p>Neither Uber nor GrabCar have revealed their driver numbers or details of their profits in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan Siau Kiong, 59, has worked for both companies and about 70 per
               cent of his $1,800 weekly gross earnings are from incentives. He makes 
              around $540 from fares but this is not enough to pay for rental costs 
              and petrol, which add up to $800. "Without incentives, it's very hard," 
              he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Ken Gwee, 28, who has also worked for both, said their incentive 
              schemes pay roughly the same amount, though drivers can work for one app
               only. "I highly doubt that incentives will remain as generous as they 
              are now," he said. "GrabCar has just entered the market, and is 
              aggressively promoting its services while trying to entice a larger pool
               of drivers away from Uber."</p>

              <p>You want a safe, reliable and reasonably priced service, go for the regular taxi service that is strictly regulated and enforced.</p>
              <p>Other than that, you are on your own and don't complain if you need to pay a high price. You asked for it. Orbigoot. LTA won't bother.</p>

              <p>Ok, I understand that they have to make the most money with all
              the investments but there is such thing as being ethical mah. Make
              money who don't want, right? But this is considered foul play.</p>
              <p>Their driver and client support really sucks lah. You go and try
              it yourself lah.</p>
              <p>Do business don't need to think about partners' welfare? Are you
              nuts or what? Good businessmen won't play out their clients and
              partners lah.</p>
              <p>You don't understand, don't talk cock about McDonald's upsize
              lah, totally different tactic. Did McDonald trick you to
              upsize?</p>
              <p> </p>
              
              
              Ethical 1 kg worth how much? If at 1am, in front got one pax, a renault suddenly cut in...jam in front and hijack it, you call that ethical?? I call it taxi business.
              
              Brother, when we talk about any generating profit organising, giving you a job is consider ethical enough already, so what ethical do you want more? 
              
              Even brother brother, father and mother or son and father also end up in court over businesses and asset, you still think of ethical? save it for charity lah

              Good business is about networking, you agreed, I serviced, please pay, nothing to be ethical abt or not. So you book a chauffeured car, you agreed to it, careless whether it is a flood or MRT breakdown or earthquake, you paid for it. Nobody put a gun on yr head to ask you to paid for it. 
              
              Then end up, you kpkb this and that, but when you took that time, you must be feeling grateful you managed to get a car ride back, better than most stuck in there for hours, tio bo, but come to payment, you nao chee nao lan, kpkb, then better walk home lah, like one guy said he walk from city to his balestier home.
              
              On the other hand, Gentlemen,
              
              If you look at it closely from a TD view, that is what we are, why we need to and be so concern about UberX or grabcar charging high prices? With them charging at high prices, it actually benefitted us, and when it comes into the news..lagi good, now paxs on the street start to know the bak hu of UberX and grabcar, they will avoid them, and that in turn, will make us low income group earn more peanuts..tio bo

              To grabtaxi, it is simple, it is a mass business, you get more cabbies to join and grab, the merrier. 
              
              To LTA aka govt, as long as the public is complaining less abt no taxi this and that...they will not touch grab or uber, and that is why Ah Lui could be facing his final days at LTA.
              
              To TDs, whatever it is, if you think you can find a niche in grab that make your driving income increase or drive lesser, by all means go grab, be elites or rangers all up to you, just drive and be happy. But if you keep harping on the levies and peanuts earning, comparing grab with your business, then it will be very difficult to pass life as a TDs...UNDERSTAND BO!
