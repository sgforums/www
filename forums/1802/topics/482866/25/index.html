              <p>For a nerd like me, and after working for so many years, researching and reading carefully is my strength.  </p>
              <p>Web designing is easy cos I picked it up during school holidays last time.  But I'm not very design-savvy and also cos I wasn't a design student.  I'll recommend clients to select their favourite theme, design and concept from www.templatemonster.com and I'll customise it for them.  I stopped doing web design because web hosting is a huge problem i.e. if server down, knn, all customers will call you at the same time because all websites and emails will be down.  :-O</p>
              <p>LV is very strong in the city and as I also live near the city, naturally it is my choice if I were to drive taxi.  But I don't know if I should get it since there are already GT and CDG's MDT.  Also got Uber, Easy Taxi, etc.  Spoilt for choices leh...</p>
              <p>You must've heard about a TD who is a PHD holder.  I'm nothing compared to him.</p>

              Well, when the day you drive taxis and mingle with TDs, you will find that we, the old PSLE TDs are more friendly and easy going than those younger O..diploma or ITE level drivers who tends to be more conservative, stressful and impatient.

              <p>Hope singaporean passengers fxxk him (ah tiong) big big big and complain alot to TC until he gets blacklisted by all TCs and apps co.  I hope he's a UberX or GC driver... else somebody interview him and put up his story in ST. Then all Singaporean TDs will know that the FTs have invaded our last hope / job!!!</p>

              <p>Your hirer may not be wrong. Sweeping skill is crucial especially with the invasion of pirates these days. Noticed in Changi Biz Park, go fewer calls already? A lot of them using pirates now. But queue at AP really I don't it.</p>
              <p>Last night also noticed something strange - even GC pirates seemed to be avoiding Grabpay! Got so many Grabpay calls from so far away - some even 8.8km away. Could be some  fraud with Grabpay as I heard some cabbies and pirates complain about money withheld when they do Grabpay.</p>
              <p>So got opportunity liao - do grabpay, easier to get calls since lesser people want to do it..So far I am able to get paid although sometimes delay 1 or 2 days for them to check that you are not in cahoots with riders for suspected fraud cases. If you are clean, no reason to fear.</p>

              Yandao eh..U should quit now, there is never a right time or perfect time to quit taxi.
              
              All these years, I have heard TD brothers saying I waiting to quit TD, but all I can say is that after 20 years, they are still around, but of course there are also TD who walk their talk, they quitted, and we wishes them the best endeavour.
              
              But out of 10 TDs who said they waiting to Quit at the right time, only 1 or 2 manage to did it, and some even return back to TD after a few months.
              
              Therefore, if you decided to Quit, quit now, because by quitting, you got time to look and get the job you want, and you will work for it as you need a job. By driving and waiting for a right time...you can wait and wait...by the time, game over liao..you already aged, out of touch with the corporate world...window 8 liao leh, sap liao leh, performance management liao leh, e accounting liao leh thing had advanced so fast.
