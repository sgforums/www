              CDG calls must work on follow/link up, once you took a call, the next call will come in after you drop off the first call pax,
              
              if offered 3 to 4 calls and you do not press, the calls will get lesser, 
              
              However, I have to say that CDG calls are mostly far away from call location, hardly you get a close one unless you keep taking calls.
              
              GT call location are nearers and keep offering regardless if you take or dun take, I think Cdg is lacking behind in this, if fark up pax is to make 2 calls, one Cdg, one GT, the GT taxi will reach pax first due to nearer, and the cdg might end up with no show.
              
              Because GT is a direct GPS mobile transmission and MDT of Cdg is a like a slow old dame, so naturally GT will get into the the hp first.
              
              For Cdg MDT, all are standard, you cannot do much, but for GT and other apps, if you want to Grab fast and get it, you can change yr Hp to a 4G with good Ram and signal type like the newest iphone and samsung one.

              <p><strong>Cabbies, Uber drivers rush for Changi Airport fare</strong></p>
              <p>Business for UberX driver Mr Steven Tang, 53, has been booming as more people know of the ride-matching app. Especially so at Changi Airport, where he now gets a third of his business. This has been made sweeter with Uber introducing a surcharge of $1.50 for pick-ups at Changi Airport yesterday. Even then, Uber claims its rides are cheaper than regular taxis, as the LTA-mandated surcharge is $5 during peak periods. But taxi drivers who rely on airport pickups are worried that Uber drivers will rob them of their livelihood. Said cabby A. L. Tan: "They steal our rice bowl because they don't have to follow LTA pricing, even though they are providing the same service. Not only that, they don't even need to wait in line under the hot sun.</p>

              <p><em>"SINGAPORE - A law to ensure that third party taxi booking apps operating here provide <span style="color: #ff0000;">safe</span>, reliable and efficient services was proposed in Parliament on Monday.</em></p>
              <p><em>If passed, the bill will require app companies to register with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and adhere to a set of regulatory guidelines.</em></p>
              <p><em>These will include making sure that <span style="color: #ff6600;">only licensed taxis and cabbies use the app</span> and that information on fares and surcharges are specified up front to commuters."</em></p>
              <p>Means what? UberX considered illegal? With UberX, any Tom, Dick and Harry, foreigner, criminal etc can drive.  Not safe since they are not screened and licensed.</p>
              <p>In addition, there will be a set of KPIs for the 3rd party apps to adhere to or risk losing their licence.</p>

              Uber is never and will never be popular among TDs and Taxi companies of the WORLD. 
                  
              It come with a powerful backup, so money is not an issue to them, they are just testing the ground and the countries, in the west, Uber is flourishing, in Asia, with a much conservative economy.. many hv banned them including India, as usual, after a rape case from the land of Rape, however, india is a big market.
              
              
                  
              It objective is to be the Google of taxis

              <p>My take is UberX is not a taxi service, but private chauffeured service. Thus, it does not come under the new regulations.  UberTaxi however will be under the new regulations.</p>
              <p>The words "<em>third party <strong>taxi booking</strong> apps</em>" were carefully chosen.</p>
              <p>But the question I would like to ask is this:</p>
              <p>All taxi meters are regulated and controlled by LTA.  They are sealed to prevent tampering.  UberX uses the taxi meter software in the iphone provided by Uber for the ride. Why doesn't LTA control this to protect pax? Private chauffeured service again?</p>

              Grab also hv their own private chaufeur booking mah, so are many other rental car companies, but private booking are mend mostly for higher end pax, who are more well off and can pay for the convenient of it, like UberX is partnering Prime rental 
                  
              No issue, you pay more, you enjoy better, this the real world. 
                  
              Same like when I call big boobs young bak bak, sure hv to pay more mah, older one.. neh neh lao lao po po that can flip over the shoulder type...sure cheaper mah.. but end up also one hole to poke.
                  
              So these pax who booked private chaufeur will enjoy better service or so called, private premium service, but end up also travel from point A to B.
                  
              As for phone fares, as LTA said, all taxi apps must register with LTA and seek approval, LTA sure conduct and audit them to make sure they are inline with the regulations B4 giving them the rights to operate here, and as stated, they can be booted out if regulation are not complied

              <p>Don't know what Ah Lui wants to do but seems he may put more restrictions on UberX type of service. UberTaxi is not issue, it is exactly the same as Grab or Easy or Hailo or CDG.</p>
              <p>Public safety is important but our gahmen always like "disruptive technology" that challenges the status quo. This mindset must continue if we are to survive and thrive. To throw Uber out is regressive and narrow minded.</p>
              <p>Think they will fine tune what Uber or Grab can do or not do with their pte car service... but throw it out completely. If it is good for the public, why not?</p>
              <p>BTW Google has backstabbed Uber... coming out with their own version of booking apps after investing in and sitting on Uber's board to learn the secrets.</p>

              <p>Tia gong UberX is cheaper except during super peak where can be 2x or 3x the normal metered fare. So, where is the premium?</p>
              <p>But LTA is clear. There must always be street hire available so that pax have a choice. Not everything is through booking one. So sweepers still got some hope. </p>

              Premium is a status, with no regard to affordability nor services. If I can engage Uber, it is like being special of having a car to pick me up rather than a taxi, and can happily see those taxis Q at stand waiting for calls with long line of cheapo paxs living in and around the north and north west boundary of Singapore.
