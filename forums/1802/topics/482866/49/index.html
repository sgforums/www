Dear All, this post has been posted to warn the public of my upsetting experience with Grabhitch just yesterday evening. *This post is 100% true and has been written by my personal experience, If it has accounted to defame to any company/person, it has been done to warn of others danger. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">I have been a passenger with Grab for at least 2 years and had at least 200 rides with them. But my experience yesterday might be a change to everything. Yesterday evening at 6.50pm, my Grabhitch arrived and picked me up at my designated venue. Below is an attached screenshot of my booking. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">The whole ride was smooth until when I was about to alight, the china Grabhitch driver demanded for me to pay an additional $2 for the ERP incurred during the trip. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">As i chose Grabpay, I told the driver to add into the payment and it will be deducted. He then told me that Grabhitch will not allow the deduction as: <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">1) the driver clearly knows he is NOT allowed to collect tolls from me <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">2) Grabhitch has made clear to all their Hitch drivers that tolls are to be beared by drivers <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">3) Which means the amount deducted from my credit card already INCLUDED the ERP. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">So, when I told him that he can follow up the matter with Grab, he flared up. When i was alighting, he pulled my bandage skirt down with a huge force causing my skirt to reach my knees. With the force exerted, i returned into the car after my foot planted. (FYI, I was sitting on the passenger's sit behind on the left) Being shocked and humiliated this way, I screamed at the china driver in mandarin <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">" How can you just pull someone's skirt down? " He did not release his hands from my skirt and still held on to them with force, and continued demanding for the $2 cash. I was totally fine about paying the additional $2 and did not argue about it with him. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">But after what he did, pulling my skirt down to my panties and NOT even trying to get out of the car to settle peacefully... i really am lost of words. If some of you might think he was trying to grab hold of me and accidentally pulled my skirt down, NO. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">He still continue pulling and holding firmly to my skirt which was already down to my knees while arguing! I just kept screaming at him to let go and when he finally did.. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">I was in shock and trembling and what i wanted was to just quickly alight that car and stop that guy from having any contact with me. So i quickly tried to step out of the car on the passenger door on the left. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">When the driver saw me putting my leg out, he started moving the car! How dangerous is that? I was wearing heels and he just moved the car when my leg is already out of the car. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">The whole situation happened at Hong Kong Street. At that moment being so flustered, i actually still left the car while the vehicle is still moving as i really cant imagine what would he do to me next. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">I quickly regained my balance and pulled up my skirt and i saw some Valet nearby and shouted in mandarin for their help. "can u all come over n help me? he just pulled me skirt down!!" <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">but the valet just stood there and stared LOL. In the mean time, the china driver heard and he immediately drove the car away with the passenger door still open. The valet that stood there and NOT bothering to help, is from the company Valet Uncle. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">SUPER dissapointed and shameful for them. After i got down the car, i was extremely emotionally unstable and broke down. I dialed for the police and they sent me down to cantonment immediately. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">The driver tried calling me 5 times after he fled, my mom called back and he cursed our family with full of vulgarities and for my whole family to die. And said he would not be afraid for the police to catch him. Someone which is not remorseful and thinks that Singapore is like his homeland. As of now, Report has been done and authorities has been informed and to be followed up. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"><br style="max-height: 1e+06px;">The driver has been banned, and i am really distressed by the situation. Is Grabhitch really that safe to use? You determine. I hope i put across a message that would help prevent future similar incidents. <br style="max-height: 1e+06px;"></span></td>

              <h1>Two taxi firms plan to use surge pricing</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some taxi fares could soon fluctuate according
              to actual demand for cabs.</p>
              <p>Two taxi operators are planning to implement dynamic
              fares, popularly known as surge pricing, with a third looking to
              join the fray.</p>
              <p>Trans-Cab, Singapore's second largest operator with
              4,566 taxis, and Premier Taxi, the second smallest with 1,889 cabs,
              said they had informed the Public Transport Council (PTC) of their
              plans.</p>
              <p>Prime, the smallest operator with 731 cabs, is
              considering implementing the controversial fare system too.</p>
              <p>Though taxi fares are not regulated here, operators are
              required to keep the PTC posted of all changes before they are
              implemented. The operators are awaiting the PTC's response.</p>
              <p>The new fares will apply only to commuters hailing a
              cab via the Grab ride-hailing app.</p>
              <p>ComfortDelGro and SMRT Taxis have not indicated that
              they want to join the initiative.</p>
              <p>Dynamic fares vary according to real-time demand -
              lower than the current structured taxi fares during off-peak hours
              but possibly much costlier when demand surges.</p>
              <p>During major rail breakdowns, commuters complained of
              Uber fares exceeding $140 - four to five times that of a usual taxi
              fare.</p>
              <p>But supporters of dynamic fares point out that in cases
              of high demand, the supply of taxis under the current pricing plan
              is inadequate.</p>
              <p>Premier Taxi managing director, Mr Lim Chong Boo, said:
              "During the peak, there would not be enough taxis even if we
              doubled the fleet."</p>
              <p>He said dynamic pricing "is a Grab initiative, and as a
              business partner, we are supporting it".</p>
              <p>The new format will give commuters another alternative
              to secure a cab, he added.</p>
              <p>"It'll also allow taxi drivers some levelling of the
              playing field," said Mr Lim, referring to cabbies complaining they
              are losing business to private-hire drivers due to the rigid fare
              surcharge system taxis must adhere to.</p>
              <p>Trans-Cab managing director, Mr Teo Kiang Ang, said he
              was keen to roll out dynamic pricing, "but the PTC asked us to hold
              on".</p>
              <p>Asked why the council's approval had to be sought since
              taxi fares have been deregulated since 1998, a PTC spokesman would
              only say: "PTC and Land Transport Authority will jointly review the
              applications."</p>
              <p>Observers reckon the Government is waiting for market
              leader ComfortDelGro - which controls more than 60 per cent of
              taxis here - to make a move before making a decision.</p>
              <p>Two weeks ago, ComfortDelGro's chief executive of taxi
              business, Mr Yang Ban Seng, said: "We would love to do surge
              pricing, but I don't think we are allowed to."</p>
              <p>Assistant Professor Yang Nan of the National University
              of Singapore Business School's strategy and policy department said
              taxi firms may actually lose some competitive advantage as "people
              prefer conventional cabs because there is more certainty in their
              fares".</p>
              <p>"If everything is too similar, it will boil down to
              price competition. And the taxi companies do not have the advantage
              of these other players," he said, adding that the latter "have deep
              pockets and money to burn, and they can press down fares".</p>
              <p>SIM University economist Walter Theseira said: "On the
              one hand, it is a good idea to have better responsiveness. But the
              risk is it will be next to impossible to get a street hail.</p>
              <p>"This may be a transitional concern though. If people
              move entirely over to getting a taxi via an app, then it won't be a
              concern any more."</p>
              <p>Grab would not comment when contacted yesterday.</p>

              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>He was responding to the debate over the operators’ plans to implement dynamic pricing for their fare structures in a Facebook post.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Last week, Prime Taxi, Premier Taxis and Transcab said they submitted their plans for dynamic pricing to the Public Transport Council (PTC), while ComfortDelgro, the biggest player here, submitted plans for a flat fare structure. PTC said it is currently reviewing the proposals.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>In his Facebook post, Mr Ng noted that commuters who book their taxis through mobile apps could have one more option: They can choose the current option with metered fares, or a new option using dynamic pricing, and the rate is agreed upon before the trip begins.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“We understand that some commuters may be uncomfortable with the taxi companies’ plans. This initial reaction is not unexpected. However, those who prefer not to use this new option can still choose to pay for a booked taxi by the meter. Likewise for street-hail commuters, where dynamic pricing does not apply.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>He said that competition from ride-sharing services Uber and Grab means this “will likely keep fares reasonable”, adding that the taxi operators are doing this to better compete with private hire cars, which are at liberty to increase fares during peak hours and hence earn more.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“Taxi companies should ensure that dynamic pricing improves and not worsens the matching of supply to demand of taxi services,” Mr Ng said.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Transport experts noted that an arrangement which allows for both flexible and metered fares may distort the taxi supply during peak hours for commuters.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Transport expert Dr Walter Theseira, a senior lecturer at SIM University, said: “There is no incentive for a driver to take a metered fare when flexible-fare surge pricing is in effect. The probable result will be that quality of service will be severely degraded for commuters who do not wish to pay flexible fares during surge pricing periods.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>National University of Singapore transport analyst Professor Lee Der Horng added: “The danger is that during peak hours it will be even more difficult to hail down a taxi at the roadside. If passengers reject surge pricing and still opt for the meter rate, I do not know if the driver may find reasons to reject the bookings.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Both experts felt that the flexible fare system goes against the spirit of public service that taxis provide.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Prof Lee felt that the general availability of taxis “should be assured”, as they are part of the public transport system here.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Dr Theseira said: “If it (dynamic pricing) helps the taxi industry, that is desirable, but the LTA (Land Transport Authority) also has to consider the operational impact on commuters, particularly those who may be unable or unwilling to use dynamic pricing.”</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Commuters booking a taxi through ride-hailing app Grab will soon have more certainty about their fares, though those fares will also be subject to a new pricing system that would increase them during periods of high demand.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">The Straits Times understands that the ride-hailing firm will be rolling out a new service, called JustGrab, that will provide its users with fixed upfront fares when booking a taxi.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">These fixed fares will take into account travel time, booking fees, as well as any location- and time-based surcharges. Grab users are currently able to view upfront the cost of a private-hire GrabCar ride, which is a fixed price.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">But they can view only the estimated cost of a taxi ride, as it is based on the metered fare.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">The new fixed fares for taxis will, however, be subject to dynamic fares - also known as surge pricing - in which prices increase during periods of high demand.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">These changes were spelt out in a document that Grab will be issuing to cabbies, seen by The Straits Times.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Private-hire car services offered by Grab and Uber are already subject to surge pricing - making them generally cheaper during the off-peak hours but more expensive than metered taxis when demand is high. It is not known when the new system will come into effect.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Grab declined comment when contacted yesterday.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">The Straits Times reported last week that Trans-Cab and Premier Taxi were working with Grab on plans to implement dynamic pricing.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">ComfortDelGro, the largest taxi operator here, confirmed it had also written to the Public Transport Council regarding plans to implement its own dynamic pricing.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">National Taxi Association executive adviser Ang Hin Kee said that while dynamic pricing could help cabbies earn more, it was important that taxi fares remained "competitive", compared with those of private-hire cars during peak periods.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Commuters said surge pricing could drive them to look for alternatives.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Digital director Ameera Begum, 29, said it would provide "no incentive" to turn to Grab taxis over a private-hire ride.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">In a Facebook post yesterday, Second Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng said that it was "not unexpected" that some commuters would be uncomfortable with the introduction of dynamic pricing.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">"However, those who prefer not to use this new option can still choose to pay for a booked taxi by the meter," he said, adding that dynamic pricing would not apply for street hires.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Mr Ng also noted that supply and demand would determine whether fares would be higher or lower under dynamic pricing.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">"Taxi companies should ensure that dynamic pricing improves and not worsens the matching of supply to demand of taxi services," he said, adding that the matter would be discussed further during the Transport Ministry's budget debates later this week.</p>

It shows their commitment towards their workers, and it is very strategic.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>"It will put some pressure on their competitor, Uber, to do something similar."</p>

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>"None of the gig economy platforms seem to be profitable. Their model is costly and labour intensive," he said.</p>

              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>"To sustain the Medisave programme, it has to come from their revenue, which they may not have," he said.</p>

Businesses should put the interest of their workers first."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>Mr Steven Meng, 47, a full-time GrabCar driver, currently makes 50 to 70 trips a week. But he is motivated to hit 80 to get the Medisave contribution.</p>

              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Although she got off to a “shaky” start as a Grab driver, she turned full-time after about nine months, when she realised that she could make enough, after including the incentives she gets from the ride-hailing platform.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Many youths, such as Ms Chen, 30, have turned to driving for Grab and Uber as a lucrative full-time job or an easy way to supplement their incomes outside their day jobs. But choosing to do so full-time carries some downsides for youths, as the job does not add to their resumes, observers said.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>While driving for private-hire services may be a viable source of income for some, they do not have benefits such as Central Provident Fund contributions and medical leave, they added.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>About 20 to 30 per cent of GrabCar drivers here are younger than 30, although the company’s country head for Singapore, Mr Lim Kell Jay, said in an interview with TODAY last month that an “extremely small” number do it as their primary source of income.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>At Uber Singapore, a quarter of its drivers are below 30, said general manager Warren Tseng, adding that many chose to become drivers to pursue their financial goals, such as funding their higher education and supporting their families.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>SIM University labour economist Walter Theseira said relying too heavily on driving for a private-hire service could harm a young person’s career prospects in the long term. It does not boost their resumes meaningfully and provides few transferable skills.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“The short-term wages ... may be good, but there are long-run effects on the worker’s employability and income security,” Dr Theseira said.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>He expects the new Private Hire Car Drivers’ Vocational Licence regime — applications open on Monday (March 13) — to deter those who intend to drive for hire on an occasional basis “because licensing introduces a large fixed cost not just in terms of the licence and training fees, but also in time required”.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Member of Parliament (Ang Mo Kio GRC) Ang Hin Kee noted that the majority of Grab and Uber drivers drive to earn a secondary income, and could be transient. Most taxi drivers, by contrast, are full-time hirers, said the National Taxi Association executive adviser, noting that the minimum age for cabbies — 30 — came about as the Government wanted to encourage people to explore other careers before turning to driving a cab.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“You’re really comparing different working people’s preferences,” he added.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Tampines GRC MP Desmond Choo, who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Manpower, said the bigger issue for young private-hire drivers was underemployment — not landing jobs commensurate with their training. But he conceded that what they had studied in school may also not land them jobs that they want or that pay well enough to meet their needs.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>To reduce this problem, Mr Choo suggested that career counselling services could be expanded, for instance. While younger drivers should not be denied the option of supplementing their income to support their families, Mr Choo said there was a limit to the amount they could earn and the pool of drivers would shrink over time as public transport evolves, with the rise of driverless technology. “For job security, we should want to plan for their longer-term (needs),” he added.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Ms Chen acknowledged that she does not always get a stable income driving for Grab. She recalled how she was forced off working for a week because of an illness once, but still had to continue paying rental.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>But the flexibility of the job was a draw. “(I don’t) need to jam in the train (or) the bus, and will not be scolded if I’m late for work,” she said.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Ms Chen takes home an average of S$6,000 a month — after deducting car rental and petrol, as well as Grab’s 20 per cent cut — by driving every day, for about nine hours.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>To qualify for incentives, the structures of which change weekly, Grab drivers must have a good driver rating, a low cancellation record and a high rate of accepting trips that are broadcast to them.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>Uber, on the other hand, allows its drivers to multiply their fares with a “guaranteed boost” for all trips in specific areas with high demand at certain times.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>For some, like father-of-two Jason Teo, 28, it is a matter of finding an extra stream of income to upkeep his family’s monthly expenses of about S$6,000, for which his full-time job as a sales executive alone cannot support. His wife stays home to take care of their children, aged one month and two years.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>He drives about three hours after each workday and a full Saturday or Sunday.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>He said: “(It’s) still manageable ... as long as you’re willing to drive and earn the money.”</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>For Ms Valerie Ho, 29, driving a private-hire car was an interim job option. After taking a break in 2012 to complete a pastry and bakery diploma, the former Traffic Police officer decided to apply for a return to the force. To earn some income while waiting for word from her former employer, she turned to driving with Uber part-time, but switched to full-time under Grab about three months ago.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>She earns about S$600 a week now after deducting fuel and rental costs, but acknowledged that it could be higher.</p>
              <p style='margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: "Benton Modern RE", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;'>“Sometimes I’ll be lazy ... (but it’s) definitely a daily source of income,” she said, adding that she will stop driving for Grab once she secures her former job.</p>
