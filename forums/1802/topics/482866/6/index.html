              Smartphone is become saturated, even samsung are report slow sales, and both Iphone and samsung know that there is a need to re innovate newer kind of smartphone, not just increasing the size and better functions which I bet most Taxi uncle also never use, or like me,, dunno how to use...

              This is not a right? this is a business, gentlemen, the time has changed, 
              
              One of the reason Cdg previously do not put destination because of this issue, they consulted their corporate lawyers and the decision was not to put destination so the pax can hv the luxury of saying 2 to 3 or even 4 destination without an issue, if cabby do not take, lim kopi, this one I agree.
              
              But today, the tide had change, due to apps competition, cdg has no other choice but to put destination, so for a typical cdg driver, he received a bid call to clark quay, just one destination, but when he pick up the pax, the pax demand, go balestier, than newton then go clark Quay.  
              
              Do you think you can reject him??? In business sense, yes, there is no way cdg can take you on with just a destination of Clark Quay, lai lai lim kopi, I dun mind to tell cdg off, can get their lawyer to sue me, and if they pok me, sure I will sue them, you dispose a job with only a destination but end up with so many other destination, am I right to reject??
              
              Think it over, dun be fool by cdg...they are not king

            <div class='col-md body'>
              And all this are on yr MDT, black and white,  if I am going to change shift, you put an on call for clark quay that gum me, I press it, but when reached, hv to go here and there, then how? I got no time, so in any word, you are misleading cabby. 
              
              But if the call come with a destination clark quay, and a below note saying
              Pax require pick up friend at balestier and newton...ah, this one will be different if you reject it upon successfully bidded for it.
              
              Now, in business sense, you order a plate of laksa, waiter write it down, you cannot come back and fxxk the waiter that he did not give you mee siam and lotong with the laksa...so, please, know your RIGHT, dun be scare of lim kopi, if you know yr right, cdg are more scare of you

              <p>Well before I come the pax is aware I am a Kimgu. The apps show the type of taxi and the GPS location of the taxi. So if the caller registered with the App fucked me well I will give a negative feedback of this pax and made a police report. Just move on and look for another pax. Why bother ? </p>

              I had been once thru this since cdg started with destination, not me, but helped a cabby out of company before LTA step in, I agree that with the same pax, you hv to agree to his request if he still stay on the cab, but the key here is, there are new pax.
              
              LTA ruling is simple, as long as the same pax is in the cab without dropping off or picking up anyone, he can request you to change destination without a stop and start fare.
              
              So for this guy, his pax drop off at a condo, asked him to wait, came down, cabby start new fare...now the ruling stated that as long as the same pax without dropping off, pax complained, cdg send voucher, guy went to LTA, no problem, because his cam show pax moving off and return. 
              
              As I said many times, the best is to communicate with pax, eg
              
              Pax saying going to aspen condo, reach already requested you to wait, he need to take something and go to tiong bahru plaza. You tell pax, you pay first, later start new fare, pax not happy, nevermind, end the journey, paid and move off, pax said ok, carry on. 
              
              We must understand the key word here..the word is "REQUEST" under the laws, this is a question, not a die die must do, you can reject it. Like you request a girl for dinner, the girl can reject you or accept it.
