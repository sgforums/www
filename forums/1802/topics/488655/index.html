              <p>2000 years ago, those who are smart started a religion. Those who are brave founded a nation. Both have to lie in order to achieve their goals. The first one talk about heaven and hell. The second one used the ancient art of war where deception is an important strategy.</p>
              <p>2000 years later, the smart people become billionaires or got themselves elected as pm or president. The brave started their own mafia organisations or sacrificed themselves as soldiers for their country. Its no longer possible to start a new religion and almost impossible to found a new country. Again deception and lies are involved in order to govern as a president or pm of a country, or to run an mafia.</p>
              <p>2000 years from now, the human race will be exploring other planets and will face aliens smarter and even more deceitful than any human race. Hopefully by then, people will wake up their fucking idea and understand that when u die, it is the end. There is no karma, no retribution, no heaven, no hell, no god, no ghost and no spirit.</p>
              <p>The only constant is that humans like to believe a lie and they lie to advance their cause. Humans got great capacity to imagine things.</p>

              No doubt religion control the minds, however, it do teaches the good and humanity, I think even if we do not believe or choose not to believe, we still need to appreciate, respect and accept the good that it teaches. 
                  
              Human in our animal state is named as the Homo Saipen, we are consider the most smart animal in this planet, most wild, cunning and cruel and also have a never satisfied or contended mind. 
                  
              Therefore religion of different sect had in a way found it way to calm one mind or soul, nevermind if there is god or no god, hell or no hell, heaven or no heaven, the key is it help to civilise the Homo Saipen. Human in a nutshell needs leader, like animal instinct, we migrate, we form group, we challenge for territories, we protect our own, and we attack when get agitated.
                  
              Most ancient rulers understood the significant of religion in calming the human soul, same goes to LKY, he understood that religion existence is critical for culture, human needs and belonging, therefore he allow an open society of believe, but whatever you believe, do not go to the extreme and become an extremist, seek only the middle way

              We take a look at our ex chief, a leader, some TDs followed him because they agreed to his method of driving and need a leader like him, there is nothing wrong about it, and when thing is not getting good enough whereby the comfort zone is diminishing, he shift, he move, he migrate, and along with his herd of TDs, they go from TC, to silver to SMRT, and when in group, they are happy mingling amond each other.

              Many of us hv failed to appreciate what we have now, look around you, you got a job, a good family, a strong dollars, a govt that is no that good but better than most other countries. 
              The past is for us to learn, because it shape what is we are today
              The Present is important to us as we are presently in it, learn to enjoy it, appreciate it and smile because the present is a Present for YOU.
              The future is unpredictable, however, we can influence and shape it by our action today in the Present. 
              
              So, if you are just a layman TDs, dun need to think so much lah, let tomorrow worries by itself

              <p>I fully agree that the main contribution about religion is that people use it to stay calm and find meaning in life. There are so many kinds of religions to suit different tastes. Just like we have a buffet of food, drink, whores, spouses, schools, careers, homes and cars to choose from.</p>
              <p>Imagine a simple slipper. $2 type can liao mah. But some people like me cannot, must be $600 LV slipper than satisifed.</p>
              <p>For a slipper, we cannot say $2 better or $600 type better. Same thing for religion. Just too bad some type of religion will point a gun at u to convert and point a gun at u if u run away. This kind of pattern works 2000 years ago. KNN now still want to try and force people convert and start a new country.</p>
              <p>So everything got good got bad. U want religion can. But some religion teach u to kill people, kill children and get children to kill more people. It becomes a cancer. And we know that when u got stage 4 cancer, its call ITE. Its the end. This planet earth is like one patient who got cancer somewhere. Now its spreading to many places. To stop this shit, every country must unite to fight them, otherwise this planet will completely turn black.</p>

              You see my brother, everything happen have a reason behind it, eg, if there is no christianity, do you think there will be IMuslim? of course we all know that ISIS is no good, but ask yourself a firm question, then why so many volunteer to fight for them? 
              
              Because there is an inequality in the world we live in, if that inequality is deem to be too wide, social ill occur, and when that happened, peoples at the wrong side of the inequal equation, will and shall be easily be mobilised in force to repel it.
              
              Eg, if the american/west is to share the gains, the humanity and leave the muslim or arab in peace instead of puppeting on their rulers so as to get a large share of Oil for their own gain and yet manipulative their politics from the watergate case to the egypt..Iraq war on the assumption of nuclear weapons and so on, do you think ISIS will exist, or there will be al qaeda in this world?
              
              There it is a social political problem, if you look at those founder or builder of a country, from Mao to stalin to ho chih ming to LKY to kublai khan and so on, they build the country or an empire base on a strong reason that can mobilise the majority of peoples of the nation into believing in a do or die situation.
              
              Mao lead the poor farmer, LKY lead the colonial servants against the proud colonial govt, Khan led the monggol against the arrogant rich hans and so on...
              
              And that is why Singapore govt today are smarter, they make sure everyone hv a house, a job, a family and 3 basic meals, with that, the social ill will be erased or at least reduced
