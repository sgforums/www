              SINGAPORE - Two women, who assaulted a taxi driver, were each sentenced to six weeks' jail on Thursday .
               
              Stall assistant Li Li, 40, admitted punching cabby Shah Kamariza Raja Abdul Razak on the face while beautician Fan Xiling, 34, pleaded guilty to kicking the 36-year-old's thigh in Toa Payoh North on March 14 this year.
               
              A court heard that Mr Shah Kamariza picked up the two women - both Singapore permanent residents from China - from Peace Centre at about 1am. They requested to go to Block 204 Toa Payoh North and then to Fernvale in Sengkang.
              
              After reaching Block 204, Li alighted to collect some items from a friend.
               
              While waiting for her to return, Fan told the driver she wanted to smoke. She then wound down the taxi window and lit a cigarette.
               
              The cabby told her he did not allow anyone to smoke in his taxi, and if she wanted to, she should alight and pay the taxi fare of $15.
               
              Fan then alighted without paying the fare and crossed the road. The cabby chased her, pulled her and asked her to pay the taxi fare.
               
              Li returned and joined the dispute.
               
              A taxi driver passing by tried to intervene and also told Fan that passengers were not allowed to smoke in taxis. Fan retorted that if she could not smoke in the taxi, she would not pay the fare.
               
              When Mr Shah Kamariza was calling the police, Fan kicked his thigh while Li punched him on the face and body multiple times.
               
              When he moved backwards and tried to block their attacks, the two women started pulling his shirt and it tore.
               
              A 31-year-old motorist saw the commotion and used his cell phone to record the incident.
               
              Fan took off one of her heeled shoes and tried to hit Mr Shah Kamariza's head with it. The taxi driver wedged himself between the victim and the two women, helping the victim to block off the duo's further advances. Li and Fan shouted vulgarities at the victim and tried to stop the motorist from recording the incident.
               
              They could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000.

              <p> </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">You'd think that commuting in this day and age would be safe, given how connected we are thanks to technology, but you couldn't be more wrong. Well, at least that's what the numbers say.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">According to an article in The Straits Times in January this year, the number of molestation cases reported in Singapore rose from 1,325 in 2013 to 1,367 in 2014. The number of reports of molestation on public transport increased from 154 in 2013 to 164 in 2014.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Perverts on public transport aside, women also have to worry about the brazen acts of sexual harassment that are taking place within one of our favourite modes of transport - the taxi. We're more vulnerable in cabs, because we're usually alone and the driver can (in a worst-case scenario) lock the doors.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">In March this year, a cabbie was jailed nine months for molesting two of his passengers. One was forced to alight from the cab and drink a couple of beers with him in a secluded area, after which he tried to hug and kiss her. She didn't try to flee as she was afraid that he would harm her.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The other fell asleep in the back seat after a night of drinking and awoke to find him rubbing her left breast. He continued to touch her breasts while she was throwing up.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">When situations like these arise, we're usually too shocked to protect ourselves. Here's an action plan to follow, should you ever encounter the chee ko pek (Hokkien for dirty old man) cabbie.</p>

              Six City Harvest Church (CHC) leaders found guilty of misusing church funds last month were all sentenced to jail on Friday.
               
              In court Friday afternoon after hearing final arguments earlier in the day, judge See Kee Oon gave the heaviest sentence â€“ eight years in prison â€“ to church co-founder and deputy senior pastor Kong Hee.
               
              Chew Eng Han, Kong, John Lam, Sharon Tan, Tan Ye Peng and Serena Wee were convicted last month of criminal breach of trust involving S$24 million and using S$26.6 million to cover it up in a bid to boost the pop music career of Kongâ€™s wife, Sun Ho, in the US.
               
              Former finance manager Sharon Tan got the lightest sentence of 21 months in jail.
               
              Ex-finance committee member Lam was sentenced to three years in jail, former finance manager Wee to five years, deputy pastor Tan Ye Peng to five years and six months, and former CHC fund manager Chew to six years.
               
              The sentencing follows a 140-day trial â€” one of the longest in Singapore â€” that came to a close in September when the prosecution and lawyers for the accused made their final submissions to the court.

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">He said that many passengers in the taxi queue were not willing to take the 'premium' taxis. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">A lady was asked to alight from a taxi just because she was breastfeeding.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">This incident happened at last week, around 5.16pm in the afternoon.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">A lady, Rafidah, took to the internet to rant about the unfairness she has faced.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">According to reports by <a style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #337ab7; background-color: transparent;" href="http://www.wanbao.com.sg/local/story20151125-69357#local">Lianhe Wanbao</a>, Rafidah boarded the taxi and was putting on breastfeeding accesories.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Upon noticing that part of her breasts were exposed, the taxi driver repeatedly asked her if she was breastfeeding.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Eventually, Rafidah was asked to alight and board another taxi.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">When asked how she felt, Rafidah mentioned that she is angry and hurt, and that she feels discriminated against.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">According to her, she was properly covered at that point of time, and there was no way any indecent exposure could have happened.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">While she was alighting from the taxi, the taxi driver also allegedly attributed his actions to religious views.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The driver claimed that breastfeeding in the taxi is unacceptable because there were statues for worship in there.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">However, Rafidah feels that breastfeeding does not clash with any religious views.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Earlier this year in June, Wanbao has also reported on a lady who was asked to alight from the MRT because she was breastfeeding. </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">The lady ignored the passers-by, but they complained to the SMRT staff, and that sparked off a huge debate.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 21.56px; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15.4px;">Wanbao has contacted the relevant taxi company, which has responded by saying that breastfeeding is not an issue so long as women are properly covered, and that investigations are ongoing.</p>

              How come never state the source of de news leh...
              
              Breastfeeding..no problem, I like.
                  
              But sometime can be a distraction, especially those tua neh neh one...wha, how to concentrate on the road...Got once a tua neh neh in my cab also breastfeed her baby, then she dropped her hp, told me to stop, 
              
              I stopped, she pass me the baby, then pick the hp underneath the car seat, wha..I see the tua neh neh, cannot tarhan...hai si lang, then the baby I carried cried and want to suck my nipple...alamak..
              
              So,at times, it can be distracting and intimating, but nevertheless, it is ok to breastfeed in cab, only that mother should not purposely choose to feed their baby in cab so as to save time for shopping or doing other thing, if can, best is to breastfeed at home or at any nursery room provided by most big shopping centres.

              <p>Taxi driver given stern warning for adding unauthorised $3 'HarbourFront' surcharge</p>
              <p>A Comfort taxi driver who imposed an unauthorised surcharge for picking up a passenger at HarbourFront Centre had been given a stern warning. </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - A Comfort taxi driver who imposed an unauthorised surcharge for picking up a passenger at HarbourFront Centre had been given a stern warning, Comfort DelGro told The Straits Times on Wednesday (Dec 23).</p>
              <p>The passenger had posted on the Hardware Zone online forum that he boarded the cab on Monday at the HarbourFront Centre taxi stand, just outside the mall's McDonald's outlet.</p>
              <p>He added that he frequently takes taxis from HarbourFront Centre, but Monday's incident was the first time a surcharge was added to his fare.</p>
              <p>A receipt posted by him showed that the 10.4km trip cost $11.15, but a $3 surcharge for a pick-up at Changi Airport was added to it, bumping the fare to $14.15.</p>
              <p>"I did ask (the driver) about the $3 surcharge when I was paying him, giving him one last chance to explain or retract it. But he insisted that pick-ups at HarbourFront Centre have a $3 surcharge and asked me to check for myself," the passenger said, adding that he had alerted Comfort DelGro and the Land Transport Authority about the incident.</p>
              <p>Checks with Comfort DelGro confirmed that there are no surcharges for pick-ups at HarbourFront Centre.</p>
              <p>"In this case, the cabby has been given a stern warning for adding in an unauthorised surcharge in the final metered fare. We have apologised and will be refunding the passenger," said Comfort DelGro's group corporate communications officer Tammy Tan.</p>
