              So, even if he was a ex taxi driver, it could be only for 5 years, and during those 5 years, could had run from cdg to TC to smrt..., therefore I would said that, for him if he is to go on for 10 years, he might had driven for all companies including grab and uber liao.

              <p>I returned the money purse of a passenger before.   Really waste of money and time but have to do it.   Drive all the way to 383, put one parking coupon, and spent some time waiting and going through the procedure.</p>
              <p>Best thing is customer "Zhi Dong" dont leave anything behind otherwise really cause us to waste a lot of money.  Spending 1 hour handling this matter is like losing $15-$30 dollars.</p>
              <p>One time one customer that I fetched claimed that I took his mobile phone or tablet and reported to police when I did not even see it.   I ended up wasting 2 hours driving to the police station and going through the procedure.   I even ended up having to pay an additional parking fine despite putting parking coupon because the car park near the police station was fully occupied and I parked in a non-parking space that I could sequeezed into. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">One such person cost me more than $100.</span></p>

              Firstly, when pax lost something, it is pax problem, not your problem.
              
              Secondly, if pax call you to bring back, if you think it will cut yr into your fare, tell pax that you will charge by meter fare in going back because first rule apply, pax lost thing is pax fault.
              
              3rdly, if pax said, do not want to pay, you just tell pax to go to office lost and found dept to collect.
              
              and/....
              
              4thly, if pax call police, do not get panic, there is no charges yet, tell police that you will come after you finish yr business.

              <p>As a new driver, I would probably use the GPS (Marbella) for many trips (even if client says will guide) just in case.  To beat the 6 months evaluation, can just be a super relief for 6 months to reduce the chances of complaints.</p>

              <p>I realised that alot of TDs kana assaulted and when the culprit eventually gets charged, the TDs gets very little compensation only.  WTH man... TDs life really so damn cheap meh?  I've not seen yet TDs sue culprit for damages... is it because TDs are poor and cannot afford lawyer or their status / earnings low so amount awarded is low???</p>
              <p>Knn... next time for election candidates criteria, I want to recommend all must have TVDL and drive minimum 1 year as TD before they can qualify as candidate.</p>
