              who ar?? who knock into bugis shop???
              
              As I said before, be it grab, uber or taxi...at the end of the day, we can fight over this and that, but the biggest competitor is innovation and automation such as driverless will come into the picture and put us all into a big shit hole, be it uber, grab or taxis.
              
              So, my advice to TDs, Uber or Grab drivers, if can, learn or master another trade thru your skilfuture credit, or under WIS or WDA scheme, the new emerging market and economy is digitalization and robotic/automation. All these are IT related, go into and learn the basic, so that when they need people to control the driverless vehicle, you will be very much needed, valued and employed.

              <p>Good hearted nice guys normally give people benefit of doubt.  </p>
              <p>Not that they are stupid.  </p>
              <p>This <span style="line-height: 1.231;">one small amount; this uncle can take it.   If it is me, I straight away go and find another customer than go to police to waste time as I could make more during that period of time.</span></p>
              <p>Every 10000 customers you fetch in Singapore, how many would run fare?</p>
              <p>Most of the reported incidents of people running fares are young girls and young ladies.   So we should give them less benefit of doubts.</p>
              <p>I always look at customers before deciding whether to give them the benefits of doubts.   I always trust CISCO officers.   Sometimes people don't leave items in taxi, I also let them do so.</p>
              <p>Howcome younger girls and ladies run fare more often than others?   Must be because they haven't started working, don't like to take buses or spent too much money on clothes and makeups.</p>

Mr Sim wound down his window and asked what Lek was gesturing about. Lek got out of his car and swore at Mr Sim, who drove off when the traffic light turned green.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Lek then got into his car and chased after the taxi.</p>

He then punched the cabby a few times on the left side of his head.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Mr Sim drove to Woodlands East Neighbourhood Police Centre, as Lek continued to punch him on the back of his head.</p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">"I want to show cancer patients - especially children - that they have our support. They really need our encouragement. They need to know that they are not alone," she said.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Ms Kee was one of 165 ComfortDelGro cabbies who took part in CabbyCare Charity Group's Hair for Hope event on Wednesday (June 8).</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">She and fellow cabby Kirsty Foo, 56, are the first two female cabbies ever to join ComfortDelGro in this cause. They and other cabbies shaved their heads at the event, held at the Orchid Country Club.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">This is the third time ComfortDelgro is taking part in Hair for Hope. Response from cabbies has risen from 60 participants in 2015.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">About 50 companies have pledged their support for the Children's Cancer Foundation (CCF) this year. Hair For Hope aims to have 6,500 shavees, and to raise a total of $36 million.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">CabbyCare has raised a total of $20,000 with its Hair for Hope event. ComfortDelGro will match the cabbies' contributions dollar for dollar, to make it $40,000 for the CCF.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">While some women may find it hard to go bald the two female cabbies were all smiles after their heads were shorn.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">"Whatever hair we lose will grow back. But the health of those patients won't get better as easily. This is nothing compared to what the children and the other cancer patients have to go through," said Ms Kee.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Rohan Dhanarajan, 13, a student at Bowen Secondary School, joined the cabbies to show his support, too.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">"I cannot imagine someone of my age going through such pain. So going bald for the children with cancer is just my way of supporting them," he said.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">Together with his grandfather - cabby Kanapathy Shunmugam, 64 - he has been shaving his head for Hair for Hope for the past seven years.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;">"When children with cancer lose their hair, it can break their self-confidence. By us shaving our heads it shows them that it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's okay to be bald," said Rohan.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.1429px;"> </p>

              To be frank, most inside comfort office are a lian, ah huay, ah kau and ah seng type, and the moment you walk out of the office, they will gossip and laugh at you, the taxi driver. 
              
              The term COMFORT do not imply having a comfortable taxi ride, it is mend more for those in their office to have a comfort working life.
              
              If you ask the public, or simply do a survey of 100 peoples, Just by asking them
              "Do you find comfort in taking comfort delgro taxi?" 99% will tell you Bullshit..some even might fark you.

              <p>To be frank, most inside comfort office are a lian, ah huay, ah
              kau and ah seng type, and the moment you walk out of the office,
              they will gossip and laugh at you, the taxi driver.</p>
              <p>The term <span>COMFORT</span> do not imply having a
              comfortable taxi ride, it is mend more for those in their office to
              have a comfort working life.</p>
              <p>If you ask the public, or simply do a survey of 100 peoples,
              Just by asking them<br> “Do you find comfort in taking comfort delgro taxi?” 99% will tell
              you Bullshit..some even might fark you.</p>

              <p>Bro, Comfort also means comfortable rides for passengers lah.   If AC not cold enough, during servicing tell mechanic sure make it cold for you one (otherwise you can argue with someone in Comfort not cold AC how to have comfort in the car for passengers).   If seats' fake leader in bad shape, also would make it good for you.   However, sometimes they would not do the job if your car is due for scrapping soon.</p>
              <p>I told the mechanics AC not cold during the very hot period and they fixed it.  After that, customers always asked me to lower the AC at night.   My AC can reach as low as 16 deg celcius at night and in early morning.   Day time if parked under hot sun can reach 60 deg celcius but can cool down very fast to acceptable level very fast if got let hot air flow out first.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Talking about the admin people, don't know why they changed the uniforms of the ladies there.   Seems like cannot see last time people.   Now with the new uniform, look very unapproachable like people in the bank (like one class above taxi drivers who purposely dress more casually because it is more comfortable that way ).   Last time they dressed humbly making the themselves feel more friendly and approachable to taxi drivers and potential taxi drivers.</p></div>

              <p>Ai ya, I was only referring to the previous pink color shirt uniform.....very conservative pattern but very feministic color.......where got show quarter ball ....where got tight skirt.</p>
              <p>Where got time to specially go to 383 to see them?   Every trip there means money lost due to 50-cent parking coupon (you know very hard to get parking space) and loss income because have to specially drive there.   Personally I would not specially go there unless to put items at "Lost and Found", top up and go to Complains handling department.   You know how much you would lose (how many plates of chicken rice) if you waste 45 minutes going there.</p>

              Brother, there are about 1/4 of taxi drivers in Singapore are just driving to pass time, they have long passed the official retirement and are just plying on the road so as to keep them active and busy and also, of course to provide just a daily expenses, like me.
              
              So of course we got lots of time to beo here and there mah, I sometime only do market aunties trips...even tho got people holding luggage going to airport,  I also siam and let those who need to bring up a young family driver to take.
              
              So, sometime, we got nothing to do, go sin ming office play play, TCSS, visit former DRO who are now top executives..then hope to get free fish head curry...
