            <div class='col-md body'>"THREE ComfortDelGro cabbies were caught on Monday evening trying to avoid passengers, in a surprise check by the company's officers.<br>Two were parked along a road when they should have been on the move and a third did not turn into a taxi stand. They were all apparently holding out for phone bookings that would earn them an extra $4.<br><br>ComfortDelGro, the largest taxi operator here, carried out checks on more than 2,600 of its cabs between 4pm and 8pm on Monday. The vast majority did stop to pick up passengers, the company said, and the three offending drivers have since been advised not to avoid passengers.<br><br>The checks were a response to calls from passengers for service to improve now that taxi companies have raised flagdown fares and the peak period surcharge.<br><br>Smart, the last of seven cab companies to announce fare changes, is raising its fares in line with the rest on Aug 1.<br><br>ComfortDelGro's manager for fleet admin service, Mr Lee Choo Kin, said Monday's checks were called after complaints from the public that cabbies were waiting until the start of the peak period at 5pm before plying the roads.<br><br>It previously carried out checks at Suntec City as well as places like Shenton Way and the Singapore Turf Club. In the last six months, it has caught about 170 errant cabbies.<br><br>When The Straits Times tagged along for Monday's checks, 12 plainclothes ComfortDelGro officers were stationed near three taxi stands around Suntec City, taking down licence numbers of empty cabs that passed by without stopping at the taxi stands.<br><br>Mr Lee said these licence numbers would be checked against a computer system to find out if the cabbies subsequently received a call booking in the same area.<br><br>Errant cabbies are sent a note saying they should turn into the taxi stand to pick up passengers. Repeat offenders are disciplined.<br><br>The majority of ComfortDelGro's cabs have automated tamper-proof rooftop signs. The system allows them to turn on the 'On Call' sign only if they have received a call booking and prevents them taking a call booking when they turn on the 'Busy' sign.<br><br>Passengers like financial analyst Serene Tan, 37, and sales assistant Chloris Lim, 35, complain that it is hard to get a cab at Suntec City after 8.30pm.<br><br>Said Ms Lim: 'The cabbies like to hide. A lot of office people call for a cab.'<br><br>Passengers said one popular drivers' hideout is the area near Benjamin Sheares Bridge. ComfortDelGro has conducted checks there, Mr Lee said, and pointed out that cabbies could be taking a breather there and not waiting for call bookings.<br><br>The Straits Times conducted its own check on the taxi stand near Carrefour, between Towers Three and Four from 8.35pm to 9pm on Monday.<br><br>More than 20 cabs from all seven taxi companies passed by the taxi stand without stopping, even though about 10 people were waiting in line at any one time. It took 13 minutes to get a cab.<br><br>ComfortDelGro said it does checks at all times of the day and night and is stepping up enforcement. SMRT said it conducts random enforcement checks at least twice a week."<br><br>(Straits Times, July 19)<br><br>With new roof-top signs, can just stand near taxi stand and photograph taxis that fail to turn in...submit the photos and complain to LTA...catch all errant drivers.<br><br></div>
