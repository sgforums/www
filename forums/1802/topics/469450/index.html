              <p>Good advice by Bowah...</p>
              <p>Humans all have the same mentality, all of them have a tendency to commit the same sin. This sin named ENVY or Jealousy.</p>
              <p>Just like for example, I am a TD, my sec sch friend is a Sales Director a at MNC, another friend is a businessman, and everyone seems to be better doing than me.. Sure I will envy them.</p>
              <p>then maybe, one day all of us have gathering, then this Sales Director come and ask cigarette from me, then when paying bill time, this businessman friend k Siao go toilet blah blah blah... Knn... All better than me then how come still take advantage??? Then the story or å¿ƒç—… will start... Haizzz...</p>
              <p>tale it easy... There are still some people who are just happy with their lots and these people are really the happiest people.</p>
              <p>ever wondered why news rate ingaporeans as an unhappy lot? Because all of us are always trying to outdo each other blah blah lah... Take it easy...</p>
