              <p>I just wrote to the papers regarding the incident and wonder would it be published.</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #00ffff;"><span style="color: #000080;">Dear Editor,<br><br>    I am writing in today to relate a recent unhappy encounter with a cab driver.<br><br>    My friends and I were at the T junction of Bukit Pasoh and Neil road waiting for cab. I tried to call to book a cab and was successful. Since we had already got a cab on booking, my friend decided to try to hail for a cab for the ladies that was waiting right across the street as they had been there for quite sometime and still failed to hail down a cab.<br><br>    He then managed to hail down a TransCab, license plate number SHB9548Y. He told the driver that we are not in need of getting the cab and he asking the ladies to come over. As he was waving and calling out to the ladies across the street while holding to the open door of the cab, I think I heard the cab driver shouting no repeatedly at my friend.<br><br>    Anyway, the cab driver unbuckled his seat belt, opened the door and got out of his vehicle. He was very agitated and threatened to hit my friend. The ladies was half way across the 3 lane wide road when it happened. I seriously think such actions was really not acceptable. What is the different between picking up us or the ladies? Anyway, he drove like less than 10 meters down the road to pick up another group of guys. I do not really know the exact reason for such outburst but I think it is really something that people in public service line should not do. He could just tell my friend that he would not be providing the ride without having to raise his fists at us.<br><br>    This incident happened on the 19th of February, 3:40am.<br><br>Regards,<br>Caleb Chiang.</span><br></span></em></p>

              In neutral point of view, the cab driver shouldn't choose his customers...
              
              But my personal opinion is that cab drivers are self employed and that means, it's their own business. If they do not want to sell their service or product to a customer, they have the right to do so without the need to explain anything. Personally, I think being cab driver is not a simple job. To complain and try to kill the livelihood of a person simply because he decide to choose his customers, that's abit extreme.
              
              Let's assume it's not right to choose customer, but does it really stress you so much to really want to destroy a person's career. Possibly that person has a family and kids to feed.
              
              It's just my personal opinion that we should be more tolerant of each other, yes people make mistakes and make us angry, but it could have been a case of... A angry, show attitude to B, then make B's day bad, B become angry, show attitude to C, C become agitated and angry, vent his anger at at D. D angry, then vent his anger on...

              <p>First of all, just to clarify, I was in the area with my friends for a drink in pub around the area. If anyone who is in the bukit pasoh area is deemed as pimp and whores, I do not know nerdy can you be.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I already got a cab through booking for me and my friends. That is why my friend decided to try getting a cab for the ladies that was standing across the road who were waiting for quite some time, long before we arrived.</p>
              <p>Perhaps we should had mind'ed our own business and wait for our fare to arrive. But then, shouldn't you too? and mind your own business and stay off the forums? or just read and not post word puke?</p>
              <p>And btw, to sinicker, I think you and your friends had never try that before... trying to get a cab in both direction of the road. =) That is nothing wrong with that, right?</p>
              <p>Btw, it's one thing to reject a ride but raising fists at us? That is really a no-no...</p>
