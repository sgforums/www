              <p>Strange logic, I personally would not become a super-relief is I have the choice between regular hirer or regular relief driver; will earn less money unless of course I 60+ or 70+ then difference case.  </p>
              <p>In any case, it is nice to know there are such people around who do it on a frequent basis.</p>

              Super relief I do before, now sometime also do, there are 2 types of super relief, one is freelance like me, another type is having their names listed with the taxi companies.
              
              Freelance, easy lah, you go with yr own contacts, no sooner you get more and more hirer calling you, so it is up to you to negotiate with regards to the period, the condition, the times and the needs. 
              
              Just like if last minutes call up, surely the price will drop, unless I know hirer is in bad shape and need to go hospital, then maybe I will not reduce the price so drastically, must be compassionate abit mah..tio bo?
              
              For those register with company one...ah..this one got many young guys doing it, price is cut throat price, company will get you the relief, but depend on yr luck, sometime, no relief, and even have, the price is damn low like $60 for sonata per day, leave or take it. 
              
              And they careless who are you, if you said pick up at level 2 Carpark, but the taxi is parked at level 3, they go, cannot find the taxi, will fark off and tell you off. This is their standard. Most super relief are lazy bum, do not wish or want to commit to contract or drive all day like siao lang.

              The only down side of being a super relief is you do not get a regular cab that you get use to it, every few days, another cabs, some good, some damn fark type cab, so you hv to learn to take it, just like there are many fark up hirers, super relief must also learn to endure and absorb those conditions.
              
              On the other hand, low rental is the main perk, other perks include drive and forget, meaning, whatever farkup the hirer or cab is, just tell yourself, drive only a few days, return and forget abt it.

              We super relief also contact each other if got good lobang which the other cannot make it, sometime, also got 2 super reliefs covering one hirer, one morning shift, one night, or one take 10 days, the other take another 10 days.
              
              And it is also important for Hirer to change carparking to relief side, if Hirer do not do what was agreed, relief will just tell company and will not take the cab, so, some hirer go holiday, comeback, taxi no taker, call up company, company said he did not do this and that...

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I suppose the company super-relief also only take full-day jobs only.  Last time, my ex-hirer went on leave, I (day-relief) also had to go on leave too so that a super-relief could takeover the taxi during his absence.  And the super-relief park the taxi at his place until time to hand over.</p></div>

              Many of these super reliefs hv more options in their life, most are freelancer who do job like photographer, agents, bouncer, event teams, tour guides, car downloader (like me previously), contractors, local musician,  blog/forum moderators, durian sellers (off season become super relief) and so on..and some who have so much annual leaves to clear after working so many years.
              
              And of course, there are some, nua type, drive 3 days, rest 4 days type...
