              most fussy and difficult pax? PRC and one local race... dont want to say lah...no need to say also... but got exception
              
              best pax? usually chinese esp guys ... why i like chinese? cos either they tell u upfront which route or they really dont mind... some pax at first say any route and then later complain not ok...they also dont ask what is this $3 surcharge for lah... this and that...when on call, they very fast... chop chop mah...
              
              Ang moh generous with tips and not particular with route.. they like fastest and no jam... long a bit or ERP is ok...but must entertain them at times... a bit tired at times
              
              Malay - usually polite....usually short trips and big group... malay ok lah, but it is just me who dont quite like short trip and noisy ride...
              
              just my observation...no offence meant...

              <p>Frequently get requests,</p>
              <p>"Uncle can you drive faster, I' late for.........".</p>
              <p>"Please wait, my friend haven't come yet.".</p>
              <p>For locals, when they made requests and you comply and at end of journey, not even a word of thanks.  10cents change also must take.</p>
              <p>Ang Mo told me to wait, I waited 15mins, fetched him to airport, $31 fare and he gave me $50 and said keep the change and he said thanks for waiting.</p>
              <p>Ang Mos said they must book into camp at Naval Base at 2359, please hurry. We reached base with 7 mins to spare. They paid using credit card and gave me $20 cash as tips.</p>
              <p>Now when locals made requests like drive faster,  me no 'hue' or ask them to take another taxi. Not the money but their attitude that I dislike. Once I speed for this young man, I kena radar camera from TP on roadside, reached his destination paid his exact fare and quickly disappeared. </p>

              Talking about Ang Mo.... faster, this German lady from Shaw Centre wanted to go German Centre to International Business Park.
              
              Guru ALN...Guess... a test.
               Afternoon.
               She told from here exit Bukit Timah, than exit PIE, than Toh Guan.
              
              Normally which PIE exit, you will take after this kind of instruction from her. If you are so call experience Season Taxi driver.
