              <p>well.. sad to hear that.</p>
              <p>but I did encounter a bad taxi driver before. we were going bukit timah food center from bukit gombak mrt.. then on the cab liao, my friend ask him if he know how to go the fastest, he say he know, but he end up take a long route and bring us up expressway. in addition, we got stuck in the traffic jam.</p>
              <p>according to my friend, it was just a simple u turn and you'll reach in no time? end up we did not pay in full though. we paid 7 bucks for the ride. it's not that we want to scam the taxi driver, but the fare exceed 14 bucks and we're not even at the destination.</p>
              <p>it was the time that we wasted that we were quite frustrated about.</p>

              <p><br>Kin , when u drive a comfort cab , u must be ready to accept cashless payment , big or small amount .</p>
              <p>The reason for him to use amex corporate card was that his taxi fare all can be reimburse , if u are in his shoe , if ur company paying for all ur expenses , u would do the same , right ?</p>
              <p>Then u would only chose Comfort or Citycab cos of their reputation in cashless payment , right ?</p>
              <p>Then u should thank god u earn extra $10 becos of your facility inside ur cab . Other cabbies from other taxi coy can only envy or jealous .</p>
