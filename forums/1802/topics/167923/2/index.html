            <div class='col-md body'>yayaya blame the customer lah.<br><br>Customer's fault lah.....<br><br>Say whatever you want lah,your calculation also only based on your own hypothetic assumption.More than likely it is not 4 passenger per 1 hour but maybe 2 or 3 customer per longer amount of distance.The calculation is way different then.<br><br>My point still stands,since it is decided that the flag down rate is $2.40 ++ $$ per distance travelled.This is the price that taxi operator tell their customers this is the worth for their service provided.If you are not happy,go lobby for the higher rate and when that happens,people will then decided if they want to take a taxi at that higher rate.<br><br>It is like you are going to a hawker center to buy something to eat.The stall tell you that this plate of eg chicken rice is $3.00. Then you jolly well pay only $3.00.Do you hear the hawker saying then that hey this is not enough,and want you to pay extra?You pay for something based on what the seller offered at a price to you,you do not pay for something thinking if this amount let the seller have a decent profit.Since the seller decided to sell at this predetermined price,he better jolly well stick to it and not complain later that he should have sold it at a higher price so that he could have made a more "acceptable profit".<br><br>You said yourself,singaporeans should not be sympathised,so you think the one looking to take a taxi should sympathise with taxi drivers that they do not earn enough profit and give them tips?A Deal is a deal,since a predetermined price is offered already,no sympathy should be in the way,the customer pay according to this predetermined price and not sympathised with you having to pay for high disel and rental price.<br><br>So if you are not earning enough profit,go complain to your own taxi company for charging high rental or get whole bunch of taxi drivers to petition for a higher flag down fee.At present,it is decided at $2.40 ++ to be an acceptable price so no way should consumers be paying more<br><br>Mods Note : Please do not complain about whatever here.</div>
