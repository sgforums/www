              <p>i share with u guys, foreigners can be bus drivers. I know of some Indians who come, they get vocational PA license, they daring and buy 2-3 or more 13 seaters high roofs, they cut their price to those travel agents in little India. Arrival they do $40 per way, departure they do $30-35. Hourly they do $25 per hour.. Wah... Cheaper than taxi.. </p>
              <p>But till now, I still cannot figure a way to counter them and win them. There are just too many and we Singaporeans are never united. We not happy we kpkb but no real actions.</p>
              <p>ppl still vote theses very same ppl who screw them in the ass.</p>
              <p>i really respect ppl in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea. Look at the people there, it's they screw the Gahmen. Not like us.</p>
