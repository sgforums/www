              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Suspected stabbing at Raffles Green; two sent to hospital</strong></span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/blob/1472498/1415945538000/raffles-green-stabbing-data.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1011"></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Part of Raffles Green in the Central Business District was cordoned off with crime scene tape on Friday afternoon (Nov 14). Police were at the scene, and a trail of blood as well as a knife were seen within the police cordon.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Blood was spotted at Raffles Green in the CBD, which has been cordoned off by police. Witnesses say a man was stabbed by an attacker who grabbed a bag from him, but the assailant was detained by bystanders.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/blob/1472684/1415949790000/raffles-place-altercation-data.jpg" alt="" width="852" height="640"></p>
              <p>A lighter, handphone and crumpled red shirt were also lying near the trail of blood. About five police vehicles were at the scene. SCDF received a call at 1.07pm and despatched two ambulances to the scene. Two people - one of whom appeared in photos to have been held detained by members of the public - were later conveyed to the Singapore General Hospital, SCDF said.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/blob/1472630/1415947736000/raffles-place-altercation-data.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">A man who seen talking to police told Channel NewsAsia the skirmish happened at 1.03pm near the Raffles Place MRT station exit. He saw a man following another man "very closely", before he heard a moan. It was then, that the victim realised he was stabbed, he said. The victim shouted, and the attacker grabbed a sling bag off him and ran towards UOB Plaza. The victim gave chase and they got into a scuffle, but the fight was broken up when the attacker was pinned down by two bystanders. Police arrived on scene within two minutes of the man being pinned down. </span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/blob/1472474/1415947634000/blood-at-raffles-place-3-data.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></p>
              <p>KPMG auditor Mohamed Nazir Abdul Rahiman - who helped to detain one of the men involved in the stabbing - told Channel NewsAsia that the man that he detained tried to struggle, but was quite weak and was possibly injured. He also said that the victim was bleeding from his ears, his shoulder and his abdomen, and that a group of ladies nearby tried to stop his bleeding.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Another witness, Rahul Shah sent in pictures of the aftermath.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Three eyewitnesses, 18-year-olds Zaakir, Navin and Rajesh, told Channel NewsAsia they were giving out flyers at about 1pm on Friday (Nov 14) when they heard a cry. They then saw a man bleeding from the stomach giving chase to another man who the trio said they thought had stabbed him, with what looked like a small kitchen knife.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Another eyewitness, who identified himself as Mark, said: "I saw two men running, one giving chase to another, before getting into a tussle near the traffic light. A short scuffle ensued, before the crowd helped to break it up.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"The whole thing lasted 10 minutes. One man was pinned down, the other man bleeding quite badly. Both seemed injured."</span></p>

              In my CSI, I think the issue is not so simple as just stealing laptop, it can be more than that, laptop nowaday so cheap, you do not need to stab to steal, there can be a purpose of revenge or so information hidden in that laptop that the aggressor wants to expose it.
              
              So, never look at thing so simple, learn to hv a CSI thinking hor.
