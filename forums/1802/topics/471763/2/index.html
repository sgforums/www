              <p>PP v Ismil Kadir is a totally different situation. Ismil
              actually confessed to the crime at first and then later recanted. I
              also believe he was in the flat earlier to steal something before
              his brother came or he took the items stolen to pawn and sell off
              and committed murder later. He was also high on drugs at the point
              of arrest. The accusations leading to his arrest wasn't wrong, his
              DNA was found at the scene and on the items and he was found with
              stolen property, you cannot expect the police to let him go at that
              point until investigations were completed.</p>
              <p>Murder charge is not bailable and hence he was detained and
              later convicted so the 6 years was there. Only later it was found

              then acquitted. Anyway he has since been arrested on another drug
              charge.</p>
              <p>In taxi driver case, it's not theft but criminal
              misappropriation of property, the bar and standards of
              investigation has be significantly lower than theft or Criminal
              misappropriation</p>

              <p>Still, it was sloppy investigation to begin with.  The judges had some harsh words for the investigators.  Can you imagine recording the guy's statements on a notepad? It was his brother's DNA that was found.  Ismil was linked to the crime when he tried to sell off a stolen mobile phone.  Not sure if it was the victim's mobile phone. What if it was some other defence lawyer who is not as thorough and insistent as Mr Thrumugan?</p>
              <p>Point is, you may be innocent, but the hassle of going down to the police station, recording statements, not knowing when the case will close is enough trouble.  But, it is a TD's job hazard, I guess.</p>
