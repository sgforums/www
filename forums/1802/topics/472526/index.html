              <p>He is only good with newbies, then as newbies get smarter, most found out that they got tricked in some way, but also learned something, not that all are lost. And within these newbies, if he can grab a fews loyalist, that will be more than enough.</p>
              <p>However, today newbies in TD are not yesterday type, most can learn and adapt fast, and some can earn faster than me too...nabey.

              <p>But I will not like to dwell on each individual personal issue, and I will alway and remain as neutral as possible, be it a good poster or a devil advocated one like BJ or my former chief, all are welcome.
