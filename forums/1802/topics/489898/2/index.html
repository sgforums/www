              If you drive OMO, start at 4am better, still under 50% fares, no MRT, no bus, many going to AP and open market stall takes cab, some workers/staff also take because they can claim. 
              
              Once inside the taxis, go all the way for 4hrs to 6 hrs non stop, only for toilet break, there after, you already breakeven the rental and fuel cost and also make some earning. Go for your lunch and hv a nice nap, at home or at carparks. Then later, about 2 to 4pm, chiong again, this time, less taxis on the road, cos first shift one all go lim kopi, top up fuel and wash car liao
              
              Newbie first training is street picking and Q for a week, later when more familar with routes, then take call. Must know where is the CBD boundaries, the surcharge timming, the taxi stands and building + Hotel lobbies inside and outside CBD. 
              
              Go slow first, talk less, focus, learnt, and like my whahahahaha brother getcarter said, every cabby learnt from his experiences on the road, on where to Q, where to pick, slowly he will hv his unique pattern, even morning come out carpark turn left, will alway turn left, unless got pax on the right.
              
              Net of $200, no problem as OMO, but not now, maybe after a month or 2, you will be like professional driver liao... but OMO must rest a day or 2, cannot chiong all the way, if so, please give me yr contact nos, I standby for you to sent you to lim chu kang.
              
              And finally, for whatever you do, try as much as possible to avoid accident even if you are on the right way, the motto is go out in yr cab, come back in your cab, dun come back taking another cab.

              Let me explain why no split shift. The actual time needed to dress up, take lift, go to your taxi and get your 1st pax is half an hour. When you stop, you need to drive from wherever to your home, find carpark lot, maybe wash car, refuel, clean carpet, go home and change clothes. That is another half hour gone. 2 split shifts means you wasted 2 hours.
              
              Drive cab is damn tiring and time consuming, dont make it worse. Split shift means you got even less free time.

              <p>You want to drive only peak hrs ar? Dun forget peak hrs also means traffic jams. That will waste ur time and reduce ur income.</p>
              <p>If u OMO, just start 4 am or whatever time and drive until hit target lah.  The momentum is important. Split shift very stressful one. Morning never hit target then stress must cheong evening.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving is about making the connections and luck. Some days, u drive from Jurong to AP. Then got connection from AP to Jurong. Then from Jurong to town etc... Then some days, u end up in mountain and stuck there...drive pax around the estate only. Cannot get out unless u waste fuel and rush back to town empty.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, settle into a routine that best suits you.  But be careful hor...some TDs settled down too much that they end up driving taxis for 30 yrs.....like Bowah. But he got sideline lah..so ok..:)</p>
