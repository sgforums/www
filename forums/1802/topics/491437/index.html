              <p>Always remember the purpose behind your actions. As a cabby, u want to go from point a to b and be paid accordingly. There will b distractions like road rage but your purpose was to fetch pax n not get into fights.</p>
              <p>If u love fighting, then switch to bouncer. Or b a martial arts instructor. But if u r a good fighter, u will also tend to walk away from trouble. These punks r no match for u, so why waste energy?</p>
              <p>So then if u love fighting, do not start it unless the intention was to end someone's life. Even then, u can take a person's life without using weapons or fighting or getting others to do the dirty job. If u try n be an ah beng n slash someone, to feel macho and glory, police will come after u n in the end u will be hanged.</p>
              <p>So end of day, if u get angry and dont know how to stop someone's life without bloodshed, then tell yourself to stay calm, and focus on your goal which is to earn more money.</p>

              <p>My taxi course instructor said "listen to soothing music".   </p>
              <p>Some motorists would just horn back to vent their frustration.</p>
              <p>I personally say if you feel frustrated by it, drop your customer after reaching the destination (if you have a customer) then go to coffeeshop to drink coffee or softdrink.</p>

              <p>Many know gambling is bad, but many still go. Many know killing others is wrong, but in the heat of the moment, still do it or kill themselves.</p>
              <p>Same for all vices. Many people can control themselves from many vices, but nobody can control themself from ALL bad habits. Those citizens branded as criminals, are not able to control themself from many vices. They are strong outside, but actually tend to mentally weak - and I m not trying to be disrespectful here. Everyone got different brains, process info differently and what is right to A can feel wrong to B.</p>
              <p>So its too bad this situation happened. Taxi unker maybe got bad day, and unker ktc was feeling very irritated. Both got their POV, but too bad the taxi unker lost this round.</p>

              <p>I have met young punks myself. My impression is that their parents never taught them manners. Their schools also never taught them anything. The police are probably too busy. So it was left to me to be a punk back at them.</p>
              <p>The same aggression towards me, I gave it back to them. But all the while, I have my compassion to them. Honestly even if he was a bodybuilder, I might end up sending him to Mandai with one punch. I never really had to fight with them, because I am really worried about hurting them, even as emotions are getting high. So far I use my mouth only, some more with restraint. I could have cursed them until they try to hit me, but it is not a good thing to bully hot tempered people.</p>
              <p>But it is important to teach these punks a lesson, and those fare evaders. Someone got to do the dirty job.</p>

              Young punks should go skill upgrading and further study to gain knowledge on some special skill like cooking, designing, underwater works and so on, today, unlike our time, you get many opportunities sponsored by govt, our time where got all these, either you drive taxis or be pimp only.
              
              So sad to see young punks driving, really wasting their time and young life, we already been thru all these shit, after 20 to 30 years, still a taxi driver...and your friends or former army friends are now managers, supervisors or head of depts..5 days work, paid 4 to 6k or even 7k, happy family, many saving...Me?? even order ang di cau also ask for smaller ones..haiz.

              Agreed. Their future will be more bleak than what I am now.
              
              Now at least we dun suffer so much because there is still many commoners like me.
              
              For current young driving taxi will be different, by the time they get older, whereby most locals will be holding executive jobs and up themselves to manager or other professionals, it will be very demoralizing for them to remain as TDs, that time, want to change also cannot or hard to change, as most job will be taken by foreigners.
