I have met cab drivers (albeit, a few) who were willing to go the extra mile and helped me with the luggage and etc.<br><br>As for the whole line of reluctant cab drivers who showed indifference to your dad, all I can say is that a contributing factor arises from our asian mentality, thats perhaps unique to Singapore, of not breaking the norms and preserving the status quo. Upon seeing the reluctance of the first cabby driver to help out, the second, third and so on sub-consciously chooses not to volunteer himself and stand out above the rest. Its the same mentality that gives rise to the kiasu, kiasee and "scared of loosing face".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I take taxis maybe some 20-30 times a month. Maybe I'm lucky. But i've only come across 1-2 a month who are arses. The rest are pretty friendly and nice. I do also make it a habit to sit in front next to them and talk about life and politics :p<br><br>I also usually am offered a round-down of prices. And when I'm in a good mood, or if the chat was especially enjoyable, I'd usually tip the drivers in return.<br><br></div>

My dad got into a cab at the hospital which he was just discharged from and he told the cab driver he needed help with his luggage because of his back problems but the cabby just ignored him! He then went and asked every single cabby in the long line of cabs if anyone could help him load his baggage into the boot of the car but none of them wanted to help, even though he offered one of them extra money.<br><br>I mean even if they weren't cab drivers and were just some guy who happened to be walking past they should at least help someone who just got out of the friggin hospital with his bags, it's common courtesy.</div></blockquote>A load of bullshit , I am not going to believe the TS .<br><br></div>
