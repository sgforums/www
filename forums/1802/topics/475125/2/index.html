              <p>It is a therefore a dire mistake to tell people, come you drive taxis and see how? because they do not owe us a living, you take my cab, I service you, you paid for my service, I do not earn you a living too.</p>

              <p>Taxis shouting for location must hv a change shift on top, do you know that 70% pax do not see your change shift sign, they only recognise green and red.</p>
              <p>It is not that TD want to shout, but at the ding of a crowded place, he just need to higher his volume inorder for other hear him. Mostly these TD are thicker skin than those quiet one...lols</p>
              <p>Now, TD tends to use the word interview, what interview?? because they take it as a layman term, but in actually right you should use "communication" Therefore when too bad you are offer to go office (mine at loyang level 3), please do not use the word interview...use communication, it will more or less lighten your case./ Like if DRO asked, why you interview pax? you tell DRO, no, I only communicate with pax.</p>
              <p>So, if I am changing shift, last pax drop at ION at 9pm, one long line cheapo pax Q there instead of Wisma, I put change shift AMK&lt;  then I raise my voice, changing shift AMK, anyone, the warden saw my change shift sign, also help out, then from the crowd, one family boarded happily.</p>
              <p>Now, what is the productivity here? you get a pax to AMK, you save yr diesel, you earn your earning more, and most important, you happy.</p>
              <p>Pax took your cab also happy, at least someone going to AMK can match them, they do not hv to Q</p>
              <p>The line in Q and warden also happy, cos these TD changing shift also make an effort to reduce the Q, to ferry people out...</p>
              <p>You see the productivity here?</p>

              go office (mine at loyang level 3), please do not use the word
              interview...use communication, it will more or less lighten your
              case./ Like if DRO asked, why you interview pax? you tell DRO, no,
              I only communicate with pax.</p>
              <p>So, if I am changing shift, last pax drop at ION at 9pm, one
              long line cheapo pax Q there instead of Wisma, I put change shift
              AMK&lt;  then I raise my voice, changing shift AMK, anyone,
              the warden saw my change shift sign, also help out, then from the
              crowd, one family boarded happily.</p>
              <p>Now, what is the productivity here? you get a pax to AMK, you
              save yr diesel, you earn your earning more, and most important, you
              happy.</p>
              <p>Pax took your cab also happy, at least someone going to AMK can
              match them, they do not hv to Q</p>
              <p>The line in Q and warden also happy, cos these TD changing shift
              also make an effort to reduce the Q, to ferry people out...</p>
              <p>You see the productivity here?</p>
