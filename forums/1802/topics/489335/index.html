              <p>It's just that the MDT system meets all requirements....and is very integrated.</p>
              <p>True GrabTaxi's app may be slightly better (seems to me only real advantage is they allow customers to see where the on-called taxi is) but that is just about it.  Comfort one customer must call to find out where taxi is.</p>
              <p>But other than that, GrabTaxi has no real advantage.  Comfort has a market share of slightly more than 16000 taxis wheras Grabtaxi has only around 10000-12000 so they are taking loses to try to gain more taxi drivers to support them.</p>
              <p>Comfort had 35.6 million comfirmed call-bookings last year.  If each call they make average of  $0.35, then it brings in around $12.46 million (not including additional money from credit card, nets and ezlink fees) out of which some money has to been spent on the MDT group, replacing and servicing MDTs, some on the software group that  maintains the web, modile app and MDT software updates, GPS tracking fees and some on the call-booking group.  So it definitely it is 7 digit profit.  All these money totally generated from the 16000 taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>Grabtaxi invested $136 million in R&amp;D in Singapore.  But don't know why that amount is so much as there does not seem to be a lot more to update for the softwares.  In fact, it could operate just by renting a floor of office space.  Additional software improvements would not improve sales.  It is agressive marketing and getting more taxi drivers to sign up that would improve sales and better R&amp;D.  At least that is the case in Singapore; don't about the case for Grabtaxi functioning in other countries.</p>
              <p>Comfort already provides more calls for its drivers than needed..  I seldom see taxis from other 4 taxi companies leaving halfway without passengers after queuing up at taxi stands but often see Comfort taxis leaving halfway.  This means call-bookings for Comfort at this point of time is still substantially more than from GrabTaxi.  They would always enjoy at least 57% marketshare of on-call businesses.even if Grabtaxi is able to get all drivers from the other 4 taxi companies to sign up although there are double-head snakes that are both on Comfort MDT and Grabtaxi.</p>
              <p>So Comfort would not be panicking ..... just hating the entry ot Grabtaxi and Uber into the market they once dominated. </p>

              Alamak, up till now, you guys still do not understand the relationship between comfort and grab, so, i shall repeat it again.
                  
              Cdg and grab calls are of the same major shareholder aka Temasek. 
                  
              Before grab come into the picture, cdg calls was nos 1, no horse run, and even tho with 16000 cabs, they are unable to cope with the nos of call, many paxs kpkb no taxi to pick them up and with the increase of populations, more worst.
              
              So they decided to sublet some of their call to TC and SMRT, however, that violated their organisation protocol. 
                  
              Remember that time, TC and SMRT suddenly got surge of calls, because cdg drivers either cannot handle it or too howlian to take it.
                  
              And since our telecom infrastructure had modernised into 3 to 4G technologies.. temasek in their top table discussion, noticed the business opportunity to tap on it, they decided and allowed grabtaxis to enter out taxi industrial on one condition and that is temasek be the biggest shareholders, 
                  
              As GT is global in nature, it can penetrate any country that have a good telecom network of at least 3G and above, and at the same time, they can also be use by any other taxi companies' driver.
                  
              So, in a nutshell, let me simply put it, cdg and grab calls profits goes into the same pocket. And we argueing for just the sake of argueing.

              By introducing grab, they achieved 3 main objectives,
              
              1) stopped taxis paxs from kpkb about called, but no taxis
              2) allowed all color of taxis to use it
              3) and with more drivers using it of course, earn more profit.
              
              and finally on the hindsight, prevented cdg drivers from getting more and more howlian

              <p>I did not know Temasek largest shareholder of GrabTaxi.  Surprised also because the founder GrabTaxi got rich family background.</p>
              <p>Anyway, taxi drivers do not see GrabTaxi as a hostile organization.  Taxi drivers where got howlian?  Just cannot cope with demand during certain hours or too near taxi stands so sometimes don't take calls that are too far away (or in opposite direction) or one look cannot recognize immediately where it is (must stop and check map so let go).  Peak hours sometimes see 10 calls in 3 minutes but can only take 1 call.</p>
