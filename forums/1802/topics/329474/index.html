              <p>A TAXI driver with a newly-arrived tourist in his back seat
              collapsed at the wheel on Tuesday morning and crashed into a median at
              Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Cabbie Kwan Lok Pang was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival.</p>
              <p>Police said his passenger, a Chinese national who had just jumped in at Terminal 1, was unscathed.</p>
              <p>It is not known what caused the 54-year-old to collapse, and
              his family members on Wednesday declined to say whether he had heart
              problems.</p>
              <p>Mr Kwan had been working for Premier Taxis for three years, said the company's managing director, Lim Chong Boo.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said the cabbie 'looked healthy' and, like all taxi
              drivers between 50 and 65, would have undergone a medical check-up once
              every two years.</p>
              <p>Collapses like Mr Kwan's are uncommon, according to taxi
              companies. Premier said this its first, while SMRT Taxis said it has
              never had such a case. ComfortDelgro, the country's biggest cab
              company, declined to provide statistics.</p>
              <p>Police said Mr Kwan was approaching Terminal 2 on Tuesday
              morning when passed out and slumped over the wheel. His car veered
              towards the right before smashing into the centre divider.</p>
              <p>Mr Kwan suffered scrapes on his forehead and was unconscious
              when paramedics arrived. It is unclear if he was killed by the impact
              of the crash.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, family and friends gathered for his wake in
              Jalan Teck Whye. His wife and adult children said they were too
              distraught to be interviewed.</p>
              <p>His younger sister, however, said Mr Kwan had always worked
              in the transport industry. Prior driving a taxi, he owned a transport
              company that went under.</p>
              <p>Premier Taxi's Mr Lim said his death was unfortunate.</p>
              <p>'We will do our utmost to help Mr Kwan's family,' he said.</p>

              <p>I think it is all about diet and sufficient rest. Sitting inside taxi for too long hours can cause deep-vein thrombosis as well as heart problem.</p>
