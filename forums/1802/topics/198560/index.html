            <div class='col-md body'>consumers are not asking to be treated like kings.<br><br>in my case, asking for better services is merely asking to be treated like a paying customer.<br><br>i done my part as a customer to greet the driver when i board with a simple "hello", followed by "uncle, this is where i want to go", and alight with a simple "thank you".<br><br>all i hope in return is having the cab drivers to acknowledge my instructions and carry them in professional manner and express a simple thank to reminds me i am the customer here.<br><br>unfortunately, beside SMRT cab these days, most cab drivers give me a feeling that they are unhappy to even have a customer. i understand some could have a bad day but what are the odds of having so many of them?<br><br>some can remain mute for the entire journey and makes u puzzle if they could comprehend your directions.<br>some make the wrong turn but offer no apology and never initiate a discount in cab fare.<br>i have this tendency of telling cab drivers my destination as soon as i board the cab and some could just move off and then ask you how to get there.<br>some could even talk to you in such a tone as if i owe him a living.<br><br>all these are just tips of the iceberg as there are even more frustrating stories on busybody and sleepy drivers.<br><br>but nothing beat standing in the middle of the road seeing empty cabs passing you by with on call sign when u hope to get to your destination at the soonest.<br><br>i understand the rationale of earning more with booking charges, but being choosy with customers is a form of bad customer service as a whole. top that off with poor availability in booking hotline, it is no wonder the entire taxi service level is nowhere near the satisfactory level, let alone asking for tips.<br><br>nevertheless, i would still like to compliment a handful of cab drivers who are honest and polite. it is a pity that their professionalism are being undermined by greedy taxi companies and fellow black sheeps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.. I don't frequent cabs much. Around three or four times per week. And so far, I have seen more good than bad about cabbies.<br><br>There are some who will greet you. I like that. It gives me sastifaction in taking the cab. There are cabbies who knows how to strike up a conversation. I like that too. But not too talkative please.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But nowadays, it seems that cabbies do not help the passengers put things in the boot. I still remember maybe about 6 years ago. My mum and me were carrying a lot of stuffs. We flagged a cab. And the cabby came out of the cab and helped to sort the things in the boot. Nowadays. They just wait for you in the cab while you sort it at the back yourself.<br><br>But of course, not all yar. Im not generalizing. Just from my experience.<br><br>One thing that amuse me is how cabbies like to 'design' and arrange stuffs on the dashboard. You can see small statues of Gods. Little funny dolls which has a spring neck. Colourful lights going on and off. Its nice. So creative.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Poolman:</div><div class="quote_body">Smoking inside a taxi is an offense , i agree it stinks .<br><br>radio loud ? usually it's kept low , unless you want it louder .<br><br>Talking ? cabby are told to keep their mouth shut at all times , unless you want to talk .<br><br>Drive safely ? Must la , if not , any accident , $2000 penalty for the cabby .<br><br>Ask which route ! That's why you always hear cabby ask you which way you want to go .<br><br></div></blockquote>Cabbies are told to keep their mouth shut but they don't necessarily do so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And driving safely... hmm got penalty but I don't know why some cabbies still like to drive dangerously. Once when it was raining, a cab I was on was going at a speed like it was on the expressway, even though we were on Shenton Way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> And then when the cabbies drive quickly, they also brake quickly and suddenly and curse and push the blame on the car in front.<br><br>You mean passengers should also ask? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> I think cabbies should take the initiative more than the passenger should, because most of the time the cabbies know the roads better than the passenger. All the better if they advise the passenger which is the better road to take... like sometimes the cabby will say "I go by this way ah, the other way at this time got traffic jam". That is customer service - showing the passenger that cabbies care! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
