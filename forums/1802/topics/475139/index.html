              <p>Do you know that the airport hv to sacrifice haif the size of a terminal to accomdate taxis?

              <p>thanks for starting this thread.. i believe i did start something similiar quite some time back..but couldn't find it</p>
              <p>let me add on..based on yesterday observation..</p>
              <p>10mins before 1700hrs, where the surcharge becomes $5, many were seen queueing along side of the road despite the airport staff waving more more taxi into t2, as its a low supply of taxi timing. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">same thing happened before 1800hrs...</span></p>
              <p>they did not even enter the first right bend, just stop at the left side on the straight road.</p>
              <p>Cisco gaurd comes out with whistle and a writing board, ready to take down vehicle number, then they start moving slowly to go inside the q, but park wherever they can to delay time, go toilet.</p>
              <p>Many TD were seem going thru the bypass, which is available at all three terminals, but for T2, there's a sign says no entry to Taxis. many were seen going in direct and the Cisco guy was standing there and blowing his whistle, which i doubt he can capture the number plates (if he wants to) as the cabs are going in at a constant pace..</p>
              <p>some still go through the winding Q under the car park.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The grey area is when the airport staff signal us to go into the respective terminals as they need us, does it automatically means we can use bypass, as its a more direct route in and ignore the signage there?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Otherwise, if u prefer to play safe, just take it as they are signalling to us that they need us, doesn't mean we can ignore the sign and break the rules </p>

              <p>But knn, most of  these warden lazy fark..or too old liao, forget the nos or dun bother..these give the loophole for some cheater lor.</p>
              <p>And that is the warden duty.</p>
              <p>Eg, let say I am the warden, I call out to the other warden</p>
              <p>6 cabs, 1st nos 7658 last 6253.</p>
              <p>If end up with 7 cabs at 2nd TS, something is wrong? If first plate is no right, something is wrong, if last plate nos is not right, something is also wrong,..but you know lah, warden also tanjiak one mah, less trouble better mah, later can go home sleep and sex nice nice..</p>
