              That is complacency at it very best, like Singaporean, in the 80s and early 90s, never believe they will be taken over by foreigner, the first few batches of ah tiong, ah neh and ah bangala came, most see them as beggar, cannot make it type, Singaporean act as Kings, locals laughed at them, at their behavor and character, I remember few bangala workers coming in with shirt and tie, next day, all go dig road..give local supervisor shout here and there.
              
              And as these foreigner workers bring in more relaxation for locals workers and supervisor, most started to depart their skill to them in hoping that they work and locals just sit and collect paid, thus become complacent. Nobody that time worry about too many foreign coming in, but not, you see foreigner taking over higher position and locals are outcasted..to be taxi driver..lols.
              
              The on call market is a huge market, $0.30 and 0.40 for peak and even $1 for advance is not a small market, 16,000 cab just take one 0.30 call per day only..will generate $4,800, imagine if each take 10 calls and not yet counting those advance and peak calls..can easily hit minimum $20,000 per day, per month 600,000. More than 1/2 a million.
              
              Now you know why apps like grabtaxi are pushing hard on this market

              So if cdg is thinking they are still king, till they see a drop or a drastic drop in their calls, a lost of on call share market (because if grabtaxi is successful, many other apps will come in). And more importantly a drop in shareholders dividends and shares...then you can see Tammy or tummy tumble out of cdg.
              
              Apps work in a much cheaper way than Cdg or taxi companies call centres, net revenue generated will be more due to less cost of operating.

But those top managment are kuku birds. All liabilities... talk only, come up stupid system, bring the profits only. Tts why i cannot be like them. I am born to be slave to money. Sigh. All never look after the workers well....so u guys know what to do next when GE is near. We should keep the good system and replace the redundant miw aka party vs ppl personnel.

              I hv to repeat again, this is a capitalist country run by capitalist govt, and capitalist only believe in capital ($$). 
              
              Under capitalism way of management, the first and foremost that managment must satisfy is the shareholders. Workers and staff can be interchangeable, but sharesholders are the one who put money into it, if they cannot get a good return, they will sell and close shop. 
              
              Therefore workers and staffs will just become pawns for them to move about either by force or by changing of policies. 
              
              Within the realm of Capitalist and Workers, capitalists are more united, workers, sorry to say, less unity because of long working hours, no time to socialise like the capitalist who go networking at golf course, club, dine and wine

              <p>im waiting for F.T to replace the MIW aka Party vs people. Their ppl inside the system is a unopened can full of worms inside, highly liability. paid so much to attract F.T in, why not let them taste their own medicine and get F.T to run the system? save cost mah. MIW keep saying we xenophobes.. maybe one day will be like what bush is doing....take all the finance sector, plus those fat bonuses companies and later resign from gahmen.</p>
              <p>they advise us, to encourage change , singaporeans but to them?</p>

              No sabo lah, you know that in the taxi market, many nicknamed me é½�å…¬, cos within my joke and humor, there lies the true. just that I want to express it out in a more humanity way rather than be so serious. 
              
              You see my brother, you and me and many other like my ah fu were all former employees of certain company, we slogged, worked till late and still get left right centre from superior, so, end up we get fed up or retrenched or sacked, and become a TD. 
              
              Today, at all these taxi companies, you see who they employ, pinoy operators, malaysia cashiers, DRO, and more obvious, PRC mechanics, so where do those older local mechanics go to?? they get forced out, casted out due to high wage cost. These farkers all want low cost operating, no matter how good, or how experience or how long these local mechanics had worked for them, they are mostly gone and forgotton.
              
              So, where do these old mechanics go?? drive taxis like us??? no lah, because of their experiences and skills, most either work for car servicing companies or self operate a small rental shop, and Ah Boon, my former best mechanics is one of them, just start yr engine only, he knows the health of your engine liao...you get that kind of skill from PRC??

              Absolutely right, and now you see so many cab get burnt,...why? because most PRC are not electronically/electrically trained. It is like you are a serviceman, you service everything in the cab, including engine, electrical wiring, timming, electronics..how?
              
              No doubts electronical and IT had make a creative destruction in our lives, we simply cannot let got the basic of it, When ATM was created, tellers jobs was destroyed, so u see bank retrenching by hundreds, when Smart phone/tab/pad was created, laptop companies like hp, dell, and many others lost their profit, retrenched by thousands, and operating lines in Seagate stopped operation, overnite, Seagate, which was an important part of manufacturing in singapore become no so important.
              
              So, these electronic stuff was created like a virus scan to scan yr engine, skill and experience mechanic who are much highly paid, get kick out. And as what my ah Boon rightly put it, it cannot scan a loose nut, nor can it scan a loose wire. And more importantly, he added, even if they scanned something, can they repair it correctly??
