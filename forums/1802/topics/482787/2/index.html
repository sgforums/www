              <p>Yeah this is true. The police is also getting old timers to come back and serve in various positions. Don't have to be full time policeman if don't want to - just be a trainer. Conduct lessons, give advice. Or if want to return - do as a desk job - clear old cases or the back log. Get your last pay plus retain benefits. For those on pension scheme - get your pension plus full pay. And of course retain your rank.</p>
              <p>Or if want a change then go into Prisons, CNB or even CPIB and do intel work mainly. Be the link between them and the SPF.</p>
              <p>It's great now for ex-civil servants - so many options and treated much better than when in service.</p>
              <p>This is a topic I'll be covering in my blog about the main problem with policemen nowadays - too much promotions - so no one is doing the basic jobs.</p>
              <p>CP Ng is wrong - there's no need for 1000 extra police - it's the kind of police you employ. Take for eg; Geylang - why the problem - well everyone is now a Sgt minimum, after a few years S/Sgt or SSS. You think a S/Sgt or SSS still want to go around doing beat duty?</p>
              <p>He will think, now I got rank, why should I be doing this kind of low end jobs, walking up and down, patrolling and checking people. I want a desk job, I want to supervise.</p>
              <p>Thats why in the UK police until today there's only 2 junior ranks - Constable and Sgt.</p>
              <p>Constables do the normal everyday duty and Sgts lead them. No such thing as Cpl, SSGt, SSS Stn Insp etc.</p>
              <p>Pay the Constables well - pay them Sgt pay even and pay Sgts an SI pay. Rank should be given out slowly and on merit, not lelong like it's here now. If the pay is good, people will stay.</p>

              The problem is the salary range, Police needs to readjust the range of new entry minimum and maximum up. As most of them are now basically higher educated, the range should be widen to accomodate higher increment without promotion

              Go bang table lah, knn, that is why deposit is at their disposal, but who do not have scratches and dents in their cab, even private cars on the road so less, also hv dents and scratches.
              
              Reason it out with their superior, but if scratches go across cdg phone nos and logo, you need specialist at Sin Ming to get those logos and phone nos sticker.
