              <p>Last Friday, I was out with my wife to collect our free 'sharp - Oven'
              which we got through some redemption point. As usual, i have postponed
              the collection until it reaches the dead end of the voucher expiry
              date. Suddenly,we sprung and decided to collect it on the last day and
              were out there. But the time we choose was really bad, around 5.00 pm,
              again, last minute of the last eligible day!! So, you guys should know
              about how planned i am.<br><br>After collecting our 'free one',
              Saravana bhavan restaurant was at sight just opposite side our the
              road. We thought, ignoring some good evening tiffin is a sin and
              decided to enter there. After successfully, having our mini - dinner,We
              are out again towards our home. But it is already 5.30pm and we very
              well know that singapore efficient MRT trains will be jam packed like
              our pallanvan buses(Chennai - India). So there is no question about taking my big box in
              MRT train. Fellow, communters would have killed me if i have done so.
              During the peak hours, people will stand on side by side, with just few
              inches shoulder freedom!!<br><br>So, marched towards the taxi stand and
              got puzzled to see the queue there like for a public bus. Deciding not
              to waste money!!, we decided to join the queue, luckily the queue moved
              fast and with in few mins, we are in the turn to take the cab. Everyone
              in front of us called the taxis and went off. I was amazed why these
              people are so restless and can't even stand for few mins to get a cab?
              Anyway, there impatience is good for me. Not long before, i realized
              that how wrong i am, we were in the queue even after 30mins but no sign
              of empty taxi. Though we spot some, it will be 'Busy' and within few
              mins will come back again with 'On call'.<br><br>Now, we know, how the
              taxis cheat in CBD. It might be harsh to say cheat, but, that is the
              truth. After 40 mins of standing, one taxi came and he asked me where
              we are going, when we said our address, he decided to let us in. We i
              get in to the taxi, the additional charges are already more than $4
              dollars without even moving a feet.<br><br>Not sure, where is the fault. Is that LTA is really doesn't know what's happening on the roads or
              they are turning a blind eye towards it.<br></p>

              <p>What is the time...already 5.30pm.</p>
              <p>So my friend... normal day shift start from 5.00am to 5.00pm.</p>
              <p>Than the dayshift will than return to their partner after topping the diesel and cleaning and washing up the taxi.</p>
              <p>Than from 5.00pm onward you need the second shift to get ready their round of run.</p>
              <p> Be patience, how can the whole singapore taxis those second shift come by just only  to pick you up on your paticular taxi stand as stated there are many others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, we know, how the taxis cheat in CBD. It might be harsh to say

              <p>Hey Thambi .... do me a favour , go screw LTA , not cabby's fault !!</p>
              <p>Like ALN said , taxi to pay the ERP ( if they're vacant ) into the CBD . 5pm to 5.29pm , $1 .</p>
              <p>5.30pm to 5.59pm , $1.50 .</p>
              <p>6pm to 6.29pm , $2 .</p>
              <p>That was the rate before Lehmann Bros collapsed , i felt before they collapsed .</p>
              <p>Who set the ERP ?</p>
              <p>Answer : LTA</p>
              <p>Why they set the ERP ?</p>
              <p>They want u to take the buses and MRT .</p>
              <p>So pls go take a bus or MRT .... then there'll be no cheat , and there'll be waiting , and there'll be no complaints !!!</p>

              <p>So this Chennai fella criticising Sgp taxis ?</p>
              <p>My advice to him  : be aware of Sgp's cultures , understood more about culture of race , religion and occupation in Sgp . More tolerance in religions and culture .</p>
              <p>Don't compare Chennai's taxis and Sgp taxis , we are 1000times cleaner in our system , in legislation , culture and politically , 1 million times more discipline and 10 millions times caused less pollutions than in Chennai .</p>
              <p>To be in Singapore , they have to thank god .</p>
              <p>To be In Sgp , they have to leave Chennai at home .</p>
              <p>We are no cheats !!!</p>
