              <p>Yes, times are bad, and it might get worst, the recent economy datas are not healthy, it makes peoples become more conservatives in their spending.</p>
              <p>And you are right that many newbies TD are on the road, from the way they drive and take pax i also know liao, saw one drive up ion car park, security chased after him..hehe..lols, reversed back and move out into OB then back to ion Taxi stand, lau kui like me only know wisma, what is ION?? never heard before after 5pm..hehe</p>
              <p>More newbies on the road is also the result of downward slide of the economy. Retrenchment is getting higher especially in manufacturing sector such as electronics industrial. So, in a way, we also need to understand them, no job, went into TD, took high rental taxis, whack here and there, cannot even breakeven, then end up like vultures fighting each other for a piece of bone.</p>
              <p>So, if can look for other partime job, like bao bak zhang, peng bak kua, drive casket van/lorry or doorman and so on.../ never give up till the last breath</p>

              <p><br>Huh? why alway you debate with me one huh??..lols</p>
              <p>I believe it is not a case of samartian, as I wrote, when there is self interest in doing samaritian, that is not samartian, more like samurai. He only teach if one is of value to him, either join his group or work in his way. And that is call self interest. UNDERSTAND BO??</p>
              <p>Self interest exist in everyone of us, from ministers to cleaners, it is a nature human behavorial, it is only a matter of how much self interest you have that determine your sincerity in helping others.</p>
              <p>Let said if I am a Taxi radio operator cum taxi driver, I also do insurance, I also do durian jobs and so on, and I will only help people who are lured in to join my radio group, bought my insurance and help me in my durian job, as such, I can drive less and earn more of out others. That is self insterest without a thought for others.</p>
