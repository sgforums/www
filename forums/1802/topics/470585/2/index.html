              <p>I believe it is not a case of samartian, as I wrote, when there
              is self interest in doing samaritian, that is not samartian, more
              like samurai. He only teach if one is of value to him, either join
              his group or work in his way. And that is call self interest.
              UNDERSTAND BO??</p>
              <p>Self interest exist in everyone of us, from ministers to
              cleaners, it is a nature human behavorial, it is only a matter of
              how much self interest you have that determine your sincerity in
              helping others.</p>
              <p>Let said if I am a Taxi radio operator cum taxi driver, I also
              do insurance, I also do durian jobs and so on, and I will only help
              people who are lured in to join my radio group, bought my insurance
              and help me in my durian job, as such, I can drive less and earn
              more of out others. That is self insterest without a thought for

              <p>Those who play with fire will eventually get burnt.</p>
              <p>My boss said this: I don't understand why some people already have a rice bowl given to them, want to start acting smart organising this organising that. When you are given a license in whatever form even a simple driving license, there are always rules for you to follow.</p>
              <p>You want to share information? By all means, whatever information that the licensing authority has made public. You want to comment? By all means provided its correct.</p>
              <p>You want to teach/meet/educate members of the public or fellow license holders? Good luck to you if you think you can go far.</p>
              <p>So up to whichever smart aleck who thinks he can make a name for himself in taxi driving. Taxi driving despite its' not so high status is still and will always be a licensed job. Why you think got CTOA, NTA and all the others? Suka suka, for fun?</p>
              <p>Why are they all registered? Why got Singapore Taxi Academy? Why got refresher course? Why got company DROs? All these for fun?Just to create jobs for admin staff?</p>
              <p>So let our hero become the chief for the newbies, I remember got 1 guy come here and said wow the 3426 forum was so good, got teacher come down and spend 3 hours teach him how to use MDT. All of us who disagreed go and die. Ok lah, we see who will go and die in the end.</p>
              <p>The chief who launches an illegal society, group, association and academy. The members who join them and the group leaders who support him. Someone told me got handing over and taking over planned. Got this palringo thing also. Excellent lah. Faster faster go and join get as many members as possible, advertise for newbies, got interviews and meetings planned.</p>
              <p>But when the shit hits the fan, lets see who will escape the long arms of the law. For sure their chief will escape, he thinks the law is shit and cannot touch him. He is the superman.</p>
              <p>But let me say this, for newbies if you think meeting and joining groups online is correct and proper or even strangers whom you do not know who will teach and guide you, other than company approved, you are placing your TVDL at risk.</p>
              <p>For group leaders and members, if you only lose your TVDL, you should consider yourself lucky. Because it can and will be much worse I suspect.</p>
              <p>So Bowah, you want open a new forum for taxi drivers?</p>
