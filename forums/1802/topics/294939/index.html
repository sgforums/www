            <div class='col-md body'>a taxi driver once told me he ever encountered a teenage couple about 14yr old asked him to ferry them to a remote carpark in Changi. There, the boy paid the taxi driver $50 and asked him to get down so he can screw his gf inside the taxi! 15mins was all it took to earn that $50!<br><br>and today, i took a taxi and the driver in his 60s kept telling me his experience with prostitutes in geylang, batam and thailand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
