              <p>[CNA] Mediation system to help cabbies resolve disputes with companies</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Taxi drivers can now turn to a more structured system to help settle disputes with their taxi companies quickly and amicably.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The Taxi Industry Mediation system is a collaboration between the Land Transport Authority (LTA), taxi companies and National Taxi Association (NTA). It was launched in July, and is on trial for six months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The National Taxi Association receives about 10 cases a week on a range of issues which drivers face with their taxi companies, insurance firms or between drivers themselves. A top complaint is drivers feeling they were unfairly terminated due to service lapses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"For example, one was rude to the customer, or didn’t fulfil the booking on time, and after one or two times the company may decide to terminate the agreement, and therefore one cannot drive with this operator anymore,” said Ang Hin Kee, executive advisor of National Taxi Association. “That impacts their livelihood, and many times it has been such that it's your word against mine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">“We found that perhaps a better way is to have parties sit down together through a neutral body, like a mediation system to work out the best solution moving forward, rather than people are feeling aggrieved that their version of the facts are not properly addressed."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Cabbies also often get into disputes over the amount they have to pay in the event of an accident.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The association first mooted the mediation idea in 2013. If parties cannot come to an agreement, NTA would refer the case to LTA for pre-mediation. If the case is not resolved at pre-mediation, LTA can refer it to the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) for professional help. If there is still no resolution, the case can go to a civil court for adjudication.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When the NTA makes a case referral, LTA requires up to two weeks to evaluate the legitimacy of the dispute before convening the pre-mediation session with the parties. In nearly three months since the trial started, one case was referred to LTA. The case was resolved amicably during the pre-mediation stage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"Let’s say the taxi drivers have any disputes with company, they know where to go to look for help,” commented Harry Ng, a taxi driver who works with ComfortDelGro. “This is fair to the drivers. So, at least it's not one-sided."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Mr Ang added: "With some precedent cases that are settled through the mediation, we hope that future cases can take reference from there, and therefore disputes can be resolved quickly because (those involved) know now that there has been a case of this nature resolved before in this manner."</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">With a more structured system in place, NTA also expects to see fewer disputes in future. </span></p>

              The mechanism to meditate from the perspective of NTA is not right, their vision is still thinking that TD are employees of taxi companies, but in actual fact, No, taxi drivers are freelancers, NTA therefore must look from such perspectives inorder to better serve it members.
              
              As sole properioter, a TD is therefore, very individualistic, he will have to face paxs, LTA, taxi companies and all other matters by his own, NTA is not his insurance and must know that wherever a TD is in difficulties or victimised, he is first to get kicked out or that he needs to pay first. It is not like an employee in an organisation that can keep on working till the case is solved, then decide on to terminate or carry on, moreover, there will be compensation.
              
              It is in this direction that NTA should take note that drivers who are in trouble with either LTA or taxi companies, should be given the period of plying the road for their bread and butter till his case is settled, thereby, the outcome will then decide on his needs to pay, terminated or carry on his driving as usual.
