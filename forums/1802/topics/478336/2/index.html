              Taxis must alway be taken as a public image, in every countries you got, one of the thing you judge is the taxis, second, toilet, third, the culture..
              
              And especially Singapore govt, who are so scare of losing face, die die upfront must be nice, inside like shit is another case, like our HDB, outside very nice, inside is jail.
              
              Base on these, you think sg gov is going to allow Foreigner into taxi driving??? Truck, trailer, bus are a total different issue to taxis, they are not so expose to the public that demand services, images and the know how..moreover, some bus captain and trailers are earning more than a taxi driver in a way if you plus their leaves, bonuses and other benefits like medical. 
              
              As I said long ago, singapore wages is going to increase trememdously, especially so with a high inflation rate that is crumpling the lower and middle class, it govt is not going to force employers to do it, they will ultimately put a minimum wage on that particular trade, eg to start with, Cleaners must now be pay at least 1000 and above, if not cleaner licence revoked. Bus captains after the increment of bus fare, will get higher wage increases to encourage singaporean to drive, many will be able to achieve 3,500 + many other fringe benefits.
              
              Together with the slash on FW and FT quotas against 1 local/PR, employers must also show and prove that they engaged singaporean first before any other Foreigners, govt knows that 2016 is very near, they are going in from all direction, from quotas to employment to housing ratio and wages increases to reflect a decent living here.
              
              And the last, but not least they are looking at is TD must also hv a decent living against a backdrop of high cost of living, nobody will drive a cab if he is driving at a loss, unless you are hammer or me.

              Brother...what is SPH now..if you are holding SPH shares to earn their pathetic dividend, better throw now when the price is still reasonably at a slight lost..SPH no more laku liao..what newspaper, magazine..lan sai lah, Uncle me also use old galaxy tab(formerly used by my Chief) to see news liao..
              
              SPH had lost their market to internet, by the time they realised, too late, and sg papers are now consider state papers, no freedom of expression and certainly, as we all know, a media for the govt.
              
              They are so pathetic that they hv to create new like 7k cab driver...just to get interest, and many pinoy reporters doing fark up report....lols
              
              Simply one word..irrelevancy

              The pressure is alway, the day u open yr eyes, you think of covering rental and fuel so as to breakeven, after that, you start to think of profit, target and where to eat and rest.
              
              For a working class, the day they open their eyes, they do not need to think of all these, as long as employed in a monthly pay salary, they are paid, even if they take leaves, go MC or play snake at work.
              
              Perhap as a casket and many other jobs person I am, in comparing it with taxi driving which I am also doing, I can probably able to give u a good judgement of taxi driving, and to be frank, taxi driving is a stressful job, whatever you do is at your own expense, one pax drop, you start to look for the next and most of the time, desparately, most aged faster, white hair grown more, balding become more open.

              internet, by the time they realised, too late, and sg papers are
              now consider state papers, no freedom of expression and certainly,
              as we all know, a media for the govt. They are so pathetic that
              they hv to create new like 7k cab driver...just to get interest,

              No, just like Nokia, when iphone and samsung smart phone was on the market, their CEO said "a phone is a phone, a computer is a computer, how can a phone join with computer?"
              
              And before they know it, iphone and samsung overtook them out of nowhere, same goes to sony and the jap. Even now nokia changed their CEO (from microsoft) and go into smartphone, it is too late, you give a nokia to a kids 12 yo, he or she will ask you, what is this? a toy? what nokia..I grown up already leh, not nor kia (teochew) leh
              
              Same goes to SPH, formerly, I did a few morning regular jobs to send SPH exec to jurong plant, those are the nokia days whereby they look smart, majestic and commanding, SPH leh, 6 to 7 mth bonuses, top temasek profit centre, dividend at double digits per year. They can yaya with you all the way, but today..I rejected SPH calls and  pax..lols.

              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">He said the Health Promotion Board (HPB) will work closely with the National Taxi Association (NTA) to get more drivers to lead a healthy lifestyle.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Mr Gan, together with leaders from the NTA, visited some 1,000 taxi drivers at Changi Airport on Friday.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">It was to show their appreciation to those who continue to work on the first day of the Lunar New Year.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The cabbies also received goodie bags, with healthy items like tonic soup and vouchers for medical treatment.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The NTA says it will also work on getting taxi drivers started on sports and exercise programmes.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">“So far we've realised that the participation of our drivers in terms of physical exercise is not as high as we've hoped to see,” said NTA adviser Ang Hin Kee. “Many reasons... (one is) because they have to drive long distances every day; they cover at least 12 hours a day.<br style="font-size: 16px;"></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">“So, we are finding little ways to encourage them to do some stretching while they are in between breaks or in between customers in order to get them started.”<br style="font-size: 16px;"></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Health Minister Mr Gan said the HPB will continue to step up its efforts to reach out to all Singaporeans from all walks of life.<br style="font-size: 16px;"></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.6em; direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 23px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;">“We want to encourage them (all Singaporeans) to stay healthy, so that they not only add years to life but add life to years,” he said. “So, one of the efforts is to work with the various employer organisations, including the taxi association to see how we can reach out to worker groups, employee groups.”<br style="font-size: 16px;"> </p>
