              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Not sure if you all heard about this News. My friend email me, But pls share with your friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beware of Malaysia Taxi !!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; *<br>&gt;&gt; Air purifier in **Malaysia** **taxis<br>&gt;&gt; ( Must Read for your own safety!! ) * No matter the taxi driver is <br>&gt;&gt; chinese, malay or indian, PLEASE BE  AWARE!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If you notice that there is a sound of spray of perfume or air <br>&gt;&gt; purifier inside the taxi,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; PLEASE GET DOWN from the TAXI IMMEDIATELY!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It just happened to me just now. It was about 12.45 am  I got into a<br><br>&gt;&gt; taxi driven by a malay<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; man..<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I was in the taxi for a few minutes, I suddenly heard of a sound of<br>spray and there as a smell&gt; like air  purifier. I felt weird as to why<br>the driver put two types of air purifiers in his taxi.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The smell immediately reminded me about this  forwarded email that I<br>read.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I started to be aware of my surroundings.<br>&gt;&gt; But the puff of the purifier kept appearing every few minutes. I was<br>very worried and scared.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Gradually, I sensed that my body started to feel weaker and weaker.<br>&gt;&gt; The purifier kept puffing from the back seat, just right behind me. <br>&gt;&gt; As I really felt my whole<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; body is weaken, I asked the driver to let me get down at the side<br>road.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; But he kept trying to talk to me and ask me why not dropping me off<br>at my destination.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I think he was trying to drag the time. To my horror, I felt both of <br>&gt;&gt; my hands and legs got numbed and no energy, almost could not move.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; When I talked to the driver, I could not even speak properly, not to<br>say to shout for help, 'cos&gt; I was really too weak...<br>&gt;&gt; Immediately, at a traffic light I opened the door, jumped out and ran<br>to a passer-by for help.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I really thank God for saving me. If not, I really can't imagine what<br><br>&gt;&gt; would have happened to me. I am traumatized by this incident.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This is TRUE case. Please do keep in mind! IT IS BETTER TO BE SAFE<br>THAN SORRY!<br>&gt;&gt; I feel the need to share with you guys, no matter you are men or <br>&gt;&gt; women 'cos it is NOT a<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; LIE , not a made-up story. It really happened. Do let your friends, <br>&gt;&gt; family members and<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; relatives know about this case. I believe you are just like me, don't<br><br>&gt;&gt; wish anybody to be the<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; victim of this case.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 'Please be aware when aboard to a taxi, especially the ladies.'<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I received an email some months ago about a lady getting into a cab <br>&gt;&gt; and felt uneasy and<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; become faint when she smelt something like incense being burnt.<br>&gt;&gt; She was smart enough to order the taxi to stop immediately and after <br>&gt;&gt; throwing some<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; money at the taxi man quickly get out of the taxi. She later got to <br>&gt;&gt; know that if she had not<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; stopped the taxi and gotten out, she would have fainted and raped by <br>&gt;&gt; the taxi man (or a<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; gang of rapists)!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; After reading this, I thought maybe this was one of those emails that<br><br>&gt;&gt; you would read and just forget about it, but I was wrong!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Few weeks ago, a visitor to our Chinese church who stayed in Puchong <br>&gt;&gt; got into a taxi<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; driven by an Indian man. When she sat into the taxi, there was a<br>little burner and she could&gt; smell incense burning in the taxi. After<br>awhile, she felt weak and unable to speak or shout.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The Indian taxi man drove to a lonely road where there was hardly<br>anyone and raped her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Before she was completely knocked out, she was told by the taxi guy <br>&gt;&gt; that she was his<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; number six victim. She was not only raped but also robbed!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; When she was conscious again, she quickly went to see a doctor. The <br>&gt;&gt; sad thing is, the<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; doctor knew she was raped but did not advise her  what to do.<br>&gt;&gt; The doctor just let her make the decision to make or not to make a <br>&gt;&gt; police report. Since she&gt; does not know the rapist name and also the <br>&gt;&gt; taxi number and in great fear after this trauma,&gt; she told the doctor<br><br>&gt;&gt; that she would not dare to report to the police. The doctor said <br>&gt;&gt; since<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; she dare not make the report, he would just have to destroy the<br>medical report!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Because the rapist took her whole bag with her IC in it, he got her <br>&gt;&gt; address and even has<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; the guts to come straight to her house and try to be funny with her.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Please remember not to get into a taxi that smells funny and if <br>&gt;&gt; possible don't get into a taxi&gt; alone, and if you have to do so, give<br><br>&gt;&gt; a call or sms back to your friends or relatives and let<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; them know the taxi registration number and if possible, the name of<br>the taxi man.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; AND OPEN THE WINDOW!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Gals... please take note and...<br>&gt;&gt; Guys... please forward to your female friends...</p>
