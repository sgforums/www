              <p>Japan is rolling out driverless cars 5 years later : <a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Tech-Science/Tech/Japan-to-conduct-road-tests-with-eye-on-2020-Olympics">http://asia.nikkei.com/Tech-Science/Tech/Japan-to-conduct-road-tests-with-eye-on-2020-Olympics</a>.</p>
              <p>Many of the countries that are charging very high taxi fares (like USA and Japan) are researching into driverless taxis.</p>
              <p>Even in Singapore where taxi fares are 1/4 of the rates in Japan, there are researchers collborating with MIT people .</p>
              <p>So would we be eliminated in 5-10 years time by robots and 50,000 pure Singaporeans jobs (which is like half-a million workers factories after considering 1:9 local foreigner ratio) be wiped out?</p>

              <p>You think and worry too much. If robot taxi bang or get banged in an accident, whose fault? CDG claim ka ki?</p>
              <p>If they want to intro robot workforce, the first place will be a robot that cleans the table and clears the rubbish. But the robot costs how much? Robot maintenance contract worth how much? If the robot cock up and hits the customer, who pays? Kopitiam claim ka ki?</p>
              <p>So practically speaking, a robotic workforce got to prove themselves on the front line in a war through drones, robot mules to help soldiers carry heavy loads on the battlefield such as the LS3, autonomous weapons such as phalanx and the PETMAN robot soldier which cannot differentiate between civilians and enemies of course.</p>
              <p>Many technologies we use today originate from military R&amp;D. For instance, the first general purpose computer to be built was the ENIAC. It was used by the US Army to calculate artillery firing tables. After years of refinement through practical usage, it was commercialised for civilian use.</p>
              <p>I give another example. Martial arts originated from ancient warriors coming up with the method to kill their enemies with either bare hands or with weapons. It did not start off from someone thinking of a way to do exercise. Kung fu was meant to kill. Not to win medals in the SEA games or Olympics. I always remind my kids when I teach them that martial arts was invented to attack and kill enemies in ancient China.</p>
              <p>So whenever you see some thing new, first ask yourself whether the military is already using it. If not it means it still got many years of research and improvement to be done. </p>
              <p>In the military, when the robot accidentally kills someone, they dont need to worry about insurance claims. Its only on Singapore roads where we find workshop agents running to victims of a car accident asking whether they need help to do an insurance claim.</p>

              <p>Hardly any research or engineering from NUS, NTU or A-STAR research institutes in Biopolis resulted in a breakthrough product with global sales.</p>
              <p>If you think I am talking nonsense, please name me something Singapore's scientists researched, commercialized and end-users like yourself are using now. Singapore has the world class universities which is correct. But in terms of innovation, we are at the bottom.</p>
              <p>Dont worry about the driverless taxi NTU is making. I fetched the professor who was involved in it before. Research in Singapore will provide some local head-line news in Straits Times every year. But after a while, it becomes dead silent.</p>
              <p>I have seen this bloody nonsense cycle for too long.</p>
              <p>As I said earlier, you need a big country like US and China where their researchers can test their latest research ideas on the battlefield and/or with their huge domestic market. Singapore simply does not have the critical mass to do such things even with a 6.9 million population. Dont forget US is constantly involved in Middle East wars. In order to fully develop our research expertise, we need to help out in global conflicts, and send soldiers to fight using our research innovations. Without this we can only speculate. For instance, say we come up with a drug. How do we know its useful unless we are able to find people to test on?</p>
              <p>What more a driverless taxi? Dont worry until America starts a working fleet. It is still a long way off.</p>

              <p>Do you think driver-less taxis would be welcomed here?</p>
              <p>If they want, they should instead find ways to reduce the costs incurred by the taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>For example, create a new type of taxi which uses less petrol/fuel or no petrol/fuel at all, or create one where the engine is more energy efficient.</p>
              <p> Alternatively, work on the rental fees, by subsidizing (or simply removing) some components of the rental fees.</p>

              <p>This one depends on from whose perspective; taxi rental companies, public or self-employed taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>Personally I think if it ever evolves to that level, it would be only more compelling to introduce driverless cars in developed cities where taxi fares are a lot more expensive than Singapore's like Tokyo, Zurich, Berlin, Nice, London, New York and Sydney.</p>

              <p>Let's hope the government would not approve of them..... 50,000 pure Singaporeans jobs would be wiped out.  The two casinos only brought total of 20000 jobs of which only 10000 went to Singaporeans.   Factories are shifting out of Singapore.  Even neighbouring in lower cost Malaysia, Intel is starting to shift out to Vietnam and China.  There is no way the government could generate 50,000 pure Singaporeans jobs if taxi-drivers are eliminated as this number exceeds the number of SAF regulars employed.  Don't think any 5 MNCs could generate this many pure-Singaporeans' jobs too.</p>

              <p>Portsdown road is a not-so-busy mostly two lane road whereby speed-limit is at most 50km.   It is far from our normal road and highway road situations.   And this is 14 years of R&amp;D as MIT first started to develop their first driverless car prototype in 2002 to participate in the DARPA Grand Challenge 2004.</p>

              <p>10) Vancouver, Canada (1.77 times) </p>
              <p>Based on GDP-per-capital ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita </a> ) , we are comparable with these countries.  But our taxi fares are only a small fraction of these countries.  So if there is any compelling reasons to implement driverless taxis, it would be these countries implementing them fully before we would consider implementing them.</p>

              Dun worry lah, by the time it is in full operation, if might be 20 years from now, you need the infrastructual to maintain, to create and to supply, then you need the rules and regulations, the systems, the operation, the road created, the adminstration like insurance, tax.. the sign...and so on.
              
              I believe even in 20 years time, driverless car will only be in operation at certain enclosed private area and not on the public road, could be in NUS, NTU, feeder buses, and so on.
              
              And then maybe in 30 to 40 years time, it will be in full operation.
              
              And for most of us here, by 30 to 40 years time...we might meet each other in mandai crematorium, if not, could be in the latest waiting list. So, why worry? Be happy
