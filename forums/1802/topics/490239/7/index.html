              <p>yr statement on yr casket business go up year by year. ppl live longer more casket business? dont u tink it should be the other way round. more ppl die than more business.</p>

              Live longer does not imply people will not die, when I was driving casket in 90s, the population is only 4millions, now is roughly 5.6millions, but the casket companies did not increase, drivers still same same, but aged only. So, that could be the reason why business is increasing and even places to put yr urn is almost full, so if free, go book a place first, prices will go up.
                  
              Many of TD lau, who already drove taxi for many years are now unable to shift our of the taxi trade, drive taxi will most probably be their last frontier, more over to many, it is already a comfort zone job. 
              
              Eng eng go kopitiam or geyland also can, where to find this type of job after you had know all the roads and experiences gained.
                  
              So, it is not a matter of no job for taxi drivers, it is a matter of whether taxi drivers are willing to come out of their zone (be if comfort or hard) and change line thru reskilling, upgrading and placing, and I can said, most will not want to be unless the job pay them 4k and above. 
              
              That is the truth of it, many do not want a boss on top of them looking at them working.

              <p>-&gt; live longer means ppl suppose to die now die later.</p>
              <p>so less ppl die now -&gt; how to has  more business?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.7111988067627px;">in 90s, the population is only 4millions, now is roughly 5.6millions.</span></p>
              <p>-&gt;  population increase mainly due to import of FT. However, ppl import</p>
              <p>are not old ppl that going to die. Again this will not contribute to your casket business.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.7111988067627px;">the casket companies did not increase, drivers still same same, but aged only.</span></p>
              <p>-&gt; If business is really that good, why no new player. as long as it is good money will sure attract ppl. </p>
              <p>Last but not lease, if the business is really that good why u still need to drive taxi?</p>
              <p>Therefore, your claim on the below statement that casket business went up from year to year due to ppl getting aged cannot sustain. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 12.9674997329712px; line-height: 15.9629917144775px;">People are getting aged, that we cannot deny, as a casket driver, my business also went up from year to year</span></p>
              <p>Since you are not putting true statement. There is no point to discuss further.</p>

              Everything must come to an end lah, less people die now but population increased, many foreigners wish to die here.

              Nobody sent casket at nite, so I drive taxi at night shift lor, then at the same time, can give excuse to my lau charbo that I go drive taxi mah, but most of the time, can find me at lor 21 kopitiam lah..

              <p> <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">&gt;We cannot simply paint a picture base on illusion that flavor ourselves as a Taxi drivers, we need to be realistic at time, PM Lee do not go visit</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">USA</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">and sit on a driveless car for nothing, the govt is damn interested in it. And why so?</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">It was not PM Lee's real intention to visit USA to sit in a driveless car, it was Google's intention (they are also one of the many companies researching on driveless cars) to make use of the opportunity for PM Lee to see it so that they could push for it.   Remeber one of the jobs of the government is to ensure Singaporeans have jobs and not take away jobs.  PM Lee once said he allowed foreigners in to work on jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do.   He has to be reminded again that taxi driving job is what Singaporeans want to do and want as a backup job.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">&gt;1. To reduce foreigner dependency</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">We do not depend on foreigners for taxi driving....remember it is 100% Singaporeans who are driving the taxis..</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">&gt;2. To catch up with the nos of taxi driver getting aged and flow</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">There is not shortage of new people entering the market as indicated by the number of people who register to take the taxi course.  In fact, another 45,000 Singaporeans who are not active taxi drivers continue to renue their license knowing that they would need it one day.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">&gt;3. To cope with lesser locals taking up taxi driving (as most TD will not ask their son to be taxi driver)</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">In fact it is not there are lesser locals providing personal transportation services.  It is just some of the taxi drivers went to drive for Uber and Grabcar.   So there are actually more cars on the roads providing taxi and no-street hail kind of taxi services.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">&gt;4. To be the first, beside japan, in asia with an advance transport system so as to put ourselves in pole position</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Also what is the advantage of being one of the first few countries to implement driverless taxis?</span><span style="font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">   </span><strong style="font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">I see no advantage</strong><span style="font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">.  On the contrary, there are many disadvantages.  If we are smart, we let the cars manufacturing countries implement them in their own countries before we decide whether to implement here.   Remember these are the real countries that are engaging in R&amp;D for driveless cars.   There would also be social disorders and huge unemployments factors to consider.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">If we are smart, we let the countries that manufacture cars implement what they want in their countries first due to too expensive taxi fares, wait for bugs to be ironed out, observe the social impacts (strikes, crime rates increase, affecting of other industries due to no family purchasing power) first before we do our own feasibility studies.   I spoke to a French once and he said most people in France cannot afford to take taxi there as it is too expensive (this is the reason why the car manufacturing countries are engaging in driveless vehicle R&amp;D).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;"><span style="font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">I will just mention some of the disadvantages here:</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">a) When new vehicles are designed, there is bound to be a lot of bugs and faults which has to be ironed out.  So do we want to allow problematic cars to go on the roads in Singapore?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">b)Our roads here are a lot more congested than countries that are researching on driveless cars.  Do we want to put Singaporeans lives at risk?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">c) It would cause existing 55000 taxi drivers to go jobless with no replacement jobs.   No 5 MNCs could generate 55000 new jobs for Singaporeans (remember more new jobs in Singapore goes to foreigners as the employment ratio of 55% (Singaporeans + PR) vs 45% work permit holders ensure that Singpaporeans would be outnumbered as PRs are actually foreigners.  In fact, it could be 100% by having 55% PRs and 45% work permit holders.  Remember it could directly affect more than 200,000 Singaporeans as taxi drivers are often the breadwinners of the family. It also indirectly affect other industries (eg, kopi tiam, retailshops, supermarkets, electronic stores) and their sales would be down when taxi drivers have no income.   Remember workfare solution is not a solution as it does not guarantee a good job.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">d) There could be social disorders (means strikes).   There definitely could be social disorders in other countries if implemented there.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">e)  Crime rates would increase as too many Singaporeans would be directly affected.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">f) It takes away backup jobs of Singaporeans who may be retrenched later.  These days good jobs with steady income are not easy to get.  Our existing taxi drivers' job is a self-sustaining job in which no additional money needs to be chiped in.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">g) The government loses a huge amount of money that comes from just GST collected for rental (not including fuel GST, ERP, parking and others).  It is approximatly $72 million from all taxi drivers.  This amount is roughly what a MNC that makes $400 milion profit pays in corporate profit tax.  Even a blue-chip like SPH does not bring in so much money for the government (which would later be spent on more meaningful things in the country).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">&gt;5. And most important, out of record, with driveless, they will not have to deal with this grab, uber or taxi drivers problem…people like me gives them many problem hor.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">I suspect the only reason why Grab and uber are allowed to operate in Singapore is to ensure more Singaporeans have jobs.</p>

              <p>Now not like before not easy to find another good job after retrenchment due to influx of foreigners especially those after 45.</p>
              <p>If traditional taxi driving job is replaced by driverless cars, then those Singaporeans who are retrenched lose a very good backup job.   So very little job options would be left for them and they probably would end up working at jobs with no fixed income like financial advisors, property agents, renovation sales coordinators, commissioned-based sales positions as well as cleaners and security guards.  Let us also not forget that the military also releases a lot of signed-on regulars at the age of 45 and 50.</p>
              <p>Also those currently employed may be exploited by their bosses and managers asking them to do this and that or station in a third world country for many years with no back out option.   They may be saying something like....<span style="line-height: 19.696px;">you don't do you, just resign....</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">now not like last time can work as taxi drivers.....I think you would be working as cleaner or security guard.   If start own business, probability of failure much higher than success too.</span></p>
              <p>What happens if they only have one flat (I am not talking about those living in Condo and renting out their HDB flat to foreign talents) and is still paying the load and support a housewife with 2 Singaporean kids and parents?</p>
              <p>Remember, foreign talents who lose their Singaporean jobs could still go back to their own country to buy cheap houses (you know properties for natives of countries like Malaysia, India, Phillipines, Indonesia, Thailand are super cheap) and live comfortably there....Singaporeans who lose their jobs in Singapore are stuck with the Singaporean cost of living (which expatriates rated as highest in the world).</p>

              <p>This world is progressing towards an economy driven by robots and artificial intelligence (AI). Embrace it we must. Reject it we must not.</p>
              <p>Already we have sex robots that can provide warmth (through batteries) and some speech.</p>
              <p>Even our MDT technology has advanced. Rickshaw era no MDT. Then came the radio and walkie talkie.</p>
              <p>Our humble Creative 99 PC is long gone. I used to own it. I still remember 20 yrs ago, there were shops in funan and peninsula and sim lim selling pirated software on 5.25" floppy disks. Now no more.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting our police. Last time wear shorts and chase people with sticks. Now they wear long pants and learn how to take cover.</p>
              <p>You worried about driverless cabs? What if robots started taking over the classrooms? What about the soldiers and police and fighter pilots being replaced by advanced robots in 20 years?</p>
              <p>What if the day comes when geylang no longer needs thai or prc pros because the robot can do everything a girl can do on bed plus operate 24/7?</p>
              <p>Fear is the path to the dark side.. Fear leads to anger.. Anger leads to hate.. Hate leads to suffering.. </p>
              <p>Remember the movie - The attack of the clones - from star wars. Mankind are already exploring other habitable earth-like planets. Whatever u see on the silver screen is a prophecy. It will all come true. The day will come when robot clones are used in space wars, not just wars on earth.</p>
              <p>When this day comes, many many traditional jobs will go. Remember the dinosaur called T. rex? So big so strong so powerful. It went extinct because it cannot adapt to a changing planet.</p>

              <p>Retail shops at HDB would not disappear because ordinary Singaporeans want retail shops to survive.</p>
              <p>If everything is online, then we would be in trouble as everything is controlled by some people who could not handle viruses and backdoor bugs planted in OS.</p>
              <p>When more jobs disappear, more would want to drive taxis.</p>
              <p><strong>The bottomline is those pushing for driverless taxis are unable to generate as many new good jobs for Singaporeans in Singapore.  </strong></p>
              <p>If they are somehow able to generate equivalence amount of good jobs, it has to be shared with FTs which means more than 100,000 new good service sector (even more if you talk about Marine sector, construction sector or manufacturing sector) jobs need to be generated.</p>

              Driveless or any other new technology shall create it own value chain of jobs, eg driverless shall create programming jobs, driverless car repair jobs, driveless GPS pod maintenance and servicing jobs which are higher skill jobs that require higher knowledge and skill, and that is where upgrading and skilfuture come into the picture. 
                      
              And with a diminishing of local population, that fit well into training our locals (the youngs one, not us hor, we lau kok kok liao, train smlj also no use) into the innovation economy that will outdate the 70s' industrial and 90's knowledge economy.
                      
              And with it, less manpower are required, and that fit into the reduction of foreign dependency. Robotics and automation is not new, you can see it changes and happening day by day. Just like you drive taxi today, from nets to ezlink to credit cards..and the next day you go ATM...you notice that you do not even need to face a human. And it is 24hrs, and you can also do internet banking transfer with just the tip of yr finger.
                      
              Finance industrial is one such industrial that is doing it, and you can see that they are retrenching thousands of ah nehs and foreign expat day by day, so if you wonder why today foreign ah neh are not so proud, because they are also under threat as banks go into internet banking and automation.
