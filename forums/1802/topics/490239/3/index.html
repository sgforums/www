              <p>Driverless cars also means casket driving would be replaced...only need to program to drive slower.   What I am saying is we only go driverless if can really generate equal no of same or better jobs and not eliminate jobs which we could preserve.</p>
              <p>You see Coke factory also automated but must shift away.. Many years ago Western Digital already shifted away.   Seagate maintain some plants in Singapore only because government stepped in to lower their operating cost.</p>
              <p>We can don't have driverless taxis as our taxi fare is relatively cheap compared to other developed countries and we can keep foreigners (only those with Singapore citizenship by birth or converted can drive) out and driverless cars out.  We don't have to downgrade to non-developed world standards .   However if our new drivers depend on GPS, someone would say even taxi drivers depend on Googlemap GPS and use it as an excuse to eliminate us.</p>
              <p>I really cannot foresee how additional 55000 jobs could be generated with introduction of driverless taxis.</p>

              <p>My understanding is people have been saying Japanese taxi fare is too high..... and they have more taxis than needed ( <a href="http://blog.japantimes.co.jp/yen-for-living/pity-the-driver-cabbie-salaries-much-lower-than-average/">http://blog.japantimes.co.jp/yen-for-living/pity-the-driver-cabbie-salaries-much-lower-than-average/</a> ).  Their taxi fare is 4 times ours but their cabbies make less money than us (especially after tax. 3 million yen per year is S$34675.57 per year).  This is despite us having the highest cost of puting vechiles on roads due to high vechile tax and COE.  Something is not right with their system.</p>
              <p>Also if driverless cars replace human drivers, then 375600 Japanese taxi drivers (not including their family members) would end up like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaxgmmjNrpA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaxgmmjNrpA</a></p>

              <p>Driverless cars also means casket driving would be
              replaced...only need to program to drive slower.   What I am
              saying is we only go driverless if can really generate equal no of
              same or better jobs and not eliminate jobs which we could
              preserve.</p>
              <p>You see Coke factory also automated but must shift away.. Many
              years ago Western Digital already shifted away.   Seagate
              maintain some plants in Singapore only because government stepped
              in to lower their operating cost.</p>
              <p>We can don't have driverless taxis as our taxi fare is
              relatively cheap compared to other developed countries and we can
              keep foreigners (only those with Singapore citizenship by birth or
              converted can drive) out and driverless cars out.  We don't
              have to downgrade to non-developed world standards .   However
              if our new drivers depend on GPS, someone would say even taxi
              drivers depend on Googlemap GPS and use it as an excuse to
              eliminate us.</p>
              <p>I really cannot foresee how additional 55000 jobs could be

              If you visit PSA, there is a lack of crane operator, a very high paid job, but no one want to work on it, now they go into digital eyes to download and upload containers, automated, man is just needed to station below to operate it like playing video games, and it was quicker and more accurate.
              
              This is one example of semi manless crane in operation today at PSA, such innovation reduced our relying on foreign talent intake, next, own self check in at Changi AP, it reduced the manpower needed and therefore reduced foreign staff, coming up with driverless transport is mainly for cancelling out the over relying on PRC and malaysia Drivers, if you can create a driverless LRT, why not buses, remember the old day where buses is run by electricity (HK still have), manless. Now we are just going back to revisit it.
              
              Singaporeans are aging, our local manpower is reducing, and if we keep rely on Foreigners, govt will loose our, citizens will also loose our, values and culture will be affected, identity and belonging will be distorted. So, the initiatives to support automation by govt is a much welcome notion, and we, be it TD, chay kway teow towkay, bankers, bangers, or arsholes..must support it, if we still keep our kiasu and kiasee image within on losing our job, then, we might lose it to foreigner if we do not innovate now.

              <p>Crane operator is good job that Singaporeans wants to do.... look at how MP Png Eng Huat presented ( h<a href="http://www.feecha.com/single/5982003992199168">ttp://www.feecha.com/single/5982003992199168</a> ).  Bus driver job is what we need foreigners to work since less number of Singaporeans wants it.   But taxi job is what Singaporeans want as main and backup job.  Driverless LRT is a lot easier to implement than driverless buses because they are fixed routes on tracks without obstacles.  Also there would be problem with money collection if driverless buses are implemented.</p>

              <p>People pushing for driverless cars are tied to tech people..... they obviously would not briefed the authorities saying 55000 jobs would be eliminated with a lot less generated and it would affect 220,000 Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>They also definitely would not say Singapore's taxi fare is 1/4 those of other developed countries and is very competitive by developed countries' standard.</p>
              <p>They also would not tell the authorities that in other developed countries, driverless cars has not been approved by their respective parliaments or congress.</p>
              <p>Also there is no compelling reasons to implement driverless cars and the technology is far from ready.  For example, it defintely would have problems navigating during heavy rains, it has not been tested operating at 90 km/h, it has not been tested in congested roads, there are too many signs to identify, it could not tell whether a person at the roadside is flagging, it cannot accept cash payment, it could not self wash vehicle, it would have problems knowing where passengers want to go (many old people have problems communicating in English, it would have problems navigating in HDB carparks (eg stop at rubbish area of blk 13 and stop under shelter) and condos (eg Tower 11 of basement 2), it would have problems stopping for cash-card payment, it does not know how to take instructions from security guards, it could not help passengers with luggages, it does not know how to follow carpark marshall instructions at changi airport, it does not know how to queue at taxi stands, it cannot help wheelchair passengers .....it would have problems at Jurong Island checkpoint....it cannot self search for street hail passengers......it would have problems driving through narrow streets of private estates whereby people park on both sides of the roads especially when here are cars from the opposite direction.... it could not understand simple instructions like stop behind the red lorry or at house no 57....the list of things that driverless taxis cannot perform goes on and one....</p>

              <p>The situation is 55000 Singaporeans jobs get eliminated while a lot less are generated (possible only 1% new jobs and it would be 55/45 (PR+Singapores vs foreigners) split with foreigners)....and these new jobs generated still have to be shared with foreigners.  Considering the fact the PRs are included in local ratio, very likely there would be more foreigners in the 1% newly generated jobs while eliminating 99% more Singaporeans.   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is this what we want (eliminating 99% Singaporeans for less than 0.5% Singaporeans)?</span>  I say the person pushing for driverless car in Singapore forget the Singapore National Pledge and possibly is promised of some benefits to push for driverless taxis.</p>
              <p>Is there a need to eliminate Singaporeans taxi drivers when we are very competitive by developed countries' standard charging only 1/4 of what taxis in other developed countries are charging?  We also obviously do not want to drop to Malaysian, Chinese or Indian standards too.</p>

              <p>Where got no choice......taxi 55000 active drivers want with another 50000 holding taxi license who continue to renew it knowing they would need it when they get retrenched.... so people who are taking bribes from foreigners to push to open up taxi industry to foreigners or driverless taxis have nothing to say since Singaporeans indicated that we want taxi as main and backup jobs.</p>
              <p>Bus driving is what a lot of Singaporeans do not want to do.... but it seems that new bloods are entering that market too including lady degree holders ( <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/senior-minister-of-state-for-transport-calls-for-more-women-bus-drivers">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/senior-minister-of-state-for-transport-calls-for-more-women-bus-drivers</a> )</p>

              What no choice, there are choice in life, either individual or in a group, just like the recent election, it is a group choice, people choose that Govt, so be it. So when people mandated them, mean that people agreed to the white paper of 6.9 million populations, that is a group choice. 
              
              And why u need so many TD, because of increase in populaton, same goes to housing, notice more and more are built, but if you are to reduce the population, do you still need 55000 cabbies? like in 80s when I driving, population only 3 millions ++, you just need 30k cabbies, and more than enuf, because rental was low, vehicle was cheap and good.
              
              So to reduce that human dependency, automation and robotic is the way to go, Japan also hv a aging population, and yet they do not need or do not wish to take in foreigners, as it will erode their culture, like today SIngapore, become a rojak culture with no identity.
              
              Eh..you SIngaporean ar? Yes, China Singaporean or Malaysia Singaporean??
