              <p>Let us wait and see whether their parliament would approve of driverless-taxi in Australia..... it would drive a lot of Australians jobless.   However they seem to be headed in that direction since their taxi-fare is 4 times ours.</p>
              <p>Take note also that they are planing to spend US$20 billion to generate 500 new jobs for Australians if they joint-venture with Japan to build Soryu class submarines in Australia ( <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/will-japanese-subs-be-built-in-australia/">http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/will-japanese-subs-be-built-in-australia/</a> ) .  Introducing driverless-taxis would eliminate at least 50000 Australian jobs.</p>

              50000 Australia Jobs will also be created to manufacture Driveless vehicle and enhancing it technologies. So in a nutshell, does not mean, car go driveless, drivers no job, it mean that lower jobs like driving will be out, and newer higher skill job will be here, that is why our govt also invested in Skillfuture for All Singaporeans.
              
              If you cannot get employed due to you unable to take up the more skill needed job, you are consider as structural unemployed, meaning, there are jobs, but you cannot fit in.

              <p>Hardly any research or engineering from NUS, NTU or A-STAR
              research institutes in Biopolis resulted in a breakthrough product
              with global sales.</p>
              <p>If you think I am talking nonsense, please name me something
              Singapore's scientists researched, commercialized and end-users
              like yourself are using now. Singapore has the world class
              universities which is correct. But in terms of innovation, we are
              at the bottom.</p>
              <p>Dont worry about the driverless taxi NTU is making. I fetched
              the professor who was involved in it before. Research in Singapore
              will provide some local head-line news in Straits Times every year.
              But after a while, it becomes dead silent.</p>
              <p>I have seen this bloody nonsense cycle for too long.</p>
              <p>As I said earlier, you need a big country like US and China
              where their researchers can test their latest research ideas on the
              battlefield and/or with their huge domestic market. Singapore
              simply does not have the critical mass to do such things even with
              a 6.9 million population. Dont forget US is constantly involved in
              Middle East wars. In order to fully develop our research expertise,
              we need to help out in global conflicts, and send soldiers to fight
              using our research innovations. Without this we can only speculate.
              For instance, say we come up with a drug. How do we know its useful
              unless we are able to find people to test on?</p>
              <p>What more a driverless taxi? Dont worry until America starts a
              working fleet. It is still a long way off.</p>

This country has many restrictions and limitations when it comes to encouraging innovation. I speak from experience. Singapore will never be known for innovation. It cannot even make good copies and improve on them like china. It also cannot add innovations to existing tech and make them into beautiful n functional products loved by everyone around the world - like apple. Its all to do with having tight governance over a tiny nation. I can tell you china does innovation better than singapore.
              
              This is a safe n comfy country at the end of the day. So what i say is meaningless to most. So nothing will change when it comes to cultivating innovative minds.

              <p>50000 Australia Jobs will also be created to manufacture
                          Driveless vehicle and enhancing it technologies. So in a nutshell,
                          does not mean, car go driveless, drivers no job, it mean that lower
                          jobs like driving will be out, and newer higher skill job will be
                          here, that is why our govt also invested in Skillfuture for All

              <p>If you cannot get employed due to you unable to take up the more
                          skill needed job, you are consider as structural unemployed,

              <p>I dare bet with you there would not be 50,000 Australian jobs created to manufacture driverless cars.  When those drivers go jobless, the country have to support them giving them unemployment benefits every month as they are a welfare country.  Crimes rates also would go up since the whole family is short of money.</p>
              <p>When robots were introduced in factories in the 1980s, the push for it was it would enable companies in expensive countries to be competitive in manufacturing and thereby preserving jobs.</p>
              <p>Driving is not low end job.  There would not be any replacement jobs once these are taken over by driverless cars.   And we could keep the driverless cars out and preserve jobs.   It is not structural unemployment that we cannot fit in....it is something we do not need to eliminate ourselves since there is no real benefits using driverless cars as they take away jobs from a lot more ordinary people and create a lot less jobs for another group of people who are pushing for driverless cars.  It is like making 50,000 people suffer for 500 people and claiming the 50000 people cannot fit in when the other 500 people are not needed.</p>
              <p>Can you imagine in Singapore if driverless cars are introduced?   Lorries, buses, taxis, crane heavy vehicles, cement trucks are taken over by driverless cars?  How many people would lose their jobs and how many new jobs could be created for them once the jobs are lost?   Yes the countries that manufacture driverless cars gets a lot more jobs but people in other countries suffer.  <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 13.4425px;">Skillfuture for All Singaporeans </span></p>
              <p>does not generate jobs.... it only cause you to spend more time going for training with no assurance of any job.  Even incentives for companies to employ Singaporean PMETs only last for one year.   We have seen recently very automated Coca-Cola declaring that they would shift away to cheaper Malaysia.  We can only foresee more manufacturing companies shifting away and more Singaporeans finding it harder to find new jobs.   Now, even cash rich Temasek is selling off NOL after selling off Chartered Semiconductors years ago.</p>
              <p>For the same reasons I have been refusing to use GPS to navigate as it would mean relying on companies that push for driverless cars to eliminate drivers job.   Once you depend on them, you would be vulnerable.   If too many people depend on GPS to navigate, it would give people the excuse to eliminate traditional drivers and claim we cannot keep up with time when it really is they cannot generate same number of jobs for people that they plan to eliminate.</p>
              <p>Can you visualize what jobs Singaporeans could do if manufacturing-related and driving jobs are lost?</p>

              Osim and combat boots are not ground breaking innovations. This is too boring. You got to think bigger and more complicated than this. Modern technology is extremely complex. Osim and the rest of the mechanical massage companies are still unable to come up with a massage robot that can replace a human being. The technology is not trivial and the R&amp;D costs are formidable. I do not believe they got such a product on the pipeline.
              
              Science is always limited by funding. Here in Singapore, research grants are mostly from the government, who have never believe in supporting local talent. Their basic idea of importing senior scientists and so called whales here is only good for elevating Singapore onto the world map. It does not inspire confidence in local scientists and in fact has quite the opposite effect on encouraging youths to pursue a scientific career. This is the biggest flaw of their policies. Granted it does achieve fast short term results. A-star got many things to boast, although none of it is really ground-breaking, or can be directly translated and applied in a real product for international consumption.
              
              My conclusion after observing them for the last 20 years is that it was never in their interest to foster local scientific talent, which is a basic ingredient for innovation. Innovation takes alot of time and money. Nobody will want to share their ideas if a senior figure head within a-star, such as a executive director or renowed principal investigator can just take their ideas away and call it their own. This pilfering of ideas is a basic problem in many singapore government agencies, such as WDA and MINDEF. It is not just an a-star issue.
              
              All these issues pertaining to 'restrictions and limitations to fostering innovation in singapore' are very political in nature, and I do not expect anything to change.
              
              It is also linked to the fact that our ministers choose to sending their best and brightest overseas. As long as this continues, it directly implies singapore is not good enough, our local universities are not the best, and the top scientific jobs will always be mostly filled by foreigners.

              There is a saying, it is not who is the best. It is whether you believe in yourself that you are the best. If the family and country is firmly behind you, I would say the sky is the limit. But here in Singapore, one should consider themselves lucky if even their parents have such conviction in their own children.
              
              Look at the Singapore's sports scene. Look at our table tennis players and how they came on board. Isn't it the same old formula passed down by LKY?
              
              So it was never about squeezing the best out of the locals. It was always about finding the best around the world and shipping them here. With such a policy, how could you expect many people to invest the prime of their lives doing science and innovating?
              
              The only place this is feasible is really in California. Singapore does not have the time for you.
