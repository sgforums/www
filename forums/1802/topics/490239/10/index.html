              <p>Where got cannot do anything about it.   In manufacturing you cannot do anything about it because your products have to sell overseas and factories that use robots normally could produce at cheaper prices.</p>
              <p>But taxi is a different case, we can kept "cannot meet our requirements driverless taxis"  out of Singapore.   Remember we are very competitive by developed countries' standard as we charge very low despite highest cost of putting cars to roads.</p>
              <p>Very stupid right, eliminate very competitive industry in Singapore when we could protect it for Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Are you also trying to say nowadays strawberry generation dun drive cars one?</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to TV topic... that partially explains why sales of digital TV is not good for Japanese companies.   Sharp kena taken over, Panasonic stopped production of plasma and LCD TV already.  Sony has no facilities for producting LCD TV.  Toshiba is ending production of TV.</p>
              <p>I am exactly different from that generation.   I always have one portable TV cum DVD,VCD,CD,Radio + Game console in my taxi whenever I drive.   Many a times, while waiting for customers in the queue, I would watch my portable console.   And I do not carry a smart phone and only surf the net at home.</p>

              <p>Anyway, the so-called driverless taxi that would be hitting the roads in Singapore is actually run by SMRT in no to little traffic districts at 40 km/h: <a href="https://vulcanpost.com/573390/shit-is-getting-real-smrt-is-bringing-in-24-seaters-driverless-cars-end-of-this-year-in-singapore/">https://vulcanpost.com/573390/shit-is-getting-real-smrt-is-bringing-in-24-seaters-driverless-cars-end-of-this-year-in-singapore/.  </a></p>
              <p>The real threat is from nuTonomy which aims to introduce thousands of driverless taxis in a few years time (I thought LTA only allows new taxi operators very limited number of taxis until they could consistently show compliance with service standards).</p>

              <p>Not exactly true in this context. You see when machines are invented since the 17th century, there is still a need of the operator, which is the human. Thus these machines still create jobs for the people in another way. Just that it increases productivity with less people. <br><br>Fast forward to the present, this era is different and you can call it, scary. Computer, IT, nanotechnology, and AI, combined can typically replace most of the jobs that the human can do. The computer can even govern another computer behaviour without any human interferance. <br>Here comes the worrying part, in the next 2 to 3 decades, AI computing, nanotech, robotics, etc wil replace almost all kinds of jobs that the human can do and they are much faster, productive, intelligent, and they don't need breaks, holidays and leaves, don't demand wages, don't strike, etc. Most of all, given the Moore's law and diminishing costs of building technology, humans are facing a threat for the majority. Are we redundant? Is singularity going to be real? <br>Is it a good thing when you don't need to work or is it a bad thing when you are jobless?</p>

              <p>Proponents of technology will swear that technology can replace human.  The human eye has evolved over millions of years and reports have indicated that it has a resolution of some 576 megapixels, more than any camera resolution available today. But not only that, it can move around at split seconds, has spatial resolution and combine with your brain and life experiences to make sense of the surroundings.</p>
              <p>Driving is not simply eye and hand coordination. It involves emotions and life experiences.  A simple stopping at the bus stop mentioned above is an example. The DT vehicle will simply not stop because the rules are there to prevent it from doing so.  But the human is different.  He takes calculated risks and these are the result of life experiences which a computer does not have or will not be allowed to have.</p>
              <p>Finally, it is not only about technology, but human factors as well. How proficient we are in using these technologies. Someone using an autonomous/driverless vehicle for about 10,000 km without accident will end up being complacent and trust the machine completely. And that's where the danger lies should the computer screw up as in this unfortunate case.</p>

              Behind every successful advancement of human technology, there will be scarification, we invented rocket and flying machines with much scarification, not to mention that till today, accident still happen even with advance auto piloting and pin point GPS guidance.
              
              The world must know that there are more human accident than robotics one, on the road itself, human driven cars created more accident and death per day than a day in WWII and those flying. Because human are all born to make mistake, we educate and civilize  ourselves to prevent those mistakes or simply, to lesser it.
              
              Everyday on Singapore road alone, there are much more accident than industrial accidents, and no matter how you look at robotic and digitalization technology such as driverless car, it is also a creation of human, and as said, human are born to make mistake, people will push on to make it near perfection, but never a 100% perfection.
              
              We must therefore, like it or not, embrace the changes in view of nothing is perfect, but at least it is near perfection, no computer anti virus is able to protect itself from getting hacked, no machine will go on and produce perfect or the same product, there will be mistake, accident and even fatal, and human knows it, that is why, there are tow truck on standby, TP on standby, and casket driver like me on standby.

              <p>Wah...going at 50 km/h already got 1 fatality per 130 million miles (compared with 94 million miles for those driving at up to above max normal road speed).</p>
              <p>So we definitely must adopt a "wait and see" attitude for driverless cars before we even consider letting them go on our normal "unrestricted" heavy traffic roads.</p>

              when microwave was introduced, pple said got smlj radiation, food eat already can get cancer and so on, but today, microwave is as common as yr house fridge.
              
              LRT is already a driveless technology, if we think driveless is far away, it will happen, it is the buzzword of tomorrow (not our time) mode of transport, and whichever firms make the first successful move into it, will see billions in return, and down the value chain of this new project, many will hop in, from services to supplier to human talent needed to programme and operate it.
              
              We can deny it existence and safety, but how long are we going to deny it, as a driver, I am always a opponent of driverless rather than a proponent of it. But the truth is no matter who you are going to oppose and view it, it will be here, if faster 10 years time,  slower 15 years time. But you have to agree that it will arrive. Because there is technology, it is a matter of infrastructure adjustment. When the Ford brother created that first motor car, it knock into a tree, then into a river, then into a strawberry farm, the brothers also get injured here and there, and proponent of it (using horse / cow cart) were laughing at them, then GM signed a contract with them, and the rest is history.
              
              In the history of mankind, create and procreate work hand in hand, we are always in constant changes, from dial phone to handphone, in the 80s, people will laughing over it, how can there be a phone held on hand, and those who laugh at it were former singtel operators, now lau char bor liao.

              Driverless car is also the same, you need a group of operators to control at the control room, just like LRT, and today bullet train in japan are driverless too, but there are security personnel station to mend it.
              
              Same goes to aircraft, if there is no auto pilot, there will be a lack of pilots in the market, because pilot will hv to hold the steering wheel for 2 to even 18 hrs, that will tire them out and will take longer rest for them, but today, with auto piloting for both in the air and landing, most can relax better and can go for a few more trips.
              
              So, in time to come, driverless does not imply no one is controlling it, there will be some control over it.

              However, that somebody who control it must be highly skilled and trained, he or she must be IT savy, global coordinate knowledge and have a fundamental skill on robotic functions and system. 
              
              And that is why our govt had keep emphasis on Upskilling and education. 
              
              Locals had been commenting on foreign input and coming into our society, England also face these issues, so they, the people of England decided to stand up and seek break away from EU so that foreign access into England will be control or limited and that will provide job for the locals. Of course this is only one of the reason, there are many other reasons.
              
              So, if Singapore is going to break away from who??? Asean?? Asia??? it will come to no effect, therefore our govt, who are politically inclined is beginning to feel the pinch of too much foreign eroding their popularity among the local youngs. And to reduce foreign dependency under a low birthrate and aging society will be automation, robotic and digitalization. 
              
              Today bus drivers consist of 1/2 foreigners, 1/2 locals and PRs. If we can train the locals to operate driverless bus in a nice aircon control room, we do not need that 1/2 foreigners, who could jolly well go back to them homeland. Govt do not want to keep issuing PRs and new citizenship, there must be stoppage somewhere, and they felt that by going robotic and all those technology, it is the key.
