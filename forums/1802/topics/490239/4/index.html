              <p>What no choice, there are choice in life, either individual or
                                  in a group, just like the recent election, it is a group choice,
                                  people choose that Govt, so be it. So when people mandated them,
                                  mean that people agreed to the white paper of 6.9 million
                                  populations, that is a group choice.</p>
              <p>And why u need so many TD, because of increase in populaton,
                                  same goes to housing, notice more and more are built, but if you
                                  are to reduce the population, do you still need 55000 cabbies? like
                                  in 80s when I driving, population only 3 millions ++, you just need
                                  30k cabbies, and more than enuf, because rental was low, vehicle
                                  was cheap and good.</p>
              <p>So to reduce that human dependency, automation and robotic is
                                  the way to go, Japan also hv a aging population, and yet they do
                                  not need or do not wish to take in foreigners, as it will erode
                                  their culture, like today SIngapore, become a rojak culture with no
                                  identity.</p>
              <p>Eh..you SIngaporean ar? Yes, China Singaporean or Malaysia
                                  Singaporean??</p>

              <p>The election results did not imply that Singaporeans in general approve of 6.9 million population... it only says that Singaporeans think PAP is doing a good enough job in general (not in all areas) ...some voted PAP because of goodies given our before elections, Pioneer Generation package and lift-upgrading politics.  Incidentally, foreigners sway election results by about 3% per 4-5 years (which also means Ajunied Workers Party is in jeapody next election).</p>
              <p>You only automate if you are not competitive relative to your peer countries.....<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> robots are supposed to complement not eliminate humans.</span>  Incidentally our taxi industry is more competitive than Japan's due to better business self-employed taxi drivers model that charges economical taxi rates that consumers could afford to pay.  In Tokyo, a trip from airport to Toyko downtown cost S$289.97 (<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> </span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">25,350 for </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">only 60km).  If use our rate of 22 cents per 350m, it should only cost $37.7+$3 surcharge.   Even if you take during midnight + advanced booked + use Chrysler limo taxi, ours is a lot cheaper than theirs.  If we charge using their rates, we only have to make one trip per day and could call it a day.</span></p>
              <p>There are more cabbies now because many Singaporeans were eliminated for foreign workers but it is also true that when the population is bigger, more taxi drivers are needed.  However, this demand would drop when the new MRT lines are completed.  Quite a few passengers that I ferried told me they were seriously considering joining the taxi industry.   So taxi industry is where a lot of people who are retrenched or have to do a mid-career switch would end up at.   Many people from SAF and police after they have to stop working there at age of 45 (SGTs and Enciks) would become taxi drivers.   I ever met a Lt-Colonel from SAF who became a property agent and a SAF Captain who became a renovator.  Many white collars who got retrenched would also end up as taxi drivers due to not willing to go under younger superiors and companies not willing to train them.  Also there are cases of people who could not get along with their new ex-superiors and those not willing to relocate to other countries which their companies want to force them to do so.  One IT customer I had told me he quit his IT job last time because he could not handle the workload and his company was not willing to hire one more person to help.

              In SAF, soldiers who are really good and crazy about weapons, know how to shoot and improvise, can get transferred out of unit. Deemed as xiao lang.
              
              People like me lor. So good until they transferred me to service vocation, even though I was pes A combat fit.
              
              Last time during ICT, they passed us a form asking whether we will fight for this country. All I can say is this country better dun go war. In a war, you need crazy, fearless soldiers who are patriotic. This country has none. Come to war time, all will run. Those who think they want to stay and fight are the real crazy people because while they were still in NS, they are just passing time.

              <p>If attacked all the way to Singapore, sure fight one....not fighting means surendering and becoming slaves.. however, not all solders who received military trainings before would get a rifle as we do not have enough...   The issue is if war is at other countries whether we would fight or not...  if they asked this question in that survey, most Singaporean guys would say NO.</p>

              Fighting a war requires organisation. SAF soldiers never fought a real gun battle before. Most soldiers never even fight in public before. Come to real war without preparation and experience is sure die. I think soldiers in thailand n philipines will do better than us coz many people keep guns at home and live in a high crime society.
              
              
              Put soldiers aside. Our weapons systems also can fail. Its a proven fact - our saf generals cannot even solve out MRT problems - still want to hao lian and claim we got advanced weaponry that is deadly? I believe many things in SAF will fall apart in an actual combat.

              <p>Confrontation time, those in Mindef Res like you, like me will be activated, you tell me, take your passport and run?.......</p>
              <p>Things won't just happen overnight in this kind of tech savvy era, after Kuwait experience, I don't think any countries in this world will have a right mind not to build up their national defence.......</p>
              <p>Did all their soldiers been war before? What you see currently so call war action in middle east, is not a war.......</p>

              National defence is essential. If the day comes, I got nowhere else to go. But I wont be on the front line simply because of my role. Blame it on my youth back then, too smart and pattern many many. I avoided combat duty in saf even though I was was combat fit.  Many NSF envied me. Anyway my reservist was completed years ago. My time inside was really wasted. I wished to be in a combat role firing at enemies, but no chance lor, due to being keh kiam when I was young. Charging up the hill is still better than idling around at the canteen and hiding in the bunk.
              
              But hor many army officers talk with so much pride about national defense. All standard pattern, standard response. I already heard until sian.
              
              I tell u the truth, there is no replacement for testing our weaponry and soldiering in actual combat. All those exercise dont involve ground combat with live rounds and risk of death.
              
              Problem two is until today, we have no practical SOP if our MIA and KIA soldiers start coming back by the thousands. How is MINDEF going to respond to crying mothers and fathers? Over the years, there were many isolated accidents resulting in death. Many cases were kept confidential, some were highlighted. Wartime is different liao. I expect Singapore SOP to be no different from Russia and China.
              
              Problem three. We are unlike Israel. They are homogenous nation with thousands of years of history fighting neighbours. Singapore only used diplomacy against neighbours. We never engaged in combat before. Its a good thing of course, but remember we are not Israel.
              
              The last problem are the kill ratios in an actual war. The Sino-Japan wars interest me. One Jap soldier death versus 2-3 PRC deaths. And Beijing capital was shifted hundreds of kilometers inland. Here in Singapore, we got limited active personnel and nowhere to run. This is the biggest reason why many people commented that during wartime, our elites will run away.

              I forgot another issue. PAP likes to talk about asymmetric combat and punching about the waist. Doing more with less. yadayada. But come to mindef, I do not forsee us acquiring nuclear weapons. We excelled on the economic side, but national defense wise, we are at a very serious disadvantage. No possibility of using nuclear weapons and having to fight much larger neighbours purely using conventional methods.
              
              As we all know, sinkie better make full use of diplomacy. Talk until cannot talk still must talk.
              
              The moment, weapons are mobilised, our elite families and their children will flee leaving families of cabbies, security guards, hawkers and delivery drivers to hold off aggressors.
              
              I will of course volunteer and grab the rifle, grenade and artillery. All those patriotic regulars like KTC better join me and rush to the frontline when asked. And dont come and tell me the ah mat tank that got exploded is what 4D number hor. Just load and keep firing.

              <p>Luckily. in the civilian world and civil service, military rank has no weightage unless you can get at least BG rank (will be given a no-rental Mercedes and free driver to use with "star/s' in front of vehicle ).  Otherwise many seniors would be unhappy as 18-19 years old "new birds" climb to rank of 3SGT and 2LT so fast..... even 1WO have to address a 18 years old no voting rights without degree 2LT who is without any experience as SIR.</p>
              <p>Corporal also can climb to the rank of Minister, Subordinate Court Judge, Professor, CEO, MP, manager, VP, Senior Counsel, Principal of school and boss.</p>
              <p>I also saw before a LCP becoming casino floor manager (the kind that wears suit).</p>
              <p>As we have seen, Lt-Colonel and CPT also can drop to just property agent and taxi driver.</p>

              <p>Ani zhun, when we in this topic, today open mob......<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p>Well, many things I cannot elaborate here, or else later MSD come knock my door.......</p>
              <p>How we going to defend if war break out? Where is the buffer zone? Our concept of ops?......etc</p>
              <p>All this are in Need to Know, Need to Hold basis......</p>
              <p>Hierachy system is necessary, regardless of age or education background, If you watch "Saving Pte Ryan" before, Tom Hank also a young officer........</p>
              <p>Peacetime, in order to maintain high efficiency of our forces, changes is unpreventable, that's why now we have this ME ranking also......</p>
              <p>Like what I have mentioned, each soldier have their own duty and liabilities to serve, including me......</p>
              <p>If today you are standby force, lang lang load up tonner and shout up......</p>
              <p>If today you are a aircraft technician, lang lang go system check before our fighters jet scrammer off......</p>
              <p>Not depend on your capability,  I'm good in kungfu, must sent me to war front, no, not like that, only in computer gaming we can do that......</p>
              <p>Is what's your vocation you have serve in, mai kay kian, how you want to keng in army is your decision, your vocation will be with you for life time.......</p>
              <p>Yes, I agree that, army don't really take good care of those who have serve and retired, that's why very common we will see a Captain ended become a Captain, Bell Captain......</p>
              <p>But that's beside the point, National Defence, when he don back his uniform, he will still got a duty to serve......</p>
              <p>My responsibility if tio activated is not very critical to the whole force, but at least I got a bunch of banging bros to look after, increase their morale, we receive mission order, we execute it switchly, just like TD, go out one piece, we come back one piece, beyond that, is not within my capabilities to control......</p>
              <p>General will plan, G1 to G4 will be stressed, but we don't overwrite just because we think we know.......</p>
              <p>That's SAF.......</p>
              <p>Lastly, most MID plate either 3 number or 5 number, very difficult to whack 4D, hopefully if war break out, SGpool will still operate, at least in field, soldiers nothing to do can play scratch.......<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></span></p>

              Chao keng like me. Peace or war time, little bro down there still need to fire. I got an important role to provision.
              
              During the last 2 world wars, it was about imperial japs and nazi germany. Today its the militant muslims found globally, and who got great financing. No goverment wants to acknowledge that world war 3 is already upon us. But its a fact. No more conventional napoleon era style of war. Todays war is fought in pockets globally, just like stage 4 cancer. Chop one tumor, it comes out somewhere.
              
              Again saf defense strategy is of course classified. The generals will of course say singapore can be defended. Otherwise still can be general? Where the buffer zone is u no say i also know. This is not china. I study satellite maps daily. After LTA owned roads and property, after deducting privately owned land, hdb and commercial zones, air fields and classified under ground caverns such as the one off pulau bukom and mandai. We are left with fighting areas, including known farms. Ever noticed our population white paper only says growth to 6.9 million? We got plenty of land for more than 6.9 million. But buffer land is needed.
              
              Again saf generals are good at being hao lian and put themselves on a cloud. Its fine, education wise, i dont lose them. It takes an intelligent person to keng in army without mental or medical issues. You go and chiong sua, i can relax behind and replenish your ammo. I got no officer responsibilities. Win or lose, is also not my head being chopped. ;)

              <p>Bro, I'm not here to change anything, I'm not a regular anymore, also MR liao after roll for 5 additional years......</p>
              <p>Today even if activated me, I don't even have a new set of uniform to report......<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>But this is the mentality instill with me all my life, another 2 years time, my son turn to be enlisted, this will be the thought I will impart to him......</p>
              <p>Isn't that if we feel that a WW3 is imminent, shouldn't we be more positive and build up our national defence?.......</p>
              <p>The rest who choose to keng or insubordinate or worst case AWOL adsentees if war break up is not my problem, MP units will handle them......</p>
              <p>Unhappiness on how the whole system works is one thing, whether you have done your parts is another.......</p>
              <p>If I can't handle my own battalion well, I can't possibly blame the whole division and it works downward.......</p>
              <p>Even you are just a rifles man or storeman, your scope of duty will be even smaller, what's there to complain?.......</p>
              <p>Like you say, just replenish your ammo.......</p>

              I love my country very much. Threat comes here, i will rush to volunteer even as an old man. Love for country on one hand, but still will not vote pap. Its very strange right?
              
              However cock up i perceive saf, its still better than dont have.
              
              If i sound negative, it is based on my own calculations of whether singapore can be defended. Our generals can market their best defense strategy in front of LHL. But they are no fools. This land got its independence without a fight. Old man and ex-president worked for japs. Our ex-defense minister's children escaped NS. My chao keng pattern does not sound so bad right? All these elites got good education and had no medical or mental problems. I is the same, but not elite only, yet managed to keng my way out. ;)
              
              Look at how ISIL boss runs his international religious marketing n recruiting program. Look at his fighting strategy, logistics and financing. Then look at SMRT and NOL. Yes its very different. Our ex-general cannot solve the transportation problem wor.... Only heard him recruiting his own kakis...  The other ex-general did not manage to make money on our national shipping business wor...  Can they please do better and make us proud?
