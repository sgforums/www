              If you look at the kind of candidates pap brings in - talented smooth talking high achievers. That is the kind of people we need to prevent war from ever starting. Most of them are well versed in tai-chi diplomacy. This nation was born through dialogue. It never came about because of a war. Raffles and LKY were not warlords.
              
              Even in saf, its about sar-kar and making the right people happy. I have heard of majors who resigned due to cannot get along with their superiors. No choice what. What if our general upsets a foreign general tio bo?
              
              So to progress up the ladder here, its all about smooth talking and pleasuring others. Never mind your fake degrees and foreign talents as long as there is no aggression and violence. This country will be destroyed if war ever comes to shore. No matter the outcome (win or lose), a war lasting even a few months involving aerial bombing and land attack will result in damage this country cannot recover from.
              
              Thats why its better to be known as a unofficial sex-hub and have ministers 'prostituting' themselves by kow-towing here and there to other countries, then to use strong-arm tactics.
              
              Yes I know what pap is up to, and secretly agree with them, but still I will not vote for them.

              <p>Correct...people who climb in SAF either are scholars or have served long enough and worked on important special projects.   However, those who have opportunity to get close to the people in power had opportunities to show off their talents to them.  SAF unit politics less strong than outside as they have an established protocol there.   I have seen a non-scholar new Major who quarelled with his superior during NS time and he still rose all the way to BG level.</p>
              <p>However, the reason why we have no war is because we have a huge number of solders on paper.   Even if someone tries to start a war between Muslims and us, there is no way they could attack using conventional warfare method.   How many paratroopers do they have?   How many boats and swimming tanks do they have?   We have 3000+ armoured vehicles, half a million troops and we manufacture our own ammunitions, big guns, ships and some armoured vehicles.   They need to land 1.5 million troops + at least a few thousand armoured vehicles to have a chance.   But this is very expensive too as we have to spend $13.1 billlion a year just to maintain the force that employs less regulars (don't count NSFs because they make a lot less than private sector people) than the total number of active taxi drivers.   Even if we trim defence budget by 5 billion dollars a year (which is possible and channel it to medical and HDB subsidies or other areas), the imaginary hostile forces still would not be able to attack Singapore. </p>
              <p>However, military strength is not only the key to peace.... peacetime actions like helping out during Tsunami is important too..    That is why the person-in-charge of tsunami helping out in Indonesia was asked to join PAP to become Minister.</p>

              For an aggressor, its very easy to estimate our total NSF+NSmen.
              Birth rate 8.1/1000
              Population 5.5 million
              ICT: 10 years, 40 days/year max
              
              Total = 445,500 NSFs + ORNS
              
              In the event of war, there is one more addition to this total: MR personnel below 40 (NCOs) or 55 (officers)
              
              16.1% of our population is between 45-54, we assume 0.5 x population = 442,750
              
              16% is between 35-44, we assume 0.5 x population = 440,000
              
              So the total number of soldiers in the event of war should not exceed 1.328 million.
              
              We need to deduct an important figure from this - Singapore's mortality rate for males was 72.51 per 1000 = 7.251%
              
              So the approximate number of soldiers an aggressor will see is 0.92749 x 1.328 million = 1.231 million, assuming all the chao keng, bai ka, bai qiu, blind, deaf, mute and prison convicts can also contribute.
              
              The big problem with Singapore is food. If our delivery drivers stop sending food from Malaysia, we will start starving within a week.
              
              Our water supply is another issue. Hyflux reverse osmosis desalination plant in Tuas South and Changi needs to have a naval defense. I have never seen an exercise in this regard. Also the aggressor can do missile saturation attack against Huflux, rendering it inoperable. We will be cut off from food and fresh water.
              
              Another issue is a specific component for our massive mobile military hardware. There is currently no inhouse expertise in SAF to replace this item, which I wont say what it is. If the aggressor destroys the warehouse containing the spares, and our mobile military will soon become immobile. There is also no specific defense for this warehouse that I can see, unlike our fuel refineries.
              
              Thats why I say in a war lasting a few months, the damage to Singapore can be irreparable. Soldiers going hungry, thirsty and an increasing number of inoperable military vehicles can wrack havoc on morale.
              
              To win quickly, we must be quick and decisive, but the SAF is as we know - wait to rush, and rush to wait.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes we got ST kinetics. Yes we make many military hardware. But we got no auto industry. All or most of our big mobile military gear were made elsewhere.
