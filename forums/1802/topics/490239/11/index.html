              <p>You also know in Singapore would not be so many people one.   Most of my trips are one person trips.  Hardly anyone uses car pooling.</p>

              <p>Talking about open top vehicle, Singapore already designed and built the Bronco "wartime taxi". and already exported to UK and Thailand already.   One vehicle with 2 cabins can squeeze 30 persons.  Even Thailand's ex Prime Minister already took it to survey their flood areas in 2010.</p>

              But 10 years is not long, from pri 1 to sec 4 only, in 2006, I was still driving my most reliable Toyota sampan with a 3210 nokia phone...and a horse racing calendar. There was no smlj Uber, Arber or grab...but today, it is so much different...therefore, do not underestimate technology, it can happen before you retire fully.
              
              As we all knew that the economy is going thru a downturn period, but not up to recession, there are lesser paxs as expats are ask to go back, locals being more conservatives, might choose other modes of cheaper transport, this are part of an economy cyclical behavior, however, this time round, it will remain for a long period.
              
              We might think that taxis are taking in less, but the truth is apps ride are also taking in lesser, unless you are like my bro CT, Panchen or hammer or my ex chief, who will use all their brain cells to make a living, for them, I rest my case and wait to send them off.

              <p>I study until pri 6 only so dunno how fast is 10 yrs from pri 1 to sec 4.  The technology is already here although not perfect.  It is the laws that need to be able to catch up with technology.  Because when it comes to liability and punishment, our laws always refer to a person and never about a machine.</p>

              <p>yah lah....but I am sure all these while most of us here were not talking about this kind of driverless taxis.....but that kinds like Sedan class that could drive at 90 km/h on all roads that we drive on.</p>
              <p>This one is more like driverless van/bus that could only drive at 40 km/h in not busy areas only.</p>

              <p>The Tesla driver killed in the first known fatal crash involving a self-driving car may have been watching a Harry Potter movie at the time of the collision inFlorida, according to a truck driver involved in the crash.<br><br>According to Tesla’s account of the crash, the car’s sensor system, against a bright spring sky, failed to distinguish a large white 18-wheel truck and trailer crossing the highway. In a blogpost, Tesla said the self-driving car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer “with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S”.<br><br>It goes on to say that the car’s autonomous software is designed to nudge consumers to keep their hands on the wheels to make sure they’re paying attention. “Autopilot is getting better all the time, but it is not perfect and still requires the driver to remain alert,” the company said.</p>
