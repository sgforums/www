              <div class="content" style="clear: left; padding-top: 1px; font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">WASHINGTON/DETROIT — United States vehicle safety regulators have said the artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car (prototype pictured) could be considered the driver under the country’s federal law, a major step towards ultimately winning approval for autonomous vehicles on the roads.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, of its decision in a previously unreported Feb 4 letter to the company posted on the agency’s website this week.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Google’s self-driving car unit on Nov 12 submitted a proposed design for a self-driving car that has “no need for a human driver”, the letter to Google from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief counsel Paul Hemmersbaugh said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">“NHTSA will interpret ‘driver’ in the context of Google’s described motor vehicle design as referring to the (self-driving system), and not to any of the vehicle occupants,” said NHTSA’s letter. “We agree with Google its (self-driving car) will not have a ‘driver’ in the traditional sense that vehicles have had drivers during the last more than 100 years.”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Major automakers and technology companies such as Google are racing to develop and sell vehicles that can drive themselves at least part of the time.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">All participants in the autonomous driving race complain that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and eventual deployment of such vehicles. California has proposed draft rules requiring steering wheels and a licensed driver in all self-driving cars.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Mr Karl Brauer, senior analyst for the Kelley Blue Book automotive research firm, said there were still significant legal questions surrounding autonomous vehicles.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">But if “NHTSA is prepared to name artificial intelligence as a viable alternative to human-controlled vehicles, it could substantially streamline the process of putting autonomous vehicles on the road”, he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">If the car’s computer is the driver for legal purposes, then it clears the way for Google or automakers to design vehicle systems that communicate directly with the vehicle’s artificial pilot.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">In its response to Google, the federal agency offered its most comprehensive map yet of the legal obstacles to putting fully autonomous vehicles on the road. It noted existing regulations requiring some auto safety equipment cannot be waived immediately, including requirements for braking systems activated by foot control.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">“The next question is whether and how Google could certify that the (self-driving system) meets a standard developed and designed to apply to a vehicle with a human driver,” said NHTSA.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Google is “still evaluating” NHTSA’s lengthy response, said a company spokesperson on Tuesday. Google executives have said they would likely partner with established automakers to build self-driving cars.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Google told NHTSA the real danger is having auto safety features that could tempt humans to take control.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Google “expresses concern that providing human occupants of the vehicle with mechanisms to control things like steering, acceleration, braking ... could be detrimental to safety because the human occupants could attempt to override the (self-driving system’s) decisions”, stated the NHTSA letter.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">NHTSA’s Mr Hemmersbaugh said federal regulations requiring equipment such as steering wheels and brake pedals would have to be formally rewritten before Google could offer cars without those features.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">For example, current federal rules require alerts on dashboards if tyre pressure runs low. NHTSA said a test would need to be created that shows the vehicle computer is informed of the problem.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">Last month, NHTSA said it may waive some vehicle safety rules to allow more driverless cars to operate on US roads as part of a broader effort to speed up development of self-driving vehicles.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">NHTSA said then it would write guidelines for self-driving cars within six months. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the administration may seek new legal authority to allow deployment of autonomous vehicles “in large numbers”, when they are deemed safe, said the department.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">The process of rewriting federal regulations governing the design, placement and operation of vehicle controls could take months or years. The NHTSA counsel said Google could consider applying for exemptions for certain regulations. REUTERS</p>

              <p>Why worry about MDTs?   Old MDTs also good ..... we had been using it for many many years and it does not make economical sense to replace good old parts that could still be used.</p>
              <p>My experience after being frustrated is the algorithm is not perfect , the programmers were bribed to make things difficult for certain drivers) or the management asked the programmers to make the program work in such a way such that they could make any driver not get the customer.  </p>
              <p>One morning I pressed very fast for the first job I was offered to bid....but did not get it...I was thinking this is normal as another driver who also just started could have pressed faster than me....no big deal since this often happens....however 2 seconds later the same job appeared again and again I pressed very quickly but could not get the job.   Then  a few tens of seconds later, I saw another long Changi Airport trip which I obviously attempted to bid for it... but again I did not get it...... 3 consecutive attempts no success....so I though, I would not attempt to take anymore deals for the rest of the day (and therefore would ignore the 2 calls per day quota) so I street hailed the entire day.   So I avoided all the peak hour calls.....   After peak hours, a lot of calls (a lot more than usual) started coming in but I obviously ignored (but continued to take genuine customers from the streets).   Then sometime in the afternoon one Comfort lady called me asking me why I did not take up calls and I told her something wrong with their program as I could not get the calls despite attempting and one call even reappeared.   I also told her I am not on GrabTaxi.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I was not affected by them as I am a good street hailer.  I hit my highest sales record that day (a Friday/Saturday monring when local customers were willing to pay to take taxis) clocking 600+ km that day from 20+ hours of driving (1 full tank) and went back home as a very happy man who did not encounter any nasty customer that 20+ hours. </p>
              <p>Imagine if I had joined Uber or GrabCar what would have happened to me?   Totally dependant on a central source and would most likely get the lousy deals (while they give other drivers special extra incentives for finishing near the top).</p>
              <p>The good thing about taxi driving is there is no special incentive given to the so-called best driver or mentor and he already would be happy from additional sales he gets from working hard and no one else would be unhappy because someone "overwrites them" which would have resulted in them having to drive at least 1 hour extra per day.   You also cannot cheat by hiring people to drive for you or outsourcing taxi driving to other people as your taxi license would be suspended if you do that.</p>

              <p>As a taxi driver, you are supposed to be on taxi drivers' side.   You should be saying we do not need driverless taxis.   Driverless taxi take away Singaporeans' job unlike maunfacturing robots that make Singaporeans more competitive.</p>
              <p>Driverless taxi is for countries whereby taxi fares are too expensive.</p>
              <p>Remember it is eliminate 55000 very competitive jobs for probably only 500-1000 jobs out of which using existing employment ratio of which 55 Singaporean citizen+PR for every 45 foreign workers.  What this means is more foreigners than Singaporeans for new jobs created as PRs are not Singaporeans but citizens of other countries.</p>
              <p>Would our system work without a single driverless taxi?   Yes ..... so why make Singaporeans jobless for foreigners to have more manufacturing and design jobs in their own country ?     Lose 100 pure-Singaporeans jobs but only gain 1 job which has to be shared with foreigners...... not worth it.</p>
              <p>I know you would be retired by then but think of other Singaporeans and their families.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Also what is the advantage of being one of the first few countries to implement driverless taxis? </span>  <strong>I see no advantage</strong>.  </p>
              <p>If we are smart, we let those countries engaging in driverless taxi research (and manufacturing) implement it in their cities first (as they are the people who really need driveless cars due to high taxi fares) before we decide whether to implement it.   But probably the foreign companies would be attempting to pressurize, bribe or blackmail some people (in power) to push for it.  </p>
              <p>The people that push for driverless taxis are unable to generate as many jobs as what they would take away from the local market.   When that happens, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crime rate in the society would increase</span> and for every 1 person that lost his taxi drivers job, 4-5 other family members would be affected.  Not to mention the decreased consumers' spending in the market that would cause places like super-markets, resturants and retail shops to have less businesses.  Also there would be more strikes and social disorder in the country.   Also first generation cars are likely to have more faults and driveless vehicles could go hay-wire.   Remember our roads are also a lot more congessed than roads of countries that manufacture cars.</p>
              <p>Also there would not be 55000 additional security guard rice bowls and driverless cars takes away probably around $72 million of just taxi GST (not including fuel GST and other money) that taxi drivers pay a year (about the amount a MNC that makes $400 million in Singapore pay in corporate tax).</p>
              <p>We have seen so many viruses in computers and smartphones and so many electronic products malfunctioning in a few years time (some delibert time bombs, some remotely controlling from elsewhere to make it malfunction whenever they like).   I guarantee you later on there would be virueses in driverless systems too.</p>

              <p>Then someone would be asking then where foreigners work as our taxi market is not open.   The answer is they manufacture cars in their own country (as no company in Singapore manufacture cars although some educational institutions do design and build cars purely for competition purposes so that international reputation and rankings would be there).</p>
              <p>We purchase traditional taxi cars from USA, Japan ,South Korea, Germany, France, UK (London taxis) and Italy (some yellow top cabbies use Fiat).  The list includes almost all nations of G7 (just short of Canada).</p>
              <p>Later on they would threathen to fire very limited number of Singaporeans who work in driverless car research in Singapore so we let them fire them but welcome them to traditional taxi drivers' job (if they cannot find a better job).   While some may say it is loss of face for them to do such low-class jobs but the situation is if previously higher social status people like ex-managers, ex-VPs, top university PhD and ex-CEOs (failed entrepreneurs) could do it, why could they not do it?</p>
              <p>Professor Chua's story in De Shi Dang Jia already highlighted the problems Singaporeans would face and another 45,000 already anticipated they may encounter the same problem and continue to renew taxi license despite not working as active driver as they know one day they would need it.   This 45,000 does not include other Singaporeans who would be retrenced in future when market goes worse who has yet to apply for taxi license.</p>

              We cannot simply paint a picture base on illusion that flavor ourselves as a Taxi drivers, we need to be realistic at time, PM Lee do not go visit USA and sit on a driveless car for nothing, the govt is damn interested in it. And why so?
              
              1. To reduce foreigner dependency
              2. To catch up with the nos of taxi driver getting aged and flow
              3. To cope with lesser locals taking up taxi driving (as most TD will not ask their son to be taxi driver)
              4. To be the first, beside japan, in asia with an advance transport system so as to put ourselves in pole position 
              5. And most important, out of record, with driveless, they will not have to deal with this grab, uber or taxi drivers problem...people like me gives them many problem hor.

            <div class='col-md body'>People are getting aged, that we cannot deny, as a casket driver, my business also went up from year to year, however, locals are also getting to live longer, as you had heard from news that Singaporeans are now between the 3 and 4th place in the world to live the longest, coupled with govt intention to reduce foreign dependency and go into a so called Singapore Core policies, together with the extension of re employment to 67 years old, there will be job for locals.</div>
