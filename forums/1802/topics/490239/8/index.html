              <p>Aiyah, credit card is just one form of cashless payment. You have nets, masterpass and now apple pay. Driverless taxis if implemented will not do street hail one lah. All will be through bookings. So pax who want to use driverless taxis will pre-register their credit card, atm card whatever. It is an easy problem to overcome to avoid fare evasion. </p>
              <p>No, I am not for uber or anyone. Like you, I am just trying to find ways that driverless cars cannot be used as taxis.  But those points you mentioned are easily resolved.  The only issue I can think of is the issue of liability in accident cases.  </p>

              Driverless car also need maintenance, servicing, programming, and so on,...and down the value chain, it created better paid and better skill jobs, like service center, better road leading to more road work, GPS pods control, marshals and station orderly. 
              
              For a start, it will be in parks, university and some other recreation places like GBTB and MBS. Then it will slowly move into heartland and expressway. 
                  
              Companies that operate driverless shall be responsible for it insurance and pax safety. 
              
              We as older singaporeans should not be so selfish to prevent new technology and innovation for our younger generation future jobs, therefore, we cannot keep thinking abt driving taxis forever, a responsible human/citizen is one who care for the family, the nation and also the future succession of people. 
              
              That is truly a hero. But too bad, hero die first...
                  
              
              Our forefather worked hard and bear the changes to provided a better life for our father, and our father also worked hard and go with the changes to provide a better life for us.
              
              If we are to neglect and stubbornly prevent changes in the way we travel and work just because of our selfishness of the present, then, we are doing no flavor to our next generation.

              <p>I am on the drivers' side. But just letting you know there are
              ways to prevent pax from not paying fare. They can design that the
              taxi will not move until the pax tap the EZ link card or whatever
              card. So chances of pax running away without paying will not
              happen. Like bowah has mentioned, we have to be realistic and not
              just paint a picture in our favour.</p>

              <p>I already see it as not being able to meet so many requirements I already mentioned.  Remember, there are other requirements that I have not mentioned.</p>
              <p>For instance, when driverless cars enter carparks of condos with security features that disallow communications signals ( probably an anti-terrorism mechaism ).   The mobile phone, MDT, cashless machine and most likely GPS signals would be totally lost.   When you bundle it with "customer did not close the door properly", the car would be totally trapped as it has no way of telling whether it was totally open or partially open.</p>

              <p>Who is being selfish?  The people who want to eliminate 55,000 Singaporean jobs (without providing a real replacement solution) or the potential victims?   How many new driverless car jobs (for Singaporeans in Singapore) would be created and how many old Singaporean jobs would be lost?  I am speaking not only for myself but also for other Singaporeans that need taxi driving as main and backup job.  What happens when the very limited number of Singaporean driverless cars researchers in Singapore lose their jobs?   We welcome them to join us as taxi drivers together with people in other industries that gets retrenched (provided they already are experienced car drivers and could pass the taxi exams).</p>
              <p>I currently see it as eliminating a ratio of 100 jobs but only creating a ratio of only 1-10 additional jobs.</p>
              <p>Also remember this fact, the taxi course is always fully filled and the waiting queue is around 1 month's long.    So this job is a job that a lot of Singaporeans want to do (and the country has a real demand for it and it is self-sustaining without the government having to pump in any money for it and the government collects a lot of GST from it) ......so do we want to eliminate it?</p>

              <p>NT, I have read your post on all the negatives in having autonomous taxis. I do not disagree with you. All I had done was to highlight a couple of items to which there are possible solutions. But by bringing it up, you are only highlighting these weaknesses to the powers that be that intend to bring in these cabs.They will just send those problems to the manufacturers and tell them to do someting to fix all of them before these vehicles can be found acceptable on Sg roads. After which, one of 3 things can happen:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. They go back to the drawing board and try to solve all of the problems mentioned.</p>
              <p>2. They decide that it is not possible to fix them all, but they can fix enough of those problems to pass them as privately owned vehicles, but not as taxis.</p>
              <p>3. They can produce taxis with limited capabilities, but we will still rely on normal taxis operated by humans, whicj means our jobs are not under threat of being snatched.</p>

              <p>Right but I have been saying is we do not decide to introduce them to our market until we have seen the technology being perfected in other countries and seen the social impacts on their society (meaning the real car manufacturing or designing countries) before we decide whether to implement in our own country.</p>
              <p>Remember those real car manufacturing / designing countries are the countries that need driverless cars as their taxi fares are super expensive.  See here ( <a href="http://www.priceoftravel.com/555/world-taxi-prices-what-a-3-kilometer-ride-costs-in-72-big-cities/">http://www.priceoftravel.com/555/world-taxi-prices-what-a-3-kilometer-ride-costs-in-72-big-cities/ </a>).   As a developed country, we taxi fares are considered cheap ( of course we do not compare with third world cities like Delhi India as we do not want to drop to third world's standard<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0e71cd; display: inline; text-align: justify; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-size: inherit; background-color: #f7f7f7;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">) .</span></p>
              <p>If you speak about robots cutting hairs.   In the first place do we need to eliminate human barbers in Singapore?  No.   <strong>Can we survive without robotic barbers?</strong>  Yes.   If human barber too expensive?   No.   Are robotic barbers reliable?  No.   Can robotic barbers meet all requirements?   No.   Who benefits most from robotic barbers?   Foreigers (since they manufacture the robots).   Who loses?   Singaporeans.    So do we want to introduce them?    NO.   What is the worst case scenario if we do not introduce RB ?   Singaporeans say barber prices in Singapore too expensive and goes to JB to cut.</p>
              <p>However in the case of manufacturing whereby we are really no longer competitive.  If we only rely on manual human labour and not use robots, our products would be too expensive and uncompetitive and therefore there would not be a demand overseas.    </p>
              <p>However for our taxi driving, there is no real overseas market.   If however Comfort also operates taxis outside Singapore, then they only introduce driverless taxis in those countries that really needs driverless taxis.   Almost no developed world countries people is going to tell you that our taxi fares too expensive.  If 3rd world people find our taxi fares are too expensive, they can always walk, take bus or take LRT/MRT.</p>

              <p>errr....just asking. Was the driverless trains tested in other
              countries? Also if you are up to date with the news, 2000 charging
              points will be installed all over the island to cater for electric
              cars. Why do you think they are doing this?</p>

              Aiya, dun argue for the sake of arguing lah, by the time driverless is around, we all could either be at some old folk homes talking cock and sing song, and some will be at mandai, kong meng shan, lim chu kang...
