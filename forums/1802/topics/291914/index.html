Serves him right. A taxi is much heavier! But then this taxi driver also abit unreasonable , give him the full details la! What is done cannot be undone , since it has happened just satisfy the situation ,  if not happy then go in front of his car &amp; brake suddenly so that that guy's car crash onto the cab's butt , he pay more!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i read in the papers that he is trying to use his medical condition to ask for a pardon and escape any jail term. there is another case by a molester and the culprit actually escape jail term bcos he have some cancer and is dying, his lawyers is using that case to help his client to get pardoned.<br><br>what to do u think?<br><br>i thk, no matter how, the taxi driver still must answer to his crimes(not mistake). even if he is old and abt to die bcos of some illness, letting him go freely will do no justice. firstly, he drove off after commiting an accident. then he knock and hit and run. then he hid and didn't own up until the police found him. the victim is suffering yet he chose to hide. and ignoring the pleas from the victim's gf to come out and shed some light on how the accident had occurred. its very painful to see ur love one in coma for 1 month! nothing can describe the agony and pain of the victim's friends and family!<br><br>in short, the driver is a cb. and he still want to be pardoned from jail term? jail term is already too lenient for him.. and he still want to bargain!</div>
