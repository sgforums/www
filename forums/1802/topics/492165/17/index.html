            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi to all, hope all of you are in good health. I am a newbie in this industry and still learning more on this trade. Prior being relief about 2 mths ago, it took me awhile to go thorugh all the forums about taxi industry before I made the decisions to be a TD relief. One of the advices, which i took from here is to drive part time and see if the market is good for me to plunge in as a full time. However, having driven taxi for a couple of months now, I decided to make this as a part time relief job instead ($30 nett) credit to bowah and endure my full time job due to its CPF, welfare and benefits. I really appreaciate every discussions and advises being shared by everyone here. Therefore, I would like to state that being a TD full time is a good contigency solution as a last resort.</p></div>

              Again, I re- emphasize, if you are still new to Taxi driving or even Phv, and there is a job or a current jobs that pay average with all the benefits as stipulated within the employment act, go for the job or stay with the job, forget about driving.
                      
              This statement was what I said to many 15 to 10 years ago, when they started as newbies, but many because of wanting freedom, cold hard cash and not bound by discipline, did not heel my advices. 
                  
              15 years later, most regretted, some get slaughtered, some end up with lots of health and of course, money problem. Their ex colleagues and friend would had promoted to managers, supervisors or head of dept earning 5 to 10k, wearing nice nice to office, point here point there only.
                      
              30 years ago, when I start driving taxi is different, it is the taxi drivers' market, that time taxi is King, many still cannot afford to buy car, and I can still afford to buy a Daihatsu Charade, later improved to Honda accord just by driving taxis, got a wife and 2 bak bak mistresses, 2 houses, no problem. 
                  
              No need to drive like a mad dog, morning suka suka 3 to 4 hrs, night another 3 hrs will do. Most taxi driver end up buying private property, worst to worst also a condo or a terrace house, unless you like to gamble, then sorry.
                      
              Today drive taxis and phv can end up in hospital C class bedroom one hor or chao ah long one hor, both legal and illegal ah longs.
                      
              So, think twice before you want to drive, be if relief or be hirer, dun waste your time if you think you can go for other higher and safer jobs that pay better with better benefits and better structured saving, not to mention pay increases and promotion.
              
              Today is paxs' market, and going forward in the years to come, their market will become stronger and stronger with all kinds of promotion and options, it is not taxi companies and taxi drivers market anymore, and in fact, going forward, taxi will get worst. So, why join a futureless trade??

              Most companies increase their employees pay by average 2 to 3% this year, 1 to 2 months bonuses..due to market not that good, even I, as a casket relief driver, also got a month bonus and pay went up 10%, formerly per job was $150, now $165.
                      
              In good time, would be 5 to 6 or even 10%, average 5 months bonuses including AWS.
                      
              Taxi driving earning is down 20 to 30%, see the logic??? and things outside are increasing, so your earning decrease, cost of living increases, it is a double whammy..no wonder I see most drivers always wear the same clothing.

              Everyone of us will get old, and today, the youngs are finding it difficult to survive by themselves, dun expect them to take care of you when you are old, especially those TD and PHV who have no CPF, better save..otherwise...old, eyesight poor, cannot drive..can end up picking cardboard as exericise one hor.

              There are stress in every trade lah,
              
              However, stress can be of many types, and some stress are good stress.
              
              Typically speaking, everyone of us got stress, taxi go drive to earn a living and support family will have stress, but this are normal stress in all working people, these at times are also good stress when you manage to get appreciated or huat in your work, it keeps a body and mind going. 
              
              On the other hand, there is another stress that is bad, and that is mostly related to self inflicted stress, stress that you ask for it, like gambling, having affair, doing illegal stuff...and so on. It give a person, no matter how strong he is, a guilt in him + the time put in + the effort + pressure and frustration, it all add up to bad stresses.
              
              Therefore be wise, if today, you are driving, that is normal stress, dun go play around with other thing, a person must factually know his limitation and his position inorder to execute his way of living morally and correctly.

              You must understand why people drives taxis or want to become taxi drivers, main reason is freedom of life, if you talk about money and working, taxi drivers are actually working much more than many other jobs and earn peanut, but the freedom of life, expression and engagement is one thing that attract many to join, especially men. Many do not like a boss on top of them.
