              <p>I think it is a matter of “Go with your heart” Life is not long,
              even I got a chance to get $100k per year, but not happy, what is
              the use?</p>
              <p>Do what you like, if you like and dream of being a taxi driver,
              go ahead, just do it. But if you are going to compare $$ instead of
              yr life and dream, then forget about taxi, go be a broker or like
              me, a casket driver cum casket marketing sale director at hospital
              better.</p>
              <p>Everyone of those poster on top of me will encourage you not to
              drive because they come into taxi driving as a last resort,
              meaning, no choice. But if you come in with a dream and wanting to
              be, that is different, it is not a last resort for you, ride your
              dream.</p>
              <p>Although there are many taxi driver, like those above, keep kpkb
              everyday, there are some who enjoyed it.</p>

              And because most of us never go University, our aspiration got lost, instead, keep bringing paxs to Universal studio.
              
              But whatever you end up as, dun get dis hearted, as long as it is a honest job, be it cleaner, casket driver or plate collector, we earn our bread and butter proudly. 
              
              So what if you are some businessmen, Uber boss, taxi companies bosses, MPs, ministers,  lawyers or MDs..CEO or COEs. 
              
              These peoples have a skill of making use of others to survive, they will lies, force and exploit others weakeness to for their own gain, and that greed will increase overtime because greed have no boundary. 
              
              So they will come out with these product, that system, this gift and that incentives to lure the weak ones to them, and then they will all gather at high class club, dine and wine with ladies while we struggle on the road and workplace to make a decent living.
              
              But that is how this world is about, where all men are born equal, but some are different.

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I got my TDVL yr2013 and still keeping inside pocket, that year also not happy with work/boss etc. Tahan till last year Nov wanted to just quit and drive taxi but then wife last year had retired liao so I'm the only income earner, think think still better don't do anything rush. Got stable job just stick to it cos the welfare, benefit and employer's CPF etc.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Two month ago I just happen to search the car 2nd hand market, decided to upgrade my OPC SLK(COE till Aug yr2018) to a bigger one. Bght a toyota rush 1.5A(COE till Aug yr2017) tradein my SLK $12K and paid $13K settled no loan, with insurance admin fee etc another $1.8K. This car have a minimum parf $9.3K and most likely I can still scrap or sell it before COE expire at $10K next year, so my cost is about $4.8K minus one year use of SLK also.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Then suddenly it came across my mind why not drive GRAB/UBER part time using my car since I got many off days as I'm working on 12hrs shift, one week I have 2-4days off. Previously I did not consider of doing taxi/grab/uber part time cos most of the time rental does not match but now since my car park there also no use during off days. Registered a company $115 but if convert to commercial motor insurance is around $2K after NCD quite expensive, I need to top up about $1.2K with current private motor insurance refund.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Not really good with road, route and meeting people so still holding back. Now just trying Grabhitch(no need commercial motor insurance, limited to 2 hitch per day) for two weeks liao, only 5 rides which match my usual route to work(less than 5mins detour) and received $43. Just try and see the experience driving, at least if really suay kena retrench I have an option.</p>

              Drive partime is a stress, no matter how you do your sum, it will end up a negative sum game, not even zero sum. People work, go back happy happy, dinner with family, be with childrens and wifey (I with my bak bak), uber and grab partimer hv to go drive to cover...if for a short time is ok, but after 3 months like this...also sian liao...tann tann for Uber and Grab pte ltd only.

              Having a pte car is for luxury, end up having to fetch people here and there to cover the car cost...is stressful and also a hinder of Truth. Meaning in actual fact, you CANNOT afford to own a car. And because of wanting, you plunge yourself into these apps companies trap, 
                      
              People who afford to drive, will drive to work, send childrens to school, drive wife to work or market, and on weekend, bring family and parents outing, dinning and shopping without much hassle.
                      
              But if you are driving a pte car and end up everynight coming home pass midnite, weekend burnt....all for covering the apps rental and fuel cost..I think you are doing yourself no flavour and it will not sustain...you might end up completely no balancing of life.
                      
              Even taxi per shift is only 6 to 6 or 5 to 5, just imagine, you hv to work from 8 to 6 and carry on till midnite...tsk tsk tsk..materialism craving create hard labour exploitation by business

                              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I got my TDVL yr2013 and still
              keeping inside pocket, that year also not happy with work/boss etc.
              Tahan till last year Nov wanted to just quit and drive taxi but
              then wife last year had retired liao so I'm the only income earner,
              think think still better don't do anything rush. Got stable job
              just stick to it cos the welfare, benefit and employer's CPF
              etc.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Two month ago I just happen to
              search the car 2nd hand market, decided to upgrade my OPC SLK(COE
              till Aug yr2018) to a bigger one. Bght a toyota rush 1.5A(COE till
              Aug yr2017) tradein my SLK $12K and paid $13K settled no loan, with
              insurance admin fee etc another $1.8K. This car have a minimum parf
              $9.3K and most likely I can still scrap or sell it before COE
              expire at $10K next year, so my cost is about $4.8K minus one year
              use of SLK also.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Then suddenly it came across my
              mind why not drive GRAB/UBER part time using my car since I got
              many off days as I'm working on 12hrs shift, one week I have
              2-4days off. Previously I did not consider of doing taxi/grab/uber
              part time cos most of the time rental does not match but now since
              my car park there also no use during off days. Registered a company
              $115 but if convert to commercial motor insurance is around $2K
              after NCD quite expensive, I need to top up about $1.2K with
              current private motor insurance refund.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Not really good with road, route
              and meeting people so still holding back. Now just trying
              Grabhitch(no need commercial motor insurance, limited to 2 hitch
              per day) for two weeks liao, only 5 rides which match my usual
              route to work(less than 5mins detour) and received $43. Just try
              and see the experience driving, at least if really suay kena
              retrench I have an option.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">My childhood dream not big also,
              bus uncle only. I like driving actually..</p>

              In other countries, where car is cheap, it is wise to use own vehicle, but in Singapore, unless you are driving a going to scrap car, using own car to drive for apps is never a wise one, more so in term of economy of scale.
