              <p>Apologies for the corny title LOL just wanted to share my current predicament.</p>
              <p>I've always had a dream ever since I was young, not a very big dreamer, but I always wanted to be a bus driver or a taxi driver. The idea of being on the road and meeting different people always intrigued me.</p>
              <p>Have been married for about 2 years now with no kids only outputs I have is my house and monthly expenditures. Just joined the 30s club and am working in a reputable MNC making about 45k a year, something I'm not too happy about. Reason being, I'm sick and tired of the stress and waking up every morning and dragging myself to work and dreading to deal with the shit I do day in and day out. The monotony and stress of it all is just eating me up inside.</p>
              <p>So right now I'm thinking about becoming a TD to give me more job sastisfaction. My main concerns are, similar to many aspiring TDs, Finance wise and is this a good decision?<br>I know this is something ultimately I have to decide on my own, but to hear from fellow veterans would at least give me better insight into what I would be getting myself into. Then there's the Uber scene. So please, fellow TDs out there I seek your input on this one. Please forgive me if this was a little lengthy. Your inputs are extremely appreciated. Thanks ^_^</p>

              <p>Recently Warren Buffet was mentioned in the same breaath as DTs by the Straits Times. Here is a guy who woulde hold the title of the world's richest man if not for the fact that he has given away a huge chunk of his assets. This guy has money to burn, and if he so wishes, can afford to put  a few thousand of his driverless taxis on Singapore roads should he choose to do so. And he has a nose for good investment. In Singapore running a taxi company is good business, and if I were him, I would jump at the opportunity. Next year T4 will be ready. And if it is made to be DT friendly, and if Warren Buffet decides that DTs will not impose airport surcharge, guess who will be the winner?</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Just getting approval to put electric taxis on the road has taken more than 3 years.  And it is not even approved yet as of now. You got LTA, NEA, EMA, URA, HDB, EDB and a whole lot of other agencies to clear. You go and ask HDT their frustrations. Many other countries have already implemented electric vehicles for years.</span></p>
              <p>Whole fleet of driverless taxis by next year? Legal framework, regulatory approvals, ethics, safety, liabilities, accountabilities, political and a whole lot of other things need to be considered first. Just implementing licence for Uber and Grab drivers already take some 2 years to decide.</p>
              <p>You think Singapore will be the first country in the world to implement driverless taxis? Wait long long lah.</p>

              <p>The people pushing for driverless taxis are people dying to put driverless taxis into the market to see their work in place and make money.   However, they are far from being ready as there are too many scenarios that they cannot handle. </p>
              <p>Do we want to put these taxis in Singapore to endanger Singaporeans lives and rice bowls or is it wiser to see such technology being perfected in those countries that design and manufacture such cars before we comtemplate evening putting any of these cars on our roads?   Remember, the countries that are designing (and possibly manufacturing) such vehicles all have very expensive taxi fares and this is the reason why they embarked on driverless car projects.  </p>
              <p>If any of these designers could drive taxis in Singapore, they would find out they are unable to meet the requirements of normal taxi riders and other duties executors such as policemen, car park / taxi stand / hotel lobby marshallers.  They would also find out that in real situations such as 2 lanes closed on normal roads and expressways and construction repairs, their vehicles would be struck on the road causing huge congessions.</p>

              My advice go n try out as a relief driver during weekend.
              Example sat sun day shift or Fri sat night shift.
              Keep your day job first.
              Dun ever be a hirer.
               income of a full time taxi driver will be definitely 
              Lower than 45k.
              Let's say u drive 5 days a week.
              One day 12 hours shift with 8 hours real driving n 4 hours in coffee shop / rest n queue in taxi, average  $100 a day.
              One month 2k.
              If you want to earn more than have to work 7 days a week. So 2k a mth is around 24k per annum.

              I think it is a matter of "Go with your heart" Life is not long, even I got a chance to get $100k per year, but not happy, what is the use? 
              
              Do what you like, if you like and dream of being a taxi driver, go ahead, just do it. But if you are going to compare $$ instead of yr life and dream, then forget about taxi, go be a broker or like me, a casket driver cum casket marketing sale director at hospital  better.
              
              Everyone of those poster on top of me will encourage you not to drive because they come into taxi driving as a last resort, meaning, no choice. But if you come in with a dream and wanting to be, that is different, it is not a last resort for you, ride your dream.
              
              Although there are many taxi driver, like those above, keep kpkb everyday, there are some who enjoyed it.
