              <p><br> You must understand why people drives taxis or want to become taxi
              drivers, main reason is freedom of life, if you talk about money
              and working, taxi drivers are actually working much more than many
              other jobs and earn peanut, but the freedom of life, expression and
              engagement is one thing that attract many to join, especially men.
              Many do not like a boss on top of them.</p>

              There is no such thing as owning a business without initial capital, it is either you pay now or later. Taxi is a small proprietor trade for small businessmen, people who joined taxis or phv driving from all walks of working life will then understand basic accounting of business, like profit and lost, cash flows and managing cost.
              
              Rental is the main cost, an invest capital that pay later, other are cost of goods like fuel prices, carpark fees, summons, knocks and puncture etc etc. 
                  
              Just like hawkers, unlike stable business like Uber, grab or courts etc, boss just sit and think of strategy to make their sale revenue up, taxi and phv have to plough the field for long hours,
              
              They are the boss, the workers, the staff, the financial accounting, the business planner, sales, marketing...all lump into one.
                  
              So, in a nutshell, after joining taxi or phv, you see the drivers tends to become more calculatives and mindful of even the smallest expenditure or lost, this is the evolve of business mind, 
              
              Unfortunately, the return for such business is pathetically little, given the life time you hv to spend on the road, and the liability of knocks and summons, not to mention the health deterioration due to stress and agony on the road.

              Possible, my friend kenna toto..straight away ask them to tow back and pay everything
              
              A contract is bounded, not a submission, many always think contract is non negotiable, but the fact remain that everything is negotiable, dun believe, you return key...and see what the DRO or IO say...
              
              Hello, I like to throw key, I give you 7 days notice as per contract
              
              DRO: Uncle, cool, contract is a contract, we can sit down and discuss other options..we got many other scheme you can take up...first, can I ask, why you want to throw key??....
