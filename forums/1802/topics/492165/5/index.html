              Dun read his book lah, will send you to Holland, taxi driving is not about your status in the society, it is about the passion and the job you wanted in life, but if you are thinking of earning big, or telling story, sorry, this is not the job. During his time, there were no apps rides, if have, I think he would had joined them.
                  
              Money is a need, we all cannot deny it, especially so in the context of Singapore high living cost, however, money is not permanent, it can bring you a short period of happiness, but most of the time, prolong period of unhappiness due to shortage of it.
                  
              Therefore, to truly touch one soul, one hv to sincerely ask himself, what do you want in life, some people take up taxi is because it is all about self, ME or I, out of the corporate world of dirty politics, out of the world of back stabbing and bossing.
                  
              So, you need to have that passion in you to truly say, I enjoy driving and serving others by transporting them from A to B or B to C, and that there is no one to blame except ME, and
                  
              I answer for my own action and hold my own responsibility by earning an honest living by getting pay from direct serving others. You got to have that passion, otherwise, forget about it, it either you get out in a month or you go on and keep grumbling this and that even after 20 years of driving taxis.

              I lor, I drive with passion, a person who work with passion is a always a happy person, it is not about the hard work or passion for money alone, it is about what you enjoy, but of course you hv to take the good and bad of any industrial, the good times and bad times aka OBK times.
                  
                  
              I know many do not find it passionate to drive taxis, but still drive because of this and that, but no matter what reason you can give to be a taxi driver, you are a taxi driver, full stop.
                  
              Just remember you are already a taxi driver, and since already truly a taxi driver, might as well enjoy it, be passion about it, otherwise, life will be more frustrating, more anger and more discontent.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your kind reminder. I am a o level holder . During younger days, i switch jobs alot so my job history is very poor. I agree with u regarding cpf. The additional 17% as of now is helpful to me as ii am still paying housing loan. If i drive taxi, i need to set aside monthly $500 cash for cpf housing provided my wife is still working and contributing with no additional montly cpf  savings. That's why i now suck thumb keeping my job knowing that i really dislike it. I joined this forum to know more abt td real life experiences and estimated income. Becos once i made my decision, i know there is no turning back. I cannot assured/ convinced/ promised  my wife that i can take care of our expenses monthly being a td. She knows it very well too.

              We worst than you, I only PSLE, also cannot pass. Our time is different from you, that time I drive taxis in the late 80s, no apps, no hp, no GPS, only got one walkie and horse racing calender, we still can earn and afford to bungalow, 
              
              now drive taxi can end up in a gallow/hospital.
              
              As Chinese saying, every trade produce it own scholars except taxi driving.
              
              So my advice is, dun even think of driving taxis, if you really need an assurance on why it is not wise to join taxi driving, I can sent my Bro Ah Fool to give you a one to one lecture, FOC.

              <p>Aiyah, if your current job sucks, then switch lor.. </p>
              <p>As a TD,</p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>1. Flexibility, yes but comes at a price.  You decide whether you want to work or not and not others decide for you against your will.</p>
              <p>2. You get to meet all kinds of people.  Some nice, most neutral and few nasty.</p>
              <p>3. You get to go places that you have never been or thought existed, but once in a while only. You can see some nice houses and atas condos.</p>
              <p>4. You do not bring your work worries home unless you get involved in accidents or trouble with pax.  End of shift, switch off engine and go home be with family peacefully.  Every day, start engine is a new day.</p>
              <p>5. You may meet some very nice pax who chat with you on interesting topics, offer you food and drinks or give good tips.</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>1. Health wise, you may suffer.  But if you know how to eat properly, take breaks to rest well and exercise properly, should be sustainable.</p>
              <p>2. You are on the roads 12 hrs or more a day.  Safety is paramount. Drive safe, don't be impatient and give way even if you have the right of way to avoid accidents at all costs.</p>
              <p>3. You do meet some nasty pax occasionally but keeping a cool head and sometimes apologising usually solves the problem.</p>
              <p>4. Fare evaders can happen to you.  Just take it in the right spirit and move on.</p>
              <p>5. It is a job that ppl look down on.  But if you are not bothered how others including your friends and relatives see you, then should be no problem.  It is an honest living.</p>
              <p>Financial wise, if you are not a big spender, you can raise a family comfortably.  50,000 taxi drivers are doing it, you should be no exception.  Your wife needs to give her support, not in the financial sense, but she should not feel inferior to be the wife of a taxi driver.  Then all will be fine. Safety on the roads is very important.  Any other problem can be resolved.</p>
              <p>If you are young, go upgrade yourself.  This is to give yourself another path to walk on should you want to get out of this trade in the future. Good luck and drive safe.</p>

              See most discussion here abt pay comparison , cpf , annual leave etc.
              First ask yourself these question before even thinking about taxi vocation.
              Are you a above average skill driver 
              Are you able to manoeuvre fast at tight space situation 
              Are you a fast driver
              Are you cool level headed
              Do you have good sense of road direction
              Do you have high EQ...required as a td
              Some decent IQ required too

              Play games with pax , TP , ph drivers, other tds.
                          Are you able to drive 3 hours non stop
                          Are you able to clock min 200km everyday
                          So you need to consider the attributes required to be a td. Not the $$$
              Listen to bowah die faster.
              Talk abt service..and be happy serving people.
              Just point A to point B without taking longer routes...this is the basic service..simple as that...I am happy when my yi yang zi press faster than anyone else...and then got a AP job after midnight.is a dog eat dog world as a td..not as easy as you think. Certain company after certain time employee then can claim taxi fares ..this type of info need to know...

              huh? drive taxi must hv high EQ and IQ want meh??? no wonder my ah fool laughing...
                      
                      
              aiya, today, MOM minister Lim sia suay said, Singapore still got 30 thousands jobs available in all sector, why must choose taxi driving leh??? later my ah fool will said, siao liao, another competitor on the road.
                      
              And to be frank, most taxi drivers (born during the baby booming period) who drove until 50s or late 40s or even 60s had in a way regretted that they are  taxi driver, could had chose a better career like casket driving, bus driving or even a storekeeper job, by this time and age, most would had become leaders, supervisors, managers or even set up own business from the niche of their experiences.
                      
              Must remember that Taxi driving is a non advance career (or should not be a career).
                      
              That is why you see many older TDs like those above everyday kpkb this and that, some drive until  ki siao, many drive until go hospital and have premature dead,..which is also good for our casket business. 
                  
              Many have anxiety deficiency and hypertension within them, and also psychic mental issue that go on non observed. You will notice they get angry very fast, and suddenly change of personality is common among taxi drivers. Many survive thru hallucination of "if", if I kena toto, if I kena 4D, if I am younger, if I got money...if my lanjiao still can...
