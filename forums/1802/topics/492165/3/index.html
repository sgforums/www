              <p>U do lose out on being a employed salaried person, such as AL, bonus, employee CPF etc, but for your housing loan, u'll need to top up cash. or pay by cash, or self contribute CPF (not so popular option)</p>

              Hanor hanor, drive taxi is like progressing backward, you should progress forward, like SMRT BUS just announced 20% increase in pay, so if you are new the pay is about $2,000 liao, + allowances and Overtime..wow, can reach 3k liao
              
              And senior bus driver can hv basic salary of 3,400. Still drive smlj taxi?? and for apps drivers, these are mostly lost sheep lured into a den and waiting for slaughter.

              <p>Taxi driving is not all fun.  On the contrary, there is very little freedom esp if you have family to feed and housing loans to pay.  Dun see those Ah lau TDs like bowah at the coffeeshop enjoying their kopi.  They are retired and got nothing better to do.</p>
              <p>You may think you have freedom, but you start everyday in debt already and sometimes take more than half a day to cover your debt. Sick also must drive. So, for a TD, your freedom comes at a price of about $5+ an hour.</p>
              <p>Still, if you believe you will like it, then go ahead lah. Don't think so much.</p>

              <p>let put it this way if LTA increase bus fare by 2% and have every 5 to 8min a service come on time. i will not mind paying the fare. of cos for this to happend LTA have to rebuild the bus lanes and make buses skip traffic lights anf junctions. and for that if the driver salary increase it will be good for all. now how much a seinor driver getting?? $4k include OT?? </p>

              <p>5 days weekdays can find hirer lah. Nowadays, with the rise of Uber and Grab, it's a relief market. Many hirers cannot find relief as all go drive for Uber n Grab. Unless u live in an atas area like Orchard Rd, should be able to find a hirer within a 5km radius. </p>

              <p>if u are stressed and hard up for $, u can still drive, but u need longer hours to see huge income, and soon fatigue and occupartional hazards will appear. and some bad days, its beyond your control, it'll add stress</p>
              <p>those lesser commitments, more relax kind can take their time to drive around, collect fares, see which fancy place for a meal, coffee, or shopping, just go..</p>

              On the road, you always see a road sign saying, No thru Road. That will more or less explain what Taxi driving job is about.
