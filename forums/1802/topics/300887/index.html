            <div class='col-md body'>Not true. Cabby always complain their earning not enough. Now they want to complain so taxi companies can lower their daily rental. These all their excuse lah. If driving a taxi really so jia luck, WHY ARE THERE STILL SO MANY OF THEM DRIVING? Come on lah. I do have many friens drivng taxis. I know how much they earn daily after deducting all expenses. Even a diploma holder earning S$4800 each month also drive taxi part time. Why need to do so when you already earning so high pay???? Its because of the good $$$.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ComfortDelgro taxi drivers claim loss of earnings due to 35% surcharge.<br><br>SINGAPORE : At least 20 ComfortDelGro taxi drivers have said they want a return to the S$2 surcharge, instead of the new 35 percent peak hour surcharge on the metered fare.<br><br>One taxi driver even said his earnings have dropped by an average of S$50 per shift to about S$150 now - because of fewer customers.<br><br>However, others are waiting to see the full effects of the new surcharge.<br><br>Mr Azman Mohamed, who has been driving a taxi for less than a year, said there is a perception problem with the new fare structure.<br><br>Many commuters think peak hours have been changed and the 35 percent surcharge also applies on Sundays and public holidays. This is not so.<br><br>He said four out of five believe the new surcharge also applies to the whole fare, including ERP and booking fees. In reality, it applies only to the metered fare.<br><br>Mr Azman said it now takes about 30 minutes to pick up a passenger during peak periods - compared to five or 10 minutes previously.<br><br>The perceived higher cost of taking a taxi is hitting taxi drivers' earnings.<br><br>Mr Azman said, "Most of them feel that the 35 percent (surcharge) is not helping them. They are losing money and putting back the S$2 will help them. And that is also an incentive encouraging them to drive during the peak hours."<br><br>He hopes his earnings will improve when more people go back to work next week.<br><br>Comfort taxi drivers who still have the old fare chart are being given copies of the new fare chart, while new ones are being published.<br><br>The Corporate Communications Department of ComfortDelGro said it has not received any concerns about the 35 percent peak period surcharge on the metered fare from commuters or taxi drivers.<br><br>Singapore's second-largest operator, SMRT, said it has also not received any feedback on commuters confused about the new 35 percent surcharge.<br><br>However, some of its drivers have reported passengers saying it is too expensive to take a taxi.<br><br>TransCab said its drivers are experiencing a lack of passengers, but believes the problem is only temporary.<br><br>The Taxi Operators' Association, which represents the six operators here, said it has not received any feedback of the new surcharge driving customers away. - CNA/ms</div>

I do have many friens drivng taxis. I know how much they earn daily after deducting all expenses. Even a diploma holder earning S$4800 each month also drive taxi part time.
