              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Actually, the whole thing was fated and could have been avoided. This PRC wanted to rob a taxi driver.  He got no money and his mother in China was suffering from cancer. Saw many taxis at Sun Plaza taxi stand, but got no guts to hail one. Went to main road, many taxis passed by, but he did not flag.  He wanted to abandon his plan and go home. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Then, this TD came along.  PRC did not flag. The TD stopped some distance ahead, then reversed his taxi, wind down the window and asked the PRC where he wanted to go. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">PRC there and then decided to carry out his act. He asked the TD to take him to Jalan Selimang. Such a deserted place, why would a foreign worker want to go there?</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">At Jalan Selimang, PRC took out a knife and put it against the TD's chest and asked the TD to give him his money. The TD said ok and took out the money. The PRC momentarily let go off his grip on the TD. This was when the TD fought back and in the process, was stabbed. The stabs were fatal as the TD lost a lot of blood. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The PRC heard noises from the nearby mosque. He then quickly disposed of the body in the woods. The body was not discovered until six days later. By then, it was so badly decomposed that the forensic pathologist could not ascertain the cause of death. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The PRC then drove the cab to a nearby carpark and left it there. He was caught whilst trying to book a flight home in People's Park. When Police brought him to Jln Selimang to find the body, he shivered and was so scared he did not want to follow the police into the woods. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">If the TD did not put up a fight, perhaps he might live. SMRT driver. </span></p>

              At the end of the day, coincidences goes a long way, like if that PRC had not come to singapore, if that PRC mother did not hv cancer...and so on. Therefore, we just sent our deepest condolences to our dear brother on the road and move on.
              
              What ever happen to that prc, dead or alive is not going make a great differences anymore, unless u hv a heart like my bro keepthechange who die die must take revenge type, an eye for an eye type, then I have nothing much to say.

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Ya. So
              sad. The TD got one son in NS and a daughter in school. Wife works
              as a clinic assistant. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Actually, the whole
              thing was fated and could have been avoided. This PRC wanted to rob
              a taxi driver.  He got no money and his mother in China was
              suffering from cancer. Saw many taxis at Sun Plaza taxi stand, but
              got no guts to hail one. Went to main road, many taxis passed by,
              but he did not flag.  He wanted to abandon his plan and go
              home. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Then,
              this TD came along.  PRC did not flag. The TD stopped some
              distance ahead, then reversed his taxi, wind down the window and
              asked the PRC where he wanted to go. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">PRC
              there and then decided to carry out his act. He asked the TD to
              take him to Jalan Selimang. Such a deserted place, why would a
              foreign worker want to go there?</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">At Jalan
              Selimang, PRC took out a knife and put it against the TD's chest
              and asked the TD to give him his money. The TD said ok and took out
              the money. The PRC momentarily let go off his grip on the TD. This
              was when the TD fought back and in the process, was stabbed. The
              stabs were fatal as the TD lost a lot of blood. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The PRC
              heard noises from the nearby mosque. He then quickly disposed of
              the body in the woods. The body was not discovered until six days
              later. By then, it was so badly decomposed that the forensic
              pathologist could not ascertain the cause of
              death. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">The PRC
              then drove the cab to a nearby carpark and left it there. He was
              caught whilst trying to book a flight home in People's Park. When
              Police brought him to Jln Selimang to find the body, he shivered
              and was so scared he did not want to follow the police into the
              woods. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">If the
              TD did not put up a fight, perhaps he might live. SMRT
              driver. </span></p>

              Foreign maids are lucky. The gahmen scared to provoke their neighbouring countries. Many indon maids have got away with killing their employers, on grounds of manslaughter committed while suffering depression.

              There is alway a clause on insanity of the pinoy maid
              
              Look gentlemen, the laws can be pressured by certain influence, as such Singapore laws have been a critic of international amnesty in capital punishment, especially the human rights group. And as Singapore is a member of UN, it must abide certain regulations. That influenced the laws here.
              
              Of course everyone of us know what is manslaughter and what is murder, manslaughter is consider not intended whereas murder is intended and planned. 
              
              Therefore, when we relook at the taxi case, the intention was to rob, not to kill, and because thru struggling, taxi driver get killed. So, the line to draw here is very critical, manslaughter or murder (given that all are sane).
              
              All of use know the initial punishment was death, and with the shift in our strict laws inorder to satisfy human right groups, the line was shifted back to manslaugher and sentenced to life.
              
              Of course all of us are sad over it, including me, and especially so, a brother of ours, we all naturally, got emotion.

              There are heavy consequences if SIngapore is to carry on death sentencing, our economy might suffer due to trade ban.
              
              As you are brits trained, you should had understood the western laws, in western laws, like syria laws, they abide in a way to their religion, and to the west, who are mostly christian, only God can decide the fate of a man, a man cannot put another man to dead unless the whole country agreed.
              
              That is also why when western judge sentence a person to death, he or she will put on a veil on his or her face, it represent that it is god will, not his or her decision.
              
              Therefore, Singapore, who adopted British laws, from common to layman laws, are pressured by the west to relook into their capital punishement. The stigma of one man cannot judge another man to death is still much a western cultured laws. And you are british trained, should had know better.
              
              ON the other hand, china, being communist (communist have no religion, because MAO said, religion is a poison), careless smlj western...take go out and face the firing squad liao

              He shouldn't ask the PRC whether if he wanted a taxi, he shouldn't go for that "extra" money, or he could have inform HQ that he has been robbed after the robbery.
              He shouldn't have fought back, I will say this was the scariest crime watch episode
