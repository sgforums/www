All other examples and scenarios were raised by others. I stick to what I have mentioned and they are - for your sake - in point form -<br><br>1. There was no passenger queing for taxi at the taxi stand.<br>2. There were 10 taxis waiting in line<br>3. They were from various taxi companies<br>4. So I had the choice, the taxi drivers did not.<br>5. I happened to be at the end of the taxi line.<br>6. A Premier silver cab was second from the end of the taxi line.<br>7. The rest were from other companies.<br>8. I like to sit in a Premier cab.<br><br>Based on [b]<span style="color: red;">ALL THE ABOVE</span></strong>, please answer my question -<br><br>Why can't I choose the cab, more importantly the cab company, I prefer??<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</blockquote>Can i answer this question ?<br><br>U can chose which company u prefer , but it's not "COMPULSORY" , nor "MANDATORY" , or "LAW ENFORCED" that this particular driver must take u at that situation .<br><br>He is only wrong if u are first in the Q , and he rejected u .<br><br>U can chose to wait for the first few taxis to clear , then u hop into the Silver Arrow via ur turn , nobody can stop u ..... ( sorry , did he mention Silver Arrow ? I assume is ) , if he failed to pick u , he's mandatory wrong . U complaint , he die !<br><br>In fact ..... there's only <span style="color: red;">two regulated taxi slots </span>at that taxi stand , any business done within 50m of the taxi stand ( outside of the 2 regulated taxi slot ) , is consider illegal for taxi drivers .<br><br>Yes , no doubt there's a taxi-Q ( mind u , it illegal outside the 2 regulated taxis slot ) , but if this Silver Arrow pick u , and got caught by LTA , he will be in trouble picking u !<br><br>So this Silver Arrow cabby is clever enough not to pick u .<br><br>He's helping himself from some trouble .<br><br>Many cabbies chosen , would have drove off with u , and land themself into LTA Book of Misconduct ( if got caught )<br><br>I am surprise u said u are a Part-time cabby ....<br><br>True cabby would never do that ....ie  take that taxi between the Q !!<br><br>TS should know very well the mandatory rule of "50 metre from taxi stand regulation ".<br><br>That is : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxi driver <strong>cannot</strong> pick customer 50 metres within the radius of a Regulated Taxi Stand </span><br><br>They have to proceed to the human Q instead .<br><br>Go take a look , every taxi stand there'll be this "Sign-Board" : <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: green;">This taxi stand for 2 taxis only </span></strong></span><br><br>My explanation here will be the same from those from LTA .... 1.the taxi-stand 2 slots ruling ...... and 2. 50m from taxi stand ruling .<br><br>This 2 regulations is good enough to provide a good support from LTA or taxi drivers , in term of complain coming in .</div>

All other examples and scenarios were raised by others. I stick to what I have mentioned and they are - for your sake - in point form -<br><br>1. There was no passenger queing for taxi at the taxi stand.<br>2. There were 10 taxis waiting in line<br>3. They were from various taxi companies<br>4. So I had the choice, the taxi drivers did not.<br>5. I happened to be at the end of the taxi line.<br>6. A Premier silver cab was second from the end of the taxi line.<br>7. The rest were from other companies.<br>8. I like to sit in a Premier cab. </blockquote>No passengers doesnt mean there is no queue. The taxis are queueing to pick up passengers from the queue. If you are going to take a taxi in the queue, you would have to take the 1 in front coz you form a "1 - man" queue when u decided to take cabs in the line.<br><br>Its ethics, Imagine u queueing up to buy food, then i cut into the middle.</div>
