If i am the cabbie in front, i looked in the rearview mirror and see this joker get fare and drive off.  What would I think? He solicited you by offering you a lower fare - which is something that is against the practice of taxi drivers.  He won't be thinking, oh, the guy likes Premiere cab more.  Now mulitply by the number of cabs ahead of him, and the poor driver instantly got himself a dozen ppl very dl with  him.<br><br>also, cabbies because nature of their jobs being so mobile, often meet at different coffee shops or they even congregate regularly at certain spots to take up fares, imagine you made ppl dl, not nice and ethical mah.<br><br>you choose his cab, your interaction with him is only a few minutes or half and hour and then you are off, but for him, he face the dl cabbies / colleagues day in day out ...so in his shoes, he doesn't want that.<br><br>if you really like to choose, you can always flag a cab away from the taxi queue bcos i noe, there are cabbies who don't like to queue and they will pick u up.<br><br>your scenerio is slightly different from case of the lady who request to be dropped off where she like.  in her case, its the cabbie who is guai lanz who wanted convenience for himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><br>I just started reading this thread after a friend told me about it. I cannot help but join in as what started as a simple message asking for comments is reduced to a senseless blog of brutal insults. This is bad for forum as a whole.<br><br>The starter, Laogenjudi - I shall call him Mr Lao - asked a very legitimate question. As a consumer or commuter, why can't he exercise his choice?<br><br>Response has been fast and furious; understandably so because many feel that they want to help the taxi uncles. Lets try to get a clearer picture admist the smoke. Mr Lao insists he can choose the taxi company but all the others say he cannot choose the taxi driver. In principle, Mr Lao is right but in practice he is wrong. Mr Lao has failed to understand the human component. He may have grudges against the taxi companies but he cannot use the driver as a tool to fight his cause.<br><br>As somebody has said, "call a cab if you want to choose."<br><br>About the conduct of forum here. Interestingly, and ironically, the very people who tell Mr Lao to be sensitive, ethical and show respect to others are themselves hurling abuses and insults at Mr Lao. Remarks such as, "If you don't like it, get out of the country","you a foreigner from a backward country?","never take a taxi before" or "don't know what a queue is" are absolutely uncalled for remarks. What difference are they from Mr Lao as far as respecting an individual is concerned ?<br><br>You can voice your opinion but others don't have to agree with you. Why start the name calling? It only provokes the other party to respond likewise and eventually the vicious cycle spirals out of control. What a shame. For the purpose of a healthy forum, post moderator should chide writers who start calling names.<br><br>I would like to provide Mr Lao with some "intelligent answers". He may have faded away after the massive bombardment. If that is the case, nobody is any wiser - but weirder definitely.</span><br><br></div>

All other examples and scenarios were raised by others. I stick to what I have mentioned and they are - for your sake - in point form -<br><br>1. There was no passenger queing for taxi at the taxi stand.<br>2. There were 10 taxis waiting in line<br>3. They were from various taxi companies<br>4. So I had the choice, the taxi drivers did not.<br>5. I happened to be at the end of the taxi line.<br>6. A Premier silver cab was second from the end of the taxi line.<br>7. The rest were from other companies.<br>8. I like to sit in a Premier cab.<br><br>Based on [b]<span style="color: red;">ALL THE ABOVE</span></strong>, please answer my question -<br><br>Why can't I choose the cab, more importantly the cab company, I prefer??<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>The problem is that you are in this system whereby the first in line always get to go first. Thus you cannot take anyone that is in this system. To get the cab company that you actually like or as you said in your post, "choose the premier cab", please pick up your phone and dial for it.<br><br>Or you can stand away from the queue and try flagging down a premier cab. The system is build in such a way that the first one at the queue gets the next passenger and not the next passenger gets to choose anyone from the queue just the way they like or feel about a particular cab.<br><br>Speaking or which, which cab rejects passenger when they join the taxi queues and only choose the passengers of their choice from the existing queue of passenger at the taxi stand?<br><br>You should know about it more than us since you mentioned that you are working part time as well. There are several companies in singapore, Comfort, CityCab, Transit, etc... Even within the cab company, there are different models of cabs...<br><br>The company do not pay the drivers, the drivers pay the company for the rental of their vehicle daily. They are still under the company in the sense that the company will take action against them if they break any rules listed by their company like chosing passengers.<br><br>They also have warnings and demerit points system whereby their cab license can be taken away if they continue to make mistakes.<br><br>LTA would not respond to you because you are thinking as if you are shopping. Boarding a cab in the taxi queue is not like taking an item from the shelves full of manchanise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Those cabs had agreed to follow the system when they joined the queue and thus, you are not allow to choose the cab that is queueing in the queu itself.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by thinkloud2004:</div><div class="quote_body">I just started reading this thread after a friend told me about it. I cannot help but join in as what started as a simple message asking for comments is reduced to a senseless blog of brutal insults. This is bad for forum as a whole.<br><br>The starter, Laogenjudi - I shall call him Mr Lao - asked a very legitimate question. As a consumer or commuter, why can't he exercise his choice?<br><br>Response has been fast and furious; understandably so because many feel that they want to help the taxi uncles. Lets try to get a clearer picture admist the smoke. Mr Lao insists he can choose the taxi company but all the others say he cannot choose the taxi driver. In principle, Mr Lao is right but in practice he is wrong. Mr Lao has failed to understand the human component. He may have grudges against the taxi companies but he cannot use the driver as a tool to fight his cause.<br><br>As somebody has said, "call a cab if you want to choose."<br><br>About the conduct of forum here. Interestingly, and ironically, the very people who tell Mr Lao to be sensitive, ethical and show respect to others are themselves hurling abuses and insults at Mr Lao. Remarks such as, "If you don't like it, get out of the country","you a foreigner from a backward country?","never take a taxi before" or "don't know what a queue is" are absolutely uncalled for remarks. What difference are they from Mr Lao as far as respecting an individual is concerned ?<br><br>You can voice your opinion but others don't have to agree with you. Why start the name calling? It only provokes the other party to respond likewise and eventually the vicious cycle spirals out of control. What a shame. For the purpose of a healthy forum, post moderator should chide writers who start calling names.<br><br>I would like to provide Mr Lao with some "intelligent answers". He may have faded away after the massive bombardment. If that is the case, nobody is any wiser - but weirder definitely.<br></div></blockquote>I am afraid you need to dig a little deeper....<br><br>The beginning of this thread is not the first thread of this topic, it is actually here: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=254504" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=254504</a> here is where I got first involved by answering the TS. You will find my short answer at about 3 post from the bottom. I did ask - curiously and without sarcasm - if the TS is from overseas.<br><br>Subsequently the thread was locked because it was in the wrong place.<br><br>This thread was reposted here, with almost the same questions from the TS. Again I asked the question: are you a foreigner?<br><br>My question was without malice, I am merely confused that the TS is asking questions that are part and parcel of life without giving more explanation over his experience.<br><br>Let me state that at this point, the TS could have simply answer my question and tell us the REASON behind the questions. Note that actual questions is different from the reason why a person ask those questions.<br><br>Without any further clarification on whether the TS was a foreigner or local, I assume that he is a foreigner. Hence I said, if you are not happy with the local system, leave.<br><br>All these while, the TS made not attempt to clarify his status or position. Yet subsequently he claimed that he is a part time driver. That being the case, I would assume that he is familiar with the rules of LTA and the other relevant authorities. <span style="color: red;">So at this point, I ask, why all the questions if he already know all the rules?</span><br><br>We need to observe that most forummers had already given their take on the WHYS, and I believe the answers has been reasonable and extremely realistic.<br><br>Unfortunately the TS is not willing to accept such answers.<br><br>Time and again, I've tried to ask him for his status. And time and again, he refuse to deal with this question. Therefore, at this point, we can safely conclude that perhaps the TS is leading us on, and perhaps, too, that the the TS is not being upfront with himself to us.<br><br>To me the TS is a paradox: he wants the system to work in such a way that the taxi drivers do not benefit from fair practice yet he is a taxi driver. This is the point where I am quite confused over. This is different from some of the other posts, which came from the totally consumer viewpoint.<br><br>At the end of the day, the queue system is designed to be FIRST IN FIRST OUT, taxi companies not withstanding. Who gets into the queue first, gets the fare first. It is as simple as that. By merely going by cab companies is also not the answer. Drivers are not robots, every company will have their own bad hats. So in itself, choice of cab companies is not really a good justification for this issue.<br><br>This system is no different from what is practiced in an A&amp;E section of the hospital or the polyclinic.... you see whichever doctor that is assigned to you! You want to choose? Pay the price of a specialist!<br><br><strong>Yet, thinkloud, I am willing to read whatever profound theories you may have to have a system to work in a taxi-queue environment.</strong></div>

There were 10 taxis waiting in line<br>3. They were from various taxi companies<br>4. So I had the choice, the taxi drivers did not.<br>5. I happened to be at the end of the taxi line.<br>6. A Premier silver cab was second from the end of the taxi line.<br>7. The rest were from other companies.<br>8. I like to sit in a Premier cab.<br><br><span style="color: green;">In fact, many good suggestions already appeared after my post. I just wish to add.<br><br>When you select a taxi in the taxi queue, you are not just choosing the taxi company. You are choosing the driver - and that is an insult. Coming from the rear of the taxi line further reduces your rationale. What happens if, just as you were about to go into the Premier cab; another person comes from the front also prefers the same cab.  Will you give way? Will the law of the jungle prevail then?<br><br>All your conditions mentioned are variables. It is because there are many variables that rules are being set and implemented. When there is a rule, everybody follows and it cannot be bent to suit your variables.<br><br>Your preference may be a Premier cab, somebody else may want a young handsome driver, a certain race or religion, a cab with more flashy advertisements.....etc. Imagine if the authority allows all such preferences at a taxi stand.<br><br>If Mr Lao were to travel by bus, try boarding at the EXIT door and tell the driver because it is nearer to you and you still pay the fare. I don't know how he will react. But I am sure some of the passengers will feel like pushing you down. Granted some of the rules are not, or need not be, very explicit but there are things called social grace and etiquette. Try to be different and prepare to be unceremoniously denounced.<br><br>Regards</span><br><br></div>
