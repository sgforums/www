            <div class='col-md body'>I was walking towards the taxi stand outside Capitol Centre, North Bridge road. To hail a taxi of course. I saw at least 10 taxis, from various companies, waiting in line. As I approached from the back of the line, I decided to hop into a Premier Taxi which was second from last. The taxi driver turned around and said I should go and take the first taxi in line. I said no because I did not want to walk more and besides I prefer Premier Taxi than other taxis. He insisted that I MUST take the first taxi and refused to move.<br><br>Angrily, I got out, crossed the road and took the MRT.<br><br>Why taxi driver can choose passenger but passenger cannot choose taxi?<br>I simply do not like certain taxi companies, why can't I patronise the one that I like?<br>I am paying more to take a taxi because I do not want to walk more. Why can't I hop on to the taxi nearest to me?<br>Finally, what is the penalty or punishment for the driver if he decided to accept me? Will he be fined by LTA or get whacked by his hungry colleagues?<br><br>Comments please (more specifically, please answer the questions).   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

You don't have to like to join the queue, but join the queue you must.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laogenjudi:</div><div class="quote_body">Your point on <span style="color: red;">Censured by LTA</span> interests me?

No cab drivers already in a queue is allowed to pick up a walk-up passenger unless he is in he head of the queue. This is a safeguard as well as a safety feature.... otherwise, every cab can jump in and out and endangering passengers and pedestrians.</div>

Not that of the taxi driver...<br><br>Consumers have their rights to bring their businesses to other when they deemed not to their satisfaction...<br><br>Likewise, service providers also have their rights in rejecting your businesses when they deemed not to their rights...<br><br>Just because you prefered Silver Arrow as the premier service and deemed other providers like lousy and untrained, that doesn't mean that you can abuse your consumer rights in kbkb here about not getting the service you have been rejected, fundamentally because due to their work and personal ethics not suited to your preferences and liking...<br><br>You don't simply understand that not all things in life are within your reach and desire...<br><br>When was the last time you had a good job, had a good meal, had a good relationship, had a good praise and pat on your back? Not always, and there must be times when you had been scolded by your superior, bad encounters with people, bad tasting food...<br><br>This is what we call life...</div>
