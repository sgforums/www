Never knew that passengers have such great power.<br>While I respect LTA's reply, I don't think I will, out of respect for taxi drivers, chooe a taxi at the taxi stand.<br><br>Anyway you have proven yourself right. And thanks for sharing.<br><br>I think all of us who thought otherwise and said unkind things owe Mr Lao an apology.<br><br>Regards</span><br><br><span class="large"><br>Dear Mr Thinkloud2004. You are welcome. First, I must apologise for not replying your earlier post. This is because I was then waiting for LTA's official reply. I agreed with you that out of courtesy, we should not choose the taxi but my point is "knowing our rights as a consumer." Secondly, I apologise (to you) that I had to resort to profanity, just like some of those uncouths. My grandfather once told me,"When you speak to a man, use human language. When you speak to a roach, just say sh***it."<br><br>As your name implies you THINK before you write. You are one of the very few who writes with wits and wisdom here. Measured and calculated, you obviously know what you are saying - unlike the bunch of petulant and querulous school boys who fart in their pants knowing nobody will find out who they are. <span style="color: red;">Even with their pants stained, they still deny that they have farted ....hahaaa. </span><br><br>I hope to meet you in a cleaner environment where we can discuss issues more intelligently with intelligent people. My frequent places are City Hall, Capitol building and NLB, as I work in a University nearby.<br><br>The rest can continue to bluff each other and pollute the atmosphere here.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></span><br><br></div>
