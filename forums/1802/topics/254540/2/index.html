But in fact they have not answered my fundamental question - i.e. why can't I choose the taxi, more importantly the taxi company, I want?<br><br>Whether the driver accepts me or not is another matter. It takes two to complete a business deal.<br><br>Most of the (attempted) answers are from the heart rather than from the head, i.e. don't ask question, just give it to the first in line. No doubt, most people here are perfectly conditioned by rules, even if it means surrending their rights.<br><br>Try to provide answers to the following<br><span style="color: red;">1. How many taxi companies are there in Singapore?<br>2. Are they all the same?<br>3. If they are the same, why have different companies?<br>4. If they are different, why can't I choose the one I prefer?</span><br><br>I am not against queing for taxis. I am appalled at our capitalist cum socialist system. There are many taxi companies, ostensibly to give consumers more choices but in fact to create more managers and directors for the chosen elites.

They lay down the rules and if you are not happy they tell you, "You have plenty of choices.

I go to this famous computer centre in town.<br>There is this RICH TYCOON having a shop in almost every floor in the building, starting with level one where I enter the building. Heard all kinds of bad reports about this tycoon's various outlets. Their sales people are foul-mouthed, impatient and resort to personal attack when they cannot manage to convince you to buy. They cheat tourists. They despise locals.<br><br>Also heard from a friend that at level six there is this little shop where service is wonderful and price reasonable.
