              Long ago, I already said it very clearly, taxis driving or even apps driving is never a way to earn a living and bringing up a young family, 
                      
              you do not need any style in driving, because you can never know where you will end up everyday, it is more for people who are retrenched and take it as an interim period and also for people like me, 
                      
              old man and woman whose childrens have grown up,  married and living happily, we just drive to make our brain stay sensible before dementia set in.
                      
              In today digitalization age moving toward an industrial 4.0 model/blueprint, young peoples should educate and train themselves more on robotics, IT , digitalization management, digital remote, control and services.
                      
              The economy today is going into a slow pace as the next phase of a new industrial is slowly taking place to churn up the economy again, by then, you will hv self actualization in doing most thing, from driver less to fully automate factories and fully self service. 
              
              If you notice the changes in our education system, you will understand the movement of our govt nurturing our youngs toward this new digital industrial.
                      
              All these shall lead to reduction in labours, stay abreast of all other countries who are still using tuk tuk or proton saga as taxis, a digital knowledge base local workforce that service the need of this new industrial and with it, a faster pace of improvement and huge leap for the economy of Singapore.
                      
              So, Still drive smlj taxi??? nobody will be in a right mind to tell his or her sons to be a taxi or apps drivers, if so, the parents must be siao liao.

              <p>Cannon bo? Many uber driver tell me more you drive the lesser is the profit. Because of high levy and high fuel cost. Morning till night non stop how can beat taxi earnings? Even same collections the uber have to pay more levy and fuel cost more then taxi. </p>

              <p>If you notice the changes in our education system, you will
              understand the movement of our govt nurturing our youngs toward

              <p>All these shall lead to reduction in labours, stay abreast of
              all other countries who are still using tuk tuk or proton saga as
              taxis, a digital knowledge base local workforce that service the
              need of this new industrial and with it, a faster pace of
              improvement and huge leap for the economy of Singapore.</p>
              <p>So, Still drive smlj taxi??? nobody will be in a right mind to
              tell his or her sons to be a taxi or apps drivers, if so, the

              <p>i agree with the <em>above, </em>esp so in todays market sentiment. people with no debts or commitments, can drive taxi to keep themselves sane. the piece of cake gone smaller due to 3rd party apps, pick ups, new mrt lines etc etc. but people in mid life crisis also being squezzed out of job market. </p>
              <p>this year, i see many business, neighborhood shops, food stalls, having a real hard time too</p>
