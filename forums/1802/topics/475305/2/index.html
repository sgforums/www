              <div>
              <p>The Multi-Mission Range Complex (MMRC) is a first-of-class three-storey indoor live firing range located at Pasir Laba. The MMRC leverages on advanced technology to improve soldier shooting competencies and facilitates the training of soldiers' traditional and advanced shooting skills in an evolving operating environment.</p>
              <p>The MMRC is a Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated as part of a Public-Private-Partnership scheme. The SAF manages the MMRC's developmental and running costs, while the design and build functions of the infrastructure and systems are managed by the SAF, DSTA and the principal contractor, Multi-Mission Range Services (MMRS).<strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Features and capabilities</strong></p>
              <p>MMRC comprises seven ranges including the following:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Two 100m Combat Ranges for the standard 100m Marksmanship Test packages.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Two 100m double storey Multi-Tier Ranges for advanced shooting skills.</li>
              <li>An Urban Operations Range consisting of 2 chambers with 10 different configurations for close-quarter shooting.</li>
              <li>Two 50m ranges that hones our soldiers' judgmental skills through the use of a scenario-based video/CGI targetry system.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The MMRC's safety features include the following:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong><span class="redLi">Ballistic material. </span></strong>All walls, celings and floors are lined with ballistic materials to prevent backsplash and ricochet of bullets. Different ranges use different combinations of rubber panels, steel and concrete materials to absorb or shatter bullets upon impact. Main entry and exit points at the ranges are bullet proof and the peripheral accessories at the urban ops ranges such as doors, lights, CCTVs and props are made of "shoot-through" materials that prevent ricochets and backsplashes.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> <strong><span class="redLi">Mechanical ventilation system.</span></strong> A special mechanical ventilation system draws the harmful lead-in-air content from the ammunition propellant, away from the soldier.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span class="redLi">Effective and efficient use of training time and resources</span>.</strong> The MMRC is designed to be an all-weather range for both day and night firing. With lighting control, the MMRC will be able to simulate day or night shooting conditions, thus removing the need to wait for nightfall to commence "night shoots". Waiting time is further reduced as training is not subjected to disruption by inclement weather. As an example, approximately 900 soldiers are able to complete the Marksmanship Test package in a day as compared to two to three days in outdoor ranges. These features of the MMRC effectively optimises the use of land and training spaces as it effectively replaces seven outdoor ranges in terms of throughput of soldiers undergoing training.</p>
              <p><span class="redLi"><strong>Enhanced training realism and soldier experience</strong></span><strong>.</strong> The MMRC provides realistic scenario-based training. All weather day/night conditions in both urban and conventional terrains with different operational scenarios can be programmed to hone our soldiers' skills. The use of state-of-art video targetry system such as Computer Generated Imagery is able to provide soldiers with scenario-based training where civilians and hostile targets appear at random. This adds to the realism of the training experience which presently cannot be replicated at the current baffled ranges.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="redLi">Outsourcing of Services.</span></strong> To ensure our soldiers shooting skills remain as their core focus during training, the functional services in MMRC are outsourced. These services include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong><span class="redLi">Ammunition Management.</span></strong> The firing units will indent and authorise the ammunition required. Upon which, the outsourced contractor, MMRS, will collect, pack, distribute and return the ammunition.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong><span class="redLi">Conduct of Range.</span></strong> MMRC operating staff conducts most of the basic and advanced shooting packages, with the exception of Urban Operations and Sniper Live Firing. These packages are conducted by the respective units as the tactics, techniques and procedures require instruction by unit commanders. In such packages, the MMRC staff will assist in operating the computer and targetry systems.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong><span class="redLi">Coaching and AAR.</span></strong> MMRC staff are also qualified as coaches. MMRC coaches are certified by the SAF and undergo the Infantry Small Arms Coaching Course. MMRC coaches are able to teach and provide feedback to soldiers and are particularly helpful for those who are not strong shooters. MMRC coaches will conduct After Action Reviews and weak firers may be coached at the Marksmanship Corrective Trainer before they shoot again. <br></li>
