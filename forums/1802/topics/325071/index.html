              <p><span>THOSE who assault public transport workers have been warned: An
              appeal judge yesterday tripled a businessman’s jail term after he
              appealed against his one-month jail sentence for punching a taxi
              driver, who later died of a heart-related condition.</span></p>
              <p><span>Justice of Appeal V K Rajah said the courts needed to send “a
              clear signal that any assault against public transport workers will be
              firmly dealt with”.</span></p>
              <p><span>On May 19 last year, businessman Wong Hoi Len, 50, had boarded
              cabbie Toon Chin Joo’s taxi at around 12.30am, after a night of
              drinking.</span></p>
              <p><span>Just before reaching his destination, Wong requested to stop the
              taxi as he needed to throw up. However, before he could alight from the
              taxi, Wong threw up. Toon, 49, alighted from his taxi and scolded Wong,
              who responded angrily.</span></p>
              <p><span>The dispute turned into a scuffle, with punches thrown by both
              men. Wong then pushed the cabbie to the ground as both men continued to
              struggle. A while later, Toon became motionless on the ground, and was
              later pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.</span></p>
              <p><span>An autopsy report found “deep bruising” on Toon’s face, but said
              the cabby died of an existing heart condition, known as Thyrocardiac
              Heart Disease.</span></p>
              <p><span>In March, a district judge had jailed Wong for a month, and the businessman then appealed against the sentence.</span></p>
              <p><span>Yesterday, Wong’s lawyer, Mr Tan Siah Yong, appealed for a lighter sentence —  a fine or a day’s jail.</span></p>
              <p><span>While he took into account that Wong had offered to compensate
              the cabby’s family, Justice Rajah said he “can’t ignore the fact that
              the extent of the attack was completely disproportionate” to what the
              businessman claimed had happened between the pair. Wong alleged the
              cabby had verbally insulted him that morning.</span></p>
              <p><span>The assault charge that Wong faced was also “comparatively
              modest, compared to the consequences that followed”, said Justice
              Rajah. The High Court Judge will be releasing detailed grounds of his
              decision later.</span></p>
              <p><span>When contacted, ComfortDelGro spokesperson Tammy Tan said the
              company — which runs taxis and buses — has seen “several cases” of
              passengers assaulting cabbies and bus captains in the last few years.</span></p>
              <p><span>For taxi drivers, “the numbers have gone up slightly this year
              compared to last year”. Assaults against bus captains seem to have
              fallen slightly, due in part to an anti-assault campaign the company
              launched last year, added Ms Tan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How cabbies can defuse threats</strong></span></p>
              <p>In light of the recent rise in cases of cabbies being robbed, the Land Transport Authority will work closely with all parties, including the police, to boost efforts in enhancing the safety of drivers.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Raymond Lim disclosed this in his reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Member of Parliament Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.</p>
              <p>While hardware installations, such as distress alarms in taxis, are useful, "simple preventive measures" can also be more effective, Mr Lim said.</p>
              <p>This includes "educating drivers on the dos and don'ts and the appropriate responses to take when faced with potential threats", he added -- TODAY</p>

              <p>Police arrested a taxi robber early this morning thanks to close
              cooperation between its Combined Operations Room and Comfort Taxi's.</p>
              <p>The 35-year-old taxi robber had been picked up along Kampong Bahru
              Road at about one this morning and wanted to be driven to Jurong West
              Street 81.</p>
              <p>While the taxi was travelling along the Ayer Rajah Expressway, the
              passenger, seated beside the 53-year-old driver started fiddling with
              information stickers pasted on the dashboard.</p>
              <p>He became abusive and aggressive when told to stop.</p>
              <p>He poked the driver on his left eye, and then punched him on the left cheek.</p>
              <p>The driver stopped and got out to call the Police at the road shoulder along the AYE near the National University Hospital.</p>
              <p>The passenger took the opportunity to drive away as the driver had left the key in the ignition.</p>
              <p>The police operator then worked closely with the operations room of Comfort taxi to track the stolen cab.</p>
              <p>Based on information received two Traffic Police officer laid an
              ambush for the taxi at the slip road from Jurong Town Hall leading to
              the AYE.</p>
              <p>Corporal Muhammad Ismail Amzah who was one of the two officer who laid the ambush recounted what happened.</p>
              <p>"Less than about 5 minutes we spotted the vehicle bypass our
              vehicle. Within two minutes we managed to stop the vehicle and managed
              to arrest the subject. They gave chase in their patrol vehicle when
              they spotted the cab speeding by."</p>
              <p>The officers managed to stop the suspect along the AYE opposite Faber Hill Condominium.</p>
              <p>The suspect failed a breathalyzer test and was arrested .</p>
              <p>Deputy Commander of Clementi Police Division Superintendent Loh Jee Cheong on the quick arrest.</p>
              <p>"The swift arrest of the taxi robber would not have been possible if
              not for the close cooperation between the two operations rooms. I would
              also like to congratulate and thank the two Traffic Police colleague of
              mine for their quick thinking that resulted in the arrest of the taxi
              robber."</p>
              <p>The suspect will be charged in court tomorrow for robbery with hurt.</p>
              <p>If convicted he can be imprisoned for between five and 20 years and caned at least 12 strokes. --938Live</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Cabbie Woes: More Cabbies Attacked</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Cabbies may say assaults against them are rare, but they are
              on the rise, according to the largest taxi operator here.</p>
              <p>ComfortDelGro — which has 15,000 of the 24,000 taxis on the roads
              here — told Today that assaults against the company’s drivers have more
              than doubled from a year ago.</p>
              <p>In the first seven months of the
              year, ComfortDelGro has seen 17 attacks against drivers, more than
              double the number for the whole of last year.</p>
              <p>Could last
              December’s fare hikes have played a part in some of these passengers
              seeing red and venting their spleen against cabbies?</p>
              <p>Most of the
              15 cabbies Today spoke to did not think so, saying that most attacks
              could happen after fare disputes, when passengers try to cheat their
              way out of paying and when dealing with drunken passengers — a
              perennial headache cabbies face.</p>
              <p>While passengers might grumble
              about high fares, cabbies said most would get agitated if they got
              caught in a traffic jam, or felt that the cabbie was out to cheat them
              by taking a longer route.</p>
              <p>The authorities have taken a tougher stance to deter crimes against cabbies.</p>
              <p>Two
              weeks ago, the High Court sent out a stern message to attackers of
              public transport workers when a judge dismissed an attacker’s appeal
              and instead tripled his jail sentence from one month to three months.
              Under the law, the maximum punishment for common assault is two years’
              jail and a $5,000 fine.</p>
              <p>Fare cheats cases, too, are on the rise
              for some operators — in the case of ComfortDelGro, a monthly average of
              134 cases this year, up from a monthly mean of 85 cases last year, said
              spokeswoman Tammy Tan.</p>
              <p>Cabbie Ong Eng Seng was the victim of a
              violent passenger, who not only refused to pay a $16.60 fare but also
              punched him in the eye before fleeing.</p>
              <p>The attack on Feb 7 left the 69—year—old driver with a swollen eye and blurred vision. He was unable to work for a week.</p>
              <p>“If
              he didn’t have the money to pay, we could have negotiated. He didn’t
              have to resort to violence,” the CityCab driver told Today, recalling
              his shock at being attacked for the first time in his 21 years as a
              cabbie.</p>
              <p>First—time offenders can be fined up to $1,000 while repeat offenders can be fined $2,000 and jailed six months for cheating.</p>
              <p>Unlike
              other countries, attacks against taxi drivers are just a blip on the
              crime radar here, but an alarming one nonetheless. For example, the
              number of reported taxi robberies has risen from 24 to 49 between 2006
              and last year, according to the police.</p>
              <p>Cabbies say a large
              proportion of crimes, including assaults, go unreported. Mr Ong called
              the police after the attack, butdecided not to pursue the matter. “It
              was too troublesome. Just my luck to have picked the wrong passenger,”
              he told Today.</p>
              <p>CityCab driver Robert Leong believes in reasoning
              things out with passengers. “If the passenger insists that I have taken
              a longer route, I offer him a discount. Why argue? I would rather just
              move on and pick other passengers,” he said.</p>
              <p>Cabbies in other
              countries, however, have opted not to face the wrath of unruly
              passengers on their own — relying on taxi drivers’ associations
              lobbying and working with the authorities to make their work safer.</p>
              <p>In
              Australia, for example, two state governments have adopted a tougher
              stance on assaults on public transport workers. In February, the
              Northern Territory Government raised the maximum penalty for common
              assault on a bus or taxi driver from one to five years.</p>
              <p>In the
              state of Victoria, a A$2.5—million ($3.2—million) safety strategy was
              launched last August, following the murder of a taxi driver. Trials of
              protective and dismountable screens to shield the driver from rear—seat
              passengers, and improved cameras inside the vehicles, are scheduled to
              start next year.</p>
              <p>Here, taxi operators have dismissed the idea of installing such cameras, citing passengers’ privacy and costs.</p>
              <p>What about protective screens — used in London cabs since the 1970s?</p>
              <p>Smart
              Taxis’ general manager Niki Ong felt such screens may be aesthetically
              ugly. “We want our drivers to be approachable, interactive and provide
              a service to the passengers,” he added.</p>
              <p>Companies here employ a
              distress alarm that uses the Global Positioning System technology to
              track the location of their taxis. The technology also allows the
              police to be notified.</p>
              <p>Would a public education campaign help? An SBS Transit campaign has helped reduce assaults against its bus captains.</p>
              <p>Today understands that ComfortDelGro is looking at a similar public education campaign to deter assaults against cabbies.</p>
              <p>Some
              cabbies are already taking their own deterrent — if unauthorised —
              measures, including keeping packets of chilli powder with them and not
              wearing seat belts for a quick getaway when trouble strikes.</p>
              <p>Cabbies say they take the first step to defusing any potential unhappiness by asking the passenger his or her choice of route.</p>
              <p>Most
              cabbies opt to stay cool despite being harangued. “No choice,” Mr
              Anthony Tan, a cabby for 20 years, said. “Your livelihood could be
              affected should the passenger complain against you.” — TODAY/sh</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Police have arrested a 34—year—old man who is believed to
              have robbed three taxi drivers at knife—point over the weekend.</p>
              <p>On Sunday at about 1:45pm, a female taxi driver told police she was
              robbed at Raeburn Park by an attacker who fled in a blue taxi. She
              managed to provide the police with the taxi’s registration number.</p>
              <p>The
              police relayed this information to Comfort Taxi, which tracked the taxi
              using GPS and alerted its drivers to be on the lookout.</p>
              <p>After 20 minutes of a joint search, police officers intercepted the taxi at the junction of Outram Road and Eu Tong Sen Street.</p>
              <p>One
              officer fired his Taser — akin to a stun gun — at the suspect after he
              approached the officers in a threatening manner, ignoring instructions
              to stop.</p>
              <p>The suspect is believed to have robbed two other taxi
              drivers at knife—point on Saturday. Both cases occurred within 20
              minutes of each other.</p>
              <p>The suspect will be charged in court on
              Tuesday with armed robbery. If convicted, he can be jailed between two
              and 10 years, and given at least 12 strokes of the cane. — CNA/so</p>
