              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;"><strong>This article is contributed by the STOMP Team</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">A bystander confronted this man dressed in a black tank-top who had allegedly tried to flee from a petrol kiosk in Yishun on Saturday morning (Oct 5) without paying for his cab fare.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">According to a description accompanying the video on facebook, the man attempted to use aggression to scare off the cabby and was claimed to be on the verge of beating him up until the bystander came into the fray and stopped him.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">In the video, the man can be seen explaining that he had lost everything on him, and that he just wanted to go home and get money to pay the cabby but was told by the bystander there's 'no need to talk' and to 'just wait for the police' to arrive.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">The bystander, who was the one who posted up the video, wrote in replies to comments left on the video that he felt he had to step in because he could not stand to see the cabby getting such treatment.</p>

              <p>Things may not be what they appear.  Here's a reply at stomp by a supposedly friend of the guy in black:</p>
              <div class="field-item even"><br></div>
              <div class="field-item even">
              <p class="submitted" style="margin-top: 15px;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Editrixxx on Mon, 10/07/2013 - 18:32</span></p>
              <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I know this "burly man" personally. This is not what happened AT ALL. There was a misunderstanding. The Malay "hero" got the wrong idea and behaved aggressively. There was no violence against the cabbie, nor any aggression on the part of the Indian guy. The Indian guy's parents have filed a police report and both they and soon the courts will have the full CC-TV video. The "man" is a student and was coming home from his own birthday party (in case you were wondering what was in his hands, they are suspenders as he was wearing a full suit at the beginning of the night) and it was 5.30 am in morning. The cab did not have NETs so he requested the taxi driver to stop at the ATM at the SPC in front of his house to draw money. Once there only, he realised he forgot his wallet as well as everything else in his friend's house. He then told the taxi driver to drive him home so he could go up and get the money. The taxi driver refused and started yelling at him because he has been cheated many times in the past. People around him got the wrong idea and this where the whole commotion started. The Indian guy was trying to defuse the situation whereas your Malay "hero" was behaving aggressively. When the police came, they escorted the Indian guy home and just passed the money to the driver. The police were very understanding, no arrests were made, they did not even take down his details as they did not even consider this an incident. The taxi driver also made no issue about it. All of you who are so quick to form an opinion and condemn that Indian guy, my friend, now have the full facts. His parents have been trying to contact STOMP since the moment they found out. They even emailed STOMP the police report, yet STOMP is yet to get back to them and have yet to print a retraction. As a fellow editor, I must say PISS-POOR reporting on STOMP's part. I used to be an avid STOMP reader till a few years ago. Now I know I should read its articles with an entire bowl full of salt. STOMP you should be ashamed of yourselves. This boy's parents have read each and every comment and are extremely distressed and you have your shoddy reporting to thank for that.</span></div>

              <p>in the 1st place, just paid up straight on the spot, else. the very least, inform the TD before the journey starts, tell him / her nicely that you do not have cash with him/her side but will pay upon reaching destination. Of course the pax must at least call home. This one dont need to teach right? This actually very subjective to indivdual TD. Some TD will not be happy, some understanding...blah blah blah..etc.</p>
              <p>Of course, TD on the other hand will have the tendency of losing his earned income when pax fail to pay up and TD will definitely not be in the winning situation. Unless the pax is resorting to violence, make police report...still lose-lose situation still applies to TD. ( Loss of income ) That's one of the main reason why TD are picky in pax when sweeping.... but ultimate is heng or sway nia.</p>

              <p>You see, my brothers, what conditioned things to go into such situation? the pax himself, he himself did not discipline himself, he himself did not express himself well, and he himself mess up himself with his belongings, all these are conditioning to get a negative impact on him, blame who?</p>
              <p>He himself lah, and still the parents can come and talk about his innocent, if I am his father, give him 2 tight slaps, one for his birthday and the other for causes others so much problem beside Police.</p>

              <p>There is no reason for someone taking a cab with no cards or cash in hand, this is irresponsible and looking like fishy stuff.</p>
              <p>There are many high ego youngsters,  even the rich kids like to play with Taxi uncles for the thrill of it, and when they are successful, they get the thrill of it, then can go tell their friends how they play with taxis uncle and managed to evade fares.</p>
              <p>The authority must step in to stop all these nonsense, and for this case posted here, many roads lead me not to believe in this guy who is the pax.</p>
              <p>Anybody can also act as parent to counteract a post in stomp or anywhere, if could be he himself</p>
