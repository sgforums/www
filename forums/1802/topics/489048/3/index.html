              <p>But new drivers who were not recommended in also cannot get i40. </p>
              <p>Don't know why they are doing this because they already approached potential taxi drivers when they are taking the Singapore Taxi Academy course at Citicab building before they got their license.  They also waive them from having to pay $1000 deposit if they are able to get the taxi license.  </p>
              <p>No taxi license one you recommend in also no use and would be rejected.</p>
              <p>Those taking courses at Woodlands would be approached by SMRT.  Those at Sin Ming would be approached by Comfort.  Maybe Comfort does not send recruitment team to approach those receiving lessons at Kim Yan Road.</p>
              <p>If the new hirer is your relief, you also don not want him or her to leave you and therefore would not recommend him or her in.  Also if he or she wants to become a hirer, he or she would just go directly to 383 to switch his/her status.  With this $1000  recommendation fee, it become strike a deal with old hirer to each get $500 but he/she recommends you in.   It applies to taxi drivers wanting to switch from Transcab, Prime, Premier and SMRT too; earn $500 for leaving the other taxi companies.</p>

              <p>I never recommended anyone.....but Singaporeans who lost their jobs would really consider this option.</p>
              <p>The white collars sure first think of property agent job as it is also white collar, then many would find out also tough industry with more agents than needed (last year 4000 out of 10,000 left the industry).  They may also think of Financial Advisor job but would most likely also leave.  Some would think of joining renovation industry as sales coordinators but most would also leave. Others would become commission-based sales people but most would leave too.  </p>
              <p>Finally they would all come to driving taxi like Stanford PhD and other PMETs (some used to earn more than $15k per month).  They would have to pass security, pass medical, take course (and pass 3 practical tests), pass 4-module exam to get license and attend few more short courses before can drive.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">Then many would find driving hours too long or don't earn enough as they started off as OMO thinking they are experienced enough after driving in Singapore for more than 10 years.  So some would quit and others would come in.</span></p>
              <p>You cannot stop them from joining as this seems to be the only job reserved for Singaporeans.  There is also a round of security clearance by LTA since taxis also need to enter Jurong Island which we all dont want terrorists to attack.</p>
              <p>Talking about security, on some days they are very strict.  Took thumbprints and photos already last month still must take again when visiting on top of detaining NRIC and requiring all passengers  to take thumbprint+show ID.</p>

              Lj lah, our type call fillet bo fish lah...knn if sell like this in America, sure to go bankrupt one, their are bigger, more fillings and tastier, even their meat are BBQed and juicer, and yet not that expensive, about $3.50 only.
              
              And in country like sweden and canada, bus is almost free, up to you to pay for the service render, no money, no need to pay one.
              
              Anyway, today Singapore is one of the most expensive city, I guess on the road, if you pick tourists, they will tell you Singapore is expensive, and our dollars are getting stronger, that makes it worst.
              
              Macdonald and many retail employed cheap pinoys staff, so how can locals ask for higher pay, that is why I said, our pay is depressed by cheap labour

              <p>The $2 (US$1.50) fillet and McChicken quite nice lah.  Americans cannot deliver at this price because their labour cost higher. Big-Mac there also more expensive but probably slightly large.  Bus service cannot be free one lah....who is going to pay for them then?</p>
              <p>I had Caucasion taxi customers who said Singapore taxi very cheap and good but they also said beer very expensive.</p>
              <p>McDonald's staff pay low because their locations all very good so rental cost very high.  But they have a lot of customers when compared to other resturants and food stores.</p>
              <p>Singapore is expensive for people that need to drive car and need to buy private housings ( not for locals that buy BTO HDBs ).  The ranking that Singapore most expensive city in the world not accurate because they use private housing as benchmark.  Even local poorest group can afford public housings (2-rm BTO flat only cost $13000 after subsidies).</p>
              <p>Countries like USA if they pay public bus drivers $5500 per month, their bus fare sure very expensive one.</p>
              <p>But I agree local pay depressed by cheaper foreign labour.  Yet I am not in favour or raising minimum wage for cleaners more from $1000 to be llike other country's because our tax rate is lower and lower income people qualify for low-rental housings.  If less-skilled people not happy with the $1000, they can always find another better job (like security guard and sales jobs).  Many places also pay cleaners more than the minimum $1000. In Japan, some people live in tentages in the park ( see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVYvh8gzJL8 ) even though their wage level higher.  Here in Singapore it is 2-digit rental for whole month for low-income earners and sure can find job unless too old and weak for cleaners job.  Got such people (very old people), their job collect cupboards.  This is the only group that does not earn enough.  But all over Singapore, got Chinese temples offer free meals everyday.  So won't not die of hunger.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of better-paying jobs in Singapore than McDonalds but dont know why people still like to work at McDonalds.  This one maybe because they provide free meals, really very near their homes.or they are part-time students.  My cousin ever met an ex-McDonalds manager who willingly left his job to become a taxi-driver.  That fellow said he made more driving longer hours as taxi driver than at McDonalds as a manager.</p>
              <p>But I think tourists say Singapore is expensive because they only hang around in Orchard road area and not neighood areas.</p>

              <p>Got grave also only for 15 years.  Higher cost and must do two times (once for grave and once for urn).  Also cannot make Feng Shui better as all graves must face same direction unless the grave at the side (that case still can face side direction). </p>
              <p>Furthermore if got enemy (or conflict-of-interests people), pour shit on the grave, whole family unlucky (until Heaven produce heavy rain to wash away...but could be longer than that).  That is probably why MM LKY also cremated..... too many enemies.  <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> Even at CCK got ordinary people's grave got smashed; some a few times.</span></p>
              <p>Urn burial after cremation also got Feng Shui one.  Many people pay high prices to get better locations even before they die at Nirvana in CCK. Guang Ming San and other places.  But now the price for good locations very high at 5-digit.  </p>
