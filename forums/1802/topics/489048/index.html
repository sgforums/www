              your uncle Mr Yang or Mr Teo or Ms Tammy's husband?
              
              why do cdg needs to beg for hirer and relief, driving cdg today, like all other cabs, can also be an elite of grabtaxis. So now you got 2 calls, grab and cdg, nothing to lose but more to gain. Because no matter how you look at it, grab and cdg are one.

              <p>Comfort cannot handle the demand for taxis during peak hours as all their taxis are fully booked.  Grabtaxi is doing well in Singapore because it helps SMRT, Transcab, Prime and Primer taxis drivers as a unified big source of taxis (total 12000 taxis) for customers when Comfort taxis are fully booked during peak hours.  </p>
              <p>It is not that Comfort service or mobile application is not good (as written in articles on Yahoo, asiaone.com etc), it is just the other taxis company do not have a big enough fleet for customers to call as first choice.  With Grabtaxi, it is 12000 taxis vs 16000 taxis so customers would consider using Grabtaxi.</p>
              <p>Uber seems only used by Americans who had good experience using Uber in USA.  They have already been driven out of Japan, South Korea and other countries.  Many cabbies in other countries have striked against them.  Uber only offers services in citi area or closer to citi area.  They are offering huge incentives temporarilly to get drivers to switch to them.  I believe only people who are too young (under 30), people without taxi license or newbie OMO taxi drivers who cannot survive as cabbies would switch to them.  I calculated, it is better to get a class-4 license if one cannot survive as cabby and work as an employee for a company than to switch to Uber knowing the cash incentive could end anytime as they cannot go on running a loss.  They also have a bad reputation of ripping customers off when demand is high like what they did when MRT went down charging customers 3-digits for short trips.</p>

              <p>No worries. The original taxi business will survive. Why?
              Because is cheaper to ride taxi by original taxi business. :)</p>
              <p>Besides, not everyone has mobile Internet access. Furthermore,
              not everyone has smart phone. This is a limitation of all the new
              generation taxi services.</p>
              <p>Actually, if taxi fare is lower, maybe can attract more people
              to take taxi. For example, student fares for students. :)</p>

              <p>What if they make pirate taxi cheaper? I heard grabcar is already cheaper than taxi - no booking fee, no surchages.</p>
              <p>I dare say more than 90% of our population have mobile phone and internet access. Even students also have it. Of course, they will be some very small % that still does not have a smart phone but sooner or later, they will be suck in to.</p>
              <p>The threat from uber and now grabcar is real, don't be complacent. Taxi biz can still survive because only taxis can take street hails but it will get tougher and tougher as more and more pax switch over to pirare taxis.</p>
              <p>I myself will be booking grabcar to the airport when I go for holiday in Sep. It is convenient and cheaper, why not?</p>

              <p>hmm....no booking fees and surcharges....then they depend on what for survival?  Or is it aggressive strategy taking initial losses by the cash rich company with strong support from very rich foreign companies, then when Comfort loses its customers, then start charging booking fees.  I saw from the internet that even Japanese software giant Softbank is staking them (US$250 million).  </p>
              <p>As what I had guessed, the Grabtaxi R&amp;D unit would not be able to improve much sales as Comfort's integrated MDT system and softwares are already at the adequate level.  So they are using "no-charge" to capture the call-booking market.</p>
