              <p>50,000 Singaporeans job is more than the number of regulars employed by SAF.  It is 50 1000 Singaporeans factory workers factories or 500 9:1 foreigners:Singaporeans ratio factory workers (current mom allowed foreigner-to-Singaporeans ratio).factories.</p>

              <p>All taxis are already being monitored because of GPS.  LTA already developed an application of laymen Singaporeans to see locations of the taxis in the vicinity.  All people using smartphones are already being tracked by people with the money to pay third party companies for such services.  Only people not using smartphones are spared from these organizations.</p>

              Dun worry abt driveless taxi lah, Knn MRT keep breakdown and still cannot find the fault, you all talk abt driveless cab for fark?
              
              Driveless car is not new, in the 80s, scientists already tried, and today, with GPS, many of these so called Pro fat sir wanted to make a name for themselves, so create this and that again.
              
              I can only said, driveless is something that may happen in future whereby roads and all signal might hv to change, even buying cars, COE  and all other regulations like traffic rules and policies also need to change. So it is not so simple.

              <p>Driverless taxi or car will not happen lah.  It is not a question of technology, but liability. Until they can resolve the legal issue of insurance and accident liability, it will not happen. The law needs to catch up with technology as always.</p>

              It will happen lah, maybe another 100 years times,
              
              Like in the 1800, people said bull cart cannot be driven without the bull or horse, then in the turn of the century, the ford brothers prove them wrong, and at that time, people still dun think it will work as there is no proper road and regulations, but look at it now.

              <p>Don't under estimate driverless taxis as Singapore still controlled by academic elites from reputable universities.  They want the system that way until a got-serve-national-service WP candidate with PhD who has better academic credentials won a district.  What if they rub sholders (their foreign classmates and them) with each others and say robots cheaper then we all lose jobs.  The fact that they are collaborating with MIT people indicates that they intend to implement it. MIT people also not so stupid joint effort with us for nothing when they could implement it totally by themselves; they want to penetrate our market.  Some policy makers on top sure eventually give in to their demands for whatever reasons then give a lame excuse and there goes our jobs.</p>
              <p>Like they say foreigners cheaper (and easier to control) and even set the Service Sector ratio to 89 foreigners for every 100 total local+foreign workers ( http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/foreign-worker-levy/calculate-foreign-worker-quota ) .  With this new Service Sector ratio, companies would make excuses to eliminate Singaporeans to hire foreigners or replace Singaporeans with foreigners once a Singaporean leaves his/her job.</p>

              <p>I dont think it will happen at all, even if driverless technology is goot to go now.</p>
              <p>Reason 1 - CDG as a government entity is all about controlling the citizens, knowing their movements, providing undercover for CID, CNB officers, stealth raiding of premises require non-police vehicles - plainsclothes police officers use cabs to reach their destination so the tua pek kong cannot detect. All these activities need a real human on board. If all taxis become driverless, then the retrenched PMETs eat grass? For passengers who like to stop anywhere - it means they cannot disembark anywhere. People will complain that they got locked in the cab.</p>
              <p>Reason 2 - with a cabby, when an accident happens, CDG can pin the blame on the cabby. Makan his deposit and so on. If change to driverless auto taxi - CDG eat themself? Driverless taxi late for booking, and CDG kenna all the blame?</p>
              <p>Reason 3 - when normal taxi breakdown, cabby use his phone to call for help or inform CDG at his own cost. If driverless taxi complete breakdown, battery dead, no power and cannot msg control centre - then the vehicle will be stranded wherever and someone got to go retrieve it. CDG kenna fark again. Out of CDG 17,000 normal taxis - how many breakdown every day now? CDG got so many manpower to rescue the malfunctioned driverless cabs or not?</p>
              <p>Reason 4 - normal taxi already kenna fare cheat. Driverless cab - knn wait the whole taxi disappeared after a ride by a mechanic who ask the driverless cab to stop inside a workshop in Admiralty Road East. How ah?</p>
              <p>So dont worry lah. Driverless cab will not happen. Bu Ke Nen. CDG will have many many problems. When you run a big business or a country, you must standby some scrap goats. Robots can never perform this function. They cannot be tried in a court. Laws are applicable to human beings only. Dogs, spiders, robots are not answerable to anyone.</p>

              <p>Dont worry too much about the innovations in NTU or NUS. They got research projects and the professors need to come up with cool stories to secure next year's research funding. Nothing will happen one lah. I have been reading all these CSB (cool stories bro) for the past 20 years. None of our local professors, who cares they got Harvard, MIT or Yale education - started a billion dollar company such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Apple, Google. These kind of things will never happen in Singapore. When I was a kid, I dreamt Singapore will one day produce such people. As the years went by, I realised it was only a mirage. Decided to stop day-dreaming. Our professors here will never get rich. Their pay is quite pathetic if you ask me.</p>
              <p>Your job as a cabby is very secure. Relax and carry on driving for as long as you can.</p>
              <p>I hate to say this but our success in life is measured by our bank balance and having an intact family - no divorces, having children who are healthy, not disabled and who grow up into responsible adults.</p>
              <p>Old, poor and no descendants - habis liao. Might as well kill yourself now.</p>
              <p>Poor but got intact family - not bad</p>
              <p>Rich but got divorce - not a big problem</p>
              <p>Rich with a happy family - you are in heaven already.</p>

              <p>Just let the other cabbies know that there is such a project being sponsored using tax payers money (which means they are also sponsoring it too as they pay income tax, GST, ERP, help taxi companies generate corporate tax for government, and COE/road tax from taxis rentals) and it is targetted at eliminating cabbies.</p>

              <p>Won't happen in our lifetime as TD for sure. If it happens at all, most probably for short shuttle service, within say a place like One-North as they are planning right now. Trunk services very hard lah.</p>
              <p>So many issues. Even Google car is having problems now.</p>
              <p>What is more troubling is UberX &amp; Grabcar and who knows who else coming in. This service will eat into TDs earning slowly but surely.....especially if they can make it cheaper and better than regular taxis. And of course, economic slowdown lah and jobs loss.</p>
              <p>Economy slows =&gt; jobs loss =&gt; lower income =&gt;</p>
              <p>Demand for taxis down....</p>
              <p>=&gt; less money for taxi rides</p>
              <p>Supply of taxis up...</p>
              <p>=&gt; more PMETs and others become TDs</p>
              <p>=&gt; more salesmen and others do uberx to supplement income</p>
              <p>That squeeze will come sooner or later. Now already feeling it a bit.</p>
