              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Taxi booking apps have helped passengers find taxis, complementing the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) push for more taxis to be on the roads, which it has done with the introduction of availability standards.</p>
              <p>The standards are set to be reviewed next year, and the National Taxi Association has urged the LTA not to raise them or even consider lowering them.</p>
              <p>The LTA told Channel NewsAsia that even though taxi apps are one way to match supply and demand for taxis, it is still dependent on the taxis being on the roads to accept such bookings. Hence taxi availability standards are still important. The LTA said it is reviewing the impact of third-party apps on the taxi industry and how it may benefit taxi drivers and commuters.</p>
              <p>Taxi availability standards were introduced last year. During peak periods, taxi operators need to have at least 80 per cent of their fleet on the roads.</p>
              <p>Since the implementation of the standards, the percentage of taxis on the roads during peak periods has increased - from 82 per cent in 2012 to 87 per cent in the first five months of this year.</p>
              <p>More taxis are also being utilised - from 65 per cent to 68 per cent over the same period. This means more taxis are plying the roads, and more commuters are using them. The National Taxi Association attributed this to the growth in the use of third-party taxi apps on smartphones.</p>
              <p>National Taxi Association executive adviser Ang Hin Kee said: "Have more commuters been able to get a cab during peak hours? Are more taxis plying the roads during peak hours? If, already we are achieving that, then I think the (taxi availability) indicators can stay as they are or be adjusted downwards."</p>
              <p>"You cannot ignore the fact that the apps have been a very effective way of matching demand and supply. We should welcome the fact that there are such tools, and therefore you don't have to use a very crude measure of availability indicators as it is today. We should welcome and be happy with the apps that are helping us meet the requirements," added Mr Ang.</p>
              <p>The Association has been matching hirers and relief drivers to help cabbies meet the taxi availability standards. Under existing standards, taxi operators have to ensure 80 per cent of drivers clock at least 250 kilometres every day. Some drivers still have difficulties meeting the standards.</p>
              <p>Premier taxi driver Foo Chi Yong said: "In the city, sometimes when you go for call bookings, you hardly travel any distance, and some of the drivers really can't make the 250km. So, it becomes a pressure for us and it will affect our livelihood and, of course, our driving."<br><br>Third-party taxi apps like GrabTaxi have helped cabbies get more passengers and helped passengers get a taxi quickly. "It's really useful, it takes no time to get a taxi anywhere, and anytime. I do use it a lot," said commuter Tan Thai Meng.</p>
              <p>GrabTaxi said call booking numbers have been increasing twofold every month since it launched the app last October. GrabTaxi's general manager Lim Kell Jay said: "Looking at the trend of technology, the proliferation of smartphones, more and more people are going to do stuff on their phones."</p>
              <p>"Our goal is to one day make it so easy and so seamless for passengers to book a taxi through their phones - in the comfort of the homes, their workplace, in the restaurant - that there is really no need for them to be on the streets and hail a taxi anymore, or even call the call centre," added Mr Lim.</p>

              The key now is to address and educate the pax, no doubt apps had help the matching, but pax should not abuse it by using all apps at one go and end up 3 cabs but only take 1, that is very bad for TD as time is money for taxi and in fact, all kind of business.
              
              Sad part is also when for some older generation pax who are poorer and maybe unable to use apps or even calls, these might be left out if the situation end up all taxis waiting for calls and no one sweeping the road except me and my bro CT

              Why? 
              
              Let be frank
              LTA are pro paxs
              NTA are pro Taxi companies
              
              Who care if you can find pax or not? 
              
              If LTA is able to satisfy pax (aka the public) with lesser complain of no taxis, you think they care about you got pax or not?
              
              If NTA is able to satisfy Taxis companies (aka Hirer's Bosses) so as to get higher sponsorship from them, you think NTA care about your got pax or not?

              He was alone inside a taxi travelling from TOA Payoh to City Hall.

              <p><br>statistic is not a true reflection of supply and demand.</p>
              <p>supply and demand mis-match happen at some specific locations and specifc period. There are factors/reasons why it happen but is not reflected in the statistic.</p>
              <p>TD and his/her family/friend are also public They can also engage taxi service. It is not wrong that cabllies use a cab for their own purpose cause they can engage a taxi service. However, the taxi needs to be in HIRED status during the period to indicate that it is utilize.</p>
              <p>aging population means more supply of ppl become TD which has no career path.</p>
              <p>as TD income is still better than many other jobs, we are seeing a trend younger driver become TD.</p>
              <p>New citizen which suppose to be foreign talent also become TD.</p>
              <p>Therefore, there already more than sufficent supply of talented ppl for TD. </p>

              <p>Where is the justification to include PR in taxi trade? </p>

              Huh, smlj statistic not true? then how the framework works with real figures, you mean agar agar can said, peak hr no taxis??
              
              These aircon warming executives at LTA, NTA and TAxi companies use statistic to set rules and regulations for TD, which are practising it now...
              
              ...they set rules base on feedback and statistic, you ask them to drive taxis and see..they tell you go fly kite. 
              
              ...So they are the regulators, we must oblige to their creation of rules and regulation be it stupid or crazy. And when they start to set surcharges, they created a division of time to match nos of paxs and at the same time lure TD in with surcharges to meet the demand.
              
              Now, when paxs said no taxis...who to blame??? TD?....no ..no...the blame should be the one setting the rules, and if the farking rules do not work out, you need to recalibre it, not put the blame on TD, we are like all human, wherever got nicer food, we will be there. 
              
              Let take a look at weekend ap surcharges starting at 5pm..abt 4pm, lots of paxs, less TD, after 5pm, lots of taxis, but lesser pax till maybe after 8pm. Tell me, where is the mismatch?? Paxs may want to evade higher surcharge, pack up the Q line, TD waiting for surcharge hr to start, take their dinner or rest instead.
              
              The solution...put whole weekends on $5 AP surcharge lah, regardless of smlj timming.
              
              Restuarants, and many others charges more on weekends, even people working on weekends get higher OT pay...knnccb...taxi driver drive on weekend...worst than in weekday...why?? TD not human ar??
