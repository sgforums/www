              <p>Yesterday evening, i was driving along Commonwealth Ave West, approaching the junction turning left to Clementi Ave 4, I saw a blue cab filtered to left abit earlier because of the jam at the traffic. While doing so, he saw an LTA officer with a camera after the bus stop, with response to that the TD immediately  turn back to his lane. An oncoming old lorry jammed the blake, luckily its was only a mild "kissing" which no damage is done to both parties.The poor TD might get into serious trouble if the lorry failed to blake ontime.</p>
              <p>Who to blame here? LTA or the TD??</p>
              <p>LTA officer always positioned at the end of yellow lane, those geninue drivers turning to the left always become the victims whereby I see they have no intention to violate the buslane.One of my friends said "It is so ambiguous to stationed after the bus stop. U expect every (filter left)driver to do the turn within 20 meters in a massive jam traffic. Are they hungry for money ? Do they have the quota to fulfil ?</p>
              <p>What happened to Singapore today ? Why LTA always hide here hide that , on top of the bridge lar, at the end of yellow lane lar.</p>
              <p>Please be a man , do it open !</p>

              <p>The stretch along commonwealth into Dover junction also becareful, seen many time a TP with camera there.</p>
              <p>When you fliter into bus lane on a bus lane period, dun panic, the best is on your right or left signal to indicate you are moving out, most lan jiao private cars will not give way, typical one lah, so you moving along the pheriphery of that yellow line with signal on intention to move out. For this, TP will not take you, but if you zoom down like your grandfather road on a operating bus lane, then, nothing much to say liao.</p>
              <p>For this case, it is lucky he can still see the LTA or TP in operation, some ninjas never let you see one. You kenna until you also dunno.</p>

              <p>Normally if you 'accidentally' filter into an active bus lane for a short distance, they will let you off. But the troublesome thing is some enforcement will still summon you and you have to appeal before it's waived.</p>
              <p>What Bowah suggested above is correct and you should follow it. Guess bogay man sometimes can be useful too <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/greggman.com/vampire.png" alt="vampire.png"></p>

              <p>You must also understand human psychology, some of it, is by life experiences, even pychologist never learn, you see, when you met an authorised person with authority, dun ignore them, quickly show some respect, signal and give intention of signally out, but if you  remain like he or she is invisible, do you think he or she is going give you chance??</p>
              <p>Everyday, we TD on the road is sure to make certain offensive turns, cuts and stop, for this TP or LTA also know, but as long as your admit yr mistake and respect them, the chances of summon might reduce by 50%, like once I got a call, make an illegal U turn, TP on bike just infront saw it,</p>
              <p>I quickly wave my hand in an apological manner, he saw my action and my on call sign above, but he gives me a stern look and wave a index finger indicating no more such action, and then waved me to move on. I was not booked, but if get booked, also my fault, no one to blame.</p>
              <p>We must all know that every traffic sign on the road is put up with a purpose, the purpose can be because of danger, or because of wanting a smoother traffic, TP or LTA dun just put a no parking there for fun. And if we are going to flaunt it, we need to be wary and respect our bad.</p>
              <p>Apologising is not about who is right or wrong, it is about keeping an on going relationship, saying sorry, it my fault, can be every hard for some, especially those with high egos, but when spoken out, it open a big wide road for you. And between peoples, it is about letting off the ego and built a stronger relationship.</p>

              <p>if you are the one taking buses daily, you will appreciate the bus lanes.. now the focus is on bus liao (or else, why Gov spend so much money to buy buses), so there will be more bus lanes... if you are driving, definitely u will be against any bus lanes...</p>

              <p>Is like this one lah, those taking bus, will protect their interest, those driving pte cars will also protect their interest, and that include all user from pedestrians to cement truck driver to container driver.</p>
              <p>As for TD, of course we must talk in our interest, otherwise how can hv unity, but LTA and govt look at it differently, a Bus takes 60 paxs or more, a taxi takes only 1 to most 4 paxs, the rest u go figure it out.</p>
