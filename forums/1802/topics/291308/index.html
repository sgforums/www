Offenders will also pick up at least twice the number of demerit points.<br><br>If a cabby is caught overcharging by less than $20 twice within two years, his licence will be revoked; if he overcharges by $20 or more, he will lose it on the spot.<br><br>Fines for all these offences will also be more than doubled - except for overcharging by $20 or more, where the penalty stays at $500.<br><br>Commuters like Dutchman Freek Van Velsen, 40, who works in a bank at One Raffles Quay and is constantly approached by taxi touts, cheered the new measures.<br><br>He said: 'I think, with such large fines, even if they get caught once, it will hurt. In the past, they might have taken the risk because the fines were not that high.'<br><br>LTA's spokesman said licence suspensions are good wake-up calls for first-time offenders, who would then know their rice bowls are on the line if they repeat the offence within 24 months.<br><br>The new penalties 'strike a good balance between deterrence and providing opportunities for a contrite taxi driver to mend his ways', added the spokesman.<br><br>The Taxi Operators' Associations, which represents six associations, said it welcomed the new penalties, but hoped the authorities would be flexible in meting out the punishments and would conduct thorough probes.<br><br>Premier Taxi Operators' Association president Foo Chi Yong, 47, who spoke on behalf of the other operators, said accused cabbies should have channels for appeal so that the genuinely repentant will get a second chance.<br><br>About 23,000 cabbies from five taxi operators ply the roads and log 600,000 commuter trips daily.<br><br>Cabbies who spoke to The Straits Times said they were glad measures were being introduced to weed out the bad hats as the majority were making an honest living, although rising rentals and fuel costs have eaten into their earnings lately.<br><br>The LTA looked into 471 cases of soliciting, overcharging and refusal to pick up passengers between January and last month.<br><br>It stepped up enforcement last month, with almost daily operations at touting hot spots such as Clarke Quay, Sentosa and Orchard Towers - the same month The Sunday Times reported that touting and overcharging were rampant there. A barrage of e-mail and letters from the public confirming this followed.<br><br>The LTA said these checks will be kept up.<br><br>It also announced yesterday that 15 more taxi stands will be built in the Central Business District (CBD) by year end - adding to the existing 80 - so that commuters will find one within a five-minute walk.<br><br>And from March 1, hailing a cab on roads in the CBD will be prohibited for safety reasons. Taxis will be allowed to pick up or drop passengers only at taxi stands and along private driveways.<br><br>From next month, signs will go up at taxi stands and, perhaps, even in taxis to make it clear touting is an offence.<br><br>These signs will also advertise LTA's hotline (1800-<br><br>CALL-LTA or 1800-2255582) to make it easy for passengers to give feedback or report drivers.<br><br><a href="mailto:marcelp@sph.com.sg" rel="nofollow">marcelp@sph.com.sg</a><br><br>ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY JESSICA LIM<br><br><strong>NEED A CAB IN CBD?

Get to a taxi stand</span><br>LTA to enforce new rule for safety reasons from March; 15 more taxi stands to be built</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Straits Times, The (Singapore)<br>Home H1<br>November 13, 2007<br>Author: Maria Almenoar &amp; Jessica Lim</span><br><br><img src="http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/6607/stimagesmacbdreitb1.jpg"><br><br>FROM March next year, commuters will need to find a taxi stand if they want a cab in the Central Business District.<br><br>This includes areas like Orchard Road, Shenton Way, Raffles Place and Suntec City.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) yesterday announced the new rule, alongside stiffer new penalties for taxi drivers who do not stop for passengers, who tout or who overcharge. Misbehaving cabbies can lose their licence immediately in serious cases.<br><br>The ruling about taxi stands is meant to improve road safety, said the LTA.<br><br>With the introduction of more bus lanes within the city, it said, taxis are finding it harder to pick up passengers hailing them from the roadside. Plus, those who do stop in time for passengers may swerve in indiscriminately or suddenly, making it dangerous and disruptive to traffic flow.<br><br>So, instead of sticking their arms out and flagging a taxi from the kerbside, commuters will have to get one from a taxi stand - and even if you book one, it must pick you up at a stand.<br><br>The only exception is if residents within the city get taxis to pick them up within their private driveways.<br><br>The LTA will build 15 more taxi stands by the end of next month, bringing the total number to 95 in the city area.<br><br>Taxi stands will always be within a five-minute walk of any building in the CBD, LTA assured commuters yesterday.<br><br>Both taxi drivers and commuters seemed to welcome the new rule yesterday: Mr Adi Negara, 48, a taxi driver for the past 11 years, explained how stopping in the CBD can be a dangerous game.<br><br>'There are many bus lanes and it is difficult to stop, and if we do, we have to swerve through lanes.<br><br>'The taxi stands will help because commuters will know where to wait and we will know where to go.'<br><br>While commuters The Straits Times spoke to yesterday generally agreed that it would be safer, a bigger worry was if the taxis would come at all - whether at a stand or otherwise.<br><br>Mr Jeffrey Chan, 31, a wealth-management consultant who works in a building on Cecil Street, said that, already, most of his time at the taxi stand is spent watching the cabbies - with their 'On call' signs lit up - zip by.<br><br>He reckons seven out of 10 won't stop. Which already equates to 30-minute waits every night for his taxi home.<br><br>His sentiment was echoed by people polled last night.<br><br>It is more about increasing the supply of cabs during the rush hour to meet demand, say commuters.<br><br>Or upping the flag-down rate for cabs so more taxi drivers will want to stop at the stands, say drivers.<br><br>'If you charge passengers a one-time surcharge to take a taxi from the city, more cabs - after dropping passengers off in the suburbs - will be more willing to go back to the city,' said cabby Dicky Ong, 53.<br><br>mariaa@sph.com.sg<br><br>limjess@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">What cabbies say about the new penalties</span></strong><br><br><strong>WHAT GOES AROUND...</strong><br><br>'We can drive non-stop but if traffic is bad, rental is high, oil prices go up, we make less. But we don't do dishonest things because what goes around comes around.'<br>- MR DICKY ONG, 40, who has been driving a taxi for 18 years<br><br><strong>ENFORCE IT</strong><br><br>'Some drivers just want to make fast money. These penalties are good only if the LTA enforces them; if not, drivers will not be scared.'<br>- MR MICHAEL LOO, 58, a cabby for three years<br><br><strong>IT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT</strong><br><br>'I think part of the problem is that there is demand for this type of 'service'. If people didn't accept such offers, these cabbies would just have to line up like the rest of us and pick up passengers.'<br>- MR THEN YUEN FAH, 40, who has driven a limousine cab for six months<br><br><strong>PICK-AND-GO MOTTO</strong><br><br>'The motto should be: Pick and go. I don't ask where passengers are going because it is not fair. They stood in line after all. It doesn't matter near or far.<br><br>I was a passenger before, too, and I understand the frustration. I waited at Woodlands Checkpoint to go to Marsiling and the driver refused to take me. I sat in the cab until he agreed.'<br>- MR ADI NEGARA, 48, a taxi driver for more than 11 years</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually one way is the best .....<br><br>No extra taxi stands .... No need toutings .... No need booking .....<br><br>That is to make the taxi fare like 5pm to 8pm .<br><br>I think i should write to them .<br><br>Before wasting money to erect more taxi stands , have a trial ... Have a trial of " Peak Hour " extension , as in .... currently peak hour 5pm to 8pm ... trial the extension from 5pm to 11.30pm .... see how the reaction , then decide whether or not that 15 extra taxi stand is necessary ?<br><br>Customers no need to call can get a cab , HAPPY !<br><br>Cabbies earn extra , HAPPY !<br><br>Singapore ..... aiyo , inside CBD area , hotels , within 3km outside CBD , evening time , after 8pm , stop wasting time to wait for cheap taxis .....<br><br>Want cheap taxis ? Monday to Friday ? Take before 8pm , pay $2 extra better , or else , pay $4 more after 8pm lor .<br><br>That's the scenario now .... it will remain unchange , if the current flag-down remains unchange.<br><br></div>

Jam waste time and $$$ . And this mention location , extremely low taxi demand after 5pm .<br><br>West Side ? If i take one customer go Jurong from town , my next target is Tuas industrial area !! And who knows , i can bring one to Tampines from Tuas , $30 trip !<br><br>As in ..... town to Jurong $14 , Tuas to Tampines $30 , one hour perhaps $44!<br><br>If i take one to yishun eg , one hour maybe maximum $20 .</div>
