            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I think although there are some bad taxi drivers out there, the commuters really need to learn to treat taxi drivers better. I am very fortunate to have my own transport but before that I do take taxis and I have 2 uncles who drive a taxi.<br><br>The next time you wanna make things difficult for a taxi driver, think:<br><br>1) The taxi driver is not a rich bugger....driving a taxi is not gonna make u a millionaire....he/she is just making a living...if u can tolerate, just let it be.<br><br>2) sitting inside a car for more than 8 hours a day is no joke. Most people will get irritable...so if a taxi driver can still smile at you and be courteous to you, be thankful...instead of just complaining....<br><br>I like what my fren says....Taxi drivers are poor people who make money from poor people. It is true, most of us who take taxis are by no means rich.... so why make things difficult for one another sometimes....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just give you 2 examples that happened to my frens while shopping overseas that totally showed that Singaporean consumers are a disgrace at times...<br><br>First Example:<br><br>6 of us went to Chiangmai. Chiangmai things are relatively cheaper than BKK. So when we go to the night market, 2 of our frens said, you must at least cut the prices by 75% or at least half.... the other 4 of us were not so hiong, we do bargain but normally just abit cos we find already cheap, dun bargain too much lah...give people a livelihood, its not as if these people are rich....<br><br>So, these 2 frens went to this stall selling pillow cases. Ask how much, the guy say 350 Baht for 3 cases. That is cheap lor...but as usual they asked 100 baht can or not. The guy of cos say cannot...then my frens employ the "walk away" tactic....the guy shouted....ok ok 200 baht! Still cannot...he shouted 150 baht...still cannot...suddenly he shouted 3 for 50 baht!!! wah my frens tot hit jackpot and walk back to the stall...when they about to take the cases, the guy shouted loudly, in exact words... you go away! You no good nature. I no sell you.<br><br>Hahaha so paiseh but i tell my 2 frens they deserve it.<br><br>Second Example:<br><br>Went to Venice with a few frens and took the gondola for 25 Euros.There was a couple who finished and wanted to take again, they wanted to take but being singaporeans, they asked, got discount or not.... the gondola boatman look at them and laff, pointed to his shoes and said "real leather, 300 euros, no discount, 25 euros you want discount?"<br><br>I think Singaporean Consumers have a long way to go before they deserve the respect they should get.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Poolman:</div><div class="quote_body">Customer asked last night ?<br><br>She added : " when i called , they only said $4.00 "<br><br>I replied : " Oh ! On-Call $4.00 , Peak hour  $1 , City Charge $1 "<br><br>She argued : " What City Charge ? "<br><br>I answered : " Oh , City Charge means CBD extra charge ! Apply from 5-8 pm on Mon - Friday , 5pm til 11.00pm on Fri &amp; Sat ! "<br><br>She lose patience , said : " Yesterday , i also called at Marriott Hotel at 7pm , why no extra City charge ? "<br><br>I buay lon liao , but still very paiently replied : " Marriott Hotel not under CBD ! "<br><br>Lastly , she said : " Give me a receipt ! "<br><br>When customer asked for a receipt , they usually want to get more answers from our company , go ahead ! </div></blockquote>Wah lao erh! Like that also want to complain and make noise...<br><br>Not sure then ask politely lah, must be so rude meh?<br><br>By the way, why no CBD charge the day before at Marriott Hotel at 7pm is because any taxi within CBD will not charge the commuter the CBD charge, only upon the trip into CBD will be chargeable...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>many singaporeans are really a disgrace.<br><br>i was in the lobby of a hotel in bangkok.  it was after midnight.  we were meeting to go to the night market.  then i heard a commotion.<br><br>a lady was shouting at the thais, "i am from singapore.....blah blah blah."  she shouted so loud i think the whole hotel knows a singaporean has just arrived!!<br><br>a lot of singaporeans have the misconception that we are the kings in this region just because we are richer.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always ask cabbies to keep the change if i see that they provide honest &amp; good service.<br>Some cabbies are quite schemming.(Not refering to u Poolman.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br>When u board a cab, let the cabby noe ur destination, some will ask: where do u wan me to go by ar? PIE or CTE?<br>Ah-Ha! Here's the trick.<br>Majority of them are asking becos they don't wan to get into trouble when the patrons accused them of cheating.<br>But some are jus plain schemming.<br>They'll purposely test ur knowledge of the road. If u say "anything" or "up to u" den good game.<br>However, there're many good cabbies aound too, rite Poolman?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
