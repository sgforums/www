              <p>Japanese are cultured to be polite, but does not mean no voilence, the way they sex is the most voilence..hehehe..</p>
              <p>Courtesy is a two way traffic lanes, it cannot work just having one side courteous and the other side is non courteous, and typically speaking, in singapore, even you want to be courteous as a TD, in a long run, you tends to give up, because peoples/paxs are mostly not so courteous, I also cannot blame them, all because of the high stress money society that do not know how to calm or cool down.</p>

              <h1 id="main_title" class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 24px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.25;">Yumi Kazama: 15 years in the Japanese adult video industry and still going strong</h1>
              <p id="article_credit" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; float: left; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">TOKYO â</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">As one of the worldâs most lucrative adult industries, thousands of women pick up the latex gauntlet every single year in Japan in the hope of finding a life of glamour and fame, only for most to vanish into obscurity within their first 12 months in the business or discover that life on the other side of the lens is not quite what it seemed. But with more than 15 years and 1,000 adult movies under her garter belt, Tokyo-born porn star Yumi Kazamaâs feisty antics are still somehow managing to set pulses racing across the country.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">In an interview with Nikkan Spa! in order to promote her saucy new photo collection, the 33-year-old actress discusses how she first made it into the industry, the type of work she does and how she unintentionally became one of Japanâs most loved mature hotties.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">Released at the end of January, Kazamaâs photo album âBittersweetâ features a host of erotic images the like which weâre sure many of us have seen before. The star, however, maintains that this is more than just a regular collection of cheeky (pun very much intended) photos and that she had a lot of input and control during its production.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">âFor the album, I picked out all of my own clothes â underwear included â and I even did my own makeup. I want to bring fans closer and allow them to see every side of me,â says Kazama explaining the release of the new photo book. Taking a quick look at some of the images released to the press, it soon becomes apparent that, while typically sexy, the album shuns brightly lit studios for simpler âat homeâ and outdoor shots.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">Asked about her early days in the industry and how she responds to the label of âjukujoâ (attractive mature lady) actress, Kazama states that it was an entirely natural process and not something that she originally aspired to.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">âItâs not that I started off thinking âI want to make it in the adult movie business!â Ha ha. When I was around 25 years old and working in the AV industry, the ânatureâ and âwivesâ genres were really taking off. While playing the roles of menâs wives in these movies, I just sort of naturally âripenedâ during that period in my life; the role is a part of who I am. I was never one of those highly strung young girls to begin with anyway.â</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;">On starting in the industry</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #303030; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; line-height: 20px;">âI first got into the porn industry a year after I graduated from high school when I was 18. I went to an all-girls school and was just a regular, sensible student; I didnât joke around much and my parents were on the strict side. After graduating, I started attending a technical college, and it was there that I met some really cool, fashionable girls - the kind of girls who are into things like DJ-ing at clubs. I soon started hanging out with them; it was probably in part to rebel against my parents. Anyway, I got hit on a lot during those days, which was totally new for me, and I found myself partying a lot. I guess I was just letting my hair down and a little curious. It was more about quantity over quality, though - I wasnât really interested in things like love and romance, I just wanted to try it with a lot of guys. So when I was spotted by a scout, I kind of entered the industry with that same curious, playful feeling. I donât think I ever felt reluctant about it all - I donât really remember! Ha ha!â</p>

When quizzed by Spa! however, the actress maintains that she is essentially just a down-to-earth girl who, despite having played both passive and dominant roles, really doesnât think of herself as all that glamorous.</p>

I feel like if I donât try a lot of different genres, then it might start to get a little dull. Honestly, Iâm a pretty simple person: I donât really do extravagant and flashy, but by immersing myself in roles like these I get to completely remake myself. Itâs honestly a lot of fun.â</p>

              <p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px;">June 01, 2013</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">GENEVAâ<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A U.N. report on May 31 criticized Japanese politicians and local leaders for denying the facts about âcomfort womenâ and urged Tokyo to take measures to prevent "re-traumatizing" the victims.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Japanese government should "refute attempts to deny the facts by the government authorities and public figures and to re-traumatize the victims through such repeated denials,â the report of the U.N. Committee against Torture said.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The committee monitors whether countries are upholding the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The panel regards comfort women, who were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers during World War II, as victims under the convention.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The report did not mention Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto by name. But during the examination process, three of the four committee members who raised the comfort women issue referred to his recent remarks, such as, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">âAnyone can understand that the comfort women system was necessary,â and, âThere is no evidence to prove that the Japanese government forcibly took the women (to frontline brothels).â</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The report not only criticized Diet members and high-ranking local government officials, but it also expressed concern that public compensation or relief measures have not been provided to former comfort women and that those involved in setting up the comfort women system have not been prosecuted.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The report also called on the Japanese government to accurately describe the comfort women issue in history textbooks.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In addition to the comfort women issue, the U.N. report referred to the âsubstitute detentionâ system in Japan, in which suspects are detained in police jail cells instead of legally stipulated detention houses.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Ten members of the committee evaluate each country once every several years. Japan, which acceded to the convention in 1999, received an evaluation on May 21 and 22 for the first time in six years. It was the second examination for the country.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">During the evaluation process, Japanese government officials explained to the U.N. panel about the statement issued in 1993 by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono, which expressed Japanâs apologies and remorse to former comfort women. They also cited the efforts of the Asian Womenâs Fund that was set up to provide compensation to the women.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Japanese officials did not refer to Hashimotoâs recent remarks.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The mayor himself was busy on his Twitter account on June 1 explaining his stance on the comfort women system.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">He tweeted: âThe focal question is whether Japan abducted comfort women on the will of the state or not. The primary reason why the comfort women issue remains unresolved is because the Kono statement leaves the point obscure.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif;">âSo far, many Japanese historians and politicians, mainly those of the Liberal Democratic Party, have denied that. But that denial has been directed toward the Japanese people. Can they make the same denial toward the United Nations and the world?â</p>
