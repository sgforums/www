              <p>Wow, really ah?  I thought he die hard, hardcore and sworn to death supporter, member and chief of LV.</p>
              <p>When he ran his forum, anything bad about LV kena cut, censor etc. LV like the Mafia for him, once in, in for life and sworn to uphold LV until death (or no longer driving).</p>
              <p>So why he quit? Don't tell me - another Ah Guan issue! Kena tekan by some newbie, he demanded the newbie kena sack or not he will quit. Then the newbiw never quit, so he bo pian must quit to have face!</p>
              <p>That one his pattern is famous for us, any time he kena tekan, he become like school girl or a small baby in the pram, will throw tantrums and then quit.</p>
              <p>Or maybe he like me - kena Toto 1st prize! (Thanks Rbs for letting people know my secret!).</p>
              <p>Whatever la, he happy can liao, nothing in it for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw CT it's interesting that you still call him ' Mentor.' Don't get me wrong, I think you're a gentleman who remembers what good people have done for you. In my years in the force, I have of course trained many juniors. Yes most will call me "Sir"  during the training, but I always discourage them.</p>
              <p>Some will persist, but usually once the training or their probation period over, they eventually will address me by name or rank from there onwards. However there is this 1 guy until very recently will still call me Sir.</p>
              <p>Finally 1 day I told him, xxx you are no longer a junior policeman, you are quite senior now, been promoted many times, you definitely need not call me 'Sr' anymore. What I did was so long ago and only taught you a little bit, you have learned from others since then and also you have gained so much experience, please call me by name.</p>
              <p>Finally for the first time in nearly 17 years, he called me by name! Lol, and he looked so uncomfortable doing it. Perhaps it's time your mentor, also accepted that his trainee is now his equal and should discourage all the previous titles bestowed.</p>

                              <p>Huh, LV what happened? What happened to Bowah's chief? I thought
              he was groomed to take over LV? Is now a double chief? Of LV and
              Beach Rd?</p>
              <p>But Beach Rd honestly tough for him, all old timers, they won't
              want some wet behind the years punk coming and teaching them what
              to do, it's like teaching a father how to fuck!</p>

              My former chief is just a normal hyperactive person lah, I mean including you and many others, you guys had moved on with yr life, so is my former chief, to me, he also lead a colorful life, join here, resign there, join there...resign here, aren't that colorful, one of his charactistics is like many of us, he hates stagnatation, but his weak point is that he die die must hold on to his high egos and prides, and that is where he is much vulnerable to attack and insulted. 
              
              But then, as I understand him, whatever happen to him, good or bad, he will just wipe his backside and move on with his life.

              You can look back at yr past, PCC at time, also must think of the past dsexy women mah.
              
              The past is history, we should not go back and dwell on it, instead, we should learn from it.
              
              The future is unpredictable, but you can mould it by planing and acting from the present
              
              The present is a gift, use it wisely and happily
