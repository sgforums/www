              Of course the TD is wrong lah, and he stop to question him what it is all about, and due to his dressing and composure, you deem he is threatening whereby he could be saying anything wrong sir?

              There are many TDs on the road who do not know how to react and express themselve well, and because of that, they find it hard to suit the working environment and thus, become a TD

              Bro, when I said TD cannot express themselve well, I am referring to TD verus the public at large, not within the taxi circle.
              
              We all agreed that the first impression a public view a cabby is someone who cannot make much in life or that cannot get a job because of fark up attitude. Secondly, it can be low education, no higher skill, lazy to learn and study, cannot work with superior, with colleages and so on. Like it or not, this is the view, you can argue until the cow come home, but these are the views of what the public see in us, of course infront of you or news, they will said taxi driver is ok, good,..but behind the scene is different.
              
              TD are good in expressing themselve are mostly within it circle of trade, and that include the companies and LTA, because all at the same same frequency. But to public, they not that skill enuf, so to speak, that is why, I keep insisting govt or company to sponsor drivers for upgrading in public relationship, a course that can help drivers to tackle any issue on the road, and it should be given free.
              
              Let take a look at this driver who make an illegal turn, he could be on call, he could be urgent going to toilet, he could be late for an advance and so on or simply turn because infront he knew, no more pax liao, all industrial or plain field, and we agreed that it is wrong, this is the first item, the second item will be, someone honked at him because someone is not happy as he nearly knock into him, if he had taken some public handling courses, he would had wave his hand in apologise and case close..see the picture, he would hv the skill to think first before action.

              <p>Aiyoh bro, no need to explain long long lah. I agree TDs have poor image. Uneducated, rough, uncouth, lazy and cmi in society type. Y'day top up my diesel at petrol station. The lady knows me cos I used to top up petrol there for my own car. She very surprised. "Now, u drive taxi arh?"  I have to say I drive part time oni. </p>
              <p>Nobody wants his/her children to becum TDs lah. But funny hor. I am sure every S'porean knows an uncle, brother, cousin or friend who is a TD. So, why look down on them?</p>

              aiyo bro ar...The title Lor Sor King is earned one leh, not just blah blah and get one hor, and furthermore, who got the time to write all these...including me, maybe only a few more. 
              
              People way of looking at TD is a stigma, so no matter how good you are, still the stigma remain provided they come to know u better, when I wash my cab, the washer give me a kind of you no money poor taxi driver look, then, when I wash my BM there, the scene changed completely, and from there on,...the address is boss, thank you, please, ...
              
              Like you see security guards at condo and companies, you will hv a stigma on them, cannot make much in life, that is why become Guard, nicer name will be security officers, but when I came to know that one of the guard paid was 5k per month, drove a sport converters...that stigma was removed, for him only.
              
              You cannot blame the public on the way they look at TD, it is cultivated and breed that way. When youngs, your parent would had told you, bo study, later become rubbish collector, but today rubbish truck driver cum collectors are earning much more than TD, somemore got 2 assistants with him. But the culture already breed into people mind, rubbish collector is for bo study and poor people, however, that is not the case.
