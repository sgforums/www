              This is still considered sexual harrassment, or more serious, outrage of modesty. Want to drive taxi drive properly lah. Want talk government nobody care. You talk about dirty with the passenger, get ready go jail sit and fine.
              
              Women are "sacred creatures" in Singapore. Unless you want to test system with Women charter.

              <p>The problem with non-serious sexual harassment cases here is that nobody was ever convicted because he asked for a girl's bra size. This is an actionable offense, but till date I have not read of any successful convictions. There will always be people willing to test the law to the limit, just like there will always be people who will do extreme sports and risk death. Dirty talk happens frequently everywhere, do you have any newspaper cases to quote?</p>
              <p>I really dont know of anyone who went to jail because of dirty talking in Singapore. Sure it constitutes sexual harassment, but if it was so easy to get a free stay in Changi, many homeless people would have done it over and over again.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Got women's charter, but this country's judges also not stupid right? Lets say a girl dont like me and went to police station and accuse me of pressing her neh neh. Next she file protection order. The judge will have to read her story since this is a case of her words against mine. If the incident never happened, she will have to make up a lot of things, and theres a high chance the judge will conclude she is mouthing rubbish after probing and asking her and me many many questions. Remember it takes a lot of time, talent and intellect to become a judge. If our judges can be so easily fooled by a fake story from a 20 or 30 yr old, we may start wondering whether they bought their degrees from somewhere....</p></div>

              <p>Not so easy one lah.</p>
              <p>1. He was drunk.  Is he able to remember all the details? When did the e-brake happen? What caused the TD to e-brake? Where did it occur?  What happened after he hit his head? If he claimed he was dead drunk and cannot remember a thing, then how come he can be sure he hit his head on the head rest?</p>
              <p>2. When he slammed his head into the head rest, did he there and then complain to TD? If not, why? He could have fallen after leaving the cab and push the blame to the TD.</p>
              <p>3. When he boarded the cab, the TD said he asked him to belt up.  He did not wear seat belt. Whose fault?</p>
              <p>4. Lastly, vehicle got camera recording. Check recording and see if got e-brake.</p>
              <p>Remember, if u lie, you need to dig ten holes to cover one hole.</p>

              <p>Yes. Robbers and fare cheats choose their targets.  Those lau ah pek drivers, small built or bui bui drivers are at risk.  Cos they are weaker or cannot run after the fare cheats.</p>
              <p>Night drivers must be extra careful.  If you want to go places like Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, Neil Rd, Orchard Towers and Geyland, then you must be super alert.  Otherwise, go queue at MRT stations, airport or Malls in the heartlands and make multiple short trips.</p>
              <p>Even the way you drive.  If you drive slow slow, blur blur type, you are a potential target.  The robber or fare cheat will observe your habits.  If you are the active aggressive (not reckless), drive close to speed limit type or exceed a bit, he will think twice.</p>
              <p>If you suspect any pax, make conversation.  At traffic stops, turn your head to look at him.  If he sits just behind you instead of to your left, then you better be alert.</p>
              <p>Still, it's a risk and you are vulnerable driving at night.  Not 100% safe.</p>

              <p>You are smart cabby. Singapore got many many cabbies who cannot
              think so clearly. Just like some cabbies will scan pax before they
              even stop, there are pax who scan the cabby for that blur fark look
              before they board.</p>
              <p>It is a good idea to ask friends if u got that blur face. If not
              sure it is good idea to wear sunglass and hide that blur blur
              innocent look. You look at those wan bao cabbies who got beaten up.
              Thats the look and dressing to avoid. Ever saw or read about a
              chrysler, kim gu or e-class limo cabby who kenna whacked or get
              conned? Never right? Some of these limo cabbies are even
              under-cover police. Thats how our police track drug traffickers,
              illegal pros movement, and get crime tips thru taxi group walkie
              talkie. </p>
