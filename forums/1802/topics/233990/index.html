            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday i took a cab from my house to tanjong pagar. The fare was $14.90 inclusive of the $2 surcharge. As i left my house in a hurry, so i didnt check if i have enough money with me. I realize i only have $10 with me during the journey so after reaching the destination, i decided to pay using nets. However there seems to be something wrong with the machine. Although the screen display the word approved, the receipt cannot be printed out. Then the driver told me tat transaction might have not been made and tell me to pay by cash. Then i told him tat the screen already display approved so the transaction shuld have been made but he argued tat there shuld be receipt issued. I was very unwilling to pay him "again" but i am in a rush so i LL go to a nearby atm and withdraw money then pay him the $14.90 again. i am going to check my band account to see if the transaction have been made. If it has does anybody here know how to get back the money? Its a citycab by the way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

A receipt is good enough to justify everything ... date , time on board , time alight , total distance , NRIC of driver .....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from the thread starter's post , it is not known whether does he got the receipt ? ..... hope he does collect the receipt from the driver , can't imagine with this sort event happening , he still have not taken any receipt .<br><br>Got receipt easier to get things done , without a receipt (*sigh ) ..... Good luck .</div>
