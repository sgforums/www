              <p>Just my personal 2c view...</p>
              <p>Be it forex, bonds, equities, commodities, etc type of trading transactions... a vested retailer enter into a buy/sell orders base on the allowed spread bids.  A transaction is consider successful if the queue price is hit and your queued qty is done. It can be partial done or totally not done... the order will lapse and u have to re-queue your orders tmr. Unless some adopt the good-to-cancel orders which the order will remain  maybe till a certain period of time.</p>
              <p>Some small retails play safe by queuing everyday at both the extreme of the buy/sell bids... it is a conservative method but doesnt gaurantee full-proof. Moreover, by doing so... it create a genuine buy/sell order everyday and active traders will make use of it.</p>
              <p>If it is your interest... then go for it. If u are juz a small fish trying to tag along and gain some profit from the up or down swing movement, then my personal opinion is juz forget about it.</p>
              <p>The time spent is not worth-while... u can win peanuts 10 times... but u cant afford to loose once. After many days of frustration when your queue price remain undone, the tendency is u will change your the conservative queuing price.</p>

              One thing is for sure, there is no such thing as a 0% risk trade. Common sense should tell you something is not right if someone promises a 0% risk trade or investment or whatever.
              
              The closest thing to a 0% risk instrument is Singapore gahmen bonds, but even that is not entirely risk free.
              
              So definitely there is risk involved if you want reward. People need to know this.

              I know that there is no such thing as "0% risk with 3% return per day or 90% per month...", that's enough for me.
              
              As above, the closest thing to 0% risk is a Singapore Government Bond and the yield is not even 5% per month, I think.
              
              Binary options trading claims to give you big returns following the crowd but the risk is enormous. Maybe there are other such schemes I don't know about. Maybe bitcoin? 
              
              But I do understand risk/reward and there is no such things as a free lunch.
              
              If you want to clear doubts, then say what it is here so that people can assess it for themselves. Why need  a one to one meeting unless you are trying to use pressure tactics?

              <p>Broadly speaking, there are 3 ways people get rich.</p>
              <p>1. the politically connected type - in some countries, they may have to put their riches into bank accounts of other people such as family members or cronies, to minimise corruption claims. In the Singapore context, ex-investment bankers come into the picture. They help invest the millions that our PAP ministers earn. You think our PM and President keep 100% of their salary in their banks? No. You think they got time to monitor their investments? Of course not. Some one is behind the scenes, and I do not want to have anything to do with this person. Getting rich through politics is not for the average person. So forget it. You might want to sidetrack and ask whether GIC or Temasek are asked to help our minister's personal portfolios? I do not know but I really doubt so.</p>
              <p>2. the banker type - their monies are almost all invested over diverse instruments. However even banks can collapse, what more to say of retail investers? Of course they are always the rare survivors and miracles you read about. There is no way to verify though. You can win 100 times or over 10 years. But everything can be wiped out in the next financial crisis, which is coming very soon. You can get rich here if you got the skill and time and talent for it. But most people lost money in the process of trying to find out. Again it is not for the average person.</p>
              <p>3. the triad business type - their monies are stashed away as fiat currencies, physical like gold, silver and art. All kept in a secure location which is never a bank. Their monies is the most secure and immune to financial crises. There are hardly any visible triads in Singapore, but this business model makes the most sense here. Transact only in cash - do not use credit card, do not use NETS, and do not keep more than $100K using the same name in the same bank because your cash is insured up to this amount only. Excess cash should be safely stowed away in the safe location. There is no need to invest because the triad business model rakes in thousands a day of guaranteed profits, more than any financial instrument can promise you. You do not want to invest it, because you do not want the money to be tracked and audited. Lastly because of all this, the money is safe except for fire, and nobody can track cash movements. What are triad businesses here? Many many lah. Too many to count man.</p>

              <p>Just my personal 2c view...</p>
              <p>Be it forex, bonds, equities, commodities, etc type of trading
              transactions... a vested retailer enter into a buy/sell orders base
              on the allowed spread bids.  A transaction is consider
              successful if the queue price is hit and your queued qty is done.
              It can be partial done or totally not done... the order will lapse
              and u have to re-queue your orders tmr. Unless some adopt the
              good-to-cancel orders which the order will remain  maybe till
              a certain period of time.</p>
              <p>Some small retails play safe by queuing everyday at both the
              extreme of the buy/sell bids... it is a conservative method but
              doesnt gaurantee full-proof. Moreover, by doing so... it create a
              genuine buy/sell order everyday and active traders will make use of
              it.</p>
              <p>If it is your interest... then go for it. If u are juz a small
              fish trying to tag along and gain some profit from the up or down
              swing movement, then my personal opinion is juz forget about
              it.</p>
              <p>The time spent is not worth-while... u can win peanuts 10
              times... but u cant afford to loose once. After many days of
              frustration when your queue price remain undone, the tendency is u
              will change your the conservative queuing price.</p>

You may think he is crazy or retarded. But do you know he earns alot of points on his VIP card.. geting alot of freebies and free stays? This is an example of sure win play.

              Money of course is a Must, but it does not imply everything, at times, we have to be logical and truthful to ourselves,
              
              Last year, for the three months ended Dec 31 2014, MBSâ€™ adjusted property EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), the key measure for operating performance in the gaming industry, rose 100.3 per cent from the corresponding period a year earlier to a record US$518.5 millions. 
              
              While VIP betting turnover slumped 26.8 per cent to US$10 billion, the rolling chip win percentage, a measure of winnings at tables for high rollers, surged to 3.58 per cent in the quarter from 1.92 per cent in the previous corresponding quarter, well above the statistical average of 2.85 per cent. Mass market volume dropped 3.3 per cent but the casino win rate improved to 26.7 per cent from 24.5 per cent.
              
              In simple term, for 3 months they earned 518.5 millions in US dollars without the need to produce, manufacture or service anything.

              Simply put it, casino do make tons of money by tapping on human nature of greed, of course there are some who make it rich, but will or shall, eventually, make lost in near future, as lost is a lost, win is only having more chips to enjoy till lost. That is why people said "Casino is not a business that scare you win, it only scare that you dun come anymore"
              
              Casino do prove value, that is to satisfy the greedy urge of humans whereby to some, had become a hobby. And to some "successful traders", it can be a money washing place.

              <p>this is a taxi driver forum not to sell investment product?</p>
              <p>TDs are realistic and hard working people, otherwise, they already become property agent, insurance agent, etc. Why still drive taxi?  Hard work and low return.</p>
