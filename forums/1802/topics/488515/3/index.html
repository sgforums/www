              <p>Yes, taxi driving is hard work, low return, not a good choice of career or job or a way to make a living. I am in this only as a temporary measure, to earn some income while building a sideline biz.</p>
              <p>You can &amp; should build an additional income stream just in case you cant drive anymore due to whatever reasons.</p>
              <p>Just beware of scams &amp; get rich quick schemes because if it seems too good to be true, you must be on your guard. Not to say it is difficult to make money on the side, just that there is no free lunch.</p>
              <p>A 0% risk, high reward trade is pipe dream. Options trading claims to give you a risk-free arbitrage opportunity but in reality, leakage, slipping and market inefficiency makes it a moderate to high risk venture.</p>
              <p>One possibe exception is high speed program trading used by the big hedge funds. These program is said to be able to make lots of money by arbitraging but we layman won't really know or get access to it.</p>

              The key is add in passion, in all work, be it you are TDs or hawker stall seller, workers, employees or Uber driver, the key is the need to hv a passion in it, otherwise you will not last long. 
              
              From a taxis perspectives, if you look at the money you earned from yr hard work in servicing others, the different paxs of the day and time, the hazards, the things that happen on the road day in and night out..its is quite colorful unlike those dull ones that go work with discipline in time and regulations

              In all thing, we must learn to look forward, not on the bad times, but looking forward on the good thing we will do, or enjoy or travel as in holidays or with family outing and eating, that will bring you a much happier life, be it you are a TDs or CDs.
              
              Like as a TDs, I look forward to counting money at the end of the day, be with my bak bak, on my TV to watch my favourite old show with my ang di cau...(guiness stout)
              
              As a CDs, I look forward for the supervisor to hand over me the money, count my tips (bai bao not ang bao), enjoy a light moment with my fellow CDs colleagues at Lavender kopitiam.

              Money like a taxi, cannot be left parked mah, however, the differences is that Money can be diversified, not to put into just one basket, looking at those banks blue chips with good dividends, just whack into few of them, sit back and take dividends enought liao...now you know why I just net $30

              <p>Wow, do you know LKY, until the day he was hospitalised, he was still taking Chinese lessons from his tutor? LHL said so.</p>
              <p>Why don't need learning? LIfe long learning is a good habit. Everything takes time. If you have not succeeded now, it does not mean you have failed.</p>
              <p>You only fail when you stop trying....</p>

              <p>Taking chinese lesson when in hospital, you sure?</p>

              <p>If you are as rich as them and got lot of time, sure keep learning.</p>
              <p>Rich people dont depend on taxi income to survive. they can earn more through other investment.</p>
              <p>In short, if you are depending taxi income to survive, dont talk big.</p>
              <p>If you want big, should spend time that can help you to earn more. dont become TD.</p>

              <p>Being a TDs for me is more of networking make more friends.. to TDs or to passengers.</p>
              <p>Earn some pocket money for, business and advertising expenditures.</p>
              <p>Thats why i even care to share here, because i know almost 0 TD drivers below their 45s would want to be a TD till the day they die.</p>
              <p>I came to share, gossip talk cock. If you being too defensive and sensitive and wanna view it otherwise as if to scam your money then too bad lor.</p>
              <p>I see some of uncles are those over defensive type, thus they plan to conceal their destiny in that small vehicle for the rest of their life, not opening to anything else.</p>
              <p>As mentioned many times before, and like some bros here mentioned, comfortable to know more can coffee, think otherwise then ignore.</p>
              <p>No 1 force you :) Good luck all..</p>
