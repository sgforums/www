              <p>Ya, I know TDs very hard to huat. Can only fetch one at a time. It is a super labour intensive job.</p>
              <p>No wonder LKY once said something like "If you don't study hard, you will end up as a taxi driver....".</p>
              <p>Bugger, I studied hard, still ended up as a taxi driver (but sideline nia, heng ah). </p>
              <p>Actually TDs are doing a good public service - help to ferry people safely home or from one place to another in cool comfort.</p>

              Study or no study, the thing boss like is not about you study smlj, is whether you can deliver what he wants or not.
              
              PM after reading my post, already said, no need degrees...degrees most TDs also have, limpek 150 degrees long sighted. We do not need paper General and Minister, we do not need Academical Managers and superiors who just sit behind a computer believing in digtial than human existence.

              No lah, today, in first talk later, 3 month probation, if cannot, plse, the door and gate are open. 
              
              The public sector had long been a strait jacket sector with no flexibility, why? because of paper chasing rather than good IQ and skilful. So behind those desk you see in any govt sector, sit a person with the same mindset as the computer infront of him. When that computer command him to move, he moved. He moved up thru courses, degrees and many other soft diplomas or courses, he get promoted not because he work out or bring out something benefit to the society or the companies' profit , but because he got that paper, which is meaningless if you cannot function.
              
              10 business peoples in Singapore...8 do not hv degrees, 5 do not have diploma, and 3 only primary school education. From Kopitam towkay to car tyre shops bosses to fish soup hawker to boon tong kee or tien tien chicken rice...and so on...their objectives is to make their wares good, not chasing after paper.
              
              In private sector, as what deng xiao peng said, white cat or black cat, I dun give a damn, as long as the cat can catch mouse, it is a good cat. So, to any bosses in the private sector is as long as you can deliver and bring profit to the company, I WANT YOU, can give you director or MD whatever title you want...just like TDs, as long as you can bring money home...lau char bor careless how you drive?? or that you go take courses or call bak bak..

              <p>You are missing the point.  Of course if a staff is good and can bring in sales, who cares what fark paper he got.</p>
              <p>The issue is when you interview candidates for a job, how will you know he is good? Based on what he says or write in the resume? Like that, most taxi drivers will pass the interview cos 99% are all cannon fairies.</p>
              <p>So, most bosses fall back on the paper qualifications first as the only objective evidence that the guy has achieved something. Of course, if later on cannot perform, then out he goes lah.</p>
              <p>Why some business ppl got no paper and yet are successful? Cos they got nothing to lose and got no other options. But you go ask them, 99% will wish they had a degree. They will always feel that this is missing in their otherwise successful life. That's why 100% of them will make sure their children have a degree, local or overseas.</p>
              <p>Those with degrees will not want to venture into risky business cos they dun want to face uncertainties and failures when they can have a good job after graduation. If they can rise up to be CEOs and CFOs of MNCs, why not?</p>

              You also miss the point, brother brother...yes, I would had agreed if you are going for govt sector or any GLC. But in private sector, resume is more on experience, the know how and know why. Usually in private sector, a person is able to market himself well, get head hunted, more so are those recommended by colleagues or friends.
              
              Put yourself in a boss shoe, you own a logistic company with few warehouses, import and export business. The commercial desktop job, yes, you might need some qualification on skill rather than academia result, you can tell me, your math A, your science A and your english A, but limpek want a outspoken person, able to gel all levels of people, able to do sales and kill competitor...you A in science or math or english is not much relevant to me. And yet you want to command high salaries..bull to you.
              
              Even today, the GCL and govt sectors are feeling the pinch, and that is why our PM rally said..you dun need a degree also can move up..why he said that??? because the world had changed, and he recognise it. Because he knows that a person with a degree will not take risk and seek a normal comfortable life, but that is not the case, you need to take risk, you need to challenge the uncertainties, but because you have a degree, you avoided many thing, you think that is good enuf, and moreover, you can push problem to your lower subordinates, that is very common among degree holders, pushing and shafting down other throats.

              If you look around any business bosses in singapore,...how many hold a degree? not to mention Einsten, steve job, bill gates..and so on. the world top 100 richest, 70% do not hold a degree before they become rich..they are offered a degree only after they become rich.
                  
              If Singapore is going to be academia driven...it will end no where near creativity and innovation, and if you ask any bosses in any private sector today..the most wanted people are the ITEs. 
                  
              However, our society had been so academically driven, the likes of parents wanting children to die die must get A, die die must go into good school, die die must win and get top position, is moving toward a very straight by the book peoples, and anything that goes by the book are not business nor creative people.
                  
              If I am the boss of company, my second do not need education as long as he got experience, I sub out my finance to auditing companies, who at the same time, can audit my account, thereafter, I employ ITE peoples to run the show, pay them higher than norm, respect them and upgrade their skill along their career line. 
                  
              In return you get, flexible people, people who can work and do office stuff, people who really to put their hand on the production, and most people, people who appreciate others and do not have that kind of atas or I am higher than you attitude

              There are 600000 graduate every years, I am not saying you do not need a degree, but you to me, degree is just a basic education, out of 600000 graduate, only 100 can become CEO, and that is why, lots of office politics in Singapore companies.
              
              CEO or CFO is still working for others, you might see them so nice an good, just like me, but the pressure and workload is great, every minute, there is a problem, either from HR, or account or finance, or sales or that customer make a complaint, shareholders not happy with the performances, tho earning much more than a TD, TD life is much more better than them, dun believe, you can ask my bro CT, why he become a TD??  
              
              Better be Directors lah, most directors are businessman, shareholders, but lower education, like Tong Woon transport, boss..knn..look same like my Ah Fool, never tuck in shirt, never wear a tie, but employ PhD accountant, the rest all ah lian and ah hua, he also step up as CEO. Same Like Jack Mah, knn...can go into IPO in Alibaba and become the richest man in China, even the NY stockmarket CEOs also hv to respect him, but he was just a teacher in China...face alos look like my ah fool

              Brother brother, this is not talking cock, this is a fruitful discussion of different views, I welcome your view and you said I talk cock, buay gum mah, I never said you are wrong nor socld you or yr family, let take is as a strong discussion rather than those wayang discussion. There is no right or wrong, $50 still in our pocket..tio bo.
              
              Study is a basic, not mend for progression, you need a basic to stand on mah, basic to understand english and math, from there, you can progress thru other means. But of course, you would want your children to have degrees or even get a PhD, but after that, you will still be working for someone..tio bo? 
              
              I am not saying you do not study, if can, by all means, what I am saying is education at at time can be harmful to one progression because of the lacking to take risk and become inflexible. Therefore, the best is to have both hands on technical skill and at the same time, study to progress. OJT and Bring up one skill in his trade is also a progression, not necessary you need a degree.  
              
              Moreover, today, there are thousands of degree and diploma holders in the market that it hampered the worthy of it, last time, yes, a degree holder is like king, today, what is a degree??? most cannot even afford to buy a car or a house, so to speak. Therefore, beside a basic education, you also need to find a niche in your career speciality.
              
              But for TD like us, we are stagnated, beside limo, next will be private driver, this are also not kind of promotion but a different driving experiences only. But most take it like self actualisation of reaching the utopia of TD, lols.
              
              Singapore is too academia driven that if fail to recognise the blue collar experties as a strong backbone of it economy, this is typical asian conservatives thinking as tho education will provide everything, in the west, most Technical blue collars worker are professional in it own way, it stand as per par with white collar, or even earn more because of the need and their right to pay for my skill. Singapore on the other hand, are too pampered with degree, because a degree holder can hamper a blue collar, and blue collar get exploited, will get less than what it should be, but in actual fact, contributed more.

              <p>Again, don't compare the West and the East lah... diferent cultural and metalility...</p>
              <p>The problem with diploma and degree is that most do not put their qulification to good use... Look at most of the Regulars in our be it Police force ao Army force.. Is it relevant to their studies??? But still, it is a pre-requisite. meaning must have qulification in order to even step into their office for interview....</p>
              <p>Experience... Something that you can only have if you are given the chance to work and learn...</p>
              <p>Hands on.... Same as the above....</p>
              <p>So in all, must have the pre-requisite which is what???</p>
              <p>Talk about logistics har... Yes, I will only look at experience when I'm not able to short-list potential candidates, but very unlikely cause most will have diplomas or degrees in our line... Simply because, no one else can be blamed other than yourself if you do not chose to upgrade your qualification and be that highly sought after person that the rest is looking for...</p>
              <p>Please don't streotype lah... TD really stagnated meh... For the old, maybe lor.. But for the youngsters... Don't belittle them lah...</p>
