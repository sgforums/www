              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>I've yet to fix up a radio/CD player in my Sonata.</p>
              <p>When I collected my cab at Sin Ming, there was this guy who left his namecard in my vehicle. He was from an audio shop somewhere in Paya Lebar. I asked him how much for a second hand radio, he told me $50 including installation. Find it a little expensive. Or is this normal?</p>
              <p>Anyone here has a better lobang for getting a super cheap 2nd hand radio. Don't mind not having a CD player for now. Just wanna make lonely trips less boring.</p>
              <p>Would it be wise to look for one at Sim Lim Tower and self-install? The speakers in the cab are all in place, right? All that's needed is a head unit, right?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the info, Pool.</p>
              <p>I think I'll just take a look at what the Paya Lebar place has to offer first. If I don't like what they have, then will source somewhere else.</p>
              <p>One more question: do you guys have your own car vacuum? Or do you pay someone to vacuum your cabs for you once a while. Looking at the state of my boot and rear seat floors, it'd be more economical if I get my own vacuum I think. Vacuum service at car washes charge $5, but I'd prefer to vacuum every other day.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>eh drive, i had hard time vacuuming the floor cos of the carpet. after 2 months surrender. went to toa payoh north to install the water proof cover for the interior floors ($120) now dun need to vacuum even, just use damp cloth wipe and pickup debris. 30 sec kts. wait till u kena vomit on the carpet, then u'll appreciate the covering. boot covering $30 cos before that kena sunday morning wet market pax, prawns, crabs...put newspaper oso no use. now cleaning simple, take out the entire cover, wash, dry, put back. most of the diesel kiosk got tap water. now i clean taxi interior 10 mins. tops. cos easy to clean. for long term sometimes no choice must invest. time used to clean taxi is better used picking another pax.</p></div>

              <p>Still .... for my own personal hygience , and self satisfaction ... i bought a cheap car vacuum , both wet &amp; dry purpose , when Esso got offer .. $15.90 .</p>
              <p>I thought at first : " Fuck la , just use , spoilt , throw away , anyway how good $15.90 can do ? "</p>
              <p>Hahaha , not only it cheap , and also it's good ... powerful .</p>
              <p>Just good enuf to suck those debris out of my sight , i damn buay tahan those debris ...</p>

              <p>I drove into a Caltex station jus now to use the toilet.</p>
              <p>Can't remember which it was, but its toilet is actually inside the mart. very clean.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I browsed through the carcare section for some air freshener and saw a 12V vacuum cleaner. $20.90 only, some unknown brand of course. Thought I could give it a try and got it.</p>
              <p>Not a bad little thing, suction power not bad, comes with the different head attachments. And the best part, it's got a light. Quite a bargain at $20.90, IMO.</p>
              <p>My cabin's air is now served by two small Polyglaze air fresheners, less than $4 each, but dunno how long they'll last.</p>

              <p>Finally got me a radio at the place at Upp Paya Lebar Road yesterday. Name of place Sin Hoe Whatt if I remember correctly. Lotsa taxis over there.</p>
              <p>Their brand new CD player/radio is an old model of Pioneer, the 6750. Selling for $160.</p>
              <p>I asked for a second hand CD player but too bad they didnt have stock for those.</p>
              <p>So it's either $70 for a radio with a spoiled CD slot or $50 for a radio with a spoiled cassette slot..... can imagine how ugly one of those look. So I got a 2nd hand Blaupunkt radio with a CD slot that doesn't work. Managed to get $60 for it.</p>
              <p>Installation not easy cos I think the last hirer uninstalled his stereo himself, so all the connection wires were cut. The tech had to join up all the wires to the adapter and replace a blown fuse, something I wouldn't have been able to do simply. The uncle there told me his labor charges are $20 for installation and $10 to uninstall.</p>
              <p>So basically I got the radio for $40 plus $20 labor. Not a bad deal I think. Nice bunch of people at the shop too. Have had my fair share of lousy service at car accessories shops so this place was a nice surprise. They don't have many good, high end stuff tho. Not that I'm looking for any at the moment.</p>
              <p>Btw, the 2nd hand set I got is a 2004 model of Blaupunkt. </p>
