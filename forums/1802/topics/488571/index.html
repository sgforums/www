              Today at mbs.  Smrt in front of me reject pax with nets. Second pax in queue with luggage. 
              So I took the 1st pax. 
              
              I took photo of cab,  tel no. Of pax, email of pax.
              
              should I give the Smrt driver benefit of doubt.  Meter spoil? His reason given to pax is he cannot take nets.

              <p>3. lets say you successfully prosecuted his bad habit, will your action cause the other party to change his pattern?</p>
              <p>4. is this definition of wrongful behaviour by LTA even right? should LTA and SMRT dictate whether a cabby can or cannot use his NETS machine?</p>
              <p>Hopefully you found the answer for yourself. People may see things differently though.</p>

              <p><br> Don't lah bro. Why you want to sabo him?</p>
              <p>I just took a SMRT cab from Changi City Point. Ask him why SMRT cabbies don't accept NETs. He said it is because SMRT pays very slow for cashless, always cock up one. Weekend even slower. But he said he will take anyway.</p>
              <p>This is not so bad, it is those that "inteview" pax that is worse. I took so many because the cab in front rejected them - not on the way.</p>
              <p>At Lucky Plaza, cabbies don't want to go Pasir Ris and other far away places. At near Mustafa, one lady said 8 taxis before me rejected her as she wants to go to Jln Membina??? Then why stop? At Orchard 313, cabby in front don't want to go to Hougang, wow!</p>
              <p>Of course, these cabbies also don't want to go to Woodlands, CCK, Bukit Panjang, Yishun, Zoo, etc.
                  
                  This is nonsense and the taxi companies are not doing anything, but it is to our advantage, they don't take, we take lah.</p>

              Why paste a NETs sticker on the window? 
              
              NETS is non issue.
              
              Real issue is pax going short distance. 
              
              Then 2nd pax in queue going airport. 
              
              Smrt driver can choose pax . Like tis I also want to join Smrt.  
              I got no position to judge. ..so think better let the authority investigate. ...
              
              so fellow cabbies. ..want to chut pattern. .. better not lah. ... now many cabbies behind also got smart phone.  Pls lah dun interview in taxi stand unless change shift.  
              
              One airport trip won't make you rich
              
              I also queue for 20mins. ... dun determine my luck. .. like this you force me to shoot.

              <p>If one sentence like this can go changi chalet, many people tried liao lar. Did u know 227,400 households in Singapore pull in $1862 or below? 35% of households are in absolute poverty? 33% of students go to school with no pocket money? And 60% of the undergraduates in a certain uni NEED financial assistance!</p>
              <p>30% of our households spend 5-51% more than what they earn every month. So one sentence like this can get free stay in changi ah? Say a few magic words only hor. No need to kill, rob, traffic drugs or cheat people. Just say the magic sexual harassment words - male friend to female 'friend'. Lady makes report and viola, go sit inside and receive free vocational training, good food (better than home at least), daily exercise. Come on, u think changi got so many cells for these jiak liao bee cases ah? U think our mata mata got nothing better to do ah?</p>

              <p>Cashless payment is an added convenience and not accepting it is not against the law governing the behaviour of taxi drivers.  Otherwise all cab companies will get into trouble for rejecting VISA card payment. Likewise Transcab does not accept Nets payment.</p>
              <p>If it violates the law for example, kicking the pax out before the journey is completed or overcharging, then LTA will act.</p>
              <p>LTA will not act on your complaint but will refer to SMRT who in turn will offer some crap excuses and say the driver has been warned.</p>

              <p>Cashless payment is an added convenience and not accepting it is
              not against the law governing the behaviour of taxi drivers.
               Otherwise all cab companies will get into trouble for
              rejecting VISA card payment. Likewise Transcab does not accept Nets
              payment.</p>
              <p>If it violates the law for example, kicking the pax out before
              the journey is completed or overcharging, then LTA will act.</p>
              <p>LTA will not act on your complaint but will refer to SMRT who in
              turn will offer some crap excuses and say the driver has been
              warned.</p>

              $1862 or below? 35% of households are in absolute poverty? 33% of
              students go to school with no pocket money? And 60% of the
              undergraduates in a certain uni NEED financial assistance!</p>
              <p>30% of our households spend 5-51% more than what they earn every
              month. So one sentence like this can get free stay in changi ah?
              Say a few magic words only hor. No need to kill, rob, traffic drugs
              or cheat people. Just say the magic sexual harassment words - male
              friend to female 'friend'. Lady makes report and viola, go sit
              inside and receive free vocational training, good food (better than

              <p>That's CDG's internal policy, LTA won't interfere. Think Taxilim is right.</p>
              <p>But if you can prove that he chose pax and refuse to go where pax go, then it is against LTA's regulations. He will get fine, demerit points and maybe TDVL cancelled. In this case, did he refuse to go even when pax agree to pay cash?</p>

              <p><br> Don't lah bro. Why you want to sabo him?</p>
              <p>I just took a SMRT cab from Changi City Point. Ask him why SMRT
              cabbies don't accept NETs. He said it is because SMRT pays very
              slow for cashless, always cock up one. Weekend even slower. But he
              said he will take anyway.</p>
              <p>This is not so bad, it is those that "inteview" pax that is
              worse. I took so many because the cab in front rejected them - not
              on the way.</p>
              <p>At Lucky Plaza, cabbies don't want to go Pasir Ris and other far
              away places. At near Mustafa, one lady said 8 taxis before me
              rejected her as she wants to go to Jln Membina??? Then why stop? At
              Orchard 313, cabby in front don't want to go to Hougang, wow!</p>
              <p>Of course, these cabbies also don't want to go to Woodlands,
              CCK, Bukit Panjang, Yishun, Zoo, etc. This is nonsense and the taxi
              companies are not doing anything, but it is to our advantage, they
              don't take, we take lah.</p>

              <p>Bro I support your action to shoot. I also buay song this kind of knnbccb TD. Our company is recently upgrading the cashless terminal to only accept chip ATM card. They will take back the terminal and give us a letter to explain to the pax 3 weeks from the letter the following cab not able to accept nets. But his terminal is upgrading or not we wun know. So it's good to let the company investigate.</p>
