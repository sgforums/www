              Brothers, please take a look at those cashless decal pasted on your passenger side window, We accept JCB, Nets, Master. ChinaUNION pay...and so on, followed by flag down fare from $3.20 to 3.90, so if you are displaying all these to ply your business on the road, please follow it, otherwise, it is just like a chicken stall hanging up chickens but tell you, got rice but no chicken, how you feel?
              
              For me, if he reject the first one, I will immediatelygo down, grab the second pax langguges into my boot and nicely bring the pax into my cab, open door for him/her. Want to play, play it big.

              yalor, of course, at the end of the day, you decide, but I can guarantee you that when you decided to complaint, you may or may not get rid of one lousy cabby, there are many more out there with a "seibei yao and ba" mentality like my bro KTC and CT. 
              
              My experiences is that for seasoned until cannot season drivers.. at the end of the day, while counting your intake of the day, writing yr log book, logging off yr MDT and locked the taxi door. Forget about taxi driving until the next day.

              aiya, not everyone use Union pay, but it is becoming a brand as China economy bloom, the west created Visa and Master, the jap come out with JCB, so naturally the Chinese will not want to put their money in foreign land mah, so they come out with Union Pay, and surprisingly, I met a few aussies pax using it.

              <p>Another example, you go in diamond shop, decided to buy 10carat diamond, never know cashless sway sway down, so how? Walk out with diamond without paying?.....</p>
              <p>CDG TD not gong kia, I also never say TD will forever don't accept cashless, maybe it just happen, need to pay bill, need to pay ah long that day, so come out whatever pattern to get cash, than when nothing going to happen that day, nb whole day receive receipt lor.....</p>

              Of course, if your cashless is down, you can alway tell people no cashless available, restuarant will alway tell you first, so to a cab, whose cashless system is GENINUELY down, you are consider handicapped, should try to consider repairing or ply the road street pax rather than going into Q.
              
              What happen if that Q is only a one narrow way out, and you will be jamming up the whole Q if all 10 paxs at the Q wish to pay thru cashless. 
              
              Most restuarants have back up system on their cashless, and nowaday, you can even pay thru hp. 
              
              So, try to ply your business on the road fully equipped, make sure the everything is functioning, with all tools available, it add less stress to you and make your driving more pleasant with confident. And with Today much improve IT system with the like of 4G and upgraded GPS, the case of cashless payment breaking is reduced...so if you are driving a new SMRT cab, dun come and give me the bull that yr cashless breakdown

              Brother brother, there is alway a thing call SONG, if I am SONG to send it and complaint about it, nothing wrong mah, may get Driver of the Month award leh..lols
              
              There are many peoples on the road pointing their finger at me, I also at time point middle finger at others, same goes to my bro Ah Fool, he use to make a round shape on his right hand and use his left flat hand to Pop it a few times wherever he found something angered him.
              
              So, doing middle finger pointing is also a small thing, but the key to most of them doing it is becos of SONG mah, satisfy mah...you need lots of human psychology courses to understand what is SONG feeling

              You seem not to understand most of the forumers here, most of us are not scare of LTA or Taxi companies one, this, you hv to get it clear, because most of us do not need to depend on TDs to do a living.
              
              ..and most importantly, most of us are able to talk well, if limpek father last time got money to send me for education, limpek now can be Chief Judge of Singapore liao...but bo bian, end up become casket driver..phuixxx,,,..still scare smlj
