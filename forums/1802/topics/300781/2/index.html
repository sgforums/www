              <h1 class="clr">Cabbies and commuters adjusting to revised taxi rule in CBD</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Tuesday is the first day of operations after the taxi rule in the Central Business District (CBD) was tweaked.</p>
              <p>Cabbies are now allowed to pick up and drop off passengers at side
              roads, instead of only at designated stands and driveways of buildings.</p>
              <p>Some taxi drivers and commuters are still adjusting to the change.</p>
              <p>But getting taxis in the CBD should be easier now.</p>
              <p>Although
              most welcomed the move, fine—tuning the rule barely three weeks after
              it was introduced has also caused some confusion amongst cabbies and
              commuters.</p>
              <p>"It’s only temporary right? Now change already? Very
              confused. I don’t know that it has changed. Because yesterday I heard
              from the Chinese news which said on May 1st, we have to follow this new
              rule," said one taxi driver.</p>
              <p>Generally, cabbies like the adjustment to the rule.</p>
              <p>"Very convenient for us."</p>
              <p>"It’s better for everyone."</p>
              <p>But for some commuters, the change is still not good enough.</p>
              <p>One
              commuter said: "Go back to the same old way, that will be the best. Of
              course no taxis like to offend traffic rules...but I think they are
              smart enough to know where they should park and where they should stop."</p>
              <p>"Inconvenient for the elderly. If a place doesn’t have a taxi stand, it’s inconvenient for them."</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority had acknowledged it will take some time for cabbies and commuters to adjust to the new rule.</p>
              <p>For cab drivers, they have until 1st May to do so after which they face fines of S$100 and three demerit points.</p>
              <p>Commuters can expect more taxi stands in the CBD, and prominent signs directing them to the nearest one. — CNA/ch</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LTA Fine Tunes Taxi CBD Rule To Exempt Side Roads</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1.     With effect from Monday, 17 March
              2008, taxis will be allowed to pick up and drop off passengers from side roads
              in the CBD where buses do not ply. The CBD rule for taxis will continue to apply
              on roads that have public buses plying. On these roads, taxis can only pick up
              or drop off passengers at taxi stands or on driveways of buildings between 7am
              to 10pm from Mondays to Saturdays, except on Sundays and public holidays.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2.     The Land Transport Authority (LTA)
              has continued to work closely with the Taxi Operators' Associations and taxi
              companies to monitor the implementation of the CBD rule for taxi which came into
              effect on 1 March 2008. The LTA has also taken in public feedback and has
              decided to make adjustments to minimise inconvenience to passengers, businesses
              and taxi drivers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3.     "The principal consideration
              for this rule is safety. This remains our key priority. We, together with the
              Taxi Operators' Associations and taxi companies, have considered very carefully
              the feedback from passengers, businesses and taxi drivers, and LTA has decided
              to allow taxis to pick up and drop off passengers from side roads. Our risk
              assessment is that roads with the highest risks are the roads where public buses
              ply. This adjustment balances safety concerns with the need to minimise
              inconvenience to commuters," said Mr Yam Ah Mee, Chief Executive, Land
              Transport Authority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4.     Mr Seng Han Thong, Co-Chairman for
              the Working Group and Advisor to the Taxi Operators' Association (TOA), said,
              "We have been very concerned about the issues arising out of the
              implementation of the new ruling and have provided feedback to LTA. Through this
              joint effort, we hope to resolve to a great extent problems that affected the
              drivers. Moving forward, I am confident that we shall work closely to face the
              new challenges of the taxi industry."<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5.     Added Mr Foo Chi Yong, President of
              Premier Taxi Operators' Association, "I am relieved to note that the
              authorities have exercised flexibility in enforcing the new policy during the
              initial period. We hope to receive the support and understanding from the public
              so that they can help us as drivers to adjust to the new ruling."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6.     "We are heartened by LTA's
              receptiveness to industry feedback. The proposed tweaks to the system will help
              ease the problems that our drivers have experienced on the ground. We will
              continue to work closely with the LTA and our associations to monitor the
              situation on the ground," said MrYang Ban Seng, CEO of ComfortDelgro's Taxi
              Business.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7.     Welcoming the revision, Ms Jasmine
              Tan, General Manager, Trans-Cab Services Pte Ltd, added: "Since the
              implementation of the CBD taxi rule on 1 Mar 2008, LTA has continued to take in
              the feedback of commuters and taxi drivers. The revisions would certainly
              benefit drivers and commuters."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8.     Mr Lee Wai Mun, Chief Executive
              Officer of the Automobile Association of Singapore said, "The CBD rule for
              taxis, in placing safety high on the list of priorities, is the correct approach
              to take. AAS is happy that the adjustments, while making it more convenient for
              taxi commuters, retain the need to make our roads safe for the motorists."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">9.     The LTA will continue to install
              more taxi stands and taxi lots on roads in the CBD to increase convenience. We
              will also make the taxi stand signs more prominent and install new directional
              signs to direct passengers to the nearest taxi stands. Maps showing the location
              of taxi stands in the CBD area will be distributed to hotels and commercial
              buildings to make it easier for commuters to locate the nearest taxi stand.
              These maps will also be included in the public transport information guide for
              tourists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">10.     Mr Nah Tua Bah, President of
              Comfort Taxi Operators' Association, said, "As taxi drivers, we are happy
              that the authorities have listened to and considered our feedback and concerns.
              We would give our support and hope to see all the recommendations implemented
              soon for the convenience of our commuters."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">11.     "We believe these changes
              will still meet our objective to ensure safety and improve convenience for
              passengers and motorists. As with all changes, it will require some time for
              adjustment and we seek the understanding of all commuters, businesses, and taxi
              drivers," said Mr Yam.</span></p>
