            <div class='col-md body'><strong>New Taxi Stands In The Central Business District</strong><br><br>1) The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has installed 15 new taxi stands in the Central Business District (CBD) as part of its measures to improve taxi services. This will increase the number of taxi stands/stops in the CBD to 95, so that there will be a taxi stand within 300 metres or a five-minute walk from buildings within the CBD.<br><br>2) The locations of the 15 new taxi stands are as follows:<br><br>- Amoy Street (behind Thian Hock Keng Temple) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 4 taxi lots<br>- Armenian Street (in front ofAsian Civilisation Museum)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 3 taxi lots<br>- Clemenceau Avenue (in front of Haw Par Glass Centre) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 4 taxi lots<br>- Cook Street (behind Murray Terrace Food Alley) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 4 taxi lots<br>- Kreta Ayer Road (in front of Oriental Plaza) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 2 taxi lots<br>- Neil Road (in front of Chinatown Plaza) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 3 taxi lots<br>- Old Parliament Lane (behind Victoria Theatre) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 4 taxi lots<br>- Peck Seah Street (behind Red Dot Traffic) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 3 taxi lots<br>- Penang Road (opposite Regency House) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 3 taxi lots<br>- Purvis Street (outside shop house no. 24) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 2 taxi lots<br>- Sago Lane (outside Buddha Tooth Relic Temple &amp; Museum) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 5 taxi lots<br>- Short Street (near La Salle Arts College) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 1 taxi lot<br>- Stamford Road (SMU School of Economics/Social Sciences) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 2 taxi lots<br>- Tan Tye Place (Clarke Quay) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 5 taxi lots<br>- Waterloo Street (Stamford Arts Centre) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 4 taxi lots<br><br>3) LTA will continue to work with the taxi companies and taxi driver associations to identify more locations within the CBD for taxi stands and to encourage taxi drivers to pick up passengers from taxi stands. With more taxi stands within the CBD, street hail of taxis on roads within the CBD will be disallowed from 1 March 2008. From that date, taxis can only pick up or alight passengers at taxi stands and along private driveways, even when on call booking.</div>

              <h1 class="clr">Taxis in CBD to stop only at taxi stands and building driveways</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: From 1 March, taxi drivers can no longer pick up or drop off
              passengers along public roads in the Central Business District (CBD) on
              weekdays and Saturdays from 7am to 10pm.</p>
              <p>They will only be allowed to stop at taxi stands and driveways of buildings.</p>
              <p>The
              Land Transport Authority (LTA) said this is part of efforts to help
              improve the safety of taxi commuters and road users by reducing traffic
              disruption.</p>
              <p>To make taxi facilities more accessible to commuters,
              LTA added that it has increased the number of taxi stands in the CBD by
              30 per cent, from 80 to 105.</p>
              <p>This means that the distance between
              a taxi stand and any building within the CBD is less than 300 metres
              which translates to a less than five—minute walk.</p>

              <p><strong>From 1 March 2008 Taxis Within The Central Business District (CBD)<br>Can Only Stop At Taxi Stands And Building Driveways</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1     From 1 March 2008, taxi drivers can
              no longer stop to pick up or drop off passengers along all public roads within
              the CBD between 7 am and 10 pm from Monday to Saturday, other than a public
              holiday. They should instead do so at taxi stops, taxi stands and driveways of
              buildings in the CBD.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2     This measure, which was announced by
              LTA in November 2007, will help improve the safety of commuters, taxi drivers
              and other road users as it will reduce the number of taxis driving into bus
              lanes to pick up passengers or indiscriminately stopping along the roads and
              disrupting the flow of traffic. This way, public buses which carry more
              passengers will enjoy a smoother and faster journey.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3     Taxis picking up and dropping off
              passengers at taxi stands will increase the availability of taxis there and
              ensure a fairer allocation of taxis than street hail by preventing passengers
              waiting for taxis along the road to jump queue by going up-traffic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4     To make taxi facilities more
              accessible to commuters, LTA has increased the number of taxi stands within the
              CBD by more than 30%, from 80 to 105. This means that there is now a taxi stand
              or taxi stop within 300 metres or less than a 5-minute walk from any building
              within the CBD. Please refer to Annex A for a list of the 10 additional taxi
              stands installed in February 2008. LTA has also increased the waiting capacity
              at these taxi stands by about 3 times so that more taxis can wait for passengers
              at the taxi stands. To make the taxi stands and taxi stops easily identifiable,
              all the taxi signs in the CBD have been replaced by distinctive  by distinctive taxi signs. In
              addition, the taxi stands will be numbered for easy identification by both
              commuters and taxi drivers. These signs include LTA's advisory against touting
              and overcharging. Please refer to Annex B for a picture of the taxi sign.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5     Taxi drivers who breach the rules
              can be fined $100 and given 3 demerit points under the Vocational Licence Points
              System (VLPS).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6     Mr Yang Ban Seng, CEO of
              ComfortDelGro's Taxi Business, said, "The move to mandate that taxi
              passengers can only be picked up or alighted at taxi stands, taxi stops and
              building driveways in the CBD is a good one and we are supportive of it. In
              fact, we have been working with LTA and our Taxi Association to address
              implementation issues of concern to our taxi drivers, such as providing more
              taxi stands and taxi waiting lots in the CBD, and educating the public to
              minimise misunderstandings between taxi drivers and passengers who may be
              unaware of the new ruling. We hope that commuters will appreciate that our taxi
              drivers cannot now just stop anywhere along the roads on their request, and seek
              their understanding, especially on rainy days". Mr Foo Chi Yong, Chairman
              of Premier Taxi Operators' Association, said, "We are fully supportive of
              LTA's measures to improve taxi services. This measure will enhance the safety of
              commuters and taxi drivers, and at the same time make it easier for taxi
              commuters to get a taxi from a taxi stand. We will encourage our taxi drivers to
              pick up passengers from taxi stands. We would also like to urge commuters to
              cooperate with our taxi drivers".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7     LTA officers will be deployed on the
              ground during the first month to remind taxi drivers not to stop along public
              roads in the CBD. These officers will also help to educate commuters on the new
              rule.</span></p>

              <h1 class="clr">Bumpy ride for new taxi—stand—only rule</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: On the first day of the work week since the change kicked
              in, cabbies and commuters alike did not seem to have bought into the
              new rule that taxis can stop for passengers only at taxi stands and
              building driveways in the Central Business District.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers were seen picking up and dropping off passengers along
              Bras Basah Road at 2pm on Monday, three days after the rule was
              introduced on Saturday. The rule applies every day from 7am to 10pm,
              except on Sundays and public holidays.</p>
              <p>Outside Hitachi Tower, a
              previously popular spot for hailing cabs along Collyer Quay, TODAY
              observed within a span of 15 minutes 10 commuters attempting to flag
              one down along the main road. While some taxis drove by, at least five
              stopped to pick up or allow passengers to alight.</p>
              <p>Since Saturday, Land Transport Authority (LTA) officers have warned at least 92 taxi drivers who violated the new ruling.</p>
              <p>One in two commuters TODAY spoke to said they were not aware of the new rule. Many grumbled about the hassle.</p>
              <p>Secretary
              Jessie Lum, 38, said: "The purpose of taking a taxi is for my
              convenience. Otherwise, I might as well take a train or a bus if I have
              to walk far to reach a taxi stand."</p>
              <p>SMRT taxi driver P S Velan,
              34, said passengers still demanded to alight at their preferred spots.
              "This is especially so on rainy days, where some taxi stands can be
              quite a distance from sheltered areas."</p>
              <p>Another problem is that not all taxi stands allow queues, he said. Some allowed up to only two vehicles at any one time.</p>
              <p>Some
              passengers were furious when told of the new rule. Trans—cab taxi
              driver Tang Kian Cheong, 63, told TODAY in some instances commuters
              threw the money at the cabbies and got out at a traffic light as they
              did not want to alight too far away from their destination.</p>
              <p>"Passengers
              insist on stopping where they choose but, in the end, we taxis drivers
              are the ones who risk being fined. Some quarrel with us, saying they
              pay so much, yet have to walk so far," recounted an annoyed CityCab
              taxi driver, Mr Richard Low, 60.</p>
              <p>But he was concerned about one
              passenger "an old lady with a walking stick" who alighted at a stand
              far from where she wanted to go. Mr Low suggested that the LTA allowed
              taxi commuters to be let off at small lanes with less traffic.</p>
              <p>An
              LTA spokesperson said the rules should be followed even on rainy days
              or other special circumstances for they are "in the interest of the
              passengers’ safety".</p>
              <p>Associate manager David Soh, 51, pointed out that wheelchair—bound passengers might not always be able to access taxi stands.</p>
              <p>Group
              corporate communications officer for ComfortDelGro Corporation Tammy
              Tan said drivers had highlighted several anticipated problems,
              including disagreements with customers about being dropped off at taxi
              stands on rainy days and those who are physically—challenged.</p>
              <p>"We
              are working closely with the LTA and the taxi associations with regard
              to these issues and seek the understanding of passengers with regard to
              the need to board and alight at taxi stands," she said.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers who breach the rules under the new scheme face a $100 fine and three demerit points. — TODAY/so</p>

              <p>Aiyo boyz , this new implementation is very bad for Day-Shift cabbies , not much for Evening shift like us ....</p>
              <p>Anyway .... all i knew , from Quick Pick , David Chong , ALN , Coolkies &amp; myself ... all Evening shift . Non is Day Shift .</p>
              <p>So not really affected la .... up to 10pm nia ....</p>
              <p>For me good ma .... all squeeze into one taxi Q .... then customers saw long Q no taxis .... then call 6552-1111 .</p>
              <p>Good ma , right ?</p>
              <p>I am a call-taker , i just knew the feelings of all my customers , they just hate to Q , not talking about very long Q .</p>
              <p>And all those new taxi stands damn solid , all got "number " like Bus Stop , Like Duxton Road T/S is E66 , when u need a cab , and no cabs available on sight , just call 6552-1111 , and say your exact location : E66 , then the operator will know your exact location . No need describe like fuck .</p>
              <p>Overall comments : Good for me !!!!</p>
              <p>It fits my way of working , less stress and more excuse not to pick street hire .</p>
              <p>if LTA call me , asked : "Why u that day xx-xx-2008 , xxpm , never stop at t/s to pick up so  &amp; so etc ...</p>
              <p>My answer : Aiyo , every taxi stand can only contain 3 taxis or less , i saw that t/s got taxi liao , so i move on to another t/s lor !!! "</p>
              <p>"even if there's more than 20 customers on the Q , still a infringement ma , if base on your demerit points regulations ".</p>
              <p>Street i lagi cannot stop  , i stop to tell them even so , very good service .... tell them to go to nearest t/s to wait for me . <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <h1 class="clr">Phased—in approach to designated taxi stops in the CBD is better</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : A phased—in approach may have been a better option when it
              comes to the recently—imposed rule of taxis being allowed only to stop
              at designated driveways and taxi stands in the CBD area.</p>
              <p>This is according to Advisor to Taxi Operators Associations Seng Han
              Thong who, together with the taxi companies, sent a list of issues
              faced by the cabbies because of this new rule to the Land Transport
              Authority (LTA) just last week.</p>
              <p>During the past few days, there have been long queues at taxi stands despite the pouring rain.</p>
              <p>But
              despite a growing chorus of complaints from passengers and taxi
              drivers, an LTA ruling on taxi pick—ups and drop—offs only at
              designated stands and driveways remains for the moment.</p>
              <p>"We know
              we have to obey the regulations, but then it would be inconvenient for
              the person who is taking the taxi," said one commuter.</p>
              <p>"I cannot
              book a taxi like before and they can come and pick me up at the hotel.
              Now I have to carry my luggage to the taxi stand," said another.</p>
              <p>One
              main reason the LTA has given for the new rule is safety — that taxi
              drivers do not stop suddenly along a busy road, especially with so many
              new bus lanes now.</p>
              <p>Foo Chi Yong, President, Premier Taxi
              Operators’ Association, said: "When we have a passenger on board, they
              keep on telling us why the private car is allowed to drop off family
              members — why are you not allowed? You are a taxi driver, you should be
              able to — why are you so special you have to stop at a designated taxi
              stand?"</p>
              <p>Mr Seng said the taxi companies have formed a Working Group with representatives from LTA to look at the issues.</p>
              <p>He
              feels a phased approach rather than a Big Bang approach would have been
              better, especially since such a large group of people are involved.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Seng said: "First it’s the taxi drivers, second, it’s the commuters —
              and you have the local and foreign commuters. You have the providers,
              the buildings, the hotels, which must provide taxi stands and many do
              not have this in—built structure."</p>
              <p>Public communication, he added, also needs to be enhanced.</p>
              <p>Many still do not know what the new ruling is or even where the taxi stands are.</p>
              <p>And
              while the authorities are looking at building more stands, Mr Seng has
              called for more flexibility for taxi drivers as long as they do not
              compromise safety.</p>
              <p>With the recent litany of complaints, which
              has also gone online, it remains to be seen just how far the LTA will
              bend to accommodate these grouses, and improve a scheme which may have
              started off with good intentions, but has ended up resulting in a whole
              new set of unnecessary problems for the very groups of people it was
              intended to help. — CNA/ch</p>

              <h1 class="clr">LTA finetunes rules for taxis in CBD</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has fine—tuned the rules for taxis in the central business district (CBD).</p>
              <p>Starting from Monday, taxis will be allowed to pick up and drop off passengers on side roads of the CBD where buses do not ply.</p>
              <p>Along
              roads that have buses plying, taxis can only pick up and drop off
              passengers at taxi stands or on driveways of buildings between 7am and
              10pm.</p>
              <p>LTA said cabbies have up till 1 May to adjust to the revised rules, after which they will be fined.</p>
              <p>According
              to LTA, it will continue to install more taxi stands on roads in the
              CBD. It will also make taxi stand signs more prominent and install new
              signs to direct passengers to the nearest taxi stand.</p>
              <p>The adjustments are made after receiving feedback from cabbies and commuters over the past two weeks. — CNA/ac</p>
