            <div class='col-md body'><p>Driving at 70/h is not considered slow for a p-plate liao. Often I see p-plate drivers driving even slower than that.<br><br>I understand from your situation why you are so tulan about it. Last time when I was p-plate also kenna my lane cut until song song by alot of drivers cos they "look down" on us. Somemore if (touch wood*) really accident, this incident may either become a terror for your gf whom will be afraid to drive on the road in future.<br><br>But generally, not just merc cab drivers are this arrogant. Merc drivers are damn arrogant too and think they own the road. But this applies to majority but not all I should say. Taxi drivers too, I've seen some taxi drivers who are road courteous which is why they attain awards.<br><br>For your case, I will agree with you on making a complain to the taxi company. Such drivers are a bad example to the taxi industry.<br><br>One thing to note is, u throw the litted cigarette at him which could get you into trouble as it's a form of physical contact which in the eyes of the law, both parties are wrong if there's pushing around no matter who started it. Hope you not so angry le la as I feel that the car is ok, your gf and your life is safe but just take it this is a bad experience.<br><br>Just give your feedback to the taxi company, hope that they will resolve this problem for you. By the way, the very last time I called before during an accident, the police tells me no need to call them unless there's injury in the accident and alot of other factors included. You may wish to call them to check just in case.<br><br>I really do hate this kind of fucking drivers too!<br><br>Regards,<br>AxelC</p></div>

              <p>yah agree, merc drivers, whether taxi or private, tend to drive more aggressively, generally. of course there are good ones too, but not many. a reminder...on jalan bukit merah turning left into CTE, (means u just passed kim tian road on the left?) 70kmh is way too fast, even for experienced drivers. can't recall exactly but i think speed limit's 50kmh. but actual speed should be even lower since you'll be going into a filter lane joining main traffic. do ask yr gf to be careful, esp p plate the first 12 months must very very careful not to pickup any demerit points. dun speed cos uncle and his cameras are everywhere nowadays. not worth losing the licence just to gain a few more minutes. anyway as axel says, just feedback to the taxi coy.</p>
              <p>btw, u mentioned "+/- 200m into turning into CTE". means the passenger is flagging taxis in the CTE itself? or issit just after the traffic lights at kim tian/jln bkt merah junction? if it is the former, yr complaint sure jalan one, if the latter...just remember to drive defensively and be prepared to stop.</p>
              <p>poolie wants to go merc too. hope he's not a black sheep.</p>

              <p>That is why you must be very alert.. Cab drivers dont care which company is the same. They will just cut infront of you to pick up passengers. They dont care for others. They only care for themselves. Too bad la... Complain no use de lah... The company dont care de... because these uncles borrow their cab at 100+ per cab per day... you think the company would go do something about this meh?</p>

              Such incidents are played out on the roads here everyday. While i am not siding with the merc driver, i've grown weary of these hazards and accept the fact that such antics are impossible to eradicate, whether they are cabbies or private cars.
              
              Sometimes all it needs is a little bit of grace and understanding from both parties. I don't think it takes alot to wind down your window and wave a hand up by means of apology.

              <p>clap clap clap. so true but yet seems almost impossible for sg drivers to adopt this attitude. i ALWAYS wave to express my thanks when somebody gives way to me and raise my hand in apology when i have to cut into someone else's lane even when i signal way in advance. sadly, most times the gestures are not reciprocated. at most i think 3 in 10 sg drivers do so. sigh. many drivers will sound their horns, sometimes continuously when u signal to switch lanes. "get out of my way" seems to be the norm.</p>

              <p>yah agree, merc drivers, whether taxi or private, tend to drive more aggressively, generally. of course there are good ones too, but not many. a reminder...on jalan bukit merah turning left into CTE, (means u just passed kim tian road on the left?) 70kmh is way too fast, even for experienced drivers. can't recall exactly but i think speed limit's 50kmh. but actual speed should be even lower since you'll be going into a filter lane joining main traffic. do ask yr gf to be careful, esp p plate the first 12 months must very very careful not to pickup any demerit points. dun speed cos uncle and his cameras are everywhere nowadays. not worth losing the licence just to gain a few more minutes. anyway as axel says, just feedback to the taxi coy.</p>
              <p>btw, u mentioned "+/- 200m into turning into CTE". means the passenger is flagging taxis in the CTE itself? or issit just after the traffic lights at kim tian/jln bkt merah junction? if it is the former, yr complaint sure jalan one, if the latter...just remember to drive defensively and be prepared to stop.</p>
              <p>poolie wants to go merc too. hope he's not a black sheep.</p>

              <p>graciousness and courtesyare generally not well presented by singaporeans. perhaps we have not evolve to show selflessness. take for example, the h1ni flu person who took cabs and mrt. he knows he has the virus so he booked into a hotel because he doesn't want to infect his family but he shown selfishness by taking public transport, 'other people can die but not him or his family'.</p>
              <p>out of 10 ang mos I took as passengers, 8 would express grace and would say please and thank you.</p>
              <p>out of 10 locals I am afraid there would only be 2 good enough to do so.</p>
