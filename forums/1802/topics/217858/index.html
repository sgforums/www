            <div class='col-md body'>Was having late dinner at Lao Pa Sat the other day... When about to take cab and go home, was thinking about the TV programme which mentioned about how Taxi drivers put 'ON CALL' on their own cabs or hide in one corner to wait for midnight charge... IN FACT, we LONG KNEW that the hawker centre is infamous for that BEFORE the TV even talked about it... And how the TAXI COMPANIES mentioned they would 'take action'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  against those taxi drivers...<br><br>And RIGHT... The SAME THING'S STILL HAPPENING... AFTER MONTHS... GREAT....<br><br>And the EVEN BETTER NEWS..?? WE TOOK BUSES HOME INSTEAD! SO MUCH FOR THE TAXI FARE!  &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">&gt;</div>

And got onto this cab where the driver doesn't know how to get there...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  I was like telling the others we should just get off the cab and fetch another one instead... BUT... Being a NICE guy he was... He actually allowed the cab to move away from the taxi stand.. PARKED and started to look into his directory...<br><br>After a while.. The driver told us he think he knows where it is... Comes to the cross-junction, where I pointed to him the place we're interested to go... He SAID OK. End up bring us along the road and EXIST to HIGHWAY.. He can actually tell us that that's the CORRECT ROUTE but he didn't know it's a HIGHWAY ahead... When I questioned him how come he didn't know when he was looking at the road directory.. His answer was "It's not stated on the ROAD DIRECTORY"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>ONE BIG TURN.... BACK to the SAME JUNCTION... I POINTED to him AGAIN the PLACE we wanted to go... He WENT into the OPPOSITE DIRECTION and TOLD US... Let's see if we can find the place you're looking for at the OTHER side.... A whole stretch up... Turned into an unrelated area... STOPPED. LOOKED at DIRDCTORY AGAIN.....<br><br>THEN 3RD TIME... BACK at the SAME JUNCTION... Went to the LAST OPTION. Then brought us where we wanna go... $9plus close to $10 for such a short journey... Not to mention WASTE of our time...<br><br>When one of us asked him like that how much... He still have the GUTS to say "Pay by the METER". [b]IDIOT</strong>. Then we looked at him and told him off because he OBVIOUSLY ANYHOW BROUGHT US AROUND. Then he said "Petrol expensive nowadays".<br><br>I think if he find living so difficult nowadays, the least he could have done is to be HONEST and secure his RICE BOWL. BE GLAD that we had a gentleman (not me) on the cab. If it was ME, I would have ALREADY CALLED HIS COMPANY TO COMPLAIN....[/b]</blockquote>i think i wld beri tu lan lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
