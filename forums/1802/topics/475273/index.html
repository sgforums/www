              <p>Maybe, just maybe..</p>
              <p>Since most of the older taxis are fully paid, they can take back half of the old taxis and employ driver based on incentives or commission based salary..with a minimum sum of basic salary say $500 to $600</p>
              <p>But drivers need to hit a certain amount say example S$30 and the rest shall be 50/50 among the driver and company.. just an example only..</p>

              <p>My point is if more and more TDs are kuai lan and the companies can't tahan anymore with the complains, or worst still LTA decided to change (step by step) and force the taxi companies to do it... Think?</p>

              <p>Agreed with you under employment no motivation. That's why I said (maybe) on commission basis after a minimum target hit.</p>
              <p>Not really looking at FTs or oldies TDs up the lorry.</p>
              <p>Just wondering if the complains and negative feedback from the public get to a point that LTA can't take it, would they "enforce" this?</p>
              <p>Most of the times after my shift, I tends to rest at coffeeshop before going back and will see a group of TDs tcss. But tends to hear them saying how they fark the passengers up lah or how they handle paxs. I'm not saying that they are totally at fault and perhaps they really sway and always met those fark up type of paxs.</p>
              <p>Only just wondering how long can LTA tahan with the complaints?</p>

              <p>Right now, they give you freedom and do not want to restrict your money making method. But somehow some ppl can't control and think they are above everything else because they tot they are good or the relevant authority can't do anything.</p>
              <p>Why can't these ppl have self control before the freedom being taken away?</p>
              <p>Just 1 good example, property agents? In the past, anybody can also do, and now leh... a lot of old timers gave up because they can't pass the test..</p>
              <p>And do anyone know why CEA was set up? The answer can be very similar to this trade.</p>

              <p>Do you tknow hat they can just use many reasons to create employment for TD with foreigner participation and even the public will support them.</p>
              <p>Bo taxis, call and call also dun hv, 500 taxis reject pax, or even much more, cos some never reported..wait for 1 hr also no taxis, rainy also no taxis, before peak, also no taxis?? I believe you and me would had seen such comments posted and spread on our most of the papers and social media.</p>
              <p>And if taxi companies want to further it, they themselve can add salt and pepper to deeper the wound so as to get employment and foreigners into Taxi trade.</p>
              <p>And do you think they are not pushing for it under close door meeting? However, luckily LTA is holding them back due to the backdrop of politics, if taxi trade is to open up to employement that indirectly attract PRs and foreigners like bees, 2016 is going to be a difficult year of the MIW hor. There are 100 thousands over locals holding TDVL, +family members, 1/2 million vote can be gone</p>

              <p>What's the motivation for ppl to become TDs?</p>
              <p>1. Own boss, no need to see boss face to work.</p>
              <p>2. Flexible working timings.  You and you alone decide when you want to work.</p>
              <p>3. The harder you work, the more you earn.</p>
              <p>4. Take breaks as and when you like without any Cheng Hoo.</p>
              <p>5. Taxi like own car, can be used to run own errands and fetch family members.</p>
              <p>What's the motivation for taxi companies to just rent out taxis?</p>
              <p>1. No human resource issues. Imagine employing 20,000 TDs.  Got leave issues, MC issues, resignation issues, recruitment issues, fighting issues, TD idle issues, productivity issues, personal problem issues.  The HR dept must be super big to handle all these issues. Additonal operations and staff costs.</p>
              <p>2. Revenue collection.  Now just collect rent thru' Giro.  Everyday deduct on the dot.  No pay, lock MDT. TD got drive anot oso dun care.  With TD as employees, got to handle cash everyday from 20,000 TDs. Got to reconcile cash collection with number of trips.  Got to deal with cheating cases by TDs.  Finance dept must be super big to handle all these cash. Got to do audit every month.  Additional operations and staff costs. 24 hrs a day, 365 days a year.</p>
              <p>3. Additional revenue from selling fuel. Taxi Companies earn millions every year selling diesel to TDs.  This income stream will be lost if TDs are employees.</p>
              <p>4. Any complaint now, just interview TD.  Not happy, pok TD.  If TD employee, not so easy to pok.  Can complain to MOM, Union, MP etc.  More headache.</p>
              <p>5.  $30million of TDs deposit sitting in the bank earning interest nicely.</p>
              <p>So you think leh?</p>
