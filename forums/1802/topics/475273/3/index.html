              <p>Since most of the older taxis are fully paid, they can take back
              half of the old taxis and employ driver based on incentives or
              commission based salary..with a minimum sum of basic salary say
              $500 to $600</p>
              <p>But drivers need to hit a certain amount say example S$30 and
              the rest shall be 50/50 among the driver and company.. just an
              example only..</p>

              <p>Well said.. It's not impossible for them to open up for PRS or FTs in this trade.</p>
              <p>Min requirement for TDs is to have O level and a clean and valid lic. Now, can I say that if they are hardworking, TDs should have a reasonable amount of earnings for a O level education.</p>
              <p>What TDs can do is how to protect and make it impossible for them to consider having to get PRs and FTs to get into this "protected" trade meant for citizens. Bearing in mind not only for us but future generations...</p>
              <p>Understand that some may say Tds is not a respectable jobs lah.. I don't want my next generation to becum a TD lah an so on. But still, it's the only trade meant for citizens leh. How many graudates out there can't get jobs because of FTs???</p>
              <p>Respect is to be earned not given. Just that some "bad apples" spoilt the market and gave TDs bad image. Of course, there are also bad paxs ard lah.</p>
              <p>Then the key questions is how many of these "bad apples" think in this manner and help to protect the only trade meant for citizens?</p>

              <p>Er.. I think it's govt or LTA who said that TD must be a citizen leh (even for FTs who convert to citizen).. and that for me, I appreciated this rule.. I'm only a part timer as a TD and to be frank, I kind of enjoyed doing it as I learned and see a lot during these period while OTR.</p>
              <p>I believed most of us if not all TDs knew the advantages as well those troublesome paxs.. Then the thing is that why some TDs put sand in all the Tds rice bowl with their silly antics.</p>
              <p>And in time to come, govt or LTA might said: Ok, enough is enough.. We protect this trade and reserved the jobs for citizens and yet they do all the silly things that damaged not only tds but our image as well. Open this trade up by 10%, take the FTs and see how it goes.. Then Tds kpkb liao lor..</p>
              <p>IMHO, TD can be a respected professional trade (for some individuals, it already is one) if all behave what they ought to behave or do and while gaining the publics recognition through honesty, maybe (just maybe) the paxs in turn might not grumble abt the fare adjustment that the Tds deserved.</p>
              <p>In all, it's not abt whether PRs or FTs coming into this trade. It's abt the exsisting TDs doing their job in a manner that prevent or stop them from coming in.</p>

              <p>The structure of engage singaporean is going to change come early next year. As 2016 election loom nearer, employers still do not hv the mindset change to engage singaporean first, the govt, given no choice, have to come out of new regulation to whip them hard.</p>
              <p>1. Employers must first shown prove that they engaged singaporean first before approval is given to employ foreigners</p>
              <p>2. Employers will be directed to a job bank whereby all Singaporeans looking for jobs or jobless, their datas including experiences, qualification so on are captured. Employers must use the job bank first.</p>
              <p>3. Across all sectors of the industries, the FDR, foreign depending ration will be reduce, from 1 : 3 to 1:2 for certain industries and so on.</p>
              <p>4. All salary range for Singaporean must be inline with market value condition, Employers must also produce a structured career and progressive path for all their employees, especially so for locals.</p>
              <p>All these and more will be put into a LAWs.</p>
              <p>So, when everytime I told you all to look into the future, this is what i meant, what transpired here for our TD trade is therefore critical for discussion base on these changes. My prediction against these backdrop of new regulations (laws) are</p>
              <p>a. Many TD, especially youngers one will return back to workforce, as working conditon and salary improved with a more Singaporean First focus, at the same time, people will be make know about their progression and career setting.</p>
              <p>b. With that in mind, taxi driving will face a further challenge in recruiting new hirers, and with less hirers..but more relief (partimer), taxi companies will hv to raise rental to cover cost which at the end of the day, fares will further go up.</p>
              <p>c. And that is also one of the reason why LTA is pushing for more time on the road for taxi driver</p>

              <p>The structure of engage singaporean is going to change come
                          early next year. As 2016 election loom nearer, employers still do
                          not hv the mindset change to engage singaporean first, the govt,
                          given no choice, have to come out of new regulation to whip them
                          hard.</p>
              <p>1. Employers must first shown prove that they engaged
                          singaporean first before approval is given to employ foreigners</p>
              <p>2. Employers will be directed to a job bank whereby all
                          Singaporeans looking for jobs or jobless, their datas including
                          experiences, qualification so on are captured. Employers must use
                          the job bank first.</p>
              <p>3. Across all sectors of the industries, the FDR, foreign
                          depending ration will be reduce, from 1 : 3 to 1:2 for certain
                          industries and so on.</p>
              <p>4. All salary range for Singaporean must be inline with
                          market value condition, Employers must also produce a structured
                          career and progressive path for all their employees, especially so
                          for locals.</p>
              <p>All these and more will be put into a LAWs.</p>
              <p>So, when everytime I told you all to look into the future, this
                          is what i meant, what transpired here for our TD trade is therefore
                          critical for discussion base on these changes. My prediction
                          against these backdrop of new regulations (laws) are</p>
              <p>a. Many TD, especially youngers one will return back to
                          workforce, as working conditon and salary improved with a more
                          Singaporean First focus, at the same time, people will be make know
                          about their progression and career setting.</p>
              <p>b. With that in mind, taxi driving will face a further challenge
                          in recruiting new hirers, and with less hirers..but more relief
                          (partimer), taxi companies will hv to raise rental to cover cost
                          which at the end of the day, fares will further go up.</p>
              <p>c. And that is also one of the reason why LTA is pushing for
                          more time on the road for taxi driver</p>
              </div>

              <p>1. Once you are used to being a TD for a few years, very hard to go back and work for other people again. Why should you suddenly get a huge salary increment in a new job when you have lost that few years of relevant job experience? </p>
              <p>2. When less hirers rent taxis, the rental should reduce, not increase. Basic law of Supply and Demand.  Taxi Companies if raise rental, lagi less hirers, lagi worse. If your theory is true, then if there are more hirers, rental should reduce wat since taxi companies can cover cost.  Why Taxi Companies can suka suka raise rental now? Because the hirer queue for taxi is sibeh long...</p>
              <p>3. LTA pushing for more time OTR got nothing to do with hiring Singaporeans first.  It is to ensure that taxis are available to meet demand without having to add more surcharges in order to encourage TDs to drive more.</p>

              <p>First and foremost, there lies the option, the way or the opening for options, therefore a young chap can now choose to go back to the workforce with a progressive career model or stay on and rot as a taxi hirer. Moreover, they can still come back as weekend reliefs, which is what I meant by more reliefs than hirers in near futures.</p>
              <p>Secondly, lesser young locals, unlike now, will come into taxis trade, coupled with more buses (also more bus accidents lols) and more MRT lines in the coming years, taxis fares will go up with a reduction in number of taxis and lesser hirers. Like HK having 18000 cab serving 1.1millions trip per day. Singapore 27,000++ cabs serving less than 1 million trip per day.  Fare wise, we abit higher. But on the hindsight, HK drivers got more pax than us.</p>
              <p>The diminishing of locals and reluctant to put more time on the road can only end up with one solution, foreign invasion of taxi trade.</p>

              LKY birthday can leave it to you. Perhaps you are the best person to attend....
              
              What is the public general opinion on TDs nowadays?
