              <p>Peak hour period , to go a few destinations , 3 places we called it , will be less profitable than separate short distance .</p>
              <p>The longer the journey , the more time is wasted .</p>
              <p>I also explain to my friends , meter jump by $0.20 .</p>
              <p>By every new trip u pressed , it's $4.05 .</p>
              <p>Have u got any idea , how many $0.20 to make up $4.05 ???</p>
              <p>Conclusion is , my style : Short or medium distance is better than long distance during peak hours .</p>

              <p>Why i didn't like long distance , night shift long distance means to far away location like Wlands , Yishun , Senbawang , Pasir Ris etc ... which i base my location in town .</p>
              <p>Cos u'll take a longer time to come back into town .</p>
              <p>My style : 10pm , i try no to go far away ulu places . Most likely , only place is active , is in town , near town better .</p>

              <p>Now the interesting one ... this one u must learn , nobody can train you , it's all about memorising .</p>
              <p>U can create next connections if u know what time what place got lobang ...</p>
              <p>eg ....Alvin , he's at Yishun .</p>
              <p>Normally he could've hit town next , but he got the time right , instead of hitting town town , he proceeded to AMK ST 65 , he likely to have good chance to connect one to anywhere , no time wasting . He did .</p>
              <p>Like me , i knew 11.05pm , Bt Batok Driving Centre got 100% chance to connect , if i am nearby , instead of charging into town for next pax , i'll go there .</p>

Now really waste of time running diesel without pax, can be like an hour no mean no. we got to bear it. so money is not enough...Jack Neo movie is correct.</p></div>

              i suppose nite shift quite different from day.... 
              
              nite shift 5 to 8pm jam and hard to get pax except town.... 
              
              8pm to 12am, usually connection not bad.... 
              
              after 12am it is usually one way empty to town... but cos at night less car, u can zoom to town very fast...20mins max from furthest point to town
              
              y i think nite different from day? cos sat 6 to 8am.... i am quite shocked to see many empty cabs in HDB these 2 months.... even when no surcharge.... seems more than Fri 5pm to 8pm!.... i think it is the increase in supply... more became cabbies!

              <p>Just spent 3 days in Singapore. Looks like the economic troubles are finally hitting hard. Recessionary times indeed.</p>
              <p>Government appears to be struggling to keep the place in good shape.
              They are taking actions, ofcourse. Dipping into a country’s reserves
              can be the most serious action a nation could possibly take, and
              Singapore is taking that drastic action. Do I agree ? No. But I am
              currently not living in Singapore, so my direct ability to comment is
              significantly reduced.</p>
              <p>I saw in the Friday newspapers (20th Feb) that public transportation
              costs are being cut by an average 4.6%. Not a big drop, but Singapore
              always believes in small, incremental, non-damaging steps. I asked
              myself, what about the ridiculous taxi fares in these difficult times ?</p>
              <p>I saw firsthand the impact of the economic problems on the roads and
              in the shopping mall across from my hotel. It was always a difficult
              proposition to get a taxi in Singapore, though per capita taxi
              population could be one of the highest in the world. Now, I saw plenty
              of taxis available on the road, with the green lights on. There were
              few takers, though.</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>
              <p>Taxis are expensive in Singapore. For a distance of less than 7 Kms,
              I had to pay S$ 11.60 which included a 35% peak surcharge at 7:40 AM !
              First, I do not agree that 7:40 AM is “peak traffic” time. Secondly, I
              do not agree with the surcharge. It looked like the “congestion levy”
              charged by the airlines in India. Why should an average passenger
              suffer because there is congestion or peak traffic on the roads ? In
              any case, the meter runs and charges a high fare, despite the oil price
              cuts.</p>
              <p>Not only that, I got into a Hyundai Taxi in front of my hotel
              yesterday. And the minimum fare showed as S$ 3.00, instead of the usual
              S$ 2.80. I did not like it, and asked the driver why ? And, in the
              usual sarcastic tone so charateristic of Singapore Taxi Drivers, he
              responded saying, “hey, look at the seats, these are real leather,
              further see there is no engine sound, you get a smooth solid noiseless
              ride”, thinking probably in his mind, these folks do not enjoy such
              rides in their respective countries and they complain when they come
              here ! I was surprised when he further said that it is the reason why
              the fare is slightly higher, so in fact, the fare was higher than the
              previous two days. I paid S$ 12.95 instead of the S$ 11.60 I had paid
              previously.</p>
              <p>Just ridiculous, to say the least ! Hotels colluding with taxis to
              charge their guests a higher taxi fare, without proper notice being
              displayed that the victims will be paying a higher fare. Not acceptable
              in a “clean” city like Singapore.</p>
              <p>The other day, when I pointed out to the lady taxi driver that
              Singapore’s taxi fares are on the higher side, she got angry ! She
              said, “No, the fares are not high, infact the fare should be higher !”.
              She kept shaking her head vigorously, thinking probably, these
              passengers are useless……</p>
              <p>Well, there is no choice folks : fares will need to be cut, and you
              all would see that soon enough. Otherwise taxi users will drop hugely,
              leading to retrenchment of drivers by Income and Tibs and other
              operators. That is my considered opinion. Plus, do not levy these
              surcharges or penalties on taxi users – these are not right economic
              tools. People will desist from using your mode of transport despite
              need. And that would be the start of the “depression”.</p>
              <p>Hope the right sense gets to their collective heads !</p>
              <p>Have a wonderful week ahead,</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>y i think nite different from day? cos sat 6 to 8am…. i am quite
                                          shocked to see many empty cabs in <span>HDB</span> these 2
                                          months…. even when no surcharge…. seems more than Fri 5pm to
                                          8pm!.... i think it is the increase in supply… more became
                                          cabbies!</p>
              <p>Just imagine, nowaday Q Q Q is the only solution for day shift at shopping centres, hospitals, hotels, etc, more taxis reluctant to do rounding. </p>
              <p>Like at 3pm  three mumbai paxs need to go to Tanjong Pagar GE building. ..their criteria from OCBC building, need to wait  them  for one hour going up to the building for a meeting... and with their 3 luggages in my rear boot, after their meeting straight to T1 kept the meter running.  What to do Ok lah inside CBD lan lan do it. You may said knn yao gui but just nice this time  slot already booked by them after that airport top-up at loyang than back to base. This is just like gamble... nowaday, taxi driving.  Than we will see how many more became cabbies share this piece of cake.</p>
