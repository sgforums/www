              Ironically, in a full employment city like Singapore whereby the demand for labours and workforce is high, the pay is still pathetically, low. 
              
              That could be due to the availability and supply of cheap Foreigners which had depressed our wages. 
              
              I fully agree that pay structure for locals are far too low against high inflation, and especially so, in a first world developed country which Singapore is one of them.
              
              We have unconciously pushed into the lower rung of the society and struggled everyday to survive a high cost first world city here.
              
              With this background, the best option is therefore be a blogger

              <p>@luckycabby you start by asking what are your love and passion. Which part of your body is more good at things - eg can you count well, argue well, skillfull hands, do u prefer sitting down or running around, do u love cooking, are u a patient person, are afraid of heights, scared of dead bodies, etc</p>
              <p>Then ask what are your fears, what you hate doing. From there ask yourself how can you make yourself useful and collect money from customers. Ask yourself if you are willing to start off with a pay cut in order to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills. Its a small step by step process. Start to think and ask yourself many questions. The income will not b steady at first. With time and great skill that you acquire over the years, it becomes predictable and less worrying.</p>

              Frankly, the best way of driving taxis is be relief, partime relief or weekend relief and hold a permanent job on weekdays, however, these will take up lots of yr time.
              
              If you are a full timer, in yr 30s, you still got a chance to move out of it and be a partimer, get a job, built a career, by mid 40s, you might get promoted to supervisor or leader, then give up driving if you do not need money urgently and wanted to spent more time with family.
              
              But if you have drive taxis from 30s into your 40s, it is better to stick to it, not only there are less employment opportunity, you also might not get use to working life anymore. So, it will be wiser to carry on driving and hv passion in it. But of course, if you get a very good opportunities, you can go back to working, as for Taxi driving, you can come back anytime.
              
              For those who have drive into your 50s, the food is already cook, like it or not, you are place under... confirm taxi driver.com.sg
              
              And for those who have drive into their 60s.....cabinet crews, prepare for take off

              <p>Thanks bro, for all the inputs. Think better stick to it or if cannot drive anymore, better think of other self employed opp. Agreed that going back to getting a job is tough, expecially for ah laus.</p>
              <p>One ex ah lau TD (he got a blog somewhere, can't remember) got involved in MLM and quit driving. Few can do it but he showed that it can be done leh.</p>
