              <p>SINGAPORE: Local bus and train operator SBS Transit 
              posted a 27.8 per cent rise in 2014 net profit, helped by higher 
              ridership and fares.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit, Singapore's largest bus 
              operator, said on Tuesday (10 Feb) it earned S$14.3 million in 2014, up 
              from S$11.2 million in 2013, as revenue climbed 12.2 per cent to S$951 
              million.</p>
              <p>Revenue from the bus segment rose 10.5 per cent to S$754 
              million, while revenue from the rail segment gained 19.5 per cent to 
              S$197 million, boosted by the full year operation of the Downtown Line 
              which raised ridership.</p>
              <p>Average daily ridership on SBS buses increased by 3.2 per cent to 2.8 million passenger trips for 2014.</p>
              <p>Looking ahead, SBS Transit said revenue is expected to be higher with higher ridership and higher average fare, <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/from-april-a-2-8-hike-in/1605426.html">citing the overall fare adjustment of 2.8 per cent</a> approved by the Public Transport Council for bus and train fares that will take effect from Apr 5.</p>
              <p>However,
               it added the outlook for bus and rail segments will continue to be 
              challenging. "With headcount increases mainly from the build-up for Bus 
              Service Enhancement Programme, Downtown Line 2 and salary adjustments, 
              staff costs are expected to be higher. The continued renewal and 
              expansion of the bus fleet is expected to result in higher depreciation 
              and financing costs," it said.</p>
              <p>SBS said its bus segment managed a 
              14.9 per cent rise in operating profit to S$12.3 million last year, 
              helped by increases in average daily ridership and average fare, higher 
              rental from shop renewals, increased advertising sales and other 
              operating income.</p>
              <p>But on its own, the core bus operation continued to suffer losses amounting to S$13.5 million in 2014.</p>

              For taxi fare to hike, it only takes less hirers or current hirers throw keys or remotes (for those using keyless start and entry).
              
              Just like bus drivers' paid, once no one want to drive, cannot get drivers, drivers go on strike, you see their paid went up tremedously so as to attract driver and also satisfy their needs.
              
              As for cab drivers, the current situation shown a very vibrant business for taxi companies, call apps and centres, road hv more taxis than the usual. 
              
              Companies, especially oil companies are taking these period of low oil prices to cut peoples, it is not that they are not earning, but they use this times as an excuse to cut employees, mostly those jia liao Bee local employees

              <p>CDG just announced improved earnings from taxi biz - from more hirers, higher renewed rentals and call bookings.</p>
              <p>Si peh ho dan. With more PMETs losing their jobs, many will become TDs.With more old taxis replaced by newer ones, higher rental for taxi companies.</p>
              <p>Good for taxi companies, may not be good for us.</p>
              <p>Our only hope is .....6.9m, may 10m population coming soon.</p>

              CDG like all other taxi companies is make to make profit year by year, if this year they make 100 millions net, next year they will budget 120millions and so on, same goes to all other taxi companies. 
              
              And for the biz to keep going up..what is the best solution beside getting more hirers?

              <p>10 cts, 20cts or 70cts one off flag down (not flat down arh) fare increase is ok to most ppl.  But, to increase the tariff from $0.22 to $0.3 is like peak hr 25% surcharge. So someone who used to take taxi during off peak and cost $8.70 will suddenly find that the new fare is higher by $2. </p>
              <p>You try to increase flag down fare to $5.90, see what happens?</p>
              <p>Anyway, who knows? But, I really hope that you are right and I am wrong.</p>

              <p>Peak hr ( morning school time, work time) and new fare, no difference in total fare. They still take. Sat/Sun, they still take cos they usually go to other places on weekends and not their usual work place where they usually take bus/MRT. It is the time from 9.30am to 6pm on weekdays that will suffer most. Otherwise, why is it called non peak in the first place? Non peak means boh lang or boh simi lang take taxi right? Increase fare lagi cham right?</p>

              Taxi drivers owning a car is very common lah, all tua tua tan tan huat huat. I will put it as, not car owner turn taxi driver, but rich car owners drive taxi to pass time. Driving a car after sometime, not shiok, nothing to see and talk, but taxi driving is different, very colorful, many farkers, chio bu, ah pui, ah san and weird peoples to see mah. More adventurous.
              
              If you look at the pass history of taxi fares adjustment, the initial few weeks will be quite silent. And that is good for those more able to pay regular paxs, to them, peak period more easy to get a cab. But after a month or so, it is back to normal.
              
              Increase of taxi fare come in 2 kinds. 
              
              1. Fare increased due to High COE of purchasing cab, pax hv to absorb that increment, nothing to gain for Taxi driver, as they also paid higher rental.
              
              2. Fare increased due to standard of living and the needs of taxi driver to higher their income inorder to compete with manpower shortage by attraction.
              
              In the case of nos 1, nobody gain except the government (high COE to bid the cab), the loser is the pax. Driver got nothing to gain. And it is happening now. This is not consider as income rises for TD
              
              In the case of nos 2, this is to match the market condition wages, TDs must be able to make enough to match the cost of living and at the same time, bring up family and saving.  The income range for TD must move up as wages and inflation moved up. And because fare increases had alway been linked to high COE of cab and high rental prices, TD got nothing to gain, in another word, Zero increment.
              
              If you work in a companies, your wages would had gone up years after years to curb or be inline with inflation (cost of living), if one find his paid is unable to cope up with the cost of living, then it is like working for nothing.
              
              So, same goes to TD, we must advocate for a fare increment that justify our work, the economy and the high cost of living in Singapore. This should be how we argue with Govt, if still no fares increase...then election, you guys know what to do.
