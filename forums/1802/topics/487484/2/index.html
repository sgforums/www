              <p>what kind of question is this? You think cabby making alot? You think driving a taxi very shiok? They deserve every cent of their fare. I hope the meter goes up and not down. Some taxi uncle's wives and daughters work in shenton way. Reducing the fare means end up claiming less money from company you know?</p>

              <p>Bus fares finally coming down - an expected, whopping 1%. Thats because bus companies can save from cheaper oil.</p>
              <p>Taxis is different, the taxi companies don't benefit from falling oil price, only TDs net takings improve a bit but not enough to cut fares. Or maybe CDG does? They buy cheap cheap but sell to us not so cheap.</p>

              <p>Taxi fares will never come down because rental will only go up &amp; never come down. Law of Inflation. The increase from 22 cents to 30 cents practically is a 30% increase. This is meant to offset the 25% peak hours.</p>
              <p>Morning shift drivers benefit more. Night shift drivers no difference. OMO drivers off peak hours more benefit. White taxis if no increase OBK because lugi 25% unless CDG increase to 33 cents. But 33 cents will place the whites in the same league as the black become showroom cars at airport queue.</p>
              <p>Crude oil come down only diesel come down as a incentive the win the drivers hearts. KPI of CDG must go up. Anyway CDG diesel is not the kind of diesel you get at outside kiosks. It is meant for SBS buses use. Comfort Taxi &amp; SBS under big umbrella of Comfort Delgro Group.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.8999996185303px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">For adult commuters, this translates to an increase of between two and five cents per trip, depending on the distance travelled. Student concessionary fares will also increase by one cent.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.8999996185303px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">Despite the hike, more than 1.1 million commuters will not see any changes in their fares. Senior citizen fares will remain the same, as will prices for existing travel concessions passes including student monthly concessions and the $120 adult monthly travel card.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: 0px none; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.8999996185303px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">Lower-wage workers and people with disabilities, who currently benefit from a Government travel discount scheme, will also not be affected by the fare hike.</p>

              <p>Bro, I just wanted to say that as well. These few weeks, friday nights are not that hot anymore. Thought it was me.

              <p>I am not doing grab or the other 3rd apps at the moment. Could this be the reason? If it is, then I am surprised people are willing to pay for call bookings when there are so many green lanterns on the road.</p>

              Very true, some taxi companies offering good packages, like recommending one another also can get few thousands, these attracted a lots of peoples back to taxi driving. 
              
              And also because the market is still paying low wages like $1500 to $2000 pay, peoples are finding it hard to work in order to survive the harsh reality of our high cost of living, 
              
              so they opts for taxi driving better, even earn $2000++, at least better than working under someone, and yet got a vehicle to drive around. 
              
              And if you are a bit hardworking, can still get 3 to 4k, not to mention those siao one driving 10 to 16hrs a day might end up with 4 to 5k, but no life...like my bro CT...one day 10hrs...wow! he seibei healthy.
              
              Moving foward, even tho local talents are in demand, we might see more retrenchment on sectors from offshores companies, banks and many other engineering firm including Marine and oil related companies including the suppliers,
              
              The demand will not be able to match them, as most retrenched skill are mostly redundant. 
              
              So, more with some retrenchment pay out, might opts to join the taxi trade leading to more taxi on the road.
              
              So, nowaday, I only eat 2 meals, morning, kopi eggs and bread at home, then dinner only eat rice and one vege soup and chopped small chilli with soy sauce at home. Last time, limpek can order fishhead soup...now tail also dun hv...phuixxx

              <p>I am one of those people got proper job don't want to do become TD. Ex regular technical post. 1st job after ORD in a Shipyard. Later went to CISCO jaga bank. Later on found a job as personal driver then switched to private limo zao hotel.</p>
              <p>Wife not working kids still young. At least working as TD I drive till OBK can achieve $2 - $3 each day. Furthermore as a relief, I requested off from my hirer on Sundays. At least still got family time. Driving with CDG. My hirer also very nice. Got private jobs he pass to me also. Trust me to serve his regulars. My pattern very solitude one. No hang out coffeeshop, no "cycling". All my printouts let my wife see. Can't afford to keep too much money by my side. At least see "bicycle" just see only no ride.</p>
              <p>At least I am from private limo background, so won't be so lost. I had VL classmates kena psycho by taxi co to sign hirer after passing they give up in a few months. I agree that comparing to the past now the weekends really quieter. LL lor. No call also pick. No $3 also pick. Go Jurong Yishun also pick. Then whole army green beret race down CTE then see other side red beret go up AMK.</p>

              Green down, red up very common lah, if both side red....huat time liao...but if both side green, prepare to OBK. That is all abt the 6th senses of taxi driving, you need to look at yr surrounding and not just the road infront to ply your taxi for a piece of cake.
              
              To me, there is not much shortcut in Taxi driving, just drive, pick or take call if the calls is flavourable to take, work hard, rest well, and most importantly, have a good discipline and take care of family. If you think you can shortcut these and that, by all means, but I can tell you, at the end of the day, it will be back to sq one and you are still a taxi drivers.
              
              Like recent offences such as overcharging and grabtaxi driver asking their own people to call and take them, etc etc, these to me, is nonsense with no substance at all, as the saying goes, if you want to cheat..cheat millions, cheat for a few dollars is stupidity.
              
              Taxi drivers actually can sense the mood of the economy better than some Economist in their day in day out plying on the road.
