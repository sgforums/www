            <div class='col-md body'>This is the whole article from Comfort Delgro website :<br><br>18 January 2006<br>Record 75,000 call bookings made in a single day<br><br>18 January 2006 Â– ComfortDelGroÂ’s group of taxi companies, Comfort, CityCab and Yellow-Top, catered to a record 75,000 booking jobs on 12 January 2006, one of the wettest days so far this year.<br><br>That achievement comes on top of a record 1.3 million bookings which were recorded in December 2005. While December has traditionally been a month for higher call bookings because of the festive season and the rainy weather, the recent December figures are testimony to the efficiency of the ComfortDelGro state-of-the-art call booking system and growing acceptance by commuters of the concept of calling for a cab.<br><br>Currently, all of ComfortDelGroÂ’s CityCab taxis are using the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology to wirelessly connect taxis through the in-vehicle Mobile Display Terminal (MDT). This has resulted in a shorter confirmation time for passengers who call in to the system - they now wait an average of 25 seconds for a taxi number to be given compared to the average of 40 seconds before. Pick-up has also become more efficient and commuters are, on average, picked up within 6 minutes of the confirmation. The more efficient booking system is also good news to the taxi drivers who can now get more booking jobs and as a result, earn a higher income. Comfort and Yellow-TopÂ’s existing CabLink taxi booking system has also begun its migration process to the new booking system and this is expected to be completed by the end of 2006. When completed, commuters will have greater access to all 16,000 ComfortDelGro taxis with the introduction of a single booking hotline.<br><br>The increase in number of booking calls has resulted in an 11% increase in call bookings in 2005. In all, ComfortDelGro drivers catered to a record 14.2 million taxi bookings or, on average, more than 1 million taxi bookings a month. The catered rate was maintained at a high 90%, which meant that 9 in ten calls that we received resulted in a successful booking.<br><br>Said Mr Yang Ban Seng, Chief Executive Officer of ComfortDelGroÂ’s Taxi Business: Â“In the last two years, many commuters have found that it is a lot faster and convenient to pick up that phone and call for a cab, especially during peak period, rather than wait by the road side, hoping to flag down a cab. Our drivers are also happier as this means that they will have to spend less time cruising along the roads looking for passengers.Â”<br><br>Since 15 July 2005, booking fees during off-peak hours have been reduced to $2.50 while the peak period booking charge has been increased slightly to $4. Peak hours are classified as 7.30amÂ–9.30am, and 5pmÂ–11pm on weekdays. All other times, including weekends and public holidays, are classified as off-peak.<br><br>Addressing the concern that taxi drivers will adopt a pick-and-choose attitude so that they can get more booking jobs, Mr Yang said: Â“Comfort and Yellow-Top taxis come with the automated LED rooftop signs which make it impossible for drivers to manipulate. This means that they cannot show that they are Â‘On CallÂ’ when they are not. We are extending this to CityCab taxis as well.Â”<br><br>Background:<br>ComfortDelGro is the worldÂ’s second largest land transport company with a total fleet size of about 40,000 buses, taxis and rental vehicles. It has operations in several countries including China, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia. Currently, 37% of the GroupÂ’s revenue comes from overseas investments.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Sorry if this press release came too late.</div>
