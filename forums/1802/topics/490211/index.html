              <p>If times are good, you will start worrying about GST, COE, diesel price going up.</p>
              <p>So I am quite happy that times are bad and I hope the global economy will get worse and forever stay in depression. This is the best guarantee that prices will stay put or gostan.</p>
              <p>Economy crash, people still die and need to be buried. People still need cars and buses. People still need to eat, cut hair, see doctor and get married.</p>
              <p>To me its quite ok one. It is mainly our ministers who will suffer a black eye. Because if economy is good, they get a full 12 months bonus. $1 million pay per year become two. If our economy collapse, they only get $1 million, our FTs run away, the roads become more free. Home prices go down. So poor people win - rich people lose.</p>

              Limpek also chin cham one, whatever job you are in Singapore, you hv to be smart, not just work/drive hard. People like my bro getcarter said, it is a dog eat dog world out there, but I rather said it is a hidden tiger crouching dragon world out there, there are many thing that you cannot take it at face value, even if you want to do networking, you also need to net work with the right peoples, one that will give you the benefit without any doubts.

              No lah, some people cock long long ago cannot stand liao..also still around, wouldn't die lah, and some female drivers, where got cock?? Sometime, I dunno what the fark you toking.
              
              Let me ask you a question, a petrol powered 2.0cc car, if you rent it out, how much is it per month?
              
              And how much is a normal turbo charged 2.0cc diesel taxi per month rental?
              
              Why LTA come out with a 250km per day requirement for all taxi companies?
              
              Then you come and tell me can use taxi to do other thing or not?
