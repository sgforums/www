              <p>Chief's grouping always had welfare and make all members into more successful tds. My income raised 50% when Chief took me into LV, now another 15% because of ecabby and palringo, and his leadership. We have so much welfare and our group is very organised with roles for all our members.Here's the sample;</p>
              <p>1. Chief</p>
              <p>2. Dy Chief -RSM (actually he is Major Gen but he humble take RSM position enough)</p>
              <p>3. Head of Recruitment - Khoon</p>
              <p>4. Head of palringo - PrOFatSir</p>
              <p>5. Head of welfare/food - Ericgo</p>
              <p>6. Head of IT - Cyben</p>
              <p>7. Head of Security - Hammer</p>
              <p>8. Special Forces OC - Inspire</p>
              <p>9. CSM - Mvp30sg</p>
              <p>10. And we have a few members whose duty is secret - you can call them our commandoes.</p>
              <p>And me- as chief PA and a few others who perform special duties.</p>
              <p>So wehave a very disciplined and friendly group to help all our members.</p>

              mark him, how to chiong geyland, how to open cannon at joo chiat
              pub,</p>
              <p>and please do not underestimate TD hor, we hold one of the most
              sinless job, we do not back stab others, we do an honest living,
              and also because of our tiring and long driving work, we also got
              not much time to chiong, do bad deeds and do crazy stuffs.</p>
              <p>Looking from a bigger picture, there are many jobs that harm
              others in one way or the other, like govt, nabey, how they force
              people to suffer is beyong our comprehension, like those chemical
              industrial, how they destroy the air and people health, like
              industrialisation, how they destroy the green world, the forest,
              the haze, the right of all living things way of life is destroyed,
              the eco system, environment and condition changed is all due to
              human greed and cruelty. There is simply, no right for one living
              thing to destroy another living thing till extinction.</p>
              <p>And when my former chief waited under the coconut trees and
              caring for the red ants, it show a kind of kindness in him. As I
              had alway teach, see open, look open and be open.</p>
              <p>And people are all the same, each cursing their own jobs, own
              way of life and own livinghood, everyone got their grievances. At
              the point of entering a job as a TD, most of us would had hold
              other jobs, same, curse here and there, and for you info, some rich
              going to die also cursed their life, cursed that the casket is not
              beautiful enough.</p>
              <p>So, when can man be satisfy? never, you give him a bak bak girl,
              later he wants another one, and other people's wife or gfs is alway
              looking much better than his, neighbour cars or house look
              brighter, other family look more lovely and so on.</p>
              <p>So, that a time and truly ask yourself, are you happy with taxi
              driving with a good family and lifestyle? Even if you said, not
              happy, then what else can make you happier, it endless, therefore,
              learn to enjoy the moment you have, because life is not long and
              most of us are way pass our mid, why be so stress on ourselve. Why
              make president, chief, rsm, csm, and smlj CO, aren't we long passed
              school days?</p>
              <p>So, brothers, lai lai, lavender next week, we settle it once and
              for all, be a united drivers is alway much better
              than enemity. arbo, i open one table, dinner and drink on
              me....gum bo.</p>

              let live on for the sake of living more happily.</p>
              <p>Any suggestion for time and place, all are welcome. We can also
              meet Ranggoon, Bukit merah, Beo crescent, Chua chu kang and many
              more. Let decide the place and time first, for the date, as long as
              70% can turn up, we are on.</p>
              <p>My suggestion: 8pm Kallang Macdonald, weekday</p>
