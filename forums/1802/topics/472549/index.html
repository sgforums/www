              <p>Property agent? No lah..talk until saliva dry, sometimes cannot close deal.  TD, once pax hops in, money comes rolling in.

              <p>Hawker life oso difficult. Must do marketing, prepare food.  Ppl oso choose to eat or not to eat your food. Taxi, as long as see LED green, start to flag already. Don't care blue, yellow, silver or red. New taxi or old taxi. Except for those driving black or white. Hehe.</p>
              <p>In a sandwich class like us, with elderly parents and children to take care of, sometimes being a TD gives you the flexibility to manage all of these at the same time.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, you alone decide what you want to be and how much you want to earn and not by some incompetent bosses.</p>

              <p><br>President at istana also doing mah, he got less social benefit than TD lor...lols, knn, everyday go where also got people mark him, how to chiong geyland, how to open cannon at joo chiat pub,</p>
              <p>and please do not underestimate TD hor, we hold one of the most sinless job, we do not back stab others, we do an honest living, and also because of our tiring and long driving work, we also got not much time to chiong, do bad deeds and do crazy stuffs.</p>
              <p>Looking from a bigger picture, there are many jobs that harm others in one way or the other, like govt, nabey, how they force people to suffer is beyong our comprehension, like those chemical industrial, how they destroy the air and people health, like industrialisation, how they destroy the green world, the forest, the haze, the right of all living things way of life is destroyed, the eco system, environment and condition changed is all due to human greed and cruelty. There is simply, no right for one living thing to destroy another living thing till extinction.</p>
              <p>And when my former chief waited under the coconut trees and caring for the red ants, it show a kind of kindness in him. As I had alway teach, see open, look open and be open.</p>
              <p>And people are all the same, each cursing their own jobs, own way of life and own livinghood, everyone got their grievances. At the point of entering a job as a TD, most of us would had hold other jobs, same, curse here and there, and for you info, some rich going to die also cursed their life, cursed that the casket is not beautiful enough.</p>
              <p>So, when can man be satisfy? never, you give him a bak bak girl, later he wants another one, and other people's wife or gfs is alway looking much better than his, neighbour cars or house look brighter, other family look more lovely and so on.</p>
              <p>So, that a time and truly ask yourself, are you happy with taxi driving with a good family and lifestyle? Even if you said, not happy, then what else can make you happier, it endless, therefore, learn to enjoy the moment you have, because life is not long and most of us are way pass our mid, why be so stress on ourselve. Why make president, chief, rsm, csm, and smlj CO, aren't we long passed school days?</p>
              <p>So, brothers, lai lai, lavender next week, we settle it once and for all, be a united drivers is alway much better than enemity. arbo, i open one table, dinner and drink on me....gum bo.</p>
