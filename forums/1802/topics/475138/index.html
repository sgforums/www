              <p>Gentlemen, what is the month and date? it october and middle of the month, most peoples pocket are growing deeper, some are saving for year end holiday, and as most event like F1, NDP and mid year bonuses are all gone, most probably, these 2 months will be a low period for services, even other business.</p>
              <p>TD if got free time, can try to learn another trade so that you can do other thing whenever times are bad. Moreover, it will be interesting and worthy as you learn and adapt to have more tools with you. And who knows, maybe you can end up not driving taxi altogether, but if you wants to stay on in the realm of taxis driving, so be it, it is not so bad, but thing like up and down, summons and hijacked, cheapo and cb paxs...will be part of your life.</p>

              <p>But human are human , tend to hv lots of pai kuan type, I feel you cheated me, I felt you never put full for me, I felt you alway late, or that your mileage more than me...jealous, envy and anger all mix up.
