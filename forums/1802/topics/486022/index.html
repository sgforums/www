              Please lah, many TDs lost their life on the road, some thru innocent accident, some thru robbing, some thru illness, and some tio hoot until blue black eyes cannot even find his spectacles.
                  
              A pax will never understand TD behavor till they drive taxi themselves. Because we as TD, are also pax at times, and when we take cab, we understand the TD feeling, but those cb paxs who have never experience a life of a TD, still can come and teach TD want to do and what not to do?? 
                  
              The relationship between pax and TD needs both hand to clap, you good, I good, you said early, I decide to take or not, not wait until reach already then tell me..still hv to go to these and that...

              <p>i used to be very considerate for a TD</p>
              <p>i take 1/2 to 1 hours sitting at home making a booking and still couldn't get one</p>
              <p>i go to the street and stand under the hot sun for 1 hour to encounter numberous rejection by TD, with green light on top somemore.</p>
              <p>i board a taxi and pay the extra $$$ for the extra distance travel by a TD mistake</p>
              <p>i onboard a taxi and go thru the TD black black face throughout the whole journey</p>
              <p>so, this is what i got for begin considerate</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one fine day, i decided for a change</p>
              <p>when making booking, i make multiple booking at a go, whoever come first got my business. And it usually take me not more then 10 mins to get a cab</p>
              <p>On the street, once it is a green light (for hire) taxi stop, i never give a chance for him to ask, i just open the door and hop in. If he refuse, i will threaten to complaint, to LTA. Then on, it take me not more then 15min to board a cab.</p>
              <p>When a TD uses a wrong route, i make a fuss about it. And i never got to pay extra, sometime i even pay lesser</p>
              <p>When a TD face black black, rude........., i make sure i F him hard enough and let his face even more black, spolit his days and make my day, i happy about my "achievement"</p>
              <p>And, i'm a more happy person to be inconsiderate to TD.</p>

              Let be more factual in our arguement,
              
              There are approx 27000++ taxi in Singapore, and at any one time, only about 18 to 20k are on the road, as the rest will be resting.
              
              Pte Car population in Singapore at june 2014 is approx 607,000++
              
              Land Transport Authority statistics showed that the total vehicle population stood at 971,871 at end-June - 0.2 per cent down from 974,170 at the end of last year 
              
              Bus population approx 3000 and increasing.
              
              Rest are motorbike, lorries, van and big veh like trailer etc etc.
              
              607,000 pte car and you pick 20,000 taxis on the road to argue over our way of driving...please lah, we ply the road per day 30 trips more than your pathetic few trips

              <p>As Jun 2014, total no, of taxi in Singapore is 27,865. Since the taxi availability required 80% of taxi to be available during peak hour. Hence, there will be at least 22k availablitiy on the road during peak hours.</p>

              <p>i used to be very considerate for a TD</p>
              <p>i take 1/2 to 1 hours sitting at home making a booking and still couldn't get one</p>
              <p>i go to the street and stand under the hot sun for 1 hour to encounter numberous rejection by TD, with green light on top somemore.</p>
              <p>i board a taxi and pay the extra $$$ for the extra distance travel by a TD mistake</p>
              <p>i onboard a taxi and go thru the TD black black face throughout the whole journey</p>
              <p>so, this is what i got for begin considerate</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one fine day, i decided for a change</p>
              <p>when making booking, i make multiple booking at a go, whoever come first got my business. And it usually take me not more then 10 mins to get a cab</p>
              <p>On the street, once it is a green light (for hire) taxi stop, i never give a chance for him to ask, i just open the door and hop in. If he refuse, i will threaten to complaint, to LTA. Then on, it take me not more then 15min to board a cab.</p>
              <p>When a TD uses a wrong route, i make a fuss about it. And i never got to pay extra, sometime i even pay lesser</p>
              <p>When a TD face black black, rude........., i make sure i F him hard enough and let his face even more black, spolit his days and make my day, i happy about my "achievement"</p>
              <p>And, i'm a more happy person to be inconsiderate to TD.</p>
