              If you take 70 times to pass a TDVL, I think you better dun drive taxi, because as most of us know...ON THE ROAD is much more difficult for newbies, those newbies after driving for a month will tell you, TDVL is nothing, the real thing is driving.
              
              So, IMHO, he better give up driving taxi, it may bring more problem for him.

              <p>Minimum requirement for TDVL is:</p>
              <p>GCE'O' Level or 'N' Level pass in English (at least a D7 grade) / Level 3 or higher pass in English <a href="http://www.taxi.org.sg/wpl_cat.html"><span style="color: #333333;">(WPL-CAT)</span></a></p>
              <p>If he has attained this which he must in order to enrol for the course, then why is English an issue?</p>

              2 scenarios, first, D7 english O level taken in the 70s, in the 70s, criteria to enter poly or JC is very strict and only the top layer go, so I guess he would had entered VITB, the former ITE, and from the 70s to mid 90s, most of us still use dialects, so as time pass by till 2015, his english could hv become kiam chai..just like my bro CT and ex chief.
              
              Second, he could have had enrolled/registered long before the requirement of O level set in, so it qualified him to continue the course.
              
              But to me, passing TVDL is one thing, driving physicall is another, if a person takes so long to pass a course, he may not be adequate enough to be on the road as he could be a slow learner, a person who need time to pick up skill, but that does not mean he cannot do it, but we also hv to look at his age, his slowiness and reaction, because even my bro Ah Fool can tell you, driving at this age on a rush hour is no joke

              <p>He lost his job 2 years ago and then decided enrol and to become TD.  The English requirement already kicked in during that time in 2013.</p>
              <p>I cannot comment on his English becoming like Kiam Chai cos I don't know him.</p>

              Brother, you are also a taxi driver like me, so, I do have empathy on this 61yo man and doubt that he can make it on the road, I worry that he might end up having to suffer and paid more than earning a living, you should understand what I am saying...from accident to TP summons to snap by camera to bus lanes to pax complain to wrong roads to all other taxi driver hazards...
              
              He might had driven a car before, but that could be donkey years ago, with today newer roads, rules and regulations...I think he is going to suffer base on my view of 70 times taken TVDL

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I also never understood why so many good people, once become cabbies, especially those driving mercedes and chrysler, can become so taiko. Previously not so hao lian, can behave like they so atas. Hua taxi nia leh, can behave like a big fuck? So what if they are a caller or durian tree? People with one billion in their bank account also diam diam stay low profile. Just for a pax, can cut the cabby in front and snatch away? Just for a pax, can bad mouth the caller to the pax in order to secure more kang kui? Thats why Singapore cabbies are the most disunited, and so easy for the company to makan.</p></div>

              Bo bian lah, many of these limbu drivers are just like my ex bro keepthechange, once donned the long sleeves and black pant and hold a merc steering wheel with the mercedes logo shining shining only, they will ultimately feel and act differently mah.
              
              For years of their life, they have been slaughting as an employee working long hours under people's nose. then suddenly got a car to drive, own time own target, and feel like own boss, and then changed to a limbu driver with a mercs to hold which they have never imagine that it would happen, but it happened, so the yaya papaya mindset set in lor...then they will see those driving normal cab like me, are people who cannot afford to drive a limbu, still stuck in normal class.
              
              So, we need to understand them, it is not entirely their fault, it is the genius of pychology at play by taxi companies, and these guys not only fall for it.
