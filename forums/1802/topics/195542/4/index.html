            <div class='col-md body'>4 is actually quite bad. Thats like 1 person 1 place. Plus all those carpark things he mentioned. It wouldn't be this frustrating if they just chose to alight near the block and walk in. In hokkien, "Buay zi dong". Goodness, its before 12midnight. Is it really that scary to walk a few hundred steps home?<br><br>Thats the thing, people expect service crew to treat customers nicely. But many times, when customers treat the crews nicely, the service crew will actually go even further than the expected service. It seriously takes a lot out of someone, at the end of a long workday, to still treat a bad customer the way it should. And at least the driver didn't make a big fuss during the journey.<br><br>Considering the journey, its not exactly very on the way too, in my opinion.<br><br>Give customer service line some leeway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We have to be clear about the core mission of the taxi service. Frills are fine for those who would pay a premium, but for the majority, it's just a means of transportation to get from one point to another. Taxis play an important role in the public transport system and has to be cheap, efficient and convenient to discourage others from owning private vehicles.<br><br>Taxi drivers are having too good a life, so much so that they can pick and choose which passenger to take, where to go, when to work. As Poolman admits, commuters may find it harder to find a a cab during the World Cup season 'cos lots of them aren't working but are watching telly at the coffee shop. They are not hungry enough.<br><br>It is well known that it is near impossible to find a cab on rainy days, during peak hours and in remote areas. Some cabbies will not take passengers to army camps because they are located far from the beaten track.<br><br>A radiocab system like that in the UK will force local cab drivers to work harder and make it easier for commuters to find cabs even in remote areas and on rainy days. Taxi companies will not lose money with radiocab...they will earn more by paying a fixed salary of 1k or less to foreigners to drive radiocabs purely on a booking basis. The booking fee can be abolished and local drivers will work harder to ply the steets. It will be good for commuters.<br><br>Taxi drivers had it too good for too long. Have put forward my suggestion to LTA and the taxi companies...we'll see.</div>
